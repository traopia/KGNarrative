[{"Generated text": " Google launches German library in Frankfurt Book Fair Google has launched its German-language Google Library in the German city of Frankfurt. The search engine, Google, has announced plans to expand the library's reach beyond the US. "Google Library" is the first of its kind to be launched in Germany, the company said in a statement on Wednesday. Google said it would expand its library to include more than 100,000 books from around the world. It also announced that it will launch a new online bookstore in San Francisco in August. According to Google's executive vice president, Jennifer Grant, German books will be available on the Internet for free from August 1 to August 31. In addition to the book library, there will also be a digital library dedicated to books by German authors, publishers, artists, and other authors. This will allow users to search for books in German, English, French, Italian, Spanish, Dutch, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Arabic, Turkish, Portuguese, Indian, Filipino, American, Australian, Canadian, Swedish, Norwegian, Finnish, Ukrainian, Romanian, Bulgarian, Iranian, Thai, Vietnamese, Indonesian, Malaysian, Cambodian and Turkish. Search engine The Google library is one of the most popular online booksellers in Europe, according to a report by the Financial Times Deutschland, which cited Google executive Hubert Haarmann as the main reason for the move. However, it is not the only bookseller that Google is looking at. A number of German publishers have also launched their own bookstores, including Langenscheidt, a publishing house based in Silicon Valley, as well as a bookshop in New York City. They are also planning to launch an online version of their online store, called the Google Book Library, in September, with a focus on children's books and non-fiction titles. But Google will not be able to do this without the help of search engines like Bing and Google. Instead, they will have to rely on Google Search to find books that are not available in other countries, such as China, India, Japan, South Korea and the United Arab Emirates. What's next for Google? The company has said that the search giant will continue to develop a library of books for children and young people, but it has yet to announce the exact date of when the new library will open. That's because Google already has a database of all the books available for sale on its website. So far, however, only one book has been published. And that's a German book, "The Book of Life," which is a collection of short stories, novels, short films and short story collections. Some of these books have already been translated into German. Others have been adapted into English and are published in English. There is no word yet on how many more books are planned for this year, although Google says it's working on a translation of some of them. At the same time, some publishers are looking into the possibility of expanding their library into other languages. For example, Germany's Association of American Publishers said they would like to see a "digital library" that would allow publishers to sell their books to children in their home countries. Germany has long been the country's leading publisher of nonfiction books, publishing houses and magazines. Many of those publishers say they are still waiting for a decision on whether or not they want to publish their work in another country. On the other hand, many publishers believe that there is still a long way to go before they can publish a full-fledged book. As a result, most publishers would rather not publish anything at all, because they don't have the time or the resources to make it available to their customers. If they do, then they'll have a hard time finding a publisher willing to work with them, even if it means losing a lot of time and money. Even if that means giving up on publishing, that doesn't mean they're going to stop publishing. How long will it take Google to get its books published? "We're still trying to figure out what we can do with our library. We're not sure how long we'll be publishing," said Patricia Schroeder, head of publishing at the association. She added that "we'll see what happens when we get to Germany." "I think we've got a really good library," she said, adding that she hopes that people will start to read more of her books. "
,"Reference text": " German Publishers Warm to Google Library Google is heading for a legal battle with American publishers over its plan to digitize books from five major libraries. But German publishers seem warm to the idea. Five major US publishers filed suit in San Francisco on Wednesday to block Google from scanning books without the permission of copyright holders. The project, already underway but stopped by Google in August, is the Silicon Valley company's bid to make the world's books searchable online. Five major libraries are already participating in the project and Google sent executive Jennifer Grant to the Frankfurt Book Fair on Wednesday to present the idea to European and German book publishers. This week Google introduced print.google.de, the German version of the search engine Google posted online this time last year. Google lets users type in a search term then scans its digitized library for the word or expression and produces a list of books where the term is mentioned. Users can then click on the results and a few pages of the text appear allowing users to read up online. The idea is to supplement Internet users with another source of material. In contrast to their American colleagues, German publishing houses have reacted well to the database. Some German publishers on board Google said that is discussing terms with all major German publishers. Langenscheidt, which publishes a large selection of dictionaries, said they had got on board. "We are starting with 160 books," Hubert Haarmann, head of the electronic publishing division and the publisher, told the Financial Times Deutschland. "We see it as an additional distribution possibility." An increased and more direct reach to the consumer is just one way Google is promoting its new project to skeptical publishers. The company also says that publishers will be able to monitor interest in titles through the search engine, and use the information in deciding whether to reprint certain books. Google has also promised publishers a cut of the advertising that will appear on the site. Not all German publishers are on board. In fact, the German association representing publishers has announced it will begin its own project where publishers can scan their own books, rather than let someone else do it. The project is not a competitor to Google, but will allow publishers to create their own database, rather than turn it over to the search engine. If Google can, anyone can But American publishers don't want to even take that step. They fear a slippery slope if Google is allowed to digitize copyrighted material. "If Google can make … copies, then anyone can," Patricia Schroeder, president of the Association of American Publishers, said in a phone interview with Reuters. "Anybody could go into a library and start making digital copies of anything." At issue is the right of authors and their publishers to their own work versus the "fair use" of their work by the public. Google argues that their search engine will only offer users a "card catalog" function, with a few pages of text. No one will be able to read the entire book online. " 

},{"Generated text": " Barack Obama on Cuba: 'Sermon on the Mount' US President Barack Obama has spoken out against the US government's use of Cuba as a detention center for dissidents. The US Congress has passed a resolution calling for the end of US involvement in the island nation's war against terrorism. Obama's speech was delivered in Cuba's capital, Havana, on Wednesday, January 2, 2011. In his address, Obama said that he was "deeply troubled" by the events of the past two years. "I am deeply troubled," he said, "by what I have seen and experienced in my own life. I am very troubled by what has happened to me and my family." Obama also spoke about the Cuban revolution, which began in 1961 with the overthrow of President Raul Castro. He called for an end to the military dictatorship and a return to civilian rule. But he also called on Congress to take action against US imperialism and the communist regime, especially in Latin America, and to end the war on terror. Astrid Prange, a Cuban-American journalist and writer living in Brazil, told DW: "The Cuban people have suffered a lot in this war. They have lost everything they have fought for and they are still fighting for what they believe is their right to freedom." The Cuban government has been accused by Washington of trying to silence the voices of millions of Cubans who have been imprisoned in US detention centers for decades. This is not the first time that a US president has made a public statement about his opposition to US policy toward Cuba. It is the second time in as many years that the United States has tried to pressure Cuba into giving up its nuclear weapons program in exchange for concessions from Washington. And it is only now that Washington has begun to listen to these voices that are being heard in Havana. There is a long list of grievances, but the most important is that Cuba is being held accountable for its human rights violations. That is why, in January 2011, President Obama signed an executive order to close all US military facilities at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, as well as the entire island of Curacao and other Caribbean islands. These actions are part of a broader effort by US and Cuban officials to make Cuba a free and democratic country. However, there is also the question of whether or not Cuba will continue to use its military force against its own people, or whether it will be able to do so without the help of international law enforcement agencies. So far, however, this has not been the case. Since the beginning of this year, US authorities have not acted on any of these grievances. For example, the government of Brazil has refused to open the doors to Cuban citizens who want to go to Guantanamo, saying that they will not be allowed to enter the country if they do not wish to be detained there. Cuba has also rejected the idea that it can be used as an interrogation facility for terrorism suspects. At the same time, it has rejected calls for a military tribunal to investigate the allegations of torture and murder of Cuban nationals at its detention facility in Guantanamo. On the other hand, many of those accused of crimes against humanity have expressed their willingness to cooperate with US investigators in their efforts to find out more about what is going on at the prison. Some of them are even willing to testify in front of Congress. Others, such as Brazilian Senator Mariel, have said they would like to see an independent tribunal set up to look into the matter. If that's not enough, they say, then it could lead to a judicial tribunal. What about Brazilians? Do you think that is something that should be done? Is there a legal basis for such a tribunal? Or is it just a matter of time before a decision is made? I don't think so. After all, I think there are a number of people who would be interested in participating in such an inquiry. Is it possible that we can have a discussion about this subject in Congress? If so, what would that mean for our country? In the meantime, we are going to have to wait and see what happens. We will see if Congress decides to act on this issue. Or if it decides not to. "
,"Reference text": " Opinion: Obama's Cuban revolution President Barack Obama has made a very special declaration of love to Cuba. It's as revolutionary as the Cuban revolution, and as peaceful as the biblical Sermon on the Mount, says DW's Astrid Prange. US President Barack Obama has lost his old communist "enemy," and Cuban President Raul Castro has lost his hatred of capitalism. In the first phone call from president to president since 1961 the two heads of state came to a surprisingly swift agreement. They want to renew diplomatic relations, which have been on ice for more than 50 years, and exchange ambassadors. It's only a matter of time before the US lifts its trade embargo against Cuba. All the word "embargo" is really good for - at this stage - is as an ideological soapbox for political hardliners, especially Republicans in Congress who believe lifting sanctions would constitute defeat for the US. Yet the lifting of the embargo has already begun. In addition to medication, it has been possible since 2000 to export agricultural produce such as maize, cereal crops, and poultry to Cuba. Flirting with the rogue state Furthermore, 100,000 US citizens have travelled to Cuba since 2011 for cultural and scientific exchanges. Travel restrictions on Cubans living in exile in the US who wanted to visit their relatives on the island were also lifted. According to press reports, the two countries' military forces are even said to be cooperating, as are their coastguards, and military on the border of the US marine base in Guantanamo. Now Obama wants to officially open a "new chapter" in relations with the communist Caribbean island and remove Cuba from the US list of so-called "rogue states" that support terrorism. The travel ban on American tourists visiting the island will also largely be lifted. That's as far as things will go for the time being, as Obama would require a majority in Congress in Washington to lift the embargo entirely. But even if these are only small steps, the fall of the American-Cuban wall has begun. The easing of the sanctions and the resumption of diplomatic relations are setting the scene for an end to the embargo. Embargo as scapegoat The tearing down of this "wall in the mind" is long overdue. The blockade is obsolete, and has proved to be entirely ineffective. More than this, its advocates have achieved the opposite of what they actually wanted. The blockade has provided the leaders in Havana with an easy excuse for their economic failure. Raul Castro realized long ago that Cuba's economic problems can no longer be justified simply by citing the US embargo. It looks as though he was counting on the blockade being lifted: There is no other explanation for the completion of the Mariel container port in January this year. Cuba's biggest infrastructure project was, incidentally, financed by Brazil. The Brazilians also sent a declaration of love to Cuba. Raul Castro opened the door to them. He loves anyone who helps him - his friends even more than his enemies. "

Italian President Matteo Renzi is due to speak to the Council on Wednesday. The meeting is the first in a series of meetings between EU leaders and Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, who has been in Washington for the past two weeks to discuss the country's economic and financial situation. Italy is currently in the midst of negotiations with the United States over a possible exit from the EU's rotating presidency, which is scheduled to begin in mid-January. "I am very happy to be able to participate in this meeting," said President Giorgio Napolitanano, adding that he would attend the meeting. However, he did not say whether the summit would be attended by the president or the heads of state of Italy and the three other EU member states. In a statement, the Italian government said it would not attend because it was too busy negotiating with Washington. It added that it had not yet decided whether or not to seek an extension of its current term of five years, but that Italy would seek to extend the term to a further two years. se/cmk (dpa, Reuters) "We are very pleased to have the opportunity to hold talks with Italy," the prime minister said in an interview with The Associated Press. He also said that the two sides had agreed on a number of issues, including the need for an EU-wide free trade agreement and a "comprehensive framework" for dealing with trade disputes. EU Council member countries have been meeting in Brussels since 2006, when Italy became the 28th member state to join the bloc, and since then it has become the 27th country to become a member. There have also been discussions on the possibility of a bilateral trade deal, although Italy has yet to agree on such a deal. Last year, Italy agreed to sign a framework agreement that would allow it to enter into a free-trade agreement with other countries in exchange for a reduction in its trade deficit. But the deal is not expected to go into effect until the end of 2013, according to European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker. If it does, it will be the second time in as many years that a single EU country has entered into an FTA with another member country, followed by a new one in 2013. This time, however, there is no clear agreement on how to proceed with negotiations, as the negotiations are still ongoing. What is certain is that negotiations will continue to take place, with a view to reaching an agreement by early next year. Some EU members have expressed concern about the outcome of talks, while others have said they will hold a referendum on whether Italy should enter the FTA. Others have voiced concern over the lack of progress on economic reforms, such as tax cuts for low-income earners and an increase in spending on defense spending. They have called for more transparency and transparency in government spending in order to protect the interests of all EU citizens and to ensure that all citizens have a fair chance of success in their dealings with each other. Many EU countries are also concerned about Italy, particularly in relation to trade and investment. European leaders have warned that if Italy fails to reach an economic agreement, they may have to resort to other measures to reduce its reliance on foreign aid. On Wednesday, EU foreign ministers met in Rome, where they discussed the issue of trade, migration and other issues. According to EU diplomats, "Italy has a lot to learn from its experience in international relations." The EU has already made clear it wants to strengthen its relationship with non-member countries, especially with China, a major trading partner, in return for which it is willing to pay a heavy price for its support. Europe is also looking for ways to improve ties between the US and its allies in Asia, Africa and Latin America. One of these countries is China. China is a key player in Europe's trade dispute with Russia. Russia is one of several countries that are trying to impose sanctions on Iran. Iran is another country that has imposed sanctions against Tehran. "

The 89-year-old did not say when exactly his resignation would take effect. Calling the move a personal decision, President Giorgio Napolitano made his announcement during an end-of-year speech on Wednesday. "I'm about to step down, to resign as the constitution expressly allows," he said, adding. "I've reached an age that brings with it growing limitations and difficulties for me to do my institutional duties, which are complex and very demanding." Though he did not say when his resignation would take effect, a potential date is January 13 when Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi is due to give up the country's rotating six-month presidency of the Council of the European Union. Renzi faces a political challenge in organizing a replacement for Napolitano, dubbed by Italian media as "King George." The president has served as a key intermediary between political parties through numerous changes in government and other tricky political situations. Napolitano, a former communist respected by Europe and Washington, took office in 2006. At the end of his seven-year mandate in 2013, he was asked to stay on because parliament could not agree on his successor. At the time he warned he may not serve out the full term, given his age. In Italy, presidents have loosely-defined powers including the ability to nominate prime ministers, dissolve parliament and veto legislation, as well as use the moral authority of the office to influence politics. se/cmk (dpa, Reuters) " 

},{"Generated text": " Israeli Ambassador to Iran Danny Ayalon: Iran's Sunii religion is a religion of war, not of peace. The Iranian regime has a long history of violence against the Jewish people. In 2002, when the Israeli government overthrew the Ayatollahs in Tehran, Israel's ambassador to the United States, Danny Aiyalon, told DW that Iran had a "long history" of fighting against Israel. "It was a very long time ago," he said, adding that he had no idea what was going on in Iran at the time. He added that it was "a very difficult time" for Iran to fight back, and that the regime had to be brought to a standstill by the US Congress and the Obama administration. It was also a time when Iran was trying to establish itself in the Middle East as an independent state, which it did not want to do. During that time, there were a number of terrorist attacks on Israel, including the assassination of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as well as a series of bombings and assassinations of Israelis and Palestinians. These attacks were all part of a wider Iranian-Israeli conflict, but they were also carried out by Iran, according to US intelligence officials. Iran has also been accused of supporting terrorist groups in Libya, North Korea, Iran and North Korean. Israel has accused Iran of being behind these attacks. However, US President Barack Obama has rejected this accusation, saying it is "baseless" and "absurd." "Iran is not a terrorist organization," Obama said in a speech to Congress in 2006. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who was elected in 1996, called for a peaceful resolution of the conflict between Israel and Iran. Israeli President Ashraf Ghani, however, rejected the idea, calling it "simply an attack on Iran," and said he would not accept such a resolution. Tehran has denied the accusations, though, accusing the West of backing down on the Iran nuclear deal with world powers. According to Iranian officials, the deal was reached in Geneva, Switzerland, in exchange for the release of Iranian nuclear weapons. But the agreement was not signed in principle, with Iran agreeing to freeze its nuclear program until the end of 2006, after which Iran would have to give up its weapons of mass destruction in return for an end to its war with the world. This is the first time that a US president has made such an attempt to pressure Iran into giving up the nuclear weapon it had been developing for so long. And it's not just Iran that has been a target of US pressure. There is also the question of whether Iran will continue to support the P5+1 regime in Syria, or whether it will be forced to accept the terms of an arms embargo imposed on it by Washington and its allies. That's a question that Israel is still mulling over. Is Iran willing to take a step back? The US and Israel have been at odds for some time over the past few years. At the beginning of this year, Israeli and US officials began to talk about the possibility of establishing a peace treaty with Tehran. They also said that they would like to see a deal signed between the two countries that would allow Israel to withdraw its forces from the region. After all, it would be impossible for Tehran to unilaterally withdraw from Syria without an agreement from Washington. What's more, if Iran were to pull out of that deal, then Israel would still have a lot of leverage over it. As long as Iran doesn't pull back from a nuclear agreement, Tehran will have an easy time getting its hands on US arms. So far, so good, that's what we've seen from Iran in recent months. We've also seen it happen in Lebanon, where the Iranians have started to show a willingness to cooperate with Israel on a wide range of issues, such as the war against Hezbollah, Hamas, Hezbollah and other terrorist organizations, among others. For the most part, this has not happened. Why is Iran so eager to play a role in this conflict? Because it has always been an important partner for Israel in its quest for peace and stability. Since the early 1990s, many Israelis have become disillusioned with their country's policies toward the Palestinians, particularly in light of their perceived lack of political and economic ties with them.

,"Reference text": " 'Bond between Israel and the US is unshakeable' Israel’s former deputy foreign minister and Israeli Ambassador to the US Danny Ayalon spoke to DW this week about whether the Iranian nuclear deal has been a game changer in the relations between the US and Israel. Danny Ayalon has served as Israel's deputy foreign minister and was Ambassador to the US from 2002-2006. DW: Have US-Israeli relations been damaged in light of the Geneva agreement? Danny Ayalon: Israel-US relations will not be affected by the agreement in Geneva with Iran. Yes, we do have our apprehensions; we do have our criticisms; but this is something that is legitimate between allies just as we have our different points of view about settlements, or about what should be the content of agreement with the Palestinians. The unshakeable bond between Israel and US is going to last on the natural alliance and political-strategical value of this alliance. Israel has proven again to be the only dependable ally for the US in the region in terms of American interests; in terms of countering and fighting proliferation of nuclear weapons - which is one of the most important things for American stability. How would you characterize relations at the moment between the US and Iran? I think it's very important to note that under President Obama the military cooperation and relationship between Israel and the US has reached an all time high and this continues. It's not just the administration though, it's also Congress, it's the people and the nationwide support that Israel enjoys in the US. This will not change although Israel has criticized and will continue to criticize the agreement with Iran. What do you think is behind the thinking of the Iranian leadership? The Iranians see two models - in terms of non-proliferation or in terms of dismantling the nuclear capabilities. They see Libya under the Gadhafi model and they see the North Korean model. Libya under Gadhafi voluntarily dismantled their capabilities and where is Libya now, where is Gadhafi now? On the other hand a decade ago the North Koreans went through what seemed like a consensual route and, boom, after a few years they detonated a nuclear device. For the Ayatollahs the nuclear capability is not just an objective in itself, it's a means for two things - to become the hegemony and the dominant force in the Middle East; secondly to put down the Sunii countries like Saudi Arabia and lastly their own internal stability. By becoming nuclear they believe it will be an insurance policy for them. The six parties involved in talks in Geneva should not be fooled by the charm offense of the Iranians because the Iranians came to Geneva not as a consequence of a policy change but as a consequence of their being on the brink economically. The main goal of Iran is to lift the sanctions and they have managed to do that without giving up any of their potential. Why does Israel's leadership think the Geneva agreement is bad? I believe that this agreement is bad on all accounts. It's not going to stop a nuclear Iran. Because of the message, it's going to make stabilizing the region much more difficult. It's going to induce more negative energy into the region in terms of terrorism, in terms of the Sunni-Shia clashes and it's quite obvious to foes and friends alike of the West that Iran has the upper hand. The danger is that Iran keeps the nuclear potential, the capabilities and the initiative in the hands of Ayatollahs. Any time in the future they can resume, they can actually accelerate their nuclear programme. The fact that Iran was on brink was not used well diplomatically by the six parties in the talks, because they could have gotten much more out of Iran. Iran played a brilliant game when they made the P5+1 blink first. The message to the region is that the belligerency of Iran pays off and that strengthens Assad, Hezbollah and all the very extreme radical forces. It also creates the counter offensive by the Sunni extremists. Where does this leave Israel? I think Israel's hands are now tied and there is no option at this point but the diplomatic option. Now it's just a matter of keeping Iran committed and answerable to the letter of the Geneva agreement. I don't think that this will be very simple to do. If a country is determined they can really overcome any monitoring regime, even the most robust. The last opportunity the international community has will be when the terms of the agreement are up in six months. When the P5+1 comes to the table for the final status agreement with Iran, this is the time to make all the demands with Iran. I don't think Middle East and the world can tolerate, or survive a nuclear Iran. Unfortunately it's been painted as if the duel in the Middle East is between Tehran and Jerusalem. It's not the case. The the threat of Tehran is first and foremost to the Gulf countries, to the Sunni countries, then to Israel and then to Europe. If you look at their delivery systems and their ideology it does not stop only in the Middle East. "

The Swiss government has said it will boycott the tournament in order to prevent Germany from hosting the event. "Switzerland has decided not to participate in this year's tournament," Swiss Minister of Sports Urs Stadler told the Tages Anzeiger newspaper on Monday. He said the country would boycott, in part, because of a lack of financial support from the German government, and because it would not be able to afford the costs of hosting a major event such as the soccer tournament. Germany, meanwhile, has already announced that it is boycotting the competition, which will take place at the end of May. According to the newspaper, the decision was made after a meeting between German and Swiss officials, who had been in Switzerland for the past two years to discuss the situation. German officials have said they will not attend the games, but that they have no doubt that Switzerland will be participating in them. In a statement released Monday, German Sports Minister Samuel Schmid said that Germany would be "very interested" in participating, adding that he had "no doubt" that the host country, France, would participate. However, he did not elaborate on the reasons for Germany's decision, saying it was "not a decision made by the government." "We are not going to allow Germany to take part in these games," he said. 'It is a matter of time before we have a chance' German media reported that German authorities were also considering the possibility of banning Switzerland's entry into the European competition. Switzerland is not a member of the EU, nor is it an EU member, according to German news agency DPA. It is the only country in Europe that has been invited to play in a tournament, although it has not yet decided whether it wants to do so. There are a number of other countries, including France and Croatia, that have also expressed interest in playing in an event like this. But the question is whether they are willing to accept the invitation, or if they simply want to be part of it. If they don't, then they'll have to wait and see what happens. At the same time, there is also a question of whether Germany will accept Switzerland as a host nation. That's a big question, as it's the first time the two countries have met in such a short time since the last time they competed. And that's not just because the other side has a lot of money to spend, since they're competing against each other. They're also competing with one another in their own countries. This year, however, Switzerland and Germany have been competing for a place in UEFA's Champions League, where it hopes to win a spot in its first ever tournament since it began in 2002. Both sides have expressed their disappointment with the outcome, with both sides saying they would like to see Switzerland play a more positive role in European football. As a result, Swiss authorities have decided to ban Switzerland from attending the next edition of Euro 2016, a move that could be seen as an attempt to avoid a repeat of last summer's debacle in which Germany lost out to France. Swiss President Emmanuel Macron has also called for Switzerland to join the group of countries that will play at Euro next year. French President Nicolas Sarkozy said Monday that his country was not interested in hosting another tournament until after the summer break. France has expressed concern over the prospect of losing out on a bid to qualify for Europe's second-largest economy. Macron said he hoped Switzerland would have the opportunity to compete with other European countries in terms of economic and political stability, though he added that there was no guarantee of success in that regard. A positive outcome For Switzerland, it seems, at least for now, of course, despite the fact that many of its competitors have already made their way to Europe. For example, Spain and Italy have both made it to Euro 2012, while France is hoping to reach the quarter-finals. Italy has yet to make a final bid. Meanwhile, Russia and Spain are expected to bid for their respective countries' participation in Euro this summer. "

"We have to turn to about 500 private security personnel from Germany," Urs Stadler, spokesman for a security firm consortium told the Monday, May 26, edition of Swiss newspaper Tages Anzeiger. "Most of them were already in operation during the World Cup two years ago, and have relevant experience," added Stadler from Prisec, a consortium made up of the companies Protectas and Securitas. The spokesman said more help was needed, but could not give exact numbers "due to pending assignments." Recent soccer violence raises concern Swiss media has been questioning the security preparations for Euro 2008 after a spate of violence at recent games. In the latest incident, seats were ripped out and a goal post wrenched from the ground after St. Gallen faced the prospect of relegation following a 2-0 defeat to Bellinzona on May 20. St. Gallen was the third incident in a month that saw violent clashes with police who twice resorted to rubber bullets and tear gas. While Switzerland is seen as a low risk country in terms of hooliganism, violence has been on the increase in recent years and estimates claim there are around 400 hooligans and 600 sympathizers. Swiss Sports Minister Samuel Schmid said that hooliganism cannot be ruled out, reported German news agency DPA. But he expressed his belief that extra measures such as more policing, restrictions on alcohol -- which he has called "a catalyst for violence" -- and video surveillance will help keep trouble at bay. Private firms to boost European police The private security companies will be responsible for patrolling the stadiums and their surroundings, as well as the public viewing areas, team hotels and trainings areas. An international police force will manage the rest. Switzerland has committed some 31,200 police officers and soldiers. Another 1,700 police will be sent from Germany, which will have the authority to make arrests. France will offer the third largest contingent with 750 officers and Croatia, Poland, Sweden, Greece, Russia and Spain will also send reinforcements. "

He added that the incident was the latest in a series of incidents in which German Muslims have been targeted by the extremist group "Invitation to Paradise," which has claimed responsibility for a number of attacks on German Jews in recent years. In one case, police officers shot and killed a man who was trying to flee the scene of an attack on a mosque, according to German media. Police said the man, identified only as "Sven Lau," was shot dead after he tried to run away with a knife. Local media reported that police had also shot at a house belonging to an al-Qaeda-affiliated terrorist group, which had threatened to take over the country if it did not cooperate with German authorities. Germany's Interior Ministry said it would investigate the allegations, but that it was not clear whether the accusations were politically motivated. It was unclear whether police would take any action against the militant group or whether they would face charges of criminal negligence. A statement issued by German Chancellor Angela Merkel's interior ministry said there was "no evidence" to support the claim, adding that "there is no evidence that this is the case at all." The statement also said that a police officer was killed when he attempted to enter the house of a Sunni Muslim man and was seriously injured. However, it said police were not involved in any wrongdoing and that they had no reason to believe that such a crime had taken place.

"It was an act of terrorism," Lau said, referring to "a terrorist attack." He also accused Germany of failing to protect the interests of its Muslim minority, accusing it of being a "hostile state" and of not doing enough to prevent the spread of radical Islam. On the contrary, he said: "We are not a hostile state, we are a tolerant society, and we do not tolerate this kind of behavior." In a statement released on Sunday, German prosecutors said they were looking into the matter and would seek to find a way to resolve it. They also called on the state of emergency to be lifted immediately, as well as for Germany to step up its anti-terror laws. German parliamentarians have called for an end to violence against Muslims, particularly against minorities, such as the so-called "Islamic State" (ISI) and "radicalization of minorities," as it is known in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). In addition, they have urged the federal government to increase security measures for Muslim communities, including the closure of mosques, schools and hospitals. dps, mrs/jrc(AFP)mrc-rcd ( AFP/hr/Reuters)w/pahd(AP) "
,"Reference text": " Germany won't tolerate 'Sharia police' The German government has strongly criticized nightly patrols in the city of Wuppertal by men calling themselves "Sharia police." The 33-year-old behind the patrols claimed that their goal was only to raise attention. Conservative members of Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition put forward a united front at the weekend against recent developments in the city of Wuppertal. Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said civilians wearing uniforms bearing the logo "Shariah police" could not simply start patrolling German streets. The groups reportedly hovered around sites like discotheques and gambling houses, telling passers-by to refrain from gambling and alcohol. Wuppertal's police have begun pressing charges. "Sharia law is not tolerated on German soil," de Maiziere told mass-circulation daily Bild on Saturday. "Nobody can take it upon themselves to abuse the good name of the German police." Justice Minister Heiko Maas, meanwhile, told Bild that "the state alone" was responsible for the administration of justice in Germany. It was obvious, Maas said, that any illegal parallel system of law enforcement would not be tolerated. Christian Democrat party whip Volker Kauder was similarly emphatic in an interview to be published in this week's Welt am Sonntag newspaper. "Under absolutely no circumstances can we tolerate self-styled 'Sharia police officers' patrolling our streets and dictating what people should or should not do," Kauder said. Ringleader: goal was attention The 33-year-old behind the Wuppertal patrols, former fireman Sven Lau, published a video on his website on Saturday. Lau said that a "Sharia police" never existed, and that a group of men had simply worn the mock uniforms for a few hours. "We knew that this would raise attention," Lau said, claiming that his goal was to spark a debate about Sharia law in Germany. Lau is a leading member of Germany's Salafist movement, advocates of a strict Sunni interpretation of political Islam. He works with a mosque in his native Mönchengladbach, not far west of Wuppertal, and used to head the fundamentalist group "Invitation to Paradise." (Einladung zum Paradies, in German.) The central council of Muslims in Germany (ZMD) condemned the activities. "These few teen yobs do not speak in our name," chairman Ayman A. Mazyek told the Tagesspiegel am Sonntag newspaper. "These people are perverting the name of our religion. With this shrill and foolish action, they are really hurting Muslims." Sharia law is the Arabic term for a legal system based on the Koran. Saudi Arabia and Iran are examples of countries where such a system officially applies. Wearing a veil is obligatory for women and corporal punishment such as stoning is legally tolerated. Human Rights Watch reported last month that Saudi Arabia had beheaded 19 people in just 16 days in August, for convictions on charges ranging from cannabis smuggling to "sorcery." msh/rc (AFP, dpa, Reuters) "

The city's environmental organization, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO), has launched an online petition to stop the city from becoming a dumping ground for the global garbage problem. Organizers of the "Green Revolution" have launched a petition in Germany's capital city, Berlin, calling on the European Union (EU) to end the Great Pacific Garbage Patch by 20.09.2014. "We want to make the world a greener place," said Thomas Fischer, head of CSIRO's Green Revolution project, in a statement released Saturday by the organization. He added that the goal was to reduce the amount of garbage that is dumped in the country every year. In the past 20 years, Germany has become the first country in Europe to ban the dumping of large amounts of waste into the ocean. Today, more than 1.5 million tons of trash are dumped annually into Europe each year, according to the German government's website Change.org. Albrecht and Fischer are among those who have petitioned the government to allow the project to proceed, saying that it would be "a great step forward for our planet." The petition was launched in response to a growing number of complaints from environmental organizations, such as the World Food Programme (WFP), which has called for a ban on dumping the garbage into rivers and lakes. WFP is a nonprofit organization that works to protect the environment and promote sustainable development. It was founded in 1961 and is based in Berlin. According to its website, it is the largest non-governmental organization to collect and distribute waste from rivers, lakes, oceans and seas. Since then it has grown to over 2,000 members, with the majority of them living in urban areas, and the rest in rural areas. But it's not just the cities that have been affected. There is also the issue of climate change. Climate change is changing the way we think about the climate and how we live in an era of global warming. As a result, there is an increase in greenhouse gas emissions, which is expected to increase over the next five to 10 years. This has led to an explosion of greenhouse gases in cities and towns across the globe. Environmental organizations have also been calling for an end to this trend, as well as a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of fossil fuels and other sources of energy. Germany is one of those countries that has suffered the most from this phenomenon. For example, China, Kenya, Rwanda and South Africa have all seen their carbon emissions rise since the 1990s, while the United States has seen its carbon levels drop by about 30 percent since 1998. That's a huge increase compared to what is happening in other developed countries, including China and Kenya. However, this is not the case in developing countries like Germany, where the carbon footprint is much lower than what it used to be. What is important is that we are able to address this problem in our own way. We have to do something about it. If we don't act now, we can't do it tomorrow. And if we do not act tomorrow, then we will not have the opportunity to move forward with this project. I think we have a long way to go before the end of this century, but we need to act in this direction. How do we get there? What are we doing now? We are trying to find a solution that will allow us to get on with our lives and make a positive impact on our environment. So far we haven't found any solutions. At least not yet, that's what we're hoping for, because we've already seen a lot of progress in terms of reducing carbon pollution and reducing the level of pollution. Now we'll see if there are any concrete solutions that can be implemented. Is there a way forward? If so, what are the solutions? Is it possible to create a new generation of people who are willing to work with us? Do you have any idea what the solution is? Are we going to try to solve the problem? The answer is yes, of course, yes and no. Of course there will be some solutions, I'm sure that you can find solutions in your own country. Just as we did in Hong Kong, for instance, or in Kenya or Rwanda, you won't find them anywhere near where you live today. "
,"Reference text": " Will Berlin be the next city to ban plastic bags? They are sturdy, thin and can handle a heavy load, but after a single use, plastic bags often end up outdoors or in oceans - with disastrous impacts. But a student in Berlin is trying to halt the plastic bag invasion. It started off as a student job: Stefanie Albrecht contacted the environmental organization Deutsche Umwelthilfe to support its campaign in Berlin of approaching citizens on the streets to swap their plastic bags for reusable bags. The organization hoped to make people more aware of the environmentally destructive effects of plastic bags. Deutsche Umwelthilfe's anti-plastic bag campaign on Saturday (20.09.2014) also reused the bags campaigners collected off the streets. About 1,000 people strung together a 9-kilometer-long chain made of 30,000 plastic bags at the Tempelhofer Feld in the German capital Berlin, creating a world record. In Berlin alone, 30,000 plastic bags leave shops and market stalls every hour - amounting to 259 million bags a year. Across Germany, about 17 million plastic bags are consumed every day - or 6 billion a year. Albrecht, a natural resources management student, buys secondhand clothes, grows her own vegetables and tries to reduce her rubbish. But even she hadn't always been so conscious of the environmental problem that plastic bags present. "Before, I never thought about plastics and crude oil," she said. Stimulated by the conversations she had with strangers in the streets, she was motivated to sensitize others on the issue. In reading studies on polyethylene bags, she found out that 260 million liters (1.6 million barrels) of crude oil are processed into the plastic bags used over one year in Germany alone - not to mention the energy also needed in oil extraction and bag production. Eco-threat Plastic presents so many advantages: it is lightweight, strong, durable, waterproof, and cheap to produce. After the first department store in Germany started handing out plastic bags in 1961, many retailers followed. This packaging can be reused many times, and it is also recyclable. But because they are given away, plastic bags are carelessly disposed of: a plastic bag is typically used for 25 minutes on average - from the shop until you get back home. Plastic degrades very slowly in nature, over 100 to 500 years. In fact it never actually biodegrades - plastic just breaks down into ever-smaller pieces. And they can have fatal effects in the environment. Many places on land and water have become covered in a layer of plastic bags, bottles, canisters, furniture, forks and toothbrushes. In the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, a swirling island of plastic trash covers thousands of square kilometers. Plastic bags cause wild animals to die miserably. Animals think the plastic is food, and eat it. This can cause them to choke, and suffocate slowly. Or they starve to death: the material can't be digested and excreted, so it clogs the stomach and intestines. Animals can also get caught and strangle themselves in plastic; or it can cut off circulation to a limb, leading to a different type of slow and painful death. Scientists at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) recently found plastic in every second seabird off the coast of Australia. CSIRO has warned that continued plastic production could cause extinction of 95 percent of all living animals in the region by 2050. Fish, sea turtles, whales, dolphins, sea cows, crocodiles and crustaceans could all go the way of the dodo. Economic approach Stefanie Albrecht was shocked to learn all this. Together with the Deutsche Umwelthilfe, she collected signatures on the online petition platform Change.org to demand that the German government enact a law taxing thin plastic bags. Within only three weeks, the 100,000 signatures for that online petition had been gathered. Stefanie Albrecht is now planning to personally hand over the list to the German government. Other countries are ahead of Germany: retailers in Ireland have been taxing plastic bags since 2002. There, consumption of plastic bags has decreased from 328 to 16 on average per person due to the tax. In Germany, annual consumption is at 76 plastic bags per head - a lot lower than the European average of 198 bags. "Germany has more than 80 million inhabitants. By reducing our per person consumption, we can achieve greater impact than many other countries in the European Union," pointed out Thomas Fischer of Deutsche Umwelthilfe. A minimum charge of 22 cents could cause the consumer to rethink his plastic bag habit: "Do I really need this bag, or can I put the goods in my backpack?" Fischer said in describing the hypothetical question. Bans in other areas In Bangladesh, plastic bags were banned after plastic waste clogged sewers and led to flooding in 1988 and 1998. China, Kenya, Rwanda and South Africa have also banned ultra-thin plastic bags. Many cities in the "

The UN said on Friday that there was a "very high risk" of spreading the disease. "We are very concerned about the spread of this disease," WHO chief medical officer Joanne Kargbo told reporters in Geneva, adding that "there is a very high probability that this outbreak will spread across the entire continent of Africa." "It is very, very serious," she said, referring to the deadly virus that has killed more than 1,000 people in Africa since it was first detected in May 24. In Sierra Leone, where the country is hosting the Youth Olympics in August, the WHO said it had detected a high number of cases of hemorrhagic fever, including those in Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria and Nigeria. According to a WHO statement, there were at least 10 cases in all of these countries, with the majority of those cases linked to Ebola, which is spread by the virus through contact between infected people and bodily fluids. A WHO spokesman said the agency was "deeply concerned" about a possible outbreak, but added that it did not know how long it would take to reach a conclusion. Ebola is the most common cause of death among people who have been infected with Ebola. It is not known how many people have died from this virus. However, it is believed to have spread from one outbreak to another. On Thursday, a UN medical charity, Medicins Sans Frontieres (MSF), issued a statement calling for the international community to cooperate in fighting the epidemic. ipj/tj (AfP, Reuters)The WHO also said that in order to prevent a repeat of last year's deadly Ebola epidemic, "we need to make sure that we do everything we can to stop this epidemic from spreading," the statement said. International Olympic Committee (IOC) officials said they would hold a press conference on Saturday to discuss the latest developments in Ebola and its impact on the health of millions of people affected by it, as well as the situation in neighboring countries such as Nigeria, Cameroon, Benin, Niger, Chad and South Africa.   j/k (Reuters, AP, dpa, iwapo, bp, kp), who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals, said he would not be able to attend the conference because he was not authorized to speak to reporters. He said there would be no media coverage, and that he had no immediate plans to travel to China to meet with medical staff and other officials. If he did travel, he will have to wait until the International Olympics Committee has decided whether or not to allow him to do so, according to MSF's head of medical operations, Brima Kogbo, who has been in contact with Liu since last week. IPj /tje ( AfP) ipx/ttj A UN spokesman, meanwhile, told the Associated Press: "This is an extremely serious outbreak and we are extremely concerned. There are a lot of health problems in this country and it's very difficult for us to deal with it. We are not going to let anyone get away with this, because we don't want to be in a situation where people are dying from Ebola," he said in an interview on Thursday. At the same time, health officials in Nigeria have also expressed concern over the possibility of a resurgence of an epidemic in their country, saying that they have not yet seen any evidence of any new outbreaks in that country. They are also concerned that a new outbreak could lead to an increase in deaths, particularly among young people, due to high-risk Ebola patients who are being treated in hospitals and clinics. This is particularly worrying given the high level of public awareness about Ebola among the general public and the fact that many of them are suffering from severe health conditions. As a result, many health professionals are worried about possible outbreaks, especially in developing countries where Ebola has spread so rapidly and is spreading so quickly. IOC officials say they are working closely with WHO and WHO to ensure that no new cases are identified and confirmed before the end of next week, when the next outbreak is expected to take place. But they also warn that if there are more cases, they will be more likely to spread quickly and more quickly than in previous outbreaks. "

Its warning follows a WHO admission that the epidemic requires "extraordinary measures." The head of Medicins Sans Frontieres (MSF), Joanne Liu -- fresh from a visit to western Africa -- said in Geneva on Friday that more experts were needed in the hard-hit region. "It is deteriorating faster, and moving faster, than we can respond to," Liu told reporters. "Like in a war time, we have a total collapse of infrastructure," she added. Lui said the world community needed to get the "upper hand" over the next six months. While the viral spread had been slowed in Guinea, concerns focused especially on Liberia. "If we don't stabilize Liberia, we will never stabilize the region," Lui said. She was critical of the WHO for delaying its public health emergency warning until August 8. "We need people with a hands-on operational mindset," to combat the outbreak, Liu told the Geneva news briefing. WHO - 'vastly underestimated' On Thursday, the World Health Organization (WHO) said the scale of the epidemic had been "vastly underestimated" and that "extraordinary measures" were needed to contain the contagious virus. The UN health agency said the death toll had climbed to 1,069 in four afflicted countries, spanning Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia and more recently Nigeria. Sierra Leone's chief medical officer Brima Kargbo disclosed on Thursday that at least 32 of the nation's nurses and doctors had died from the Ebola virus while performing their duties between May 24 and August 13. Local staff suffered stigma, despite saving lives, Kargbo said. "We still have to break the chain of transmission to separate the infected from the uninfected."

The court said Tuesday that the US company had violated the EU's antitrust laws by using its Internet-based CD-ROM technology. Oracle, which is based in Luxembourg, said in a statement that it did not have the legal authority to do so. "The European court of justice has decided that Oracle is not entitled to the right to participate in the application of this technology," the company said. It said the decision was made after a three-judge panel of judges heard arguments from lawyers representing the German firm, UsedSoft, on Tuesday. A decision by the court was expected to be taken within the next two weeks. In the case, Oracle said it would not be able to proceed with its application because the technology was not yet ready for use in Europe. Earlier this month, a Luxembourg court ruled that a German software company, used to sell CDs and DVDs, had failed to comply with EU rules on the use of such technology in electronic commerce. hg/mz (AFP, dpa)The court's decision comes as Oracle (ORCL) faces a series of legal challenges over its decision to enter into an EU-wide agreement to regulate the Internet. One of those challenges is whether Oracle will be allowed to continue to use its CD and DVD technology as part of its contract with CD maker Discrete. Another challenge would be whether the agreement should be extended to other companies, such as CD makers, DVD manufacturers and software companies that sell DVDs and CDs, or whether it should remain in force until a new agreement is reached between the two countries. Both sides have said they will not seek to change the terms of an agreement, although Oracle has argued that such a move would violate EU antitrust law and that there is no legal basis for it to operate in EU competition law. Read more: Oracle acquires used-to-be-discounting software maker Used Soft The case was brought by a group of lawyers from Germany, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and the United States, and was heard by European courts in Strasbourg and Luxembourg last week. According to court documents, it is the first time that an Internet company has been found guilty of antitrust violations in European competition, with the exception of one case in which it was found to have violated antitrust rules by selling CDs or DVDs to a third party. That case is currently pending before the ECJ, where a court has already ruled against the firm for allegedly violating the rules of competition in an attempt to prevent the sale of CDs to third-party resellers and disc-labeling companies. Last week, an appeals court rejected a bid by Oracle to buy used soft, saying the move was "unfair" and "not fair" to its customers and would have "serious consequences" for the future of Internet use. However, lawyers for Oracle say the deal is likely to go ahead despite the fact that its software is still being developed in Germany and is being tested in other European countries, including the UK and US, as well as in France and Germany. They also say it could have a negative impact on other countries' Internet usage, particularly in countries with high Internet penetration rates, because of a lack of data privacy laws and a shortage of information about the content of digital content on a large number of devices. But Oracle says it will appeal the ruling, arguing that "it is a matter of time before a decision is made on whether or not the law is fair and equitable." The company also says the dispute is related to copyright infringement, but it has yet to decide whether to file a trademark infringement claim against its US subsidiary, Incorporated (IUP), which owns the rights to trademark the name used in this case.   For the record, IUP stands for "Internet of Things," which means "internet of things" in English, German, French, Spanish, Italian and Spanish. This is an important step for Internet companies to make in their efforts to protect their intellectual property rights and protect the interests of users. "

It sided with a German firm in its legal battle with US giant Oracle. The European Court of Justice on Tuesday ruled that used software licenses may generally be resold by individuals or companies. The Luxembourg-based court thus sided with the German firm UsedSoft in a protracted legal battle with US software giant Oracle. The ruling made it clear that trade in used software was permissible even if the software had not been shipped on a physical medium such as a CD or DVD, but had been digitally downloaded from the Internet. UsedSoft's business model hinges completely on reselling used packages or legally obtained license keys for them. By reselling the keys to clients, the latter are then able to download the latest version of a given program directly from a company's Internet site and obtain all new updates and patches in the process. Legal clarity Oracle had sued UsedSoft over its business model, trying to prevent buyers of used software licenses from downloading programs again. But the European court ruled that the so-called principle of exhaustion applied whenever software was originally sold to a customer for an unlimited time span, not giving the maker of the software the right to prevent the resale of that software. "The door for the trade in used software has been pushed wide open throughout the European Union," UsedSoft said in a statement, welcoming "perfect legal safety on the market." The court in Luxembourg emphasized, though, that whoever resold pieces of original software and their accompanying licenses must erase every copy on their own computers in advance and was not allowed to keep a copy after resale. hg/mz (AFP, dpa) "

The rover is set to return to Gale Crater on August 5. NASA said on Thursday that the rover had made contact with the planet's rocky surface. "We're very excited," Curiosity's mission manager Jennifer Tropser told reporters at a press conference in the US capital, announcing the mission's landing. She said the team was "very excited" about the prospect of landing on Mars, adding that it was the "first time we've ever been on a planet that's been so hot and humid." "It's a very exciting time to be a part of this mission," she said in a statement released by NASA. Curiosity has been roving the rocky planet for nearly two weeks, collecting samples from rocks and craters on its way to Mars. On Wednesday, NASA announced that Curiosity had picked up a small amount of soil samples, which it hoped would be used to test its landing gear. However, the agency said it had yet to confirm whether the samples had been collected from the rocks, and that they had not yet been sent to a lab for further testing. msh/jm (AFP, AP, Reuters)The rover was due to land on top of a rock about 1,000 meters (2,600 feet) high, with a view to reaching the summit of Glenelg, about 2,500 meters above sea level. It is expected to take up to 10 days to complete its mission. Msh /jmm (AP, AFP, REUTERS)Msh,jpm (Reuters, EPA, dpa) Manned by a US Navy ship, Curiosity is scheduled to make its first landing of the year, on Aug. 5, at the southern end of Gale crater in southern Chile. After a two-day journey, it is believed to have touched down at about 3.5 million feet (1.93-billion-euro) of rock, according to NASA's Mars Science Laboratory (MSL). The Mars rover will spend the next few days exploring the crater's surface, as well as the rock surrounding it, in an attempt to determine the extent of its impact on Earth's atmosphere and the composition and composition of Martian soil and rock. According to the MSL, there is no sign of an impact from Curiosity, but it could be an indication of what's in store for Mars' surface in coming days and weeks. In the past, Mars scientists have used Curiosity as a tool to study the surface of rocky planets, such as Mars and Jupiter, to try to understand the impact of climate change and how it might affect the environment of life on those planets. Today, however, they are hoping to find out what the impacts might be on this planet, if any of these impacts are significant enough to lead to significant changes in its climate and its atmosphere composition. Many scientists believe that Mars will be warmer and more hospitable to microbial life than it currently is to human habitation, so it's important to keep an eye out for signs of microbial activity and to monitor the effects of human activities on other planets and their environments, including the presence of microbes and other life-forms, like bacteria, fungi and protozoa, among other things. Most scientists agree that Martian life is more stable than previously thought, although some have suggested that this may be the case for some areas of Mars where there are no active life at all. Some scientists say that there may have been an increase in human activity in recent years, because of increased surface temperatures and a lack of oxygen in some regions. Others say this could have a negative effect on water levels, since the atmosphere is warmer than normal and therefore more likely to contain bacteria and viruses, making it more susceptible to microorganisms that could spread to other worlds. But the Mars team is optimistic about its chances of finding a solution to this problem, saying that "there is a good chance that we will find some kind of solution." The mission is being led by the Curiosity team of scientists and engineers, who are working closely with NASA to develop a plan for a new rover to explore the red planet. "

The Curiosity rover will soon re-start its sluggish search for signs of life. NASA's Mars rover, "Curiosity," will wrap up a lengthy self-testing phase on Thursday, freeing it up to continue exploring the surface of the Red Planet. Mission manager Jennifer Tropser told reporters in a conference call on Wednesday evening that the plan, once the final checks were completed, was to "drive, drive, drive" until Curiosity discovers a rock suitable for analysis. She added that the instrument checks have delivered positive results. "Through every phase of the check-out, Curiosity has performed almost flawlessly," Tropser said. "The success so far of these activities has been outstanding." Many of the tests have concerned Curiosity's robotic arm. The 2.1-meter (7-feet) appendage will be used to pick out and sample rocks and soil. NASA is investigating whether Mars can sustain life, or whether it could in the past. The tests were designed to identify any damage sustained during its interplanetary flight and also to ensure that the arm still functioned properly on Mars, with its different temperatures and gravity. The Mars rover landed in the giant Gale Crater, near the Martian equator, on August 5; it has so far moved about 109 meters within the crater. The rover is traveling east, heading first to an intersection called Glenelg, where three types of terrain meet. This is likely to be the location for the first rock and soil samples, though NASA said Curiosity was unlikely to arrive there for several weeks. Curiosity's ultimate destination is the nearby Aeolis Mons or Mount Sharp, a 3-mile-high mound of rock rising out of the crater. Mount Sharp is about 4.3 miles (7 kilometers) away from Curiosity's landing site.

},{"Generated text": " World Health Organization: Aging and Health in China A new report on aging and health in the world's largest economy predicts that by 2050, China will be one of the fastest-growing economies on Earth. The report, which was released on Wednesday, is the latest in a series of reports on the health of China's aging population. According to the report published by the World Health Organisation (WHO), the country's population is expected to grow at a rate of 6.5 percent annually over the next five years, up from 2.7 percent in 2015. China is projected to be the second-largest economy on earth, behind only the United States, with a population of 1.6 billion people. In China, the number of people aged 65 years and older has risen by more than 10 percent since 2015, according to WHO data. However, there is still a long way to go before China can meet its goal of becoming the first country to reach the global average age of 65. Population growth has been slow in recent years due to a combination of factors, including the rise in population growth and the aging of older people, as well as a decline in economic growth. This has led to an increase in health-care costs for the elderly, who are now among the most vulnerable to disease and illness. Health care costs are also rising, especially among young people and those with low incomes. As a result, healthcare costs have increased, leading to higher costs of care for elderly and children. These costs, however, have not been fully compensated for by government spending on health care, particularly in rural areas, such as rural and urban areas. And the cost of healthcare has also risen, due in part to rising prices of food and medicine, and to increased demand for medical care. But this is not the only problem with aging. There are many other problems, too. One of them is that it is very difficult for people to get enough sleep. That is, if they are able to keep up with the demands of their daily lives, they will have to take care of themselves and their families. So, in order to meet these challenges, we need to make sure that we have a healthy and well-balanced diet and exercise program that works for everyone, not just those who can't afford it, but also those that can afford to do so. We need a new generation of doctors, nurses, pharmacists and social workers to ensure that they have the skills and knowledge to deal with this new challenge. It is also important to note that the Chinese government has not yet decided whether or not they want to implement this program in their own country, or if it will implement it as part of a broader effort to improve the quality of life for all of its citizens. "We are not going to allow this to happen overnight," said a senior official in Beijing, adding that "it will take some time before we can implement the program." This is an important step for China to realize its vision of an aging society, since it has become increasingly dependent on government funding for its social services and public health programs. To do this, it would be necessary to develop a comprehensive health plan that will address the needs of all citizens and provide them with adequate support and training for their needs. For example, a health insurance plan would require that all Chinese citizens have access to basic healthcare services, like a doctor and a pharmacy, for example. If this does not work, then the government will not have enough money to cover the costs associated with these services. What is more important is to know that this plan is being implemented in accordance with Chinese law and regulations, so that people can access the services that are available to them. Therefore, this report is aimed at ensuring that China has the right policies and procedures in place to address this problem.

People worldwide are living longer, says the World Health Organization in its World Report on Aging and Health. This is both good and bad. It gives us the chance to "pursue new activities" as we get older, such as in education and family life. But it all depends on our health. And for that the WHO says world governments need to act now to make sure our societies worldwide are ready. What are the take home facts from the World Health Organization's 2015 report on Aging and Health? The WHO says that in the next 35 years, the global number of people aged 60 years and over will almost double from 12 percent to 22 percent. By 2020, there will be more people over the age of 60 than 5 year olds. And a majority of older people (80 percent) will live in "low and middle income" countries. It's estimated that the world's population aged 60 years and older will total about 2 billion in 2050, which is more than twice as much as now. Furthermore, worldwide, about 125 million people are aged 80 years or older. But by 2050, it is expected that this number of people - aged 80 and over - will live in China alone. But I'm not old, so why should I care? Well, all this is happening at a faster rate than ever before. And the WHO says "all countries face major challenges to ensure that their health and social systems are ready" for this major demographic shift. It will cost a lot of money to improve health and social infrastructures, especially in more developed countries where traditional families structures have changed dramatically. Surely, there's "no typical older person," though. How does the WHO define aging? We tend to think of older people as physically and mentally frail. But that's not necessarily the case, not everywhere in the world. Old is a relative concept - especially in middle income to rich countries. For instance, some 70 year olds are as fit as some 20 year olds. Just think how many older folk are at your gym, and ask yourself whether you can keep up with all of them. But that still doesn't explain aging. What is it exactly? The WHO says that at a biological level, "aging results from the impact of the accumulation of a wide variety of molecular and cellular damage over time." Basically, this puts people at a higher risk of disease and, of course, death. But aging can also be associated with "life transitions," such as retirement or witnessing other people, such as friends and family, die around you. This can affect you psychologically and sometimes, as a result, physically. What sort of diseases come with old age? Some of the most common non-fatal conditions include hearing loss, cataracts, back and neck pain and osteoarthritis. Other conditions include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - which affects the lungs - diabetes, depression, and dementia. What needs to be done? The WHO is proposing a five-step plan of action, which includes: Committing to healthy aging and "evidence-based policies to strengthen the abilities of older persons." Aligning health systems with the needs of older populations Developing systems for providing long-term care Creating "age-friendly cities and communities Improving measurement, monitoring and understanding of "aging issues" worldwide. But don't forget: "a longer life brings with it opportunities, not only for older people and their families, but also for societies as a whole." "

The Finnish driver took the podium in his first race of the season on Sunday. He was the only driver to finish in the top five in F1's World Championship standings. "It was a great day for me," said Ferrari's Juan Pablo Montoya, who finished fourth in a race in which he had to settle for fifth place. Alonso, the world's most successful driver, has been the most consistent performer this season, with a total of five wins and three podium finishes. His best finish was sixth in Germany, where he finished second to Michael Schumacher. But he was only able to hold on to the lead for a few laps before dropping out of contention for Sunday's race. McLaren, Ferrari and Renault were the other teams to make up ground, but Alonso was unable to keep up with the pace of his rivals. In the end, McLaren's Fernando Alonso won the race by a single point, while the Ferrari driver finished third in Colombia, finishing fourth. Ferrari, Mercedes and McLaren were also in contention to take the title, which they won in Canada, Indianapolis, and Canada. Both teams were eliminated from the final round of qualifying on Saturday night, meaning that Alonso would have to wait until Sunday for his chance to win the championship. A strong weekend for Alonso The Spaniard's best result so far this year has come at Silverstone, when he took pole position ahead of McLaren and Ferrari. However, he has yet to qualify for next year's Formula 1 season finale in Indianapolis. Despite his best efforts, Alonso has struggled to stay on track in qualifying and has not yet managed to break through the qualifying barrier. That's a major problem for him, as he's been struggling to find his form in recent weeks. On Sunday, however, it will be his turn to shine in front of a packed house at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya in Spain. It's not just Alonso who is struggling, though. There are also a number of other drivers who are struggling as well, such as Alonso's team-mate Nico Hulkenberg. And there's also the question of whether Alonso will make it into the starting line-up for this weekend's German GP. After a disappointing qualifying session in Britain, Monaco and the United States last weekend, Hamilton and Alonso have been battling to get back into contention in their respective races. Hamilton, meanwhile, is hoping to build on his strong showing in Mexico and Colombia to secure a fourth consecutive victory in 2017. Hitting the track at a track that's known as the "Ring of Fire" is a tough circuit for drivers, especially those who don't have a lot of experience in racing. As a result, they'll be looking to add to their collection of podiums and to improve their chances of making it to next season's grand prix in 2018 and beyond. For Alonso and his team, this is the second year in succession that the German driver has made it onto the grid. Last year he qualified fifth in Monaco, qualifying sixth. This year it was his second consecutive year that he scored a top-five finish. At the same time, his record was broken in both races in 2015 and 2016. With the exception of one race last year, only one of those races was ever won by him in 2014. Although he won that race, that was not the case this time around, because he didn't make the cut for that one. So it's hard to see how he could have done it without Alonso. If he hadn't been on pole, there would be no way he'd have finished in fourth place in Austria. What's next for Hamilton? "I'm not sure," Hamilton said, "but I'm hoping he can do it again." Alonso is also looking forward to a return to racing in 2019, after missing the last two races with an ankle injury sustained during a collision with teammate Sergio Pérez in Malaysia. 'I can't wait to go out there and compete again' Hamilton has also been in good form, although he hasn't had a good run since his return from a back injury in Brazil. "

It is a reflection of his current inauspicious Formula One campaign that World Champion Michael Schumacher is only featuring in reports on this weekend's German Grand Prix at Hockenheim dues to his nationality. The home grown champion equaled his own record of 11 wins in a season at last year's race but this year he will be hoping to just get on the podium at the end. Schumi lies in third place some 34 points off the top spot and has a lot to do if he is to record his 85th career win. Ferrari's poor season to date is unlikely to get better with hopes dwindling that the 36-year-old will add to his sole victory of the season although the seven-time world champion characteristically refuses to rule it out. Schumi and Ferrari still in the fight "Contrary to many other people's opinions, we have in no means written ourselves off, even though we have to admit that the situation has worsened recently, rather than improved," said the German, referring to the problems with this season's car. "But that doesn't mean that it can't be improved again, and that's exactly what we're working on." The limelight is falling on two young pretenders to Schumacher's throne as Sunday's race approaches. The battle between McLaren's flying Finn Kimi Raikkonen and championship leader Renault's speedy Spaniard Fernando Alonso is diverting eyes from the world record holding German on his own turf. Kimi aims to keep heat on leader Alonso Raikkonen must finish the German Grand Prix for the first time in five attempts to close the gap on Alonso if he is to keep his own championship hopes alive. The Finn retired from last year's race because of a rear wing failure and this season has been plagued by technical problems which most recently cost him 10 places on the starting grid in each of the last two rounds. Despite those penalties for engine failure, the 25-year-old managed to finish second and third but he will have to increase his total of three race wins if he is to make a significant impression on the 26-point chasm that separates him from Alonso. "The battle for the championship is still on and I am determined to get a good result and work on closing the gap," said the Finn. "The (car) has good speed and we need to make the most of it this weekend." Montoya doing McLaren team mate no favors Raikkonen's car is obviously a fast one this season but he's not the only driver in a McLaren hot seat. Colombia's Juan Pablo Montoya is not to going to make way for his team mate while his own hopes of the title, however small, remain alive. "I am really looking forward to racing again this weekend in Germany," said Montoya, who won at Hockenheim for Williams two years ago and got his first victory for McLaren in Britain two weeks ago. "I enjoy racing at Hockenheim, I have performed well here and won in the past and I am aiming for a strong result like at Silverstone." Consistent Ferdy the man to beat at Hockenheim Championship leader Alonso, meanwhile, has been impressively consistent for Renault so far this season, winning five times and failing to score points only at the Canadian Grand Prix, where he crashed, and in Indianapolis. The Spaniard is setting the pace and the standard this season so, problems aside, Alonso will again be the man to beat at Hockenheim. "

Author Elinor Ostrom, co-prizewinner of the Swedish Academy of Sciences, gave the prize to Williamson in 1968. Williamson, a professor at Indiana University in California, was the first Swedish Nobel laureate to receive the award. The award was presented to him in a ceremony at the University of California in Berkeley, where he received a standing ovation from the audience. "I'm very honored to have received this award," Williamson said, adding that it was "a great honor to be recognized for my contribution to this field." The prize is awarded annually to a Swedish researcher who has made a significant impact on the world economy through his research. In 1968, Williamson was awarded a Nobel Peace Prize in Economics in memory of Nobel-winning economist, Nobel Laureate Oliver Nobel, who died in 1975 after a long illness. He was one of only two Nobel laureates in history to win the prestigious prize, which was given in his honor by Sweden's Swedish central bank in 1969. His work was published in The Economic Institutions of Capitalism (1975), a book about the economics of capitalism and the role of industrialists in creating the industrial revolution in Sweden. It was his work that earned him the reputation of being the "father of modern economics." In 1975, he was named a "Nobel laureate" for the work he had done to advance the theory of economic theory and to promote the idea of a free market economy. Since then he has received numerous awards, including the most prestigious award in Swedish history, the Stockholm International Peace Research Prize (SSPRI), which he won in 1974. But Williamson's work has not been recognized by the scientific community. Instead, it's been hailed as an achievement by many economists, especially those who believe in free markets and globalization as a way to boost economic growth and create a more prosperous society. This year's prize was won by Swedish writer and economist Carola Greider-Herta Blackburn, with whom Williamson had worked for more than 30 years, and who is also the author of several books on economics, economics and politics, among others. A Nobel Literature Prize is given to an individual or group of people who have made significant contributions in their fields of study, such as economics or political science, in order to improve the understanding of how the economic system works and how it can be improved. One of Williamson’s most famous achievements is his book, “The Economics of Capital,” which is based on his life and work in economic sciences and is a collection of essays on how to make the economy more efficient and efficient. That book was written by Williamson and published by a German-born Israeli-American writer, Ada Blackburn. Both of them have also received Nobel Prizes for their work on economic science and literature. They have both received honorary doctorates from universities in Germany and Israel, as well as honorary degrees from Harvard, Yale and Hebrew University, respectively. These awards are given out in recognition of their achievements in research and education. Nobel literature laureate Williamson is the only Swedish author to ever receive an award of this kind from an international organization. On the other hand, many of his colleagues have been honored with honorary Doctorates of Science and Letters from other prestigious universities. Many of these honors are awarded to those whose work they have helped to shape the modern economy and whose contributions have shaped the way we live today. For example, this year Williamson won the German Nobel for Economics, an honor that honors the achievements of German economist and political scientist Carl Heinrich Hübner. According to his biography, "Alfred Nobel" (1962), Williamson earned a total of 10 million Swedish crowns ($969,000 euros) from a research grant awarded by Germany's Federal Reserve Bank of Berlin. While Williamson did not receive a doctorate, she did receive one from Israel's Ministry of Economic Affairs (MENA) for her work with the same name. "
,"Reference text": " US duo shares Nobel Prize for Economics US researcher Elinor Ostrom is the first woman to win the Nobel prize for economics since it was created in 1968. She will share the prestigious award with US compatriot Oliver Williamson. The jury from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said the Americans' research had shown how "economic analysis can shed light on most forms of social organization." Ostrom, a professor at Indiana University, was honored for her "analysis of economic governance," especially in relation to the management of common property or property under common control. The political scientist's work challenges the widely accepted belief that common property is poorly managed and should be either regulated by central authorities or privatized, it added. She carried out numerous studies showing how self-organization and local-level management work to keep common resources viable. Her studies included both natural resources, such as forests, and artificial structures, for example police forces. Ostrom told Swedish television that she felt "great surprise and appreciation" and was "in shock" about being the first woman to win the prize. The pros and cons of big firms In his work, co-prizewinner Oliver Williamson, of University of California, Berkeley, examines why large corporations tend to arise - and why they do not - based on the cost and complexity of transactions, according to the Nobel committee. "He has taught us to regard markets, firms, associations, agencies, and even households from the perspective of their contribution to the resolution of conflict," the jury said. Williamson authored 'The Economic Institutions of Capitalism' in 1975, a landmark text of the 'new institutional economics' movement that questioned the idea of firms as simple profit-making machines. Last but not least The Nobel prize for economics is the only Nobel award that was not created by the will of Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel in 1896. It was actually founded by the Swedish central bank, the Sverige Riksbank, to celebrate its tri-centenary a year earlier. It was awarded for the first time in 1969 under its official name: the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel. But although it was the last "Nobel prize" to be created and the last to be announced each year, the prize is not a poor relation in monetary terms. Winners of the awards for peace, literature, medicine, physiology, chemistry and physics all receive 10 million Swedish crowns (969,000 euros). A good year for women This year was a record year for women laureates. German-Romanian writer Herta Mueller won the Nobel Prize for Literature. Australian-American Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider of the United States were awarded the prize for medicine. And Ada Yonath of Israel was one of three scientists recognized for her work in chemistry. Americans more or less swept the board this year. Nine of the 11 laureates were US citizens. The most prominent of those was US President Barack Obama, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for his "extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples." jg/AFP/dpa/Reuters Editor: Sam Edmonds " 

},{"Generated text": " Brandenburg's Tropical Islands Airport to open in 2003 Brandenburg airport will open its doors to the public in the next few years, according to a spokesman for the airport's owner. Colin Au, a Malaysian businessman who founded the business in 1990, is set to become the country's largest airport operator by the end of the year. The airport, which is located on the tropical islands off the German coast, will be open for business from 2003 to 2008, the spokesman Steffen Kammrath said in a statement. "We are looking forward to opening our doors," he said, adding that the company would be able to expand its operations to other parts of Europe, Asia and the Middle East. He added that he hoped to increase the number of employees to 100,000 by 2005, as well as the amount of money invested in developing the island's infrastructure. In 2003, it was announced that it would open a new terminal at the base of Tropical Island Airport in Germany. It is the first airport in Europe to be opened by a German businessman, who is also the owner of a private company that owns the Tropical islands. Since 2002, he has been working with the government of Malaysia to develop the area's airport infrastructure, and has also been in talks with European aviation authorities about the possibility of opening a second terminal. However, his company has yet to make a decision on whether or not it will continue to operate as a separate entity. A spokesman said that, while the project is still in its early stages, there was still a long way to go before it could be ready for commercial use. Branden-Berlin International airport spokesman Stefan Karmratt said the expansion would take place between 2003 and 2008 and would allow for a total of 15 million euros ($15 million) in investment. KAMRATH said he was "very optimistic" about its chances of becoming a successful airline operator, given that "there is a lot of potential in this area," and that there is "a good chance that we will have a very successful business." The expansion is expected to have an impact on tourism and tourism as it is one of Germany's fastest-growing industries, with more than 1.5 million visitors a year coming in from all over the world. Last year, German tourism authorities announced they would expand their business to include the development of five new terminals, including one in Berlin and two in Bratislava. They have also announced plans to build a third terminal in Laguna, where they hope to start operations in 2005. This will allow them to begin operating in 2006, when they have already completed the initial phase of their expansion plans. There will also be a pilot program in 2008 to test out the feasibility of expanding the terminal's network of terminals in other European countries. That will take about two years. At the same time, they are also looking at expanding their network in Asia, Africa and Latin America. But they will need to do so in order to meet the growing demand for international flights. For the long term, this will only be possible if there are sufficient staff to handle the increasing demand. So far, however, that has not been the case. According to an official statement from the city's tourism department, tourism is not the only area of business that will benefit from this expansion. Tourism is another area in which the economy is growing, but the tourism industry is suffering from a lack of economic growth and a shortage of skilled workers. As a result, tourists are increasingly turning to tourism to get a taste of what it's like to work at a big international airport. Many of them are hoping to travel to Europe and Asia to see the effects of tourism on their local economies. Some of these tourists have even gone to Germany to enjoy the sights and sounds of tropical island resorts. Others have gone on to visit the islands themselves and have enjoyed the experience of working at their own leisure destinations. One of those places is in Karlsruhe, Germany - a city of 2.6 million people - which has a population of about 3.3 million. Another airport is being built in Malaya, about 1,500 kilometers (1,600 miles) away. "
,"Reference text": " The Sun Sets Slowly Over Brandenburg's Tropical Dream Having suffered many disappointments concerning publically funded projects, the state of Brandenburg hoped a tropical leisure center would offer a ray of hope. Instead the ailing concern is just bringing more gloom. The economically depressed eastern German state of Brandenburg has seen its fair share of bitter experiences when it comes to huge public investment projects since German unification in 1990. Against this background, state authorities were pleased when Malaysian businessman Colin Au built a huge tropical-feeling leisure center in Brandenburg without any subsidies. The center, which opened about a year ago, was to become a symbol of economic success in a region where unemployment still hovers around the 20 percent mark. But the leisure time park, which has already swallowed a little under 100 million euros ($120 million) in private investment, is now going to have to depend on public funding to avoid another economic fiasco in Brandenburg. State authorities in Brandenburg haven't been too successful in their public investment policy in the past 10 years, to put it mildly. A grand plan to build one of the world's most modern chip-producing factories there burst like a bubble in 2003. The much-talked about Brandenburg-Berlin International airport still seems light years away from being built. Line of failures looked to be ended by Au's vision Another beacon of economic hope disappeared in 2002 when a company planning to build gas-filled transport airships went bust despite considerable subsidies. But Au's vision for the abandoned dome which the airship company needed as a hangar offered Brandenburg another chance. In the middle of nowhere, he created what he named his "Tropical Islands" wonderland, sporting everything from sandy beaches, lakes and a Laguna to a Caribbean-style village. The economics ministry in Brandenburg was over the moon to see Au originally agreeing to build the facility without any state subsidies. And Au himself had no doubt at the time that he could well do without them. Overestimated visitor numbers tell sorry story But the center's first year in operation tells a different story. Colin Au, who has meanwhile left Brandenburg and transferred matters to a German management company, had expected some 1.5 million visitors to come to Tropical Islands within the first year, but only some 950,000 will have turned up by the end of 2005. It seems highly unlikely that visitor numbers will increase considerably in future, placing a question mark on the viability of the whole centre. But Brandenburg's economics ministry is certain that the park will be in the black as of 2008. To make the place more attractive, it has agreed to shell out 15 million euros in subsidies for yet another reconstruction and marketing effort. After all, the leisure time center has a workforce of about 500 and is thus the biggest employer in an otherwise depressed region marked by a high jobless rate. Tropical center down but not out...not yet "We hope the money will help make the Tropical Islands resort better known throughout Europe according to the new marketing concept hammered out the management," ministry spokesman Steffen Kammrath said. "This leisure time center is unique and has to be marketed as such. What you have there is a tropical and water world 12 months a year with a lot of attractive offers to spend a whale of a time there." Some commentators believe that state subsidies may prolong the center's life span, but will not be able to avoid its demise in the long run. But the idea of also making it more attractive for tourists from all over Europe seems unrealistic to them if the resort's management can't even get enough visitors from home to ensure a profitable operation.

The Bavarian side have lost their first two Bundesliga matches of the season, falling to 1-2 in the first half of Friday's match at home to Leverkusen. Bayern, who have won three of their last four league matches, have been on the losing end of a three-game losing streak. On Friday, they lost 2-1 in their opening Bundesliga match against Hoffenerheim, which they had lost in December. Coach Uli Hoeness, the club's commercial manager, said on Friday that he was "very disappointed" with the result. "I'm very disappointed," he said, adding that "it was a disappointing result for us." "It's disappointing that we've lost so many games in a row, and that's the only way we're going to get back to winning ways." The loss was the second in as many matches this season for the Bundesliga's top-flight club, having lost two of its first three league games. It was also the team's first defeat in what was supposed to be a four-match winning streak, but it was only a one-goal defeat for Hoffensheim. Hoffengheim have now gone on to lose their final three matches in all competitions, including the last two, to Bayern. They will now have to wait until December to make up for that defeat. Leverhüttenstern, meanwhile, will be without a coach for at least another year, with coach Dietmar Hopp and sporting director Ralf Rangnick set to take over the reins at the top of his own club. After the match, Hoffeneheim will travel to Munich for a pre-season friendly, where they will take on a second-place Hannover side on Saturday. In a statement released by the German soccer magazine, DPA, it said: "We have a very difficult situation ahead of us. We need to find a way to win this match and we will try to do that by winning this one." A few minutes before kick-off, Bayern had already lost the previous two games, losing both of them by a single goal. But they have not lost a game since December, when they took on Bielefeld, a side that has been struggling for some time with injuries and has struggled to keep up with their opponents. Last season's loss to Hoffeheim was just the latest example of how the Bavarians have failed to overcome their own problems in recent weeks. At the same time, there were a number of injuries to key players, such as the head coach and the assistant coach, as well as a couple of players who were injured in last week's defeat at Hoffa. Both players were given a week to recover from their respective injuries, while the coach also had to undergo a medical check-up. A medical examination was carried out to determine whether they would be able to return to the squad for Saturday's game. Following the game, Munich's coach said he had "no idea" what the medical exam would reveal. He also said that his team would not be allowed to play again until next season. However, he did not rule out the possibility of playing again this year. With the exception of last year's 3-3 draw against Cologne, last month's result was not a surprise to him. His first match in charge of Munich came against a team that had struggled for consistency and was expected to finish the campaign in third place. That's why he has had a difficult time getting the job done, even though he's been working hard to improve his game and improve on his defensive record. This time around, however, things are not looking good for him and he is not happy with how things have gone so far. As a result, his side are struggling to stay in contention in Germany's second division, despite the fact that they are still in first place in both the league and in Europe. "
,"Reference text": " Bayern's Klinsmann Praises, Hoeness Attacks Hoffenheim The Bundesliga's two top teams don't play until Friday, but the mind games are already underway. Bayern's coach Juergen Klinsmann says Hoffenheim are legitimate contenders, but commercial manager Uli Hoeness disagrees. When the Bundesliga scheduled Bayern's home match against Hoffenheim in the league's unloved Friday night slot, they probably didn't imagine that it would turn out to be the match of the first half of the season. Indeed, few experts or fans thought that Hoffenheim, a first-division debutante located in a southern German village with 3,000 inhabitants, would give mighty Munich a run for its money. But it's the first week of December, and Hoffenheim top the table by three points. They also have a much better goal difference than their second-placed rivals -- and that has drawn praise from Bayern's coach, Juergen Klinsmann. "I have the highest estimation of Hoffenheim because they've built the squad very ambitiously, rationally and with very good players," Klinsmann told DPA news agency. "They can be proud of that." Klinsmann said he thought that the club could establish itself among the top three or four sides in Germany in the years to come and qualify for international competition next season. He also had words of praise for Hoffenheim's software billionaire patron, Dietmar Hopp, whose money has funded the club's ascent. "There's nothing negative about it," Klinsmann said. "He used to play for the club, is a soccer man through and through and helped the team get on its feet." Some fans have criticized Hopp and Hoffenheim for paying inflating salaries and luring talent away from other clubs instead of developing homegrown players. In fact, Hoffenheim's official salary budget is about average for the Bundesliga. Hoeness sounds his horn But while Bayern's coach was praising his opponents to the skies, Munich's commercial manager Uli Hoeness has been trying to play with their heads. On the heels of Bayern's convincing win over Leverkusen last weekend, Hoeness is back to taunting rivals. "The performance we showed in the second half against Leverkusen will be enough against Hoffenheim," Hoeness told the German soccer magazine kicker. Hoeness also dropped a none-too-thinly-veiled hint that Hoffenheim's personnel expenditures were far higher than the officially released figures and scoffed at the idea that strategy would determine the outcome of Friday's match. "Games are decided by the better players, not by tactics," Hoeness said. "And of course, we've got better players than Hoffenheim." But that particular verbal attack may represent some wishful thinking of the manager's part. Hoffenheim coach Ralf Rangnick is one of only two current Bundesliga skippers with a winning record against Munich. Rangnick, whose team cruised past Bielefeld last weekend to keep Bayern three points back, reacted to Hoeness' remarks with a shrug. "We're preparing for Munich exactly the same way we did against Bielefeld," Rangnick said. In any case, soccer fans in Germany know what they'll be doing Friday evening -- finding a bar with cable sports television to watch a top match that no one, before the start of the season, would have considered possible.

"We are very happy with the outcome," said ZEC chairwoman Priscilla Chigumba, adding that she was "very happy" with what she saw as a fair and transparent process. However, she added, "we are still waiting for the final results to come in and we will see what happens in the coming days and weeks." The election commission, which is run by the Zimbabwean opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC-Z), announced that it would hold a special election in Harare on Saturday to decide who will be the next president of Zimbabwe. It is the first time Zimbabweans have voted for a president since Robert Mugabe was ousted in a military coup in 2002. In the run-up to the vote, Zimbabwe has been in turmoil since the military seized power in an attempt to restore democracy and restore the rule of law. On Thursday, the opposition's leader, who is widely seen as the most popular candidate in Zimbabwe, announced his intention to run for president. He said he would seek a second term in office, but that he did not want to give up on his dream of becoming prime minister. DW's Elmar Brok reports from Zimbabwe: "There is no doubt that the elections are going to go ahead as planned," he told DW. But he added that there was no guarantee that Zimbabwe would be able to elect a new president after the polls closed. There is also a question of how long it will take for Zimbabwe to see a winner emerge from the deadlock between the two main opposition parties. Some observers believe that this could take longer than expected, given the fact that both parties have a long history of fighting each other and that they have been fighting for independence for many years. What is certain about Zimbabwe is that elections will not be held on the same day as they were last year. This is not to say that all the candidates will win, however, it is true that some of them will have to wait until the end of their political careers before they can run again. For example, former president Robert Mutsvangwa was the only candidate to win the 2002 elections, and he is now running for re-election. nmj/rc (Reuters, AP, AFP, dpa, Reuters) nmavm (AFP, Ejmagrcagmawati, ejlagagati) (AP, DPA, ijjagai, jmwagau, indp, klm, njh, bjw, rjk,jrc,dpa) The first round of voting was held in early 2008 and the second round in mid-2008, with only a few days left before the general election is due to take place. At that stage, there had been a lot of speculation about who would take the oath of office and who might be next in line to succeed the former military ruler. That speculation was dismissed as "fake news," but it has since been disproven by a series of media reports, including the BBC. According to a report in The New York Times, a number of opposition candidates have already announced their intentions to enter the race. Many of those who have campaigned against the incumbent president have said they are not interested in running again, while others say they would rather stay in power. They have also said that if they do not run, they won't be allowed to return to their former positions in government. So far, only one candidate has made it onto the ballot paper. And that is a woman who has not yet been elected to parliament. She is running against a man who was once a member of parliament and vice-chairwoman of a parliamentary group of women's rights groups.

,"Reference text": " Emmerson Mnangagwa declared winner in Zimbabwe presidential election Zimbabwe's electoral commission has declared Emmerson Mnangagwa president with 50.8 percent of the vote. Calling the results "fake," opposition candidate Nelson Chamisa has vowed to launch a legal challenge. The electoral commission announced the presidential election results province by province, declaring ZANU-PF candidate Emmerson Mnangagwa president by the closest of margins. The announcement came after clashes between opposition protesters and soldiers in Harare left at least six people dead on Thursday. The unrest marred what had been billed as an important milestone in Zimbabwe's efforts to return to democracy following 37 years of repression under longtime leader Robert Mugabe. In a press conference on Friday, Mnangagwa said there would be an independent investigation into the post-election violence. He also called on the opposition to help him bring about peace and unity, declaring that he would serve all Zimbabweans, including those who didn't vote for him. "Here was a celebration of Zimbabwean democracy, a festival of unfettered freedom. With the eyes of the world on us we delivered a free, fair and credible election," he said. Opposition challenges results Mnangagwa, 75, won 50.8 percent of the vote, ahead of Nelson Chamisa of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) party with 44.3 percent, the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) said. Chamisa, 40, has dismissed what he called "unverified fake results," and said the MDC planned to challenge the outcome of the "rigged" election. But the ZANU-PF youth spokesman, Tonderai Bosha, told DW on Friday that the opposition would not accept an election loss. "The opposition is saying we rigged the election. That has been the narrative during the campaigns, before the elections," Tonderai said in Harare. "What they only wanted was victory on their side. If it's victory on ZANU-PF side, it's not victory." After the first four of 10 provincial results, Chamisa's MDC had a lead of about 50,000 votes over the ruling ZANU-PF. But after the fifth province was announced, the lead had switched to Mnangagwa. He quickly took to Twitter to hail what he called "a new beginning." To become president, a candidate has to take more than 50 percent of the vote. Chamisa did well in urban areas, but Mnangagwa outperformed him among rural voters. Chamisa said police raided opposition headquarters in Harare and seized computers. The search warrant indicated they were looking for unlicensed firearms, grenades and stones. Police said 16 people in the offices were arrested. Riot police later briefly disrupted a press conference where Chamisa was scheduled to speak. The opposition indicated it would challenge the result in the courts. "What they have been trying to do of late is to play around," Chamisa told reporters hours before the final results. "That is rigging, that is manipulation, trying to bastardize the result, and that we will not allow." Other results announced by the electoral commission: The ruling ZANU-PF party won 144 of the 210 seats in parliament — a two-thirds majority which enables it to change the constitution. The opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) took at least 61 seats. Observers highlight flaws Elmar Brok, chief observer for the EU's election monitor mission in Zimbabwe, told DW that the vote was marred by a "lot of shortcomings in favor of the ruling party," including through "financing, state media, intimidation, especially in the countryside." Late Friday, the US said it was reviewing the election results. "The United States will continue to review the data collected by its own observation teams, by international observation missions and by local observers to make a complete assessment of the overall election," the State Department said in a statement. It urged all sides to act peacefully and called on the political parties "to show magnanimity in victory and graciousness in defeat." Zimbabwe Electoral Commission chairwoman Priscilla Chigumba has denied allegations of bias and strongly disputed accusations of rigging.

Despite reports that the vote had gone off peacefully, international observers voiced concerns about irregularities and a lack of trust in the polling process. Officials also criticized the delay in announcing the results of the presidential race, saying it had undermined the vote's credibility.

German is the second most common word in the German language, followed by French and Italian. In the US, the word 'German' is used to describe a language spoken by a German speaker or speaker. It is also used for a variety of other languages, such as Russian, Chinese, Korean, Russian and French. The Germans have a long history of using German as a foreign language. They have used it for many years, but it has become more and more difficult to translate into English. For example, when I was a student in Germany, I had to learn to read German in order to understand the meaning of German and to be able to interpret it in a way that made sense to me at the time. Now I can understand why German speakers are more interested in English than in French speakers. But I don't know why. I think it's because the Germans are very good at it. And I'm not sure why they would want to use it as an instrument for their own purposes. What do you mean by that? I mean, if you can't read the English language then you have no idea what you're talking about. That's not to say that German isn't a great language or that it doesn't have any meaning at all. There are a lot of languages out there, and there are lots of different languages and cultures that can be used in different ways. However, there is one language that is particularly important for me, which is German: "Germans." This means that Germans can use German to communicate with each other, rather than just to talk to one another. This is a very important language for Germans, because it means we can communicate more effectively. We can also communicate through German than we could with French or French if we want, so that's a good thing for us. Germans also have an important role to play when it comes to their language and culture, as well as in how they speak English and in what they do in foreign languages. So, for instance, we have German-speaking speakers who can speak German fluently and understand German quite well, while English speakers can only understand French flu flu better than English flu. Thus, it is important to us that we understand what German means in terms of our language fluency and our culture in general, especially when we talk about the language we use in particular, particularly in relation to the languages we speak, in which we are trying to express ourselves and how we feel about our country and the way we communicate in this language: We use the same language as we do with English or Spanish flu, or we just use different words and phrases and so on. These are the two languages that are important in our communication. You can read more about them here and here. Read more: German vs. French: What does it mean to you: The language you are using in your language is very different from English: It means something different for you than it does for them: You are saying that you understand English but you also know that English is different than French in that sense and that means you speak a different language than you do for yourself: you know, you say, "I understand that this is something that I understand," but also understands that French is not the case for German but rather for the French speaker, who understands English well and who knows what is going on here in practice: 'This is what I want you to do here,' he said, adding that he wants to know what he means by this, he wanted to clarify this: He wants this to mean that the speaker is saying something about himself and why he is doing this.

},{"Generated text": " Syrian National Coalition to Hold Geneva Talks The Syrian National Council (SNC) is set to hold a meeting in Geneva on Friday, 24.01.2014. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is expected to sign a peace deal with the opposition. The SNC, which is backed by Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Turkey, will hold talks in the Palais des Nations, Geneva, Switzerland, on the sidelines of the Geneva peace talks. Syria's government has said it will not accept the terms of any deal. "We are not going to accept any terms," Syrian deputy foreign minister Faisal Mekdad told reporters at the end of a two-hour meeting with UN mediator Lahkkdar Brahimi. He added that the Syrian government would not agree to a deal that would allow for the withdrawal of all opposition forces from the country's north and south. However, he said, there would be no talks without a ceasefire, and that there was a "very good chance" of an agreement being reached. In a statement, Syrian opposition leader Ziad Malki said he was "confident" that a truce was possible, but that "there was no agreement." "There is no guarantee that we will be able to reach agreement," he added, referring to the agreement reached between the two sides on Syria and the cessation of hostilities in 2005. But he also pointed out that no deal had been reached with Turkey or Turkey in regard to Turkey's role in Syria, adding that Turkey was also not a party to any agreement. 'No deal' The Geneva talks have been going on for more than a year and a half now, with no progress being made on a number of key issues, including the implementation of UN peace accords, as well as the resumption of talks on Syrian civil war. At the beginning of this year, the UN had called for an end to all talks between Damascus and its allies in order to prevent a repeat of 2005's failed attempt to oust President Assad from power. Now, however, it appears that talks are moving on to other issues. On the one hand, Syria has been in a state of crisis since 2005, when the government in Damascus announced that it would no longer allow the use of chemical weapons in its fight against the rebels. Meanwhile, in Zurich, a delegation of European mediators is meeting to discuss the future of Syria. It is the first time the United Nations has held a Geneva-based peace conference since the fall of Assad's regime in 2011. There is still a long way to go before a resolution can be reached, according to diplomats in Switzerland and in Turkey. And it is not clear how long the talks will last. Some observers believe that they will continue until the ceasefire is in place. That is, unless the parties agree on some sort of agreement on how to proceed with negotiations. Others say they are willing to wait and see what the outcome of these talks looks like. They say it could be years before they can reach a conclusion. This is a very long time coming. I don't think we can say for sure. We are still waiting for a decision on whether or not we want to continue the process of negotiations, or whether we'll continue to negotiate. What is certain is that all parties have agreed that this is an important step forward in their efforts to resolve the conflict. So far, we have not seen any breakthroughs in this regard. As far as I know, none of them have made any progress on that front. If they do, I think they have a lot of work to do. One thing is for certain, they won't do anything until they get to Geneva and then they'll have to talk to each other about what they're doing. You can't just talk about it in English and say, 'We're not talking about Syria.' That's not the way it's supposed to be, that's what we're trying to get done.' But that doesn't mean that Geneva is ready to give up on talks with Assad and his regime. Let's just say that if it does not happen, then the negotiations are over. For the most part, this will take place in an open and transparent manner. "
,"Reference text": " Inching towards direct talks on Syria They came to hold talks, but started negotiations with mutual affronts. But if there is one person who might be able to mediate between the intransigent Syrian conflict parties, it's Lakhdar Brahimi. Lakhdar Brahimi, the United Nations special envoy for Syria, seemed very tired on Friday (24.01.2014). He had had a long day, which was actually supposed to be the first real day of negotiations at the Syria Conference in Geneva. "Good afternoon," Brahimi told the assembled international press, before adding, "or good evening, I don't know." At the Palais des Nations in Geneva, he presented the most important result of his attempts to mediate between the Syrian government and the opposition to the more than 250 journalists who had managed to get a coveted place at the press conference: "Tomorrow we expect and we have agreed that we will meet in the same room." What Brahimi is declaring an achievement doesn't sound like much, but considering how irreconcilable the conflict parties have been, even that can be seen as a small success. Separate talks with Brahimi The two delegations were actually due to meet on the first day of negotiations in Geneva in order to agree on a timetable and on the subject and agenda of the talks. But emotions are running too high on both sides. Instead both delegations held separate talks with Lahkkdar Brahimi, both lasting just about an hour each In the morning. The Syrian government delegation had apparently been threatening to leave the conference. At least that is what the deputy foreign minister Faisal Mekdad had implied. "We are here to start the negotiations," he told waiting journalists, "but we found that the other party did not want to come." Before the conference, the opposition had explained that for its delegation, the formation of a transition government would be a central tenet of the negotiations. They emphasized that this topic should be discussed right at the beginning of talks and that the establishment of such a body should be initiated without delay. Social media and good old propaganda The representatives of the Syrian National Coalition that were present in Geneva neatly used all imaginable channels to make their views public. At #Geneva2, they tweeted: "Forming a transitional body is our major priority," leaving people in no doubt that the Syrian National Council would not want to include Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Assad's government, on the other hand, is relying on classic propaganda and loyal state media representatives in Geneva. An impressive entourage of dominant journalists from state-run media outlets is constantly at hand, accompanying the government delegation and making sure they get their point across at press conferences. Lakhdar Brahimi even had a small altercation with a journalist from a Syrian state news agency, who made a political statement under the pretense of asking the UN mediator a question. "Are there any signs that Saudi Arabia, Turkey and other countries would stop the support of terrorism in Syria?," she asked in somewhat shaky English, before Brahimi interrupted her. "Please, please, there is no point in asking such questions!" Such exchanges hint at the type of negotiating style the experienced diplomat and mediator Brahimi must have behind the scenes. 'Wish us luck' Lakhdar Brahimi described the preliminary talks that took place in Geneva as encouraging and asked for patience. He said that because the peace conference had come about at the last minute and the delegations had therefore only been appointed very recently, there hadn't been enough time to hold preliminary discussions - a task that the delegations were now catching up on. "We never expected it to be easy and I'm sure it's not going to be," he said. "But I think the two parties understand what is at stake. Their country is in very, very bad shape." He added: "The huge ambition of this process is to save Syria. Nothing less than that." After appealing to the willingness of both parties to negotiate, he simply added: "So wish us luck!" Fight for freedom As the official delegations held talks with UN mediator Brahimi in the Palais des Nations, the European headquarters of the United Nations, hundreds of Syrian expatriates who had come from all over Europe protested outside, forming a sea of red, white and black Syrian flags on the Place des Nations. With their presence outside the UN gates they wanted to show that despite all the government propaganda, the Syrian National coalition has a lot of support from the Syrian people. Thirty-two-year-old Ziad Malki came to Geneva from Zurich to show his solidarity. Ziad knows how it feels to be deprived of his freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. In 2005, he was arrested at a demonstration in Damascus and says he was tortured during his time in prison. Now he is fighting for a new Syria from outside the country's borders. Ziad is sure that with Bashar al-Assad and his family, there will be nothing new. "We don't want this man to be in " 

},{"Generated text": " Italy's migrant crisis hits EU hard Italy's migration crisis has hit hard, with the European Union (EU) and the United Nations calling for an end to the flow of migrants into the Mediterranean. The EU's refugee commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos said on Thursday that Italy would not accept migrants from Libya. "Italy is the only country in the EU that is willing to accept refugees," he said in a statement. Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni, who has been in Rome since the beginning of the year, said he was "deeply concerned" about the situation in Libya, which he described as a "dangerous situation." "We are deeply concerned that the Libyan government is trying to impose its will on the people of Italy," the prime minister said, adding that "it is unacceptable for the Italian government to continue to deny migrants access to Europe." The European Commission said it was working with Italy and other EU member states to find a solution to this crisis. Italy is one of only a handful of countries in Europe that has refused to allow migrants to enter the country, according to a UN report released in 2014. It said Italy was among the first countries to refuse asylum to migrants seeking to reach Europe. In 2014, Italy rejected more than 1,000 requests for asylum from the UN, the report said. Since then, Italian officials have been seeking asylum in Austria, Switzerland and Italy. At the same time, EU Commissioner for Migration Filippo Grandi said the bloc was looking at a number of options, including a return to Greece, a possible relocation of asylum seekers from Eritrea, or the possibility of an EU-wide agreement on asylum for African migrants. He also called on Italy to take a more active role in dealing with migrants, saying it would be "a very difficult task" if it did not have the resources to deal with such a situation. On the other hand, he added, "It is a very important issue for us to be able to work together in order to address this issue." Italy has long been the most vocal critic of Libya's illegal migration. Last month, it rejected a request from Greece to resettle asylum-seekers in Italy, accusing Italy of being "incompetent" in its efforts to prevent the influx of people fleeing war-ravaged countries. But Italian authorities have also rejected the request, arguing that it is "unacceptable" that migrants should be allowed to leave their homes in countries where they have no legal basis to do so. According to Italian Foreign Minister Pavlo Pavlovici, this is not the case at the moment. There is also the issue of whether Italy should accept asylum requests from other European countries, such as France and Switzerland, as well as the African countries that have rejected asylum applications in recent years. However, there is no evidence that this has led to an increase in arrivals from Italy or Greece. As a result, some Italian politicians have called for a re-evaluation of their country's position in international affairs. They also want to see a change in EU policy on migration, especially in light of what they see as an increasing threat to European security and stability. This could lead to new measures to tackle the problem of mass migration and increase the burden of refugees. A new European Asylum Support Office has also been set up in Ventimiglia, an Italian city near the Greek border, to coordinate the work of EU and EU officials on how to cope with this new influx. If Italy does not comply with EU rules, then it will have to face the consequences of its own actions. For example, if Italy fails to act on its obligations under EU law, its EU citizens will be sent back to their home country of origin. That would make it even more difficult to deport people who have fled war and persecution in their own country. So far, so good, but it's not clear how long Italy will take to implement the new rules. What about other countries? "I don't think we will see any change at all," said Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini in an interview with Italian news agency Tutti d'Italia. "
,"Reference text": " Italy's navy to patrol with Libyan ships to curb human trafficking Italy wants to work more closely with Libya to limit the number of sea crossings by migrants and potential asylum seekers. But what are the consequences? Italy's prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni, does not want to wait any longer for EU countries to show solidarity in distributing asylum seekers throughout the bloc. On Thursday he announced in Rome that the Italian navy would be patrolling with Libyan ships just off the Libyan coastline. The aim, Gentiloni says, is to curb human trafficking and bring migrants back from the smugglers' boats to Libya. According to the Italian government's figures, 93,000 migrants have arrived in Italy so far this year. At least 2,000 have drowned in the attempt to cross the Mediterranean - the true figure is unknown. Italy has already threatened to stop allowing boats carrying rescued migrants to dock in Italian ports, or that it may issue migrants with documents that would allow them to travel on to other European countries. Rome has not yet implemented either policy, but the government has made clear that Italy will soon run out of options. The EU Commissioner for Migration Dimitris Avramopoulos acknowledged, again, in Brussels on Thursday that "Europe continues to face high migratory pressures. And Italy more than (almost) any others." The European Commission issued a letter offering more aid and personnel to help manage migration better. Accommodation will soon be full The office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, wrote at the beginning of July that "Close to 200,000 accommodation places are available for refugees and migrants across [Italy], but are nearly all full." The High Commissioner referred particularly to the numbers of people dying when he warned, "What is happening in front of our eyes in Italy is an unfolding tragedy." The United Nations anticipates that another 100,000 migrants will come to Italy via Libya before the end of this year. The number of arrivals is already 20 percent higher than last year; and the number of dead, those who could not be saved, would rise accordingly. According to UN estimates, the Mediterranean remains the "deadliest" refugee route in the world. Italian government statistics say that around 600,000 people have arrived in Italian ports since the start of the crisis in 2014. It is unclear how many have since traveled on to Austria, France or Switzerland. Once migrants are registered in Italy and accommodated in camps, they are not held there. If, however, they leave the accommodation without giving notice, they forfeit their claim to subsistence and social services. Most of the migrants are from African countries, and many try to travel on to France, for example. 300 people are currently sleeping on the beach in Ventimiglia, on the French border, hoping to take a bus or train to France. However, the border is being policed by French officials. Migrants who are caught are sent back to Italy. Austria has announced that it too will close its border with Italy if the number of migrants starts to rise. Repatriation and distribution are difficult Last year 120,000 new asylum applications were made in Italy. Around 50 percent of these are rejected. The asylum seekers are then supposed to leave the country. However, the process of people either returning voluntarily or being deported is very slow. The interior ministry has therefore announced that it will reinforce repatriation programs. The redistribution of asylum seekers from Italy, as agreed by the European Union, is well behind target. Two years ago the aim was to resettle 120,000 people. So far, only 24,676 people have been redistributed, the EU Commission said on Thursday: 7,873 from Italy, and 16,803 from Greece. The numbers are low not just because of the reluctance of other EU countries to take the refugees in, but also because of Italian delays in the registration of possible candidates. Asylum seekers from Eritrea are the most likely to fulfill the criteria for redistribution. Around 25,000 are currently living in Italy, but only 10,000 have been registered with the EU Commission and the European Asylum Support Office as possible candidates. Migration Commissioner Avramopoulos has announced that Italy will be given more help and logistical support in this area. "

Berlin is the host city for this year's tournament, which will take place at the Brandenburg Gate in central Berlin. There will also be live coverage of the opening ceremony, as well as the final match between Germany and Russia. "The tournament is a great opportunity for women to showcase their talents," said Berlin's mayor, Thomas de Maiziere, in an interview published on the German news agency Deutsche Walle. It is also a chance for Germany to demonstrate its commitment to the sport, with the participation of women from all over the world, including the U.S. and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). "We are very excited to be able to participate in this tournament," added the mayor. However, there is still a long way to go before Germany can take part in its first major sporting event in 20 years. For Germany, it is an opportunity to show that it can compete with other countries, and that is why we are so excited about this competition. We are also looking forward to seeing how the women will perform in their final matches. What do you think? What are your thoughts on this event? Do you have any thoughts? Are you a fan of FIFA or a member of its governing body? Did you enjoy watching the games last year? Was it a good experience for you? I don't think so. I think it was a lot of fun to watch the game, but I didn't enjoy it as much as I would have liked to have had it been a little bit more fun. That said, I do think that there are a few things that are important for us to consider. First of all, we have to remember that this is our first FIFA tournament. And secondly, what do we expect from the competition itself? We expect to see the best of both worlds. This is what we've been waiting for, right? And then there's the fact that we're going to play in front of a very large audience. So we'll see how it goes. But first, let's take a look at what's going on around us. Is there anything we can do to improve our chances of winning? That's a big question. Do we want to make sure that our fans are happy? Is this something that they can enjoy? Or is it something we should be proud of? If not, then we will do something about it? Let's see what happens when we get to know each other better. In the end, that's what I'm hoping for. If we do that, you'll be happy with us, because we all know that the fans will enjoy the experience of playing together. You'll also see us competing against one another in our final games, so that means that you can be a part of something bigger than just a couple of hours of football. Which is really important because it's an event that has a huge impact on people's lives. Who knows, maybe we could even win a medal? But that would be the most important thing for me to do as a person. Because I've always wanted to compete against other people, to win something big. To win that trophy, for example, is something I'd like to say that I have done in my career. Then I'll do it again and again. Maybe I can win the trophy. Or maybe I will win it all. Whatever the case may be, who knows what the outcome is? It depends on who wins the prize. Either way, if we win or we lose that prize, or it will go to a different place and then it'll all go back to square one of those two games. All that matters is that everyone wins. After all this has happened to me and I won't lose anything because I lost everything. Everything that happened in football is important. "

"We mourn the loss of one of our most beloved artists," he said in a statement on Tuesday. The death toll from the Carnival music festival in Port-au-Prince has risen to at least 22, according to the Associated Press and Reuters news agencies. On Tuesday, the country's president, who has been in office for more than a year, announced that he would step down from his post as president of Haiti on Carnival grounds. He also said that the government would not allow the band to return to Haiti, which is home to Carnival's biggest festival, to perform at the Champ de Mars festival on the island of Hainaut. Police said the group had been killed in an attack on a police station in the southern port city. A police spokesman said a man was killed when he tried to enter the festival grounds, but police said it was not clear whether the man had died of a heart attack or a gunshot wound to his head. Authorities have not said how many people were killed or injured in Tuesday's attack. Pfd/rc (AP, Reuters, AFP) and AFP, meanwhile, reported that police had detained several people in connection with the attack, including a member of the Haitian government's security forces, and that they were being held in custody for questioning. Officials said they had not yet received any information about the incident. In a post on Twitter, President Francois Hollande said he was "deeply saddened" by the death, adding that "it was a very sad day for our country." The president also condemned the attacks, calling them "an act of war against humanity." "I am deeply saddened by what has happened," the president said. Speaking to reporters, Hollande also called for the release of scores of missing members of his own security detail, as well as a number of people believed to be in critical condition. Several people have been reported to have died in recent days, with many of them in serious condition, while others were hospitalized with serious injuries. Many of those who died were not identified by name, saying that their deaths were the result of "a very unfortunate event," according the AP news agency. Hollande has also been criticized for failing to act quickly enough to prevent a repeat of last year's deadly attacks on police officers and soldiers. However, he has promised to make the situation under control under his watch a priority priority for his government. During the past week, Haiti has had a series of violent attacks against police, soldiers and civilians. Some of these attacks have resulted in death and injuries to dozens of officers. At least one officer was seriously injured when a bullet hit a patrol car in front of him, killing a woman and injuring several other people, officials said on Wednesday. Other officers suffered minor injuries, authorities said, although they did not say what caused the bullet to hit. It was unclear whether any other injuries were reported. pfd-rc, AP, CNN and the AFP were unable to independently verify the report, citing unnamed government sources, because the investigation was still ongoing. Earlier this month, French President Nicolas Sarkozy ordered a special prosecutor to investigate the killing of two people at a port in Haiti. According to a government statement, "the investigation is ongoing and will continue until the end of this week." In an apparent attempt to quell the violence, a military spokesman told reporters that troops had entered the port and were on their way to reinforce security there. But the military said there was no evidence of an imminent military intervention. Military spokesman Major General Jean-Claude Dujardin said police were still searching for those responsible for Sunday's attacks. Defense officials have denied any involvement in those attacks and said no one was in danger of being killed. They have appealed for witnesses to come forward and say they have no information on what happened to those killed and injured. There is also speculation that there may be an ongoing investigation into the shooting of another man. Investigators are still trying to determine if there were any links between the two attacks or if they are related. "

},{"Generated text": " North Korea's Kim Jong-un to visit China The North Korean leader is expected to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing on May 13. The two leaders will hold talks to discuss the North's nuclear and missile programs. North Korea is set to host a meeting of the world's two largest economies, the People's Armed Forces (PAS) and the Chinese Communist Party (CPC). The meeting is scheduled to take place in Kangwon Province, which is home to the country's largest city, Yeonpyeongdo. According to Kim Kyok-sik, who heads the PAS, it will be the first meeting between the two countries' leaders since the end of last year's Korean War. "We have a lot of work ahead of us," Kim said, adding that the meeting would be "very important" for both sides. In the past, Pyongyang has been accused of using nuclear weapons to attack South Korean troops stationed on its border with the Republic of Korea. However, Kim has denied this accusation, saying that he has no knowledge of what is going on. He has also denied that Pyongyang is planning to launch a nuclear attack on South Korea, accusing the South of being behind the missile program. Kim also denies the allegations against him, calling the accusations "baseless." Kim's comments come just days after the United Nations called on Pyongyang to halt its nuclear program and to stop its missile tests. On the same day, Seoul announced that it would suspend all nuclear tests on the Korean peninsula for the next two years, citing a "serious lack of progress" in the talks. But Kim did not back down from his threat, and said he was willing to work with China to find a way to resolve the issue. “We are not going to give up on this,” Kim told DW in an interview, referring to his country’s nuclear arsenal and its ballistic missile defense system, as well as the Musudan, a missile-defense system used by the US and other countries to defend against nuclear attacks. Both Kim and Kim have said that they will continue to cooperate with each other in their efforts to end the nuclear standoff, but Kim is unlikely to agree with Kim on any of these points. It is not clear whether Kim will agree to a truce, or whether he will accept the terms of an end to talks with Pyongyang. If Kim does not accept a ceasefire, then Kim may not be able to reach a peace agreement with his regime. That is a big problem for Kim, because he is the only person who knows what to do about the situation in his own country. And Kim doesn't seem to want to talk about it at all, even if he does know what he's doing. So Kim says he wants to see a peaceful resolution to this conflict, not a war between North and South. What's the point of all this? Kim tells DW: "I don't think there is any point in talking about a deal. I think it's just a matter of time before the negotiations are over. We have to wait and see what happens." The talks between Kim Yong-nam and Jun Okumura have been taking place since February, when Kim met with Xi at the invitation of Kim in Pyongyang's presidential palace. They have also been held in secret for a month, in a secret meeting that was supposed to be a chance for North Koreans to learn more about their nuclear programs and how they are being used to develop their weapons of mass destruction. Since Kim was still in power in November 2010, there has not been a breakthrough in negotiations between Pyongyang and Beijing, although there are rumors that Kim might be planning another nuclear test in April. There are also rumors of a possible nuclear war in China, though Kim hasn't said for sure. For now, however, he seems to have no plans to make any concessions to Pyongyang, despite the fact that his government has already agreed to an arms embargo in exchange for his release from prison. This is another problem that has plagued Kim since he took over the leadership of his father's regime in late 2010. As Kim sees it, this is an important step for him to move on from the regime he had been in for so long. At the time of their meeting in early 2010 Kim had not yet decided whether or not he wanted to sign a new nuclear deal with Beijing. Now Kim seems determined to get the deal done. His government is also looking at ways to improve relations with Seoul, Beijing and Washington. Last year Kim signed an agreement to resume nuclear cooperation with Washington in return for Pyongyang agreeing to freeze its weapons program for three years. "
,"Reference text": " Is China seeking regime-change in North Korea? The sudden reduction in aggressive rhetoric and actions by North Korea has led to suggestions that Pyongyang has realized it has pushed its only ally in the region to the brink of severing its friendship. The announcement in Pyongyang on May 13 of the promotion of Jang Jong-nam to "minister of the People's Armed Forces" came out of the blue. Until recently, the little-known commander of an army corps in coastal Kangwon Province, Jang has replaced Kim Kyok-sik, a four-star general with a long track record of loyal service to the regime. The reasons for 70-year-old Kim's replacement are not clear - as with most of the political maneuvers in North Korea - but it may have been his loyalty that cost him his position in the politburo. Kim was widely seen as a hawk in the regime and is believed to have been in command of the operation to shell the South Korean island of Yeonpyeongdo in November 2010, an incident that killed four people, destroyed civilians' homes and infrastructure and dramatically worsened the already strained relationship between Pyongyang and Seoul. By sacrificing Kim, analysts believe, North Korea is signaling that it is backing away from the confrontational stance it adopted after the United Nations imposed new sanctions in the wake of the nation's third underground nuclear test in February. And there are other indicators that Pyongyang is seeking to return to the status quo. The North's troops have been permitted to step down from the highest state of preparedness for war that was initially ordered when South Korea and the US began a series of annual military exercises. Missiles withdrawn Similarly, two Musudan intermediate-range missiles that were identified as being on mobile launchers being operated in eastern areas of the country have apparently been ordered to return to base. In late April, there was concern that test-launches of the missiles would be a further escalation by Kim Jong-un's government and a message that it would not bow to international pressure to halt its nuclear and missile development programs. But the analysts believe the tokens of Pyongyang's goodwill have come too late. "For the North Korean leader, this is a very difficult time," Toshimitsu Shigemura, a professor at Tokyo's Waseda University and an authority on North Korean affairs, told DW. "Timing is very important here and it is possible that China is moving to abandon Kim Jong-un. The atmosphere between the two nations is changing. China may have decided that it is time for a regime-change in the North, they will not permit the collapse of the country because they do not want chaos on their own borders." Further evidence that Beijing is slowly tightening the screw on its erstwhile ally comes as more state-run financial institutions sever their links with banks in North Korea. The latest institution to adhere to the government's orders to halt transactions across the border is the Bank of China, one of the four major banks in the country, which announced on May 7 that it would cease dealings with the Foreign Trade Bank of North Korea, which has been identified as being involved in Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs. Contingency plan in place Intelligence sources have passed on to DW information that Beijing has a contingency plan in place for when Kim Jong-un's control over the country crumbles. The reports confirm that China is indeed quietly encouraging regime change and is grooming Kim's brother, Kim Jong-nam to take over his role. At 42, Kim Jong-nam is the oldest son of Kim Jong-il, the dictator who ruled North Korea with an iron fist for 17 years until his sudden death in December 2011. Kim Jong-nam had been expected to assume the leadership after his father's death, but fell from favor spectacularly in 2001 when he was detained with two women and a boy aged 4 at Tokyo's Narita International Airport travelling on a forged Dominican Republic passport. He later admitted that he had wanted to visit Disneyland. He subsequently lived in Macau and Beijing, under the close watch of the Chinese authorities. The reports suggest that after Kim Jong-nam is installed in Pyongyang, his brother will be permitted to go into exile, probably in China. The tactic is not without its pitfalls, however, in part due to the efficiency of the campaign to deify their young leader as the future of the nation. Kim Jong-nam as 'new king' "China may be dreaming of appointing Kim Jong-nam as the new king - and he is more preferable to the West than Kim Jong Un - but the problem is that he is not known in North Korea," said Ken Kato, director of Tokyo-based Human Rights in Asia. "Many people in Japan know much about the North Korean 'Royal Family,' but this information is hidden in North Korea," he said. "Even residents of Pyongyang know very little about Kim Jong-nam." Yet the reports are gaining credence among North Korea-watchers. Jun Okumura, a political analyst with the Eurasia Group, told DW that North Korea withdrawing "

The US homeland security secretary is expected to attend the G20 summit in the southern Mexican state of Chihuahua. "We are very concerned about the safety and security of our citizens," said Kelly, who was to hold a press conference with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto in Ciudad Juarez, the capital of the Sinaloa state, on Wednesday. US officials said they were "very concerned" over the death toll from the drug lord's death, which has been rising since last Friday, when he was killed by a US Black Hawk helicopter during a shootout with police in his home town of Las Varas, near the border with Mexico. Mexican officials have said that they have no reason to believe that the killing was carried out in retaliation for the US decision to extradite the notorious drug trafficker to US custody in January. In a statement, Mexican authorities said it was the first time they had seen evidence of a murder committed by an American citizen since the beginning of this year. They said there had been "no indications that there was a connection" between the two murders and that US authorities were looking into whether or not the murder was linked to a drug trafficking ring. On Wednesday, US Secretary of State John Kerry said the investigation into the killings was "ongoing and ongoing." "The investigation is ongoing and we are hopeful that we will be able to establish the full extent of what has happened," he said, adding that "it is a very serious matter." In his remarks, Kelly also said he would not rule out the possibility of an extradition request from Mexico, where the former US president is currently serving a 10-year prison sentence for his role in helping Mexican drug kingpins. He also called on the Mexican government to cooperate with international law enforcement agencies in their efforts to crack down on drug traffickers. Last Friday's meeting between US and Mexican security officials came just days after US Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced she would be stepping down from her post at the end of next month. ipj/ng (AFP, AFP, dpa)In an interview with the Associated Press, Trump said: "It is very important for us to make sure that our country is safe and secure. We are going to do everything we can to prevent this from happening again." He added that his administration would continue to work closely with other countries to ensure that Mexico does not become a "hostile state" for its drug cartels. Trump's visit to Mexico is the latest in a series of US-Mexican talks aimed at shaking up the country's political and economic relations. It comes as Trump prepares to travel to Germany later this week for talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni in Hamburg. At the same time, he is due to visit the German capital, Berlin, next week, as part of his planned trip to the United States for a summit of world leaders in Germany and the European Union, in which he will meet the leaders of Germany, France, Britain and Italy.

First of all, we have to address the security situation in our own country, and this is one of them. Second, there's the issue of who is responsible for financing the operation. This is something that's been going on for quite some time now. I think it will take a long time before we get a clear picture of where Mexico stands on this issue, but I'm sure we'll find out soon enough. And finally, let's talk about what's next for Mexico in terms of security. Is there a way to get the president to step down? I can't think of any other way than to say, "I'm very worried about this," Trump told the AP. "

Smuggling has prompted a visit to Mexico City by US Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly. Prosecutors said the remote town of Las Varas in Chihuahua state was the scene of Wednesday's battle between affiliates of the Ciudad Juarez cartel and a gang from the state of Sinaloa. Police said fighting escalated when patrols arrived. Fourteen people were found dead; 12 others were hospitalized. Grenades, launchers and rifles were found. The mountainous region is used as a corridor for smuggling into the US. El Chapo effect Chihuahua security commissioner Oscar Alberto Aparicio said a Black Hawk helicopter was called in as police chased surviving gang members through the area known for marijuana and opium poppy production. Two police officers had been killed in a "cowardly" way in the area a week ago, he said. In a similar incident last Friday, 17 gunmen were killed during a shootout with police on a highway in Sinaloa, Mexico's northwestern state. Sinaloa was the home base of Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, whose extradition to the US in January apparently left gangsters in a struggle for control of criminal syndicates. Homicides have surged in recent months, with the number of persons killed in May put at 2,186, the highest since the collection of such statistics began 20 years ago. Nieto and Kelly to talk In Mexico City Wednesday, President Enrique Pena Nieto's office said he and visiting US Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly had discussed how to rein in organized crime groups. "Shared responsibility" must become the focus of transnational efforts, Kelly said. Narcotics smuggling into the US has become a multibillion-dollar (multibillion-euro) business for Mexican drug cartels.

The military said the attack was the result of a "terrorist attack" carried out by the Islamist militant group "Boko Haram." The attack took place on October 15, a day after the military launched an operation to quell the insurgency in northeast Nigeria. Police said they had arrested more than 30 people, including four members of an Islamist group, who were believed to be responsible for the attacks. "We are still investigating the circumstances of this attack," said Femi Falana, an army spokesman. He added that the army had not yet made any arrests in connection with the operation, which he described as "a terrorist attack." "This is the first time that we have seen this type of attack in our history," he said, adding that he was not aware of any other attacks in which civilians had been killed or injured. Borne's military has said it will continue to investigate the incident, but it is not clear whether the attackers were planning to carry out attacks on civilians. In September, the Nigerian military declared a state of emergency over the conflict, saying it would not allow the militants to return to their stronghold of Maiduguri, where they were killed in clashes with security forces on September 15. According to a military statement, there was no immediate claim of responsibility for any attacks, and that there were no reports of civilian casualties. However, military spokesman Ibrahim Idris said in a statement that a number of attacks had taken place since the beginning of October, with one of them being a suicide bomber who was shot dead by troops in Cameroon. rg/bk (AFP, AP, dpa)It is unclear how many people have died or were injured in attacks by Islamist militants in Nigeria's northeast. It is also not known whether there have been any fatalities in recent months, although there has been speculation that some of those killed may be linked to the group's activities. There have also been reports that several people were wounded in an attack on a police station in northern Nigeria last month, according to local media reports. On Wednesday, police said one person was killed and three others injured when a car bomb went off near the border with Cameroon, killing two police officers and injuring several others. At the same time, security officials have said there are no indications that militants are planning attacks against civilians, as they have not been able to do so for some time. They are also concerned about the security situation in other parts of Nigeria, such as Chad, Niger and Chad where the fighting is taking place and where there is a lack of coordination between the two countries' armed forces and the armed groups fighting alongside each other in their fight for control of their respective regions. This is despite the fact that Nigeria has a long history of fighting Islamist groups in its northeast and northern regions that have fought alongside the Nigeria army in fighting against them for years and which are now fighting for their lives in various forms of armed conflict in both the north and south, in addition to bombings and kidnappings of civilians and other crimes against humanity and human rights violations. For the past two years, Nigerian troops have struggled to contain the extremist group. Since the end of August, thousands of soldiers and civilians have fled to neighboring countries in search of refuge and protection from the violence. Last year, about 100,000 people died in conflict-torn northeastern Nigeria after a series of bombings, attacks and attacks that killed more people than they could count on. Many of these attacks were blamed on Islamist extremists, leading to fears that more attacks could be imminent. But the latest attacks came just days after Nigeria declared an end to its war on terrorism and a new round of airstrikes against the jihadist group was launched by Nigerian forces in response to an air strike by Cameroon's air force and air strikes on the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIL). The attacks have killed hundreds of people and displaced thousands more since they began in August and September.

The case has highlighted the army's problems with equipment and morale. The men sentenced to death on Wednesday were part of the special forces division ordered in August to retake three towns in Borno state, which had been taken over by the Islamist Boko Haram insurgents. Their lawyer, Femi Falana, said the 54 men were sentenced to death by firing squad and five had been acquitted. They were accused of conspiring to commit mutiny against the authorities of the 7th Division of the Nigerian army, which is on the frontline. The trial began on October 15 and was conducted behind closed doors. It is subject to approval by top military officials, but there has so far been no indication that senior officers oppose the court martial. They were not available for comment afterwards. There was a similar case in Nigeria in September, when 12 soldiers were sentenced to death for mutiny after firing on their commanding officer in the northeast city of Maiduguri. The 7th Division, based in Maiduguri, leads the offensive but there are numerous reports of troops refusing to deploy. Soldiers have regularly complained that they lack weapons, food, and other basic supplies to fight the Islamists, who are reported to have tanks, rocket-propelled-grenade launchers, and other heavy weaponry. Boko Haram has taken a number of towns and declared an Islamic caliphate in the region near the border with Cameroon. The Nigerian military has in recent weeks claimed to have made progress in recapturing lost territory. Thousands of people have been killed since the Islamist uprising began five years ago.

The 53-year-old will be leading Germany's second biggest lender. After successfully weathering the Great Recession, Commerzbank's board of directors appears to want to signal a continuation in its growth trend with Martin Zielke's appointment as the new CEO as of May 1. Outgoing head Martin Blessing announced last year he would not renew his contract. Zielke had previously been put in charge of implementing reforms in the company's private banking sector following the recession. His restructuring measures attracted 800,000 new customers to the bank and changed the image of the 146-year-old financial institution. The 53-year-old has an illustrious career across several German financial institutions to look back on, having started at the teller of a local branch in 1983. Zielke's crowning achievement The beleaguered German financial institution recorded a profit of more than a billion euros (more than $1.1 billion) last year. It was the first time in five years that Commerzbank had made such profitable gains, which it said would translate into paid dividends for shareholders. A good portion of the yields were achieved by a restructuring and expansion drive of Commerzbank's private banking arm under Zielke's leadership.

The virus has already spread across several European countries, including France, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Portugal. Health Commissioner Androulla Vassiliou told the European Commission on Monday that there was a "significant increase" in the number of cases of the disease in 2007, compared with 2001. "We have seen a significant increase in cases in Europe," she said, referring to the outbreak in France and Italy that killed more than 1,000 people in 2001, according to figures released by the Commission. In addition, there were a total of 2,500 cases reported in Germany, the EU's second-largest economy after the United States, which is the world's largest economy, and a third of its population in Russia, Germany and the Netherlands. There was also a rise in infections in Ukraine and Russia. However, it was not enough to prevent the spread of this virus. According to a report published by France's Public Health Agency (PSA) in June, a new outbreak was detected in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. It was the first outbreak since 2007. dfm/AFP Editor: Chuck Penfold The Commission said it had been unable to find a single case of HVV in other EU countries. But it did find one case in Portugal, where a virus was found in a man's blood and he died of a heart attack. That case is thought to have been linked to an outbreak of hvvV (HIV), which spreads through the blood of infected people and causes severe liver damage and death. This outbreak is believed to be caused by a combination of factors, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol and high triglyceride levels, as well as the presence of high levels of HIV in people who have never been exposed to it. Experts have warned that this could lead to outbreaks of other diseases, particularly in developing countries like Ukraine, Russia and Ukraine. They have also warned of possible outbreaks in countries that have not yet been immunized against the infection. And the commission is currently examining whether there is a risk of infection among people living in EU states and countries with high HIV levels. Last year, health officials said they had found no evidence of any new cases, but that they were concerned about the possibility of new infections spreading across EU member countries and that the current outbreak could be a sign of things to come. 'We need to act now' The commission's report also said that if there are new outbreaks, EU health ministers would have to step up their efforts to identify and prevent them. At the same time, they would also be able to make recommendations on how to deal with cases where there has been a surge in infection in European states, in particular in Spain and in Italy. These recommendations would be made available to EU Member States and EU nations that do not have the resources to combat the problem of human infection by introducing new vaccines and immunization measures. Many of these measures have already been implemented, with the most recent being the introduction of anti-vaccination measures in Greece and Bulgaria. Dfm and AFP Editor-in-Chief: Chuka Liyansova The report said the new measures were necessary to protect the public from infection and to reduce the risks of future outbreaks. Although the report did not specify a specific outbreak, "it does not appear that we are in any danger of becoming infected," it said. For example, if a case were to spread from one country to another, then it would not be the case that a vaccine was introduced in that country. If the vaccine had not been developed, that would mean that people would no longer have access to certain vaccines. Additionally, European health commissioners have expressed concern over the potential for outbreaks to occur in neighboring countries where they are not allowed to take part in vaccination campaigns. As a result, some countries have begun to introduce new vaccination programs in order to help prevent outbreaks from spreading to their own populations. Some countries are also considering introducing vaccine-based immunizations, while others are looking for ways to limit the use of vaccines in their territories.

In a document on combating AIDS, the Commission said that as of 2007, around 2.2 million people carried the virus in the EU and nearby countries, an increase of 700,000 from 2001. According to Commission figures, around 730,000 of these live within the EU's 27 member states. France, Italy, Spain and Portugal have relatively high infection rates - ranging from 0.4 percent to 0.5 percent. In the Baltic country of Estonia, the infection rate stands at around 1.3 percent. In neighboring Ukraine, around 1.6 percent of the population has been diagnosed with HIV, while in Russia around 1.1 percent are HIV positive. The Commission warned that now was not the time for Europe to drop its guard on preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS, adding that in some neighboring countries the number of people carrying the virus had doubled. EU Health Commissioner Androulla Vassiliou said political momentum in the fight against HIV/AIDS needed to be maintained, adding that people must "take responsibility for themselves and their partners by talking about and practicing safe sex and going for HIV testing." A cure for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has yet to be found more than a quarter century after it was brought to public attention. However, efficient treatments exist to slow the evolution of the virus. dfm/AFP Editor: Chuck Penfold "

Ban said on Monday that Nepal should end the practice of using the term "maoist" in its name. "We are calling on the government of Nepal, the Prime Minister, to stop using this term," Ban told a news conference in Kathmandu. He added that the UN would continue to monitor the situation in Nepal. UN spokesman Martin Nesirky said the meeting would take place on Tuesday, but that it would not be the first time Nepal had resorted to such a term. Bhattarai, who has been in power since 1996, is a member of the Nepali Communist Party (NCP) since 2006. The party was founded in 1996 by a Hindu sect, which is opposed to Maoism. It has since been banned by the Communist party. In 2006, it was banned from holding any political office until 2008. rc/msh (AFP, AP)The UN said in a statement on Sunday that there was a "serious lack of political will" from the party and that its leadership was "deeply concerned" with the current state of affairs. A spokesman for the Nepal government told the Associated Press news agency that "the party is deeply concerned about the political situation of this country." "The party has a long history of violence against the people," the spokesman said, adding that he was not aware of any such incidents in recent years. However, he said there had been "a number of incidents" over the past two years in which the group's members have been fighting each other, including in 2006 and 2006 when they were both killed in an attack on a police station in Dhaka, killing four police officers and injuring more than 100 others, according to a Reuters report citing unnamed sources close to the leadership. Ruling party leaders have also been accused of plotting attacks on UN peacekeeping forces in Afghanistan, Iraq and Pakistan, as well as in several other countries, such as India, Syria and Iraq, where they are believed to be involved in human rights abuses and are suspected of supporting the Taliban insurgency in their home country, Nepal has denied allegations of involvement in such attacks. Authorities have said they have no evidence to back up the allegations, however, and have not ruled out the possibility of an investigation into the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Nepalese civilians in last year's crackdown on anti-Maoism protests.

But it has also warned that such actions could lead to an increase in violence, particularly in rural areas, especially in areas where there are large numbers of people living in poverty and where the population is under threat of starvation and other forms of extreme poverty. On Sunday, UN special rapporteur on violence and security said that a ceasefire agreement was in place between the two countries to ensure that no civilian casualties were caused by attacks by armed groups in 2008 and 2009, when the violence was reported to have killed at least 1,500 people in two separate attacks in southern Nepal in November and December, a day after the disputed disputed presidential election in disputed areas of disputed territory claimed the lives of several dozen people and injured dozens more in clashes between security forces and police and army personnel in northern Nepal and neighboring states, Reuters reported Monday, citing a UN statement quoting UN officials. Author: Ramesh Kumar Singh The statement said: "This is not an isolated incident, this is an unprecedented incident. There are many other incidents that have taken place across the world. These incidents are not isolated to Nepal but are part of a broader pattern of events that are taking place throughout the year. We have seen many incidents where people were killed or injured in these incidents. This is something that has not been seen before and we expect this to continue for many more years to come," Singh said. "

It's the world's first beer made exclusively in the country, and it's one of Germany's best-known beer brands. The beer is made from a variety of ingredients, including beer, wine, cheese, beer and wine. There's no shortage of beer in this beer. But it also has a reputation for being the most expensive beer on the market, with a price tag of €1,000 (around $2,500) per bottle. That's a lot of money for a beer that's only available in a few German cities. And the beer isn't cheap either. In fact, it costs more than $10 a bottle to make. You have to pay a premium to get it, which is why you can't buy it in other countries. This beer has been called the "German beer of choice" because of its high price and the fact that it can be used in many different countries, such as Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Russia, the United States and even the Soviet Union. "The beer tastes like beer," says the company's president, who is also a member of the German beer industry. He's also known for his beer-making prowess, as well as his willingness to drink beer with his wife and children. A beer can can also be bought for €2.50 (about $3.99) or $5.00 (up to $7.95) at the same time as a wine can for $1.90.   The company also sells beer at a lower price than other beer makers, but it doesn't have a "beer can" or "wine can," which means it won't be able to compete with beer or wine at all. All of this is to say, "We're not the only beer company out there that has beer cans in their stores," said a company spokesperson who declined to give his full name, saying it was "too expensive" for him to use. However, he did say that he was happy with the product and said he'd be happy to sell it to anyone who wanted to try it. I'm not sure if this will be a good thing for beer drinkers, or if it will just be another beer for people who don't want to go to beer bars anymore. What's more, I think it'll be good for everyone who wants to buy beer but also for those who want something that tastes better. We're talking about beer here, so we'll see what we can do about that. If you want beer we're going to have beer there, we've got beer everywhere. Beer is a big part of that, too. Wine is another thing that can only be served in beer if you're willing to take a sip of it and drink it with your friends and family. More beer? We'll have more beer when we get home, of course, because it tastes good and tastes really good.Beer is not just beer - it has to taste good, you know? You can even have it at home in your house, where there's beer all over the place and you'll get beer every night and then you get to enjoy it when you go out to dinner and watch it all the time. Everything else is fine, however, unless you have something else on your plate that you really need to do, like wine or beer (or beer). And that is what beer should be all about, right? Beer? Well, that would be beer! You know what I mean when I say beer makes you happy? It makes me happy! And it does make you feel good! Beer has always been a very good beer too, even though beer was the main drink for me. Now that I've had beer I can drink all day long and I really enjoyed it! It was a great beer though and we had a really great time drinking it - and that was really fun! We had some great beers and some good wine! "

It is a one-crust pie, eaten in most German wine regions during the fall wine season. Zwiebelkuchen is traditionally eaten with Federweisser, a young wine available in Germany in the fall. The link between the two is so strong that many Federweisser wines have a recipe for the onion cake on their labels. Here's a recipe for it: Ingredients: 1 packet yeast, active dry 1 teaspoon sugar 1 1/2 teaspoon salt 3 cups unbleached flour 1 tablespoon shortening 1 cup water (49 to 54 C / 120 to 130 F) 6 slices bacon -- diced 2 medium onions -- sliced 1/4 teaspoon cumin 1/2 teaspoon salt Pepper 1 egg yolk 1 cup sour cream Mix the yeast with the sugar, a teaspoon of salt and half a cup of flour. Blend in the shortening and warm water, then beat for two minutes. Add enough flour to make a soft dough, and then knead the dough until smooth and elastic, about five minutes. Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, then cover it and let it rise in a warm place for 30 minutes. Pat the dough into a lightly greased 12-inch pizza pan or onto a lightly greased baking sheet. Press up the edges to make a slight rim. Fry the bacon until crisp and drain it on absorbent paper. Add onions to the bacon grease, and cook slowly until tender, but not brown. Sprinkle the onions, bacon, cumin, half a teaspoon of salt and pepper over the dough. Bake the cake at 204 C (400 F) for 20 minutes. Blend the egg yolk and sour cream and pour the mixture over the Zwiebelkuchen. Bake it for another 10 to 15 minutes, until the cake is golden brown and the sour cream has set.

},{"Generated text": " China's Uighurs: How to cope with the influx of Middle Eastern migrants The Han Chinese have long been a minority in China. Now, they are a majority of the country's Muslim population. In Xi'an, however, the situation has changed dramatically. Today, there are more than 1.5 million Muslims in the city, and the number is growing. There are also a number of minorities who have migrated to China from the Middle East, including the Hui people. This has led to a rise in tensions between the Han and Muslim communities, which has resulted in an increase in migration to the Chinese mainland. "The Han have become more and more isolated," says Dru Gladney, a professor of Chinese history at Pomona College in Yinchu, China's largest Muslim-majority city. But this is not the first time that this has happened. During the 7th century, it was common for Muslims to migrate to other parts of China, where they would have to settle for a better life. At the time, this was the norm, but now it seems that it is no longer the case. Since then, Chinese Muslims have come to be known as the "Hijab" or "Muslim Brotherhood," which is a term for the Muslim Brotherhood. They have also become increasingly isolated in their own country, with many of them fleeing persecution and persecution in other countries, such as Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Egypt, Libya and even the Philippines. These are all very different ethnic groups, according to Haiyun Ma, who teaches at the University of California, San Francisco. He says that he has never seen anything like this in his life, even though he was born into a Muslim family and grew up in a family of Muslim parents. His father was a Han Muslim and his mother was an Arab, so he came from a very wealthy family in Ningxia. The family is now part of a large Muslim community in western China that has been growing rapidly in recent years. It has become a major source of income for many Chinese families, as well as a source for foreign exchange. And it's not just the Muslims who are being persecuted by the authorities. For example, in Shanghai in 1950, Muslims were forced to convert to Islam in order to live in harmony with their Muslim neighbors. That's a big difference from today, when Muslims are persecuted for their faith. So, what does this mean for them? It means that they have a lot more to offer than they used to, because they don't have the money to do it. What does it mean to them to stay in this country? Well, for one thing, I think it means they want to go back to their home country of Xinjiang and learn the language and culture of their homeland. I'm not sure if that's what they're looking for, or if they just want a place to call home. If they can't find it, then they should go to another country and start a new life there. As far as I can tell, that is the only way to get a good education in Chinese. You can also get an education there, if you're willing to give up your religion and become an expert in your field of study. However, you also need to learn how to speak Mandarin, Arabic, Persian, Mongolian, Arab and other forms of Arabic. How do you know what you are doing? Do you have any idea what the future holds for you? What kind of future is it going to bring? I would like to think that the next generation of Muslims will be able to make a living from learning Arabic and learning Persian and Arabic as they grow up. Maybe they'll have more opportunities to practice their religion. Or maybe they won't be so lucky and they will have enough time to develop their skills and talents. Either way, we'll see how long it takes. DW: Did you hear about the Hajj? Did anyone know about it? The Hajja is an annual pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia.

,"Reference text": " The Hui - China's preferred Muslims? While the Muslim Uighurs are increasingly being persecuted, the largest Chinese-Muslim minority, the Hui, are under less scrutiny and thriving as a religious community. DW examines the reasons behind this phenomenon. Walking through the Muslim quarter of Xi'an is a fascinating venture into a hodge-podge of cultures. The smell of lamb skewers and hot spices wafts through the crowded streets. Chinese-looking women in headscarfs stretch noodles, while an old man with a white prayer hat stands in front of a mosque with a distinctly Chinese arched roof. This is the home of the Xi'an Hui Muslim people, where Islam was introduced to China for the first time in the 7th century. China's Muslim population now numbers 23 million, of which over 10 million are estimated to be Hui, and a little under 10 million Uighur. While their fellow Muslim Uighurs in the Xingjiang Uighur Autonomous Region are experiencing severe restrictions on their religious freedoms, the Hui mostly practice their faith openly, and in certain areas are enjoying a resurgence in their religious participation. The reason for their success has to do with centuries of remarkable assimilation, while also maintaining their identity. A history of assimilation Historically, the Hui people are descendants of Persian, Arab and Mongol merchants on the Silk Road, who came to China over 1,200 years ago. Since then, intermarriages with the Han Chinese have meant that the Hui became ethnically mixed and spread across the country. Over the centuries, the Han and Hui have lived relatively peacefully next to and with each other. The Hui took the path of assimilation, speak Mandarin and adapted their religious traditions to the local customs. One of the most visual examples of this is the great mosque of Xi'an, said to be one of the largest and oldest in China. The place of worship is built up of multiple courtyards and sports arches and tiled roofs that clearly show influences of traditional Chinese architecture. While some Hui now live a life culturally and religiously indistinguishable from Han Chinese in first-tier cities such as Shanghai or Beijing, many cities in China have a significant Hui Muslim minority population with close-knit communities, especially in the northern provinces of Ningxia, Gangsu or Quinghai. Traditionally traders, many Hui people are also economically successful today, and according to estimates, their religious participation is growing. Increasing religiosity Dru Gladney, professor at Pomona College in California and leading scholar on the Hui people, estimates that today there are twice as many mosques in China as there were in 1950, of which a majority were built by Hui Muslims. "The amount of practising Muslims among the Hui is rising," Gladney told DW. "For example, there is a dramatic increase in the number of Hui women wearing the Hijab." Gladley adds that "the numbers of Hui going on the Haj are going up constantly." One of the reasons for this is the increased communication with other Muslim groups and the ensuing influence of outside Islam – either through Hui scholars returning from the Haj or from increased business relationships with the Middle East. Trade between China and the Middle East is growing ever more important for the communist country. As a measure to attract Arab business, Yinchuan, the capital city of Ningxia and one of the Hui hubs, has gotten a makeover. Construction of a new $3.7 billion Islamic theme park called World Muslim City is underway, and Arabic lettering has been added to the city's street signs. Haiyun Ma, a Hui scholar at Frostberg University takes a critical position with regard to the Chinese government's perceived friendliness toward the Hui. She told DW that it is more of a sign of "business interest, not of religious tolerance." On the business side, Hui Muslims do play a role as middlemen in trade between the Middle East and China. Because of their knowledge of Arabic, numerous Hui people are working in Dubai, and for Middle Eastern businesses in China. Keeping out of politics Another reason for the Hui's relative freedom are the characteristics that distinguish them from the Uighurs. The second-largest Muslim minority is ethnically distinct, and does not speak Mandarin as a first language. Most importantly, they have a homeland that they wish to claim. The majority of Uighurs live in the far-western province of Xinjiang. Many of the ethno-religious group seek independence from China, and the Uighurs as such are oppressed for it. During this year's Ramadan, they were forced to break fast and parts of their community were not allowed to attend prayers or travel. Most recently, all citizens of Xinjiang were ordered to hand in their passports. But the Hui, partly also due to their diversity and geographic diaspora, and partly because of their cultural closeness to Han Chinese, have no political aspirations of independence, Gladney said.

The German champions are back in the top flight after a three-game winless streak. They have a tough task ahead of them on Saturday afternoon, when they travel to Hamburg to take on the Dutchman's side. Bayern have lost three of their last four matches in all competitions, including a 2-1 defeat to Hannovers in September. On Saturday, the Bavarians will be looking to bounce back from a 3-0 defeat at home to Borussia Dortmund, where they lost to their first-ever Bundesliga defeat. In the first match of the season, Bayern will have to settle for a draw after losing their opening two games in a row. That's not a bad result for Bayern, who have struggled to find consistency in their form this season. But it's also a step up from last season's second-place finish, which saw them drop points in both the league and the Champions League. "It's a big step forward for us," Bayern coach Jürgen Klopp said after the match, adding that he was "very happy" with his side's performance. He also said that Bayern would be happy with the way they have been playing in recent weeks, and that they will continue to work hard to improve on their recent form. Javi Martinez and Adelino Vieirinha are the only two players to have scored a goal in each match since the end of September, with both of those goals coming against Mainz and Nuremberg. Aigner, meanwhile, has been in fine form in his first season in charge, scoring three times in four Bundesliga matches. His first goal came on a free kick, but he also had a couple of good chances in front of goal. It was his second in as many games, as well as his third in two Bundesliga seasons, that made him the most important player in Bayern's squad. For his part, he has made a name for himself as a central defender, playing a key role in Dortmund's recent success. At the same time, Martinez has played a crucial role for his club, helping them to a 4-2 win over Nürnberg. And he's the man Bayern need most to get back on track in Germany, having scored twice against Dortmund and Bayern last month. As a result, they are in good position to qualify for next year's World Cup in Russia with a chance to make it to the quarter-finals. However, there is still a long way to go before they can qualify. There is a lot of work to be done to ensure that the German side can reach the semi-final stage. If they do, it will only be a matter of time before Bayern are able to secure a place in Europe's top-four. After all, Germany have already qualified to play the last 16 games of this campaign, so they should be well placed to do so. So far so good, in fact, at all levels of European football. Even if they don't qualify, their chances of reaching the semifinal will depend on how well they perform against their opponents. Last season was a difficult one for them, because they failed to win a single match in which they were eliminated from the competition. This year, however, things are looking up. Not only did they fail to perform well against the Germans but they've also lost a number of key players, such as Mario Mandzukic, Robert Lewenkopf and Christian Eriksen, to injury. Now they're in danger of being knocked out of Europe altogether. German coach Klaus Allofs is hoping to avoid a repeat of his disastrous season last year when he took charge of Bayern in mid-September, only to see the club drop to third place with just one win in seven games. Meanwhile, Dortmund are still in contention for qualification, despite the fact that their top scorer, Franck Ribery, is yet to score a Bundesliga goal for their club. Germany's most promising young player, Mario Gomez, could be the next big thing to come to Germany. Although he hasn't scored in over two years, Gomez has already made his way into the starting line-up and is expected to start at right-back this weekend. "
,"Reference text": " Bayern blast five as Schalke draw Bayern Munich stamped their authority over the Bundesliga on Saturday, with a ruthless 5-0 drubbing of Hannover at home. Meanwhile, second-placed Schalke and third-placed Frankfurt were forced to share the points. With many critics saying Bayern might as well be given the giant Bundesliga dish already, perhaps the struggle for second is shaping up to be the more compelling battle. But Saturday afternoon's clash between second-placed Schalke and third-placed Frankfurt did not take a decisive turn, with the game ending in a 1-1 draw. Schalke drew first blood in the 11th minute, when Frankfurt's Stefan Aigner was dispossessed in midfield, and Lewis Holtby released Klaas-Jan Huntelaar in front of goal - the Dutchman's first in the Bundesliga since September. But the hapless Aigner waited just over 100 seconds to make amends for his error, when the Royal Blues allowed him a free header that left goalkeeper Lars Unnerstall with no chance. But neither side could make inroads in the second half, which allowed Dortmund to leap-frog both sides and claim second place. Bayern take command Meanwhile the imperious Bayern Munich dispelled any talk of winter form-dip - following last week's draw to Nuremberg - with a brutally efficient 5-0 win at home to Hannover. The Bavarians stormed to a 3-0 lead in just 37 minutes, celebrating a nifty overhead kick for star signing Javi Martinez in the fourth minute. Toni Kroos and Franck Ribery scored the next two against a Hannover side that were torn open at will. The overhead kick was the first for the 40-million-euro ($52-million) signing Martinez, and in the second half new defender Dante also opened his account with a straightforward header from a Kroos free-kick. The festival of football continued just four minutes later, when Mario Gomez - making first Bundesliga appearance of the season - slammed the ball into the net from a tight angle just 30 seconds after replacing Mario Mandzukic. Dortmund win The champions Dortmund, meanwhile, are still nine points behind Bayern after beating Mainz 2-1 away. It was a potentially tricky fixture in the town where Jürgen Klopp began his coaching career, and Mainz showed their brilliance in the fourth minute, when Elkin Soto knocked a dream ball into the path of Marco Caligiuri, whose volley fairly screamed into the top right corner. Dortmund's own star-Marco - national team player Marco Reus - leveled the scores just eight minutes later. Reus worked himself some room at the outer edge of the penalty area, and slotted a beautiful 17-meter effort into the far corner. And Dortmund's second goal, just before half-time, was equally aesthetic - a vertical ball bisected the Mainz defense perfectly down the middle, where Polish predator Robert Lewandowski got his eighth league goal of the season with a deft lob over the onrushing Christian Wetklo in goal. Allofs' homecoming Bremen's 1-1 draw at Wolfsburg had a special frisson of its own, as Wolfsburg's newly-minted sporting director Klaus Allofs faced the club he had served as general manager for over a decade. And there was some gesticulating from the Bremen bench in the general direction of the Wolfsburg management when the guests took the lead in the 35th minute. Just seconds after Wolfsburg missed several chances, Marko Arnautovic was left free in the box after Eljero Elia found space on the left and cut the ball back for the Austrian to finish. But Wolfsburg got their own back in the second half. In the 62th minute, Bremen were reduced to ten men when Lukas Schmitz was given second yellow card for a hard tackle on Adelino Vieirinha. Just two minutes later, Bas Dost took advantage of their guests' disorgnaization and smashed the ball into the goal after neat piece of play from Vieirinha. Dirty derby The Franconian derby between Greuther Fürth and Nuremberg was a cagey affair that ended in a frustrating 0-0 draw. The first half was marked mainly by a straight red card for Nuremberg's Markus Feulner after an ugly, flying lunge on Stephan Fürstner. But the home side's numerical advantage was short-lived - Sercan Sararer was also sent for an early ice bath after his high elbow on Javier Pinola was adjudged worthy of a second yellow card in the 61st minute. But the aggression in the tackles was not matched by ruthlessness in front of goal, and neither side could eke out any clear chances. " 

},{"Generated text": " Argentina imports Porsche's Porsches from Germany to Argentina The Argentine importer of the Porsche brand, Grupo Pulenta, said on Wednesday that it would import the cars from the country's capital Buenos Aires. According to a report in Deutsche Welle, Argentina is the world's second-largest market for Porsche cars, after Germany's Daimler. In March 2010, Porsche imported a total of 384 million euros ($545 million) worth of Porsche vehicles from Argentina, Germany and the U.S. The move came as the German automaker Porsche announced it was expanding its presence in Argentina. "We are very pleased with the results," Porsche said in a statement, adding that the company would continue to expand its operations in the Argentine market. However, the move comes at a time when Porsche has been struggling to compete with German carmakers Volkswagen and BMW over the past few years. Volkswagen's Amarok, which is based in Germany, is also expanding into Argentina with a new production line. It will be the first time that Porsche will import a Porsche-branded car from its home country. Porsche, however, has said it will not be able to do so until the end of 2010 due to "technical difficulties." The company also plans to introduce new models to the market, including the new Porsche Sprinter. Author: Gerhard Schneibel (dpa) Editor: John Blau The carmaker has also said that in order to meet the growing demand for its products, it is going to have to increase its production capacity by at least 400,000 vehicles a year. This would be a major step forward in its efforts to improve its competitiveness in Latin America. But Porsche is not the only company that is looking at Argentina as a potential market leader. A German company, BMW, also recently announced a plan to buy a stake in Argentine-made cars. BMW and Mercedes-Benz are also looking into the possibility of a joint venture between the two companies, according to German media reports. Both companies have expressed concern about the potential impact of Argentina's economic crisis on the region's competitiveness. Germany has long been a leading supplier of German cars to Porsche and has invested billions of dollars in developing and producing the car. Argentina has a reputation for being one of Europe's fastest growing car markets, with more than 1.5 million cars sold every year since the beginning of this decade. Despite the fact that Argentina currently has the largest market share of any other European country in terms of car sales, there is still a long way to go before Porsche can reach its goal of becoming the global leader in car production. For example, Volkswagen is planning to sell its own brand of sports cars by the middle of next year, in an effort to cut costs and reduce the number of cars it has to produce. Meanwhile, other German companies are looking to develop their own sports car models, such as BMW's M3 and Audi's i3, as well as other sports-oriented models. At the same time, German importers are trying to convince Argentina that its economy is growing faster than that of other major European countries, and that this is an important factor in driving the economy. That's why the government is pushing for Argentina to become a world-leader in electric vehicle production, even though the price of electric cars has dropped by a third in recent years, despite the economic slowdown. And it's not just Argentina: The country has already seen a surge in sales of its most popular sport cars since Volkswagen launched its first electric car in 2010. More than half a million vehicles have been sold to Argentines since then, a figure that has risen to over 1 billion euros (€1.6 billion) in just a few short months. Many of those sales were made in Brazil, where Porsche made its debut there last year in March, when it sold its flagship model to Volkswagen for $1 billion (around $2.2 billion). "The market is very strong," said Porsche spokesman Marco Guglielmi. He added that there was "a lot of pressure" on Argentina over its decision not to import its new car, saying that "there is a lot more to be done." "It's a very big market," he said, "but there are still lots of people who want to get their hands on this car," Günter said. "

Now the country wants to keep a positive trade balance by having the value of the imported luxury cars matched by red wine exports. Porsche is currently enjoying record profits after a two-year downturn, but the export-reliant company has hit a pothole in Argentina. Buenos Aires-based Porsche importer Grupo Pulenta has signed an agreement obligating it to export several hundred bottles of red wine for each car it imports, the Argentine government announced Wednesday. Grupo Pulenta declined to comment when contacted by Deutsche Welle. Job creation During the past year, Argentina has held thousands of high-end vehicles in customs until companies agreed to export goods valued at the same amount. Most of those vehicles came from Germany. According to a spokeswoman for the Argentine embassy in Berlin, the country has been trying to safeguard domestic employment with a positive trade balance. "Our government has negotiated with automakers to balance their imports of cars with an equivalent amount of exports," she told Deutsche Welle in a statement. "Since March 2010 we have been working with the automakers and importers in order to increase local integration and reduce the trade deficit in this sector." Small market A Porsche spokesman said the company sells just short of 100 vehicles into Argentina each year. That compares to more than 40,000 sold worldwide during five months in 2010. "For Porsche, Argentina is a rather small market," the spokesman told Deutsche Welle. "Our importer, the Pulenta Group, also deals in wine. They have their own vineyards and export that wine. It has nothing to do with Porsche - we just have an import contract with them, and it seems they've found an individual solution with the Argentine government." Domestic production Volkswagen, which has an Argentine subsidiary producing the new "Amarok" pickup truck and transmissions, has thus far avoided mandatory exports. The company had reported an export surplus of 384 million euros ($545 million) for this year. Porsche's holding company owns 32.2 percent of Volkswagen, and the Porsche brand is intended to become integrated into Volkswagen's lineup. Daimler and BMW also have subsidiaries in Argentina. While Daimler produces its "Sprinter" there, BMW only imports to the country. According to the Argentine embassy in Berlin, the country has recently sought more domestic production by foreign car companies. Author: Gerhard Schneibel (dpa) Editor: John Blau "

Poland's Deputy Foreign Minister Konrad Szymanski has said he would like to see a change in the rules of the European Union. Polish Prime Minister Viktor Orban has called for a "rule of laws framework" to be put in place to prevent the spread of anti-Semitism among the country's citizens. The EU's rotating presidency is due to convene in Brussels in two weeks' time, with Vice President Frans Timmermans expected to attend the meeting. "The European Parliament is going to have a very important role to play in this," he said on Facebook, adding that he was "deeply concerned" by the Polish government's stance on the matter. He added that the EU would be "very interested" in discussing the issue with Poland if it wanted to make changes to the law. In a statement, the Commission said it would hold an open dialogue with the government of Poland, but that it was too early to say whether the new rules would have any effect on Poland at all. On Wednesday, Poland announced plans to introduce a new law to regulate the use of social media in its dealings with EU member states, including Hungary and the Netherlands, as part of an EU-wide review of EU rules on political, economic and social issues. However, it did not say how much Poland would pay for the reform. ls/jil (Reuters, AFP, dpa)The EU has already begun a process of setting up a special commission to look into the question of whether Poland should be allowed to publish its own rules. It is expected that this will be done within the next few days, if not sooner, than the end of this year, according to a draft draft of a proposed law that would allow Poland to comply with European rules and regulations without fear of reprisals from other EU countries, such as Hungary or the United States, which has been accused of meddling in Polish affairs in a bid to stifle criticism of its government and its policies on human rights and other issues of concern to EU citizens and their families, particularly in light of recent developments in Ukraine and elsewhere in Eastern Europe, where there have been allegations of corruption and abuse of power by members of parliament and government officials, among other things, over the past year and a half of which have led to accusations of political interference and intimidation of Polish officials and politicians, and which are now being investigated by European courts and prosecutors in connection with a number of cases of alleged violations of European law and order, in particular in relation to alleged misuse of public funds by a member state of national wealth and political influence, or as a result of state-owned enterprises.

Is it possible that Poland will become a model country for other European countries to follow in similar steps? ls_jili (AP, news agency) – a policy that was adopted by Poland in response to growing criticism from the West in recent months, a spokesman for Poland told the press, "It is not possible for us to predict the outcome of any particular case in which Poland becomes a European country. We will have to wait and see what happens in that case," the spokesman said, without elaborating on what he meant by "the current situation" or "what the future might look like." The move comes as Poland prepares to host a referendum on its EU membership next year on whether or not it wants to join the bloc's membership, following a vote earlier this month in favor of joining the 27-member bloc. But it is unclear if the referendum will go ahead as planned, given the current political situation in eastern Europe and Hungary's growing influence on EU policy and EU institutions, especially in regard to migration and asylum policy in countries with large numbers of immigrants and young people living in EU states.

The move has been questioned by officials, with some saying it places the EU at-risk of taking sides in an internal dispute. The European Commission's decision to launch the rule of law procedure on Warsaw puts the EU's executive institution at-risk of taking sides, Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Konrad Szymanski told reporters in the European Parliament. "I have the impression that the [European] Commission risks taking a role as a side in a political dispute inside Poland," Szymanski noted. On Wednesday, European Commission Vice President Frans Timmermans - a former Dutch foreign minister - announced the move, marking the first time the EU has used the mechanism. Timmermans said that the move was aimed at entering "into a dialogue with the Polish authorities, to clarify the facts in an objective way and help find solutions if necessary." He added that the procedure is focused on seeking answers regarding the new right-wing Polish government's actions not to apply two judgments by the country's constitutional court, and the reasons behind the president and vice-president's terms were shortened. Preserving rule of law However, Poland's deputy foreign minister said that the European Commission was informed of the reasons behind the government's actions. "We would insist that the questions are phrased precisely because we have provided much information to the Commission in recent days and we are not entirely clear as to what the Commission is still not clear about," Szymanski noted to reporters at the European Parliament. New media laws, giving the government the power to hire and fire senior figures at state broadcasters, were also called into question by Timmermans. The controversial legislation prompted mass pro-democracy protesters in the European country. "The rule of law is one of the EU's fundamental values. Making sure the rule of law is preserved throughout the Union is a key part of the European Commission's responsibilities," Timmermans wrote on his official Facebook page. The Rule of Law Framework was created two years ago as a response to criticism that the 28-nation bloc had not adequately responded to possibly-authoritarian moves taken by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban during his tenure. ls/jil (Reuters, AFP, dpa) "

"The Polish government is going to have to deal with this very serious issue," said the Polish foreign minister, who was in Washington to discuss the matter with US President-elect David Cameron on Friday. The EU's executive arm, the European Central Bank (ECB), said in a statement that it was "deeply concerned" by the allegations, which it said were politically motivated. It also called on the EU to step up efforts to tackle the issue of corruption in Poland, saying it could lead to a "total and complete collapse of democratic institutions." "Polish society is not a democratic society," the statement said. Law and Justice Minister Jacek Rostowski, a former finance minister from the ruling Civic Platform party, said he was concerned about the "unprecedented situation" in which the US had become involved in the investigation into the scandal. He added that he had "no reason to believe that there was any basis for such an investigation," adding that "it would be irresponsible and irresponsible" to try to cover up what he saw as "a serious and serious problem." The US and Poland have long been close allies in their fight against corruption, and the two countries have a long history of working together to fight the problem. In the past, Poland has been the only EU member state without a central bank chief. Now, however, it has become the first EU country without one. Slk/rc (AP, AFP, dpa) and "wprost" (AFP, news agency) Both the British and Polish governments have expressed concern that the case could be brought to the attention of EU leaders in Brussels and Washington, respectively. Polish Foreign Minister Bartlomiej Sienkiewicz has said his country is "not ready to give up its sovereignty" and that Poland will continue to use the courts as a bargaining chip in its fight to end corruption. But the UK government has also said it is willing to take steps to help Poland overcome its own problems, including the ongoing crisis in Ukraine and a possible EU-wide financial crisis. Poland is also expected to hold a referendum on whether or not to extend the terms of its EU membership to include the bloc's member states, as well as the possibility of an EU referendum, if the referendum is approved by parliament. Both sides have said they want to avoid a repeat of last year's vote, when Poland voted to leave the euro. However, both sides say they will not allow it to happen again. On Friday, Polish media reported that a new government in Warsaw was set to be formed, but the government had yet to decide whether it would accept the results of that vote. Slovakian President Andrzej Duda told Polish daily "Slk-rc" that his government would not accept a vote of no confidence from EU lawmakers, adding: "We are not prepared to accept an outcome that is contrary to what we have been told. We have not yet decided whether we will accept this outcome."

SLk and WPA - the main opposition parties - have also criticized the move, accusing it of politicizing the vote and of failing to protect the interests of ordinary citizens. They also accuse the president of trying to undermine the democratic process by making it more difficult for Polish citizens to vote in favor of his own party.

},{"Generated text": " Virroa mites found in Bonn Bees have been finding their way into the beekeeping world for the first time in recent years, thanks to a new study conducted by the university's bee research institute. The study, published in the journal Bee Research Institute (BRI), found that honey bees are becoming more and more susceptible to the varroas mite, an insect that has been spreading throughout Europe since the 1970s. In the summer of 2010, more than 1.5 million bees in Germany were infected with the insect, which has since spread to other parts of the world, including Europe, Asia, Africa, the Middle East and the Americas. "The insect population is growing rapidly," said Dete Papendieck, a bee researcher at the University ofBonn, where the study was conducted, adding that it was "increasingly difficult" to find honeybees that had been infected by this insect. It is also becoming increasingly difficult for honey beekeepers to catch the insects that are spreading from Europe to Asia and Asia. This is due in large part to an increase in insect populations in Europe and in Asia as a result of a rise in bee populations there, as well as the introduction of insecticides and insect repellents. However, it is still not clear how many of these insect pests are actually present in German bees, and whether they are spread across Europe or in other European honeybee species. There are also a number of other insecticide-resistant species that have also been discovered in China, India, China and other Asian countries. These are the only ones that can be detected from the outside, but they can also be found on the inside of bees. They are known to be spread by insects, such as bees and butterflies, or by their larvae. Some of them have even been spotted in European bees as early as 1970, when they were just a few weeks old. But this is not the case for all insect species, according to Dr. Klaus Maresch, who has led the research since 1970 and is currently working on a project that aims to identify and identify the most promising insect candidates. He said that there are a lot of different types of insects which are able to spread from Asia to Europe. For example, he said, "Ais mellifera is a very common insect which can spread very quickly from Asian to European bee colonies." "It is very difficult to detect these insects," he told Deutsche Welle, explaining that the researchers are trying to determine which species are more likely to have spread through the European and Asian bee markets. Mites in India and India The research is part of an ongoing project to study the spread of this mosquito-borne insect and how it might affect the bees' health. According to his research, mosquito populations have increased by about 10 percent over the past five years. So far, however, there is no evidence that this has caused any serious health problems for bees or other pollinators. What is known about the mosquito population however is that they have not spread as widely as they would like to, due to their relatively small size and relatively low population density. That is because they do not have a large population in their native habitats. As a consequence, they cannot be caught by mosquitoes and thus are unable to reproduce. Therefore, in order to protect bees from mosquito bites, researchers have to look for new species of mosquito larvae that could be used as bait for other insects. Author: Gönna Ketels Editor: Nathan Witkop - type-in/large-scale project The project is aimed at finding a solution to this problem. To do this, scientists will need to develop new methods of detecting and controlling mosquito infestations. One such method would be to test the larvae in a laboratory and then test them in an experiment to see if they will be successful. If the results are positive, then the project could lead to further research in this area. A new method is being developed to try and find out how to tackle this issue. Researchers are currently looking at a variety of pest vectors, ranging from insect larvae to insect-infested larvae, to bee-fly hybrids and even to honey-bee hybridization. "
,"Reference text": " Beekeepers battle mites with technology Bees are useful, hard-working and vital for our ecosystem. Aside from making honey, bees pollinate most of our food crops. But summertime is also the season for one of the biggest threats to honey bees – the varroa mite. Dete Papendieck puts on a white veiled protective hat and takes out a metal jug with a beak-shaped spout. He sets fire to the container's contents – formic acid – and starts directing the smoke that is wafting at the beehives lined up in front of him in his garden on the outskirts of Bonn. The acid doesn't harm the bees, but it does kill the varroa mites, he says. And July, after most of the honey has been harvested, is the best time to treat his hives. The one millimeter-large varroa mite is a parasite that infests beehives and lays its eggs in the honeycombs, alongside the bees' larvae. "It feeds on the bees' and the bee brood's blood, the so-called haemolymph," Papendieck explains. A third of bees killed in Germany Papendieck is an apiarist at the Bee Research Institute at the University of Bonn and he knows that the threat of mites is serious. If left untreated, varroa-infested colonies rarely survive a winter. In 2010, German beekeepers lost about 200,000 hives to the mite – one third of Germany's total bee population. And it is not just the honey and beeswax production that are affected by the mite. Many of our food crops depend on bees: Some 80 percent of all agricultural plants and 90 percent of fruit trees in Europe are pollinated by Apis mellifera, the European honeybee. Varroa introduced from Asia Had Dete Papendieck been a beekeeper forty years ago he would not have had to worry about mites. He says the varroa mite that was originally native to Asia, was introduced to Europe in the 1970s. "It happened during a research project in which it was attempted to crossbreed the European honeybee with the Asian honeybee. The researchers were exchanging bee colonies between Europe and India, and that is how the mites came to Germany," Papendieck said. Unlike Asian bee species, the European honeybee cannot fight off the varoa mite by itself. According to Papendieck, bees easily transmit the mite to other beekeepers' hives in what apiarists call robbery. "It happens when certain colonies are being robbed by other bees. Large numbers of bees from different colonies attack weak hives and steal their stocks. At the same time, parasites and diseases are exchanged", he says. Researchers have been trying to breed varroa-resistant mites, but so far they haven't had much success. High-tech tools help fight the mite Klaus Maresch is also worried about his bees. He is an organic beekeeper from Bonn and he has been passionate about bees since he was a little boy. "They are part of my family. When I open my hives and smell the honey and hear the buzzing of the bees it's like being in another world," he told Deutsche Welle. In addition to using formic acid to fight the mite, Klaus Maresch employs a high-tech tool – a special cylindrical scale that helps him determine when it is best to start the varroa treatment. "Every day this hive scale sends data about the colonies to our server. The data, such as the temperature in the hive and the amounts of nectar and pollen collected, help me to find a good day to treat varroa," Maresch says. Maresch also makes the data about the activities in his hives available to fellow beekeepers who can treat their colonies accordingly. A driver's license for beekeepers? But it is not the mite that angers Maresch most. "That's nature," he says, "I feel angry about beekeepers who don't fight varroa. If the bees of neighboring beekeepers are infested, I also have a problem." The existing German pest regulation obliges beekeepers to treat their bees against varroa, but there are no strict controls. The majority of Germany's more-than-80,000 beekeepers are amateurs who keep between one and 20 colonies. This makes it difficult to impose and survey certain quality standards. Maresch, who sees himself as a kind of 'bee activist', would like to see the government introduce stricter rules. "There should be a law that obliges every new beekeeper to learn about beekeeping before they are allowed to keep bees. They should get an education and there should be something like a driver's license for beekeepers," he says. In the mean time, Europe's bees are going to have to " 

},{"Generated text": " EU Health Commissioner Markos Kyprianou calls for tougher rules on alcohol The European Commission has called on the European Union to toughen its anti-alcohol laws. The EU's health commissioner, Peter Hahn, is calling for stricter rules for alcohol use in the bloc. "We need to make sure that we have the right policies in place," he told the German newspaper Der Tagesspiegel, adding that the EU should be more flexible in its approach to regulating alcohol consumption. He also called for a tougher EU-wide regulation of alcohol sales, saying that it could lead to the creation of a "new regulatory regime" that would make it more difficult for people to buy alcohol legally. In a statement issued on Wednesday, the Commission said it was "deeply concerned" by the growing number of cases of underage drinking in Germany, which has led to a rise in alcohol-related deaths in recent years. However, it added that there was no evidence that alcohol was a major factor in these deaths, and that this was not the case in any other EU country where alcohol is banned. Health commissioner Peter Liese, who is also a member of the British Institute for Alcohol Studies (LISA), said the commission's decision was based on "a lack of evidence" and "an unwillingness to take action." "It is clear that Germany is not in a position where we are going to allow alcohol to be sold legally in our country. We are not at a point where it is acceptable to sell alcohol in other countries, but we do not want to do it in this country," Liee said. But, he added, "we have a duty to protect the rights of people who are drinking alcohol." The Commission's statement came as a surprise to German lawmakers who had expected a tough stance from the government on this issue. It was the first time that a European government had taken such a strong stance in favor of stricter regulations. According to LISA's representative Rodolphe de Looz-Corswarem, Germany's consumer affairs minister is "very concerned about the consequences of this policy." He said that he had no doubt that German consumers would not be happy with the new rules, given that they would have to pay a fine of 125 billion euros ($161 billion) for violations of EU law. Lyinge also pointed out that, in addition to fines, there were also penalties for those who did not comply with EU regulations, such as speeding up the sale of alcoholic beverages to minors. These penalties were imposed in 2003 and 2004, according to Deutsche Welle, a German news agency. They were later reduced to 25 percent of German beer sales. This is the second time in three years that European consumers have been penalized for not complying with stricter EU rules. German consumer protection laws have also been tightened, with a total of 25 new laws being introduced since 2003, including the introduction of new taxes on beer imports. Germany has also seen a surge in sales of beer, wine and tobacco products, as well as an increase in prices for domestic and foreign consumers. As a result, more people are turning to alcohol for their own personal consumption, rather than for the convenience of others' purchases. There is a growing concern among consumers that these laws are being used to promote the use of harmful substances, particularly in countries like Germany and the rest of Europe that have high levels of crime and drug use. For example, some people have complained that beer prices are too high, while others say they don't have enough money to cover the costs of buying alcohol. That's not true, of course, because there are many other things that can be done to improve the quality of life in Europe. And it's also true that consumers are more likely to drink alcohol than they are to consume it, even if they're not legally allowed to have it. So, this is an issue that has been brought up in parliament and is being debated by members of both the Green and Green parties. If the bill is passed, then it will be referred to as the "European Consumer Affairs Bill," which would be a bill that could be used as part of an EU bill. "
,"Reference text": " EU Mulls Warning Labels to Curb Alcohol Abuse While still targeting smoking, European Union's public health commissioner is considering adding alcohol to the list of vices the bloc should clamp down on. In a report commissioned by the European Commission, the London Institute for Alcohol Studies recommended raising the legal age to buy alcohol to 18 (in some countries, such as Germany, 16-year-olds can buy beer), lowering the permitted blood alcohol level while driving to 0.5, banning alcohol advertising on TV and in movies as well as adding warning labels to bottles as ways of preventing alcohol abuse across the bloc. Which of the methods EU Health Commissioner Markos Kyprianou actually introduces will be announced "sometime in the autumn," according to a spokesperson. Other options include a 10 percent increase in the price of alcohol. Kyprianou has, however, hinted that he favors warning labels -- similar to those that appear on packs of cigarettes -- that make the dangers of alcohol clear. "Drinking harms your unborn baby" on bottles? Brewers and wine makers across Europe, however, have come out against placing "Drinking Kills" or other labels on bottles of beer. "Warning labels are the completely wrong way to go," Peter Hahn, head of the German Brewers Association told Germany's Express newspaper. "The do not deter people who have lost a sense of how much to drink and unsettle the people who enjoy a beer after work." Industry groups also opposed implementing EU-wide guidelines in countries with traditionally different ways of approaching drinking and drinking problems. "Policies that do not consider cultural and regional differences, will fail to deal with the social problems, while at the same time generate a rising level of political objections," said Rodolphe de Looz-Corswarem of Brewers of Europe. Keeping social vices separate Green party EU parliamentarian Hiltrud Breyer meanwhile called on the alcohol industry to stop "saber rattling" before it sees the a final version of the EU's strategy to prevent alcohol abuse. German Consumer Affairs Minister Horst Seehofer said he would wait to see what Kyprianou's actual suggestions are before commenting. Other German politicians, however, were more willing to voice the opposition to putting a sip of wine on the same footing with a puff of a cigarette. "People should not expect that a skull and crossbones end up on every bottle of beer and wine," German EU representative Karl-Heinz Florenz told Der Tagesspiegel newspaper, adding that when it comes to alcohol, each member state should be responsible for how it deals with alcohol abuse. The harm of "passive drinking" While cigarettes are a health risk from the first puff, moderate drinking can actually be healthy and there is no danger from "passive drinking," Peter Liese, a German EU representative, told the paper. The commission's report disagreed with Liese's conclusion, saying alcohol abuse had a major role in as many as 200,000 deaths in Europe due to car accidents and disease and played a role in some 60,000 underweight births. The report also estimated the effects of alcohol abuse of costing the EU 125 billion euros ($161 billion) in 2003. Some 25 percent of men and 10 percent of women in Europe drink what the EU considers to be more than healthy amounts of alcohol and between 3 percent and 5 percent are suffering from alcoholism, according to EU statistics.

Modi will be accompanied by US Secretary of State Vindu Mai Chotani for the two-day meeting. "We are going to have a very good discussion," Modi said at a press conference in New Delhi, adding that he was "very optimistic" about the prospects of an Indo-US trade deal. He also said that India was looking forward to a "positive and constructive dialogue" with China, which he described as an "important partner in the region." "India is very optimistic about our future," said Modi, who will also be visiting Switzerland, Mexico and Mexico, where he will hold a bilateral meeting with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, and US Vice-President Mike Pence, as well as other world leaders, including the heads of state of Japan, South Korea, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Japan and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). India is also keen to see a resolution to the dispute between China and Russia over the disputed waters. In the past, India has fought a series of proxy wars with Russia, Iran, Qatar and China. However, in recent years, it has become increasingly difficult for India to win concessions from both sides of the conflict. Last year, Washington announced that it was suspending all US military aid to India in response to China's alleged territorial claims against the Indian Ocean. US officials have said they will continue to monitor the situation closely, but they have not ruled out the possibility of a trade war between India and Beijing. A US official told the news agency PTI on Tuesday that Washington had "no reason to believe" that China would use India as a bargaining chip in its dispute with Beijing over disputed islands. China has also accused India of violating the sovereignty of its neighbors, accusing it of harboring terrorists and violating its territorial integrity. Washington has denied the allegations, saying the accusations are "baseless" and "unsubstantiated." The US State Department, however, has said it is not aware of any such allegations and has not made any official statements. It is unclear whether the new US administration will take any action against India or whether it will seek to prevent it from doing so. Both sides have also expressed concern about a possible conflict of interest between the countries. Indian officials say they do not want to be involved in any kind of trade dispute and that they are prepared to take legal action if India does not agree with Washington's demands. They also say that there is a need for a comprehensive and transparent approach to resolving the disputes. This is the first step in a long-term effort to resolve the row between Beijing and India. If India fails to reach an agreement, then it could face a new round of political and economic sanctions from Washington. At the same time, China is likely to try to exert pressure on India through the use of military force in disputed areas, such as the East and West China Seas. According to an official statement issued by the foreign ministry, this could lead to further economic and political pressure from the country's powerful ally, Russia. On the other hand, there are also concerns that the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) could be used to expand its influence in Asia, particularly the Middle East, Africa and Latin America. Chinese President Xi's visit to Andhra Pradesh in 2008 was welcomed by Indian President Ashok Gehlot and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, both of whom are close allies of Modi's. But the visit came just days after China announced a $120 billion (US$2.2 billion) aid package to Pakistan, a move that has been criticized by some quarters as part of Beijing's "war on terror" policy. Beijing has repeatedly denied any intention to use the money for its own economic interests, while India says it wants to protect its national interests and its sovereignty. "

Indian PM Narendra Modi will be in Washington on June 7-8 as part of a whirlwind five-nation tour, covering Afghanistan, Qatar, Switzerland, the US and Mexico. This is Modi's fourth trip to the US after taking office as prime minister, and the Indian leader's schedule in the US capital includes holding talks with President Barack Obama and other top administration officials as well as addressing a joint session of Congress. Modi's trip "reflects the significance that the two leaders place on the natural alliance between the two largest democratic countries of the world," a State Department spokesperson told news agency PTI. The discussions between the two sides are expected to focus on deepening bilateral defense partnership as well as ways to boost US investment into India, particularly in the energy sector. Trade and defense There is talk of a potential multibillion dollar deal with the US electric giant Westinghouse to build a nuclear power plant in the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. If struck, it would mark the first contract reached under the 2008 US-India civil nuclear accord and pave the way for closer cooperation between the two sides in this arena. PM Modi also wants to use the trip to push for increased trade between India and the US, targeting an almost five-fold rise in bilateral commerce from the currently estimated $120 billion to some $500 billion. Furthermore, both sides have expanded military-to-military exchanges, and the US has emerged as a major arms supplier to India in recent years - selling weapons worth about $14 billion over the past five years. There are also reports of both navies looking at ways to cooperate in the area of anti-submarine warfare, in a bid to help each other detect and track submarines in the Indian Ocean. China concerns The broadening and deepening of ties between the world's two biggest democracies comes amid China's assertive rise in the Asia-Pacific region, where Beijing's expansive territorial claims and aggressive stance in the South and East China Seas have alarmed many of its neighbors. India, too, has a long-simmering border dispute with China, and both nations fought a brief but bloody war in 1962. "In light of China's growing assertive behavior, the Modi government has not been reluctant to highlight its convergence with Washington on regional issues," Vindu Mai Chotani, a researcher at the New Delhi-based think-tank Observer Research Foundation, told DW. Indeed, in their recent high-level joint statements, both India and the US repeatedly declared their support for freedom of navigation in the South China Sea. Both nations also highlight their convergence based on democratic values, and respect for rule of law, Vindu Mai noted. In addition, India's engagements with US allies in the region like Japan, Australia and the Philippines have strengthened. At the same time, India and Vietnam have been cooperating on joint oil exploration as well as in the area of maritime security. China has expressed its concern over these developments as well as deepening Indo-US ties, especially on issues such as the inclusion of Japan as a regular member of the Malabar Exercise, a naval drill held annually by the US and India. "The most important takeaway here is that Beijing views Washington's actions, especially in the Asia-Pacific, as the US containment of China," underlined Vindu Mai, stressing that it's therefore difficult for China to see the US engagement with India in a different light. An array of challenges But observers say there are limitations to how far both India and the US are willing to go to forge closer defense ties, despite their mutual interest in ensuring China's peaceful rise. While the US has been pushing for pacts such as a military logistics sharing agreement - which will allow the two militaries to use each other's bases - India has expressed a raft of concerns over these deals, experts point out. "One issue being expressed by Indian policy makers is that the signing of these agreements would lock the country in an irreversible strategic partnership with the US," says Vindu Mai, adding that, "India does not wish to be seen as a strategic ally of the US against China." Furthermore, the US relationship with Pakistan continues to loom large over India-US ties, with New Delhi looking warily at Washington's supplies of aid and armaments - such as F-16 fighter jets - to Islamabad. In the US, meanwhile, there is growing criticism over rising religious intolerance in the South Asian nation and increased restrictions on civil society organizations such as the environmental NGO Greenpeace and the US-based Ford Foundation. Discord over human rights "In the case of US-India relations, the hopeful rhetoric has far exceeded actual, tangible achievements," Bob Corker, Republican Senator and chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told a hearing last month. And during a recent speech in New Delhi, Senator Benjamin L. Cardin " 

},{"Generated text": " Berlin: How to cope with the influx of Syrian refugees from Syria? DW spoke to Jaafar Abdul Karim, a resident of Berlin's Spandau district, who has been living in Syria for more than a year. DW: What do you do when you have to deal with a refugee crisis in your own home country? What does it mean to live in a country where you don't even know what you're doing? The answer is simple: You are not welcome here. You can't live here, but you are welcome in Germany. There is a lot to be said for the refugee situation in Berlin. It's not just that there are so many people in the city who are desperate to get out of Syria, it's also that the number of people who want to return to their home countries is so high, that they have no choice but to stay in their own country. This is not a situation that can be easily solved by simply moving people to a new country, where they can have a better life. In the case of Syrians, the situation is very different from what it was in Damascus and Damascus. The refugee population is much more stable in these countries, and they are more accepting of refugees than in other parts of the world. That's why the German Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (FOMF) has set up a website to help people find their way back to Germany, even if it means moving them to other countries. However, there is still a long way to go before Germany is ready to accept all refugees. For example, Germany's federal office for migration and refugees (DFO) is looking into the issue of whether or not to allow Syrians to leave their homes in order to reach their families. DFO officials are also looking at ways to make sure that refugees who have fled Syria are able to find a place to settle. "I think the most important thing to do is to take care of our families," said DW, referring to the Syrian refugee organization Pegida & Co. (Pegida and Co.) "We are going to try to work out a solution that will allow us to move people back into our country." DW also spoke with one of DW's correspondents, Raafat Hajir, about his experience with Syria. He said that he had never experienced such a crisis before in his life and that this is something he would like to see happen again. As far as he is concerned, Syria is the only country in Europe that has experienced this kind of crisis. But it is also the first time that Germany has seen this type of situation. What is happening is that people are coming back from the Middle East, which is where most of us have been for a very long time. They are returning to Syria because they feel that their country is no longer a safe place for them. So, what can we do about it? We are trying to figure out what we can do to prevent this from happening again, so that we have something to talk about. How do we solve this problem? Do you know how to handle this situation? Are you willing to give up your home and your family? How can you make it work for you? Is there any way that you can make a difference? If so, I think you will find it very difficult to convince people of this. If you haven't already, then you won't have any other option than to just stay here and stay. And that's what I'm doing now. I've been thinking about this for quite some time now, because I have had a couple of months now and I can tell you that I feel very strongly about my decision to come back. Now I know why I didn't do it sooner. Because I was afraid of what would happen if I went back there and tried to bring my family with me. Why would I do that again? Because it would be so easy for me to say, 'I'm not going back here anymore.' But I also know that it will be very hard for other people, especially the refugees, to understand what is going on with their lives and what they're going through right now." "It's really hard to explain to people why we are here in this country and how we feel about what's happening in our own countries," he said, adding that many of them are suffering from a lack of self-esteem and a sense of helplessness.

,"Reference text": " Refugees in Germany: 'I want to integrate, but how?' Refugees are constantly told that they need to integrate. How are they dealing with that task? Impressions from a Berlin refugee home gathered by DW's Jaafar Abdul Karim. "Do you know the word 'integration'?" I ask a young man that I meet in a Berlin refugee home. "No," he says. Then I use the Arabic word "indimaj." He immediately answers: "I want to integrate, to learn the language and become part of society." He continues that, unfortunately, he has no idea how he is supposed to go about doing so. Adham Ali is 21 and comes from Syria. He has been living in Germany for six months. Until a week ago he was living in a gymnasium in the Spandau district of Berlin with 700 other young men. "Now I am in the refugee home all day. I am trying to learn German via YouTube because I cannot find a spot in a language course." I ask if he has any German friends. He replies: "Where and how should I meet Germans?" More than a million refugees came to Germany last year. People like Adham. Many live in a bubble, in refugee housing, cut off from the outside world. They are, however, aware of the fact that Germany is talking about them and their integration. And many realize that it won't be easy. He knows the issue regarding German values, says Adham - about equal rights for men and women, respecting the constitution, accepting homosexuality. He comes from a small village outside Damascus. "The women there all wear niqab," he says, refering to the head-covering veil that only leaves the eyes visible. Apparently there is no one to help people like Adham Ali find a way to reconcile their old lives with their new ones. I had that impression often during my visit to the refugee home. Some, like Adham, are full of hope nevertheless. He says he wants to continue the law studies that he began in Syria. 'I feel lost' Others are frustrated. Like Raafat Hajir, a 24-year-old Palestinian from Syria. "What do you do all day?" I ask him in Arabic. "I get up, have breakfast, hang around, go to the gym," he says. "Can you speak German?" I ask him in German. "Yes," he says, and tells me that when he arrived he took a German class that he paid for himself, but now he doesn't have any more money. He tells me that as a stateless person he has no right to state-sponsored German courses. Obviously no one has informed him that the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF) has just changed that rule. He says, "I am a dentist and could work, but what am I supposed to do? I am not allowed to work here!" He even thought about working illegally, but decided against it. He is stuck in limbo. "What is the plan? What can I do to integrate myself into society?" he asks me. He doesn't have any German friends to help him get a start. "How should I meet Germans? Just approach them on the street?" He says he knows a lot of young men that are in the same situation. A few months ago I wrote about integration in my column, about how unproductive it is that many refugees are not allowed to work for months at a time. Back then I proposed a step-by-step plan for integration. Now, a half year later, I am plagued by the feeling that we are still loitering at the bottom of my proposed "integration pyramid." The refugees are here, but we are leaving them to deal with their future on their own. They are sitting around in refugee homes with nothing to do. We are producing frustration in exponential doses. I ask myself: Are those young men, who have no everyday perspective, not the perfect victims for radicals who promise to help them find a purpose in life? Many refugees in Germany have no idea what their rights and responsibilities are. No plan, no idea. Where are the authorities? Why are these young men being abandoned? Do we not want to integrate them, or are we unable to? Why are we constantly talking about them as people that do not want to integrate? If we do not want to make them part of society, then they will not want to make Germany part of their lives either. Demand rather than encourage Many politicians tell refugees: Integrate yourselves, accept our values! Some even threaten: Those who refuse to participate in integration courses should be punished and not be allowed to remain in Germany. The new integration law that the coalition has just passed is also supposed to contain that threat as well. That is why the refugee organization Pro Asyl has dubbed it the "disintegration law": There is no lack of will on the part of refugees, but rather of offers from the federal government. The " 

},{"Generated text": " Steinmeier meets Georgian Foreign Minister Eka Tkeshelashvili in Tbilisi The German foreign minister has met with Georgia's foreign ministers to discuss the situation in the conflict-ravaged South Ossetia. The two leaders are expected to meet on Friday. "We have a lot to talk about," Steinmeier said in a telephone interview with the Georgian news agency RIA-Novosti, adding that he was "very happy" to see the meeting. He said that the two sides had agreed on a "strategic partnership" and that "we will continue to work together on this issue." "I am very happy that we have reached a strategic partnership," he said. However, he added, "there is still a long way to go before we can reach an agreement on the future of Georgia." The meeting will be attended by the heads of state of both Georgia and Abkhazia, as well as representatives of the European Union (EU) and the United Nations (UN). "It is important for us to be clear that Georgia is not the only country that has been affected by this conflict," the German Foreign Ministry said, referring to Russia's annexation of Crimea in 1994. Russia and Georgia have long been at odds over the territorial integrity of their former Soviet neighbors. Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly called for an end to the crisis in Georgia, accusing Georgia of being "hostile" towards Russia. Moscow has denied the allegations, saying it is "baseless" that Moscow is trying to influence the country's internal affairs. In 1994, Russia annexed the Black Sea peninsula from Georgia. Since then, Georgia has suffered from a series of economic and political crises, including the collapse of its oil-rich Batumi minefield, which is now under the control of Russian-backed separatists. On Thursday, the Russian state-owned Rosneft newspaper published a report accusing Russia of supporting the separatist rebels. It said Russia had also supported the rebels in their fight against the Soviet regime, calling them "terrorists." Russia, however, has said it would not allow the separatists to take part in any kind of military confrontation with Moscow. According to a statement released by Russian foreign ministry spokesman Dmitry Peskov, Moscow had no comment on Thursday's meeting with Georgian President Ilham Aliyev, who was traveling to Moscow to attend a NATO summit in Germany. A spokesman for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) said the talks had been "constructive and constructive" but that it was not yet clear whether Russia would be willing to accept the results of a military conflict. NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said Thursday that Russia was ready to help Georgia in its quest for a peaceful resolution to its long-standing territorial dispute with Azerbaijan. But he did not rule out the possibility of an armed conflict between the former republics, and said Moscow was unlikely to intervene militarily until the end of this year. Gagapsh's comments came after a meeting between Russian and Georgian officials at the UN headquarters in Brussels, where the head of NATO's regional office, Sergei Steinke, was quoted as saying: "There is no doubt that there is a strong possibility that a conflict will take place within the next few days." In the past, Russian troops have been deployed to Georgia as part of counter-insurgency operations against Azerbaijan, a move that was criticized by many Georgians as a violation of international law. At the same time, NATO has warned Georgia not to use force against its own people. Tensions have risen in recent weeks, with Russia threatening to withdraw its troops from the region if Georgia does not comply with a UN-brokered peace deal. Georgia also faces a new round of sanctions on Russia over its alleged support for separatist activities in eastern Ukraine. US Secretary of State John Kerry has also warned that sanctions against Russia could be imposed on Georgia if it fails to cooperate with international efforts to end the war there. EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini warned of "serious consequences" for Georgia following the latest escalation of tensions between Moscow and Moscow over a failed peace accord signed in 1990.

,"Reference text": " German Minister Urges Peace in Georgia's Separatist Regions German Foreign Minister Steinmeier has called for an end to the "spiral of violence" between the Georgian government in Tbilisi and its Russian-backed rebel regions and presented a three-stage plan to break the deadlock. Steinmeier issued the plea as he began a tour of the region to sponsor a new peace plan aimed at calming the simmering tensions over Georgia's separatist regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. "This is my appeal to break out of the spiral of violence. A lack of dialogue is not an option for the future," he said after meeting with his Georgian counterpart Eka Tkeshelashvili. Steinmeier, who chairs the so-called Group of Friends of the United Nations' Secretary on Georgia, is proposing a three-phase peace plan based on a mutual declaration of non-violence and repatriation of about 25,000 ethnic Georgians expelled from Abkhazia in the 1990s. Negotiations over the status of the two rebel regions, which have enjoyed de facto autonomy since the end of a civil war in 1994, was reserved for the final phase of negotiations. Tkeshelashvili said, "The plan has great potential for success," but added that the most difficult thing would be to convince Russia. Peace talks remain distant The threat of armed conflict in the region last month has given urgency to international pressure for renewed peace talks, but Tbilisi, Moscow and the Russian-backed regions remain far apart on the basic premises for restarting peace talks. Officials in Tbilisi oppose a treaty on the non-use of force without guarantees on the return of refugees and the withdrawal of Russian peacekeeping forces base in the region. Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was skeptical of peace efforts Thursday. "Signing of a treaty on the return of Georgian refugees to Abkhazia is unreal now, because such a return requires a calm situation," Lavrov was quoted as saying by news agency RIA-Novosti. "We think that signing a treaty on the non-use of force without any preconditions is an absolutely unavoidable first step," he added. Experts see little hope for Steinmeier's plan Analysts do not expect anything conclusive from Steinmeier's trip, pointing to intransigence on the part of the Abkhaz President Sergei Bagapsh, who said he would "not consider the plan." "We are not going to discuss Abkhazia's status with anyone. We are building an independent, democratic state," Bagapsh was quoted by Georgian news agencies as saying. Speaking to journalists ahead of the meetings Thursday, Steinmeier admitted: "We don't have any illusions about simple answers, but we cannot stand by without acting on this conflict. That would be irresponsible." From Tbilisi, the German minister is to travel to the Black Sea city of Batumi for talks with Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili and then to Abkhazia on Friday before ending his three-day tour in Moscow. Most citizens of the breakaway republics have been issued Russian passports and over 2,500 Russian peacekeeping troops patrol the region under a UN ceasefire agreement. In opposition to Georgia's bid to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Russia moved to strengthen diplomatic ties with the breakaway regions sharply aggravating tensions with the Georgian leadership in recent months.

},{"Generated text": " Maldives' President Yameen Abdul Gayoom to step down in September The Maldives is set to elect a new president on Tuesday. The country's president is expected to take over from his former vice president, Mohamed Anil, who was ousted in a military coup in 2008. Yamaen's government has been in power since September, when the Maldivian government was overthrown by the military. In a statement, the president said he would not seek re-election in the next two years. "I will continue to lead the country as long as I am in office," he said, adding that he had no plans to run for another term as president. He also said that the government would seek a referendum on the constitution, which was passed by parliament last month. However, he did not rule out the possibility of a presidential election in 2012. Opposition chief Mohamed Nasheed called for a general election on March 1, 2012, to be held to determine the outcome of the disputed election. A spokesman for the United Nations said the election would be decided by a vote of no confidence, with a majority of voters casting their ballots in favor of an independent candidate. Maldavian opposition chief Ahmed Adeeb called the vote a "victory" and said it was "a victory for democracy." "The election is a victory of democracy, democracy and human rights for all," the spokesman said in an interview with the Associated Press. It was not immediately clear how many votes were cast, but the poll results showed the opposition had won the most votes in March, according to a Reuters poll. nm/kms (AP, AF, Reuters, dpa)In the run-up to the elections, a number of opposition leaders have said they will not run again until they are given a chance to prove their political will. They have also expressed concern over the ongoing political crisis in Sri Lanka, where they have been accused of corruption and abuse of power. At the same time, they say they want to see a change of government in order to prevent a repeat of last year's failed coup, in which the democratically elected president failed to win the support of his own party and was forced to resign in protest over a corruption scandal that left him in jail for five years and three months. This is the second time in as many years that a democratically-elected president has lost his grip on power, following the ouster of former Vice President Ali Abdullah Saleh in early March and the impeachment of then-Prime Minister Sheikh Mohamad Abubakar, both of whom were convicted of fraud and sentenced to 15 years in prison for their roles in rigging elections in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2013 and 2014, as well as the murder of several prominent opposition figures, including former Prime Minister Abdulla Zulkifli and his wife, Ismaeel, and her daughter, Abul Kalam, among others. Both men have denied any involvement in any wrongdoing and deny any responsibility for any crimes committed against their family or political opponents, although they deny they were involved in anything that could be construed as crimes against the rule of law or a violation of their constitutional rights. According to Reuters news agency, "Nasheed has denied all allegations against him and has repeatedly denied the allegations of wrongdoing," referring to his role as a political advisor to former prime minister Yemaah Abed Rabbo Mansoor, an opposition leader who fled to exile in Britain in 2011 after he was convicted in absentia of rape and attempted murder. Naseer, however, denies the accusations, saying he is innocent and that his family was guilty of all charges. His supporters have called him a liar and have accused him of lying about the case, accusing the authorities of trying to cover up the affair and calling it a witch-hunt to discredit the investigation into his son's alleged role in orchestrating the coup attempt to oust him from power in late 2008 and early 2009 and accusing him repeatedly of failing to protect his father's family from the political persecution that followed. www/maldivia.gov.uk/klk/dpa (Reuters, AP, AFP) "
,"Reference text": " Maldives revokes state of emergency citing improved security situation The president of the Maldives has lifted a state of emergency following an outcry from the international community. The government says the measures are no longer necessary because the security threat has subsided. The government said Tuesday it had rescinded the emergency measures "with immediate effect" and that "all fundamental rights that were suspended have been restored." President Yameen Abdul Gayoom declared the state of emergency one week ago after the discovery of a homemade bomb and a stash of weapons near his official residence. The finding followed an explosion on Gayoom's speedboat in September - an incident the government labeled an assassination attempt. The president was not hurt in the blast, but his wife, an aide and a bodyguard were injured. The emergency regulations, intended to be in place for 30 days, gave security forces wide-ranging search and arrest powers, and suspended citizens' basic rights. They drew criticism from former colonial power Britain as well as the United States, the European Union and neighboring Sri Lanka. Reading out a presidential decree revoking the emergency, Attorney General Mohamed Anil said there was no longer a threat to the Indian Ocean atoll nation. He said investigations into the September blast and the recovery of weapons had made good progress. The foreign ministry said a number of people had been arrested. Lawmakers also used the security regulations to fast-track the impeachment of Vice President Ahmed Adeeb, who stands accused of plotting the alleged attempts on the president's life. Impact on tourism Attorney General Anil said pressure from the international community, as well as "the possible adverse impact on Maldives tourism and the economy," had also played a role in ending the state of emergency. Foreign tourists visiting the tropical nation, known for its luxury tourist resorts, palm-fringed beaches and coral reefs, contribute close to a third of the country's gross domestic product. The Maldives has had a rocky road to democracy since holding its first multiparty election in 2008. The country's first democratically elected leader, current opposition chief Mohamed Nasheed, was forced to step down in 2012 after a mutiny by security forces. In March, he was jailed for 13 years on terrorism charges in a trial the United Nations said was illegal. President Gayoom is under intense international pressure to release him. Nasheed's opposition Maldivian Democratic Party welcomed Tuesday's announcement. But said declaring the state of emergency in the first place was a political move designed to stop a rally planned for last week calling for Nasheed's freedom. "It appears that Yameen is willing to make up threats about the nation's security in order to settle political scores," the party said in a statement, referring to the president. nm/kms (AP, AF, Reuters, dpa) " 

},{"Generated text": " U.S. warns Egypt of 'dangerous consequences' The United States has warned Egypt about the dangers of a dangerous escalation of violence in the Middle East. US Vice President Joe Biden warned on February 4 that "the consequences of this escalation could be catastrophic." US President Barack Obama warned that the "danger of escalation" was "very real." The White House said in a statement that it had "grave concerns" about a possible escalation in violence that could lead to the overthrow of the country's democratically elected government. "We have serious concerns," Obama said, adding that he would be "deeply concerned" if the situation in Egypt were to escalate. The president's warning came in response to a report by the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a think tank in Washington, D.C., which has been working with the US State Department to develop a strategy to combat the threat posed by a new wave of violent extremism. In the past, the Obama administration has expressed concern that a "new type of threat" could emerge from the region's political and economic crisis. However, in this case, it is the Muslim Brotherhood that has the most direct influence on the government in Cairo, Cairo and Tunis, according to CSIS, as well as the New York Times, which reported that President Ben Ali had called for an "escalation" between the two countries in order to prevent the spread of terrorism. Obama has said he is "open to dialogue" with Egypt, but he has yet to make a decision on whether or not he will continue to support the Brotherhood's bid to overthrow the democratically-elected government of President Hosni Mubarak in August 2010. He has not yet made an official statement, however, and his spokesman, Leon Panetta, did not respond to an interview request for this article. According to US officials, Obama's comments were made in an attempt to reassure the international community that there was no danger of an escalation. But the president has also been critical of Egypt's security situation, saying it "is a very dangerous and dangerous situation." "It is a situation where we have to be very careful about what we say and do not say," he said. 'We are not going to allow this to happen again.' The US has a long history of supporting dictatorships and overthrowing governments, including the one that overthrew the former president in 2011. President Obama is also a strong supporter of democracy and the rule of law. During his visit to Tunisia in early 2010, he met with a number of senior officials from both the CIA and US intelligence agencies to discuss the challenges facing the Arab world. At the same time, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said she was concerned about "a new kind of danger" that was being posed to Egypt. She also said that she had concerns about whether the new president would have the authority to intervene militarily if he chose to do so. As a result, she added, "I don't think there is any way that we can prevent this from happening again. I think we need to take a step back and think about how we are dealing with this situation," Clinton told reporters at the end of her visit. After all, her trip to Tunis was the first time she'd been to Washington since the fall of Mubarak. It was her first trip abroad since leaving office in late 2010 that made her feel at home. Since then she's been in touch with her family in Tunisia, where she has lived for more than a year and a half. Her father, a former military officer, is still alive and well and is planning to return to Cairo in February. On the other hand, there are concerns that Washington will not be able to help Egypt in its quest for a peaceful transition to democracy. This is something that is not well understood by many observers, who see it as an opportunity for Washington to play a leading role in changing the course of events. That is why I'm not sure that Obama will do anything about it at this point. What I do know is that this is an important step forward for the American people. We have a lot of work ahead of us," Sheafer told The Washington Post. And it's not just a matter of whether Obama can get the job done. "
,"Reference text": " White House ignored multiple warnings about crisis in Egypt There's a general consensus among policymakers and analysts that the uprisings in Egypt and elsewhere were unpredictable. That's untrue. There were plenty of experts who warned concretely about an impending crisis. When hundreds of thousands took to the streets first in Tunis, then in Cairo, Western governments were caught off guard just as much as the dictatorial regimes that were the target of the protests. The US, arguably the country with the strongest interests and the most leverage in the region, was still scrambling to make sense of Tunisian President Ben Ali's swift exit when the next regime, this time in Egypt, crumbled. Without a clear crisis management plan at the ready, the Obama administration's reaction to the events in Cairo waffled between tenuous support for the protestors and continued allegiance with the Mubarak regime, a key US partner in the Middle East. Taken by surprise The remark by Vice President Joe Biden, probably the Obama administration's most experienced foreign policymaker, in the midst of Egypt's uprising that he wouldn't classify Hosni Mubarak as a dictator serves perhaps as the most telling sign that the US government was unprepared for the events that rocked the Middle East. But as it turned out the vast network of US intelligence services was apparently equally flabbergasted by the revolt in Egypt as their political counterparts. While the CIA director's statement before Congress that there was a "strong likelihood" that Hosni Mubarak would step down the same night proved wrong and made the most headlines, the more damaging remark actually came from Leon Panetta's boss. The director of national intelligence, James Clapper, testified before Congress that Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood was "largely secular" and "eschewed violence" only to have his statement later corrected by a spokesman. President Barack Obama, according to a February 4 article in the New York Times, was unhappy with the information and analysis he received on the uprising in the Middle East by his intelligence services. Internal White House study on Egypt However, instead of relying on the CIA and others to prognosticate events in Egypt and elsewhere the president could have simply turned to his own advisors. As reported by the New York Times, Obama himself commissioned a secret review of possible unrest in the Middle East back in August 2010. The so-called Presidential Study Directive concluded that numerous countries in the region were prone to mass unrest without serious political changes, wrote the paper. The 18-page report so far hasn't been officially submitted, but is apparently helping the US deal with the events. Still, the crucial question why the White House didn't act on its in-house information prior to the crisis in the Middle East remains unclear. While the Presidential Study Directive was conducted in secret, the Obama administration also was repeatedly alerted publicly to the dangerous situation in the Middle East, particularly in Egypt. A high-level Working Group on Egypt, consisting of a bipartisan cadre of former government officials, human rights activists and Middle East experts, sent numerous letters to US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in spring of last year repeatedly urging the administration to press for serious reforms in Egypt to avert a possible conflict. The heads of the Working Group on Egypt, Michele Dunne and Robert Kagan, then followed up with an op-ed in the Washington Post in June 2010, warning that "the Obama administration, in pursuit of an illusory stability, stands mute and passive as the predictable train wreck draws nearer." And according to the Washington Post, the group also had meetings with senior State Department officials. So why did the administration not heed the advice of the experts? "I think they didn't share the urgency that some of us on the outside felt about this," Michele Dunne, a co-chair of the Working Group on Egypt told Deutsche Welle. "That things in Egypt were deteriorating dangerously, that there could be an explosion at some point if Mubarak didn't undertake some reform measures." Conflicting positions Dunne, who is a Middle East expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington and editor of the online journal the Arab Reform Bulletin, thinks the US administration was in two minds about what to do in Egypt. While Washington saw the situation in Egypt deteriorating after the renewal of the state of emergency and the rigged election, it found it difficult to act upon it, adds Dunne. "The United States government has a lot of interests to work with Egypt and I think they weren't really sure how to press strongly for improvements for human rights and democracy while at the same time working with the Egyptian government on diplomacy, security, and counterterrorism." What's more, many experts, not just those inside the Obama administration, simply underestimated the potential for revolt in Egypt. "I think that most analysts didn't take seriously trends and developments that we saw in Egypt over the last few years," argues Dunne. To her the youth bulge in the country coupled with a high level of unemployment and increased political activism over the Internet was an alarm signal. Real revolution But others didn't think so. "This was seen as just a virtual political activism, "

The move is part of a bid by sporting director Domenico Tedesco to strengthen the club's midfield. German media reported on Wednesday that Meyer had agreed to a deal with Bayern for the midfielder, who is expected to make his debut at the end of February. According to the German news agency dpa, the move was made on January 12, a day before the transfer deadline. It was the first time that Bayern had signed a player of the Bundesliga's top tier, and it was only the second time in the last three years that they have signed one of Germany's most promising young talents. "It's been a long time coming," said sports magazine Kicker, citing a source close to Meyer, adding that he was "very happy" with the news. He also said that the signing was a "positive step forward" in terms of strengthening the team's defensive structure, which he described as "a very positive step." "I'm very happy that we've been able to get the job done," Meyer said, referring to his team-mates. However, he added that there was still a lot of work to be done in order to improve the squad's physicality and the way in which they play. Meyer's move comes at a time when he has been under increasing pressure from the media and from his own fans. In January, Meyer was forced to step down as coach of Bayern's Bundesliga side, after he received a €5.5 million (€6.7 million) transfer fee for his services. At the time of his departure, Bayern were in third place in Germany with just one point from their last four matches. But the new coach, Christian Heidel, has said he will continue to work closely with his players and staff to ensure they are fully fit and ready to play in a competitive environment, according to football magazine Sport Bild. Coach Christian Weidenfels has also been linked with a move away from Bayern, but it has not been confirmed yet. Bayern have said they will not make any further changes to their squad. They have already announced a number of changes, including a change of personnel and an overhaul of their coaching staff, as well as the appointment of new technical director, Stefan Schönefeld, to take over the role of head of football operations. Schönke, however, have not yet made a decision on whether or not to renew their contract, saying that it would be "difficult" for them to do so. Football magazine "Sport Bild" reported that "schönenfeld" had been in talks with Meyer about the possibility of signing a contract extension, although it is not clear if he would agree to that. After all, it's not just a matter of time before they can agree on a new deal. There is also the issue of who will be in charge of training and how long it will take to complete the contract. If the deal is approved, there will still be a question mark over how much money will Bayern will have to spend on the player. That's a big question, because it could take a while for Bayern to decide whether they want to keep him in their ranks. For the most part, they don't seem to have made any major changes at all. So far, so good, in fact, that's the only change they've made. On the other hand, their transfer policy is still very much in line with what they had in mind when they signed him. This is a huge change from last year, when Bayern made the switch from Bundesliga to Bundesliga, where they won the Champions League and reached the semi-finals of Euro 2016. Now they're looking for a solution to this problem. And it seems like they may have found one. As a result of this change in personnel, some players have expressed interest in joining the Bayern squad, while others have been reluctant to commit to joining them. Some of them have even expressed doubts about their ability to stay at Bayern. Others, though, are more interested in playing for another club, such as Juventus or Real Madrid. "

Clubs officials say talks are ongoing in the hope Max Meyer will extend his contract. Schalke might struggle to retain 22-year-old midfielder Max Meyer when his contract runs out at the end of the season, at least according to recent media interviews from the club's sporting director, Christian Heidel. Speaking to German news agency dpa, Heidel confirmed that Meyer turned down an offer of a contract extension earlier in February. "Max Meyer's agent received an extension offer on January 12 with a deadline of February 15, and informed us on February 15 via email that Max would not be accepting the offer because of the deadline imposed," Heidel told dpa. "We have acknowledged this. For now, we no longer feel beholden to the terms of that offer, but that doesn't mean an extension is impossible either." Meyer was reportedly offered an annual salary in the region of €5.5 million ($6.7 million); it was the second contract he refused, following a less lucrative offer at the end of last season.

"At the moment we're still ready to talk," Heidel told this week's edition of football magazine Kicker, albeit stressing that time was of the essence. "But we must and we will plan for the new season." In a separate newspaper interview Heidel was even more explicit, saying the club was not in a position to wait until summer for Meyer to make up his mind. Speaking to Sport Bild magazine, meanwhile, Heidel sought to focus on Meyer's more important role at Schalke, his regular game time, arguing it might be in the youngster's best interests to stay at a club that needs him every week. "[Coach] Domenico Tedesco has formed the team around him in such a way that there is now an ideal spot for Max. That was not always the case," Heidel said. "He needs to ask himself, putting the financial aspect to one side: 'Will I get such a position at a different club?' Because one thing's clear: Max wants to play, and he needs to play." Schalke are already preparing for the departure of one of German football's brightest young stars, midfield all-rounder Leon Goretzka will join Bayern Munich on a free transfer at the season's end.

The US Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has issued a disaster declaration for all of the affected islands in the Caribbean, including Florida, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Cuba. Hurricane Irma is expected to hit the United States on Friday, with winds of up to 185 miles per hour (300 kph) and a storm surge of as much as 1.5 feet (1.6 meters) expected, according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami. Florida Governor Rick Scott said the state would be among the hardest hit by the storm. "This is the worst we've ever seen," he said, adding that he was "very concerned about the safety of our citizens." The federal government has been working closely with the US Coast Guard to prepare for Irma, which is due to make landfall on the island of Hispaniola on Dec. 15. In addition, federal officials are working with local authorities to assess the extent of damage caused by Irma and to determine how long it will take to fully recover from the damage. President Trump said he would make a "big decision" on whether to declare an emergency in order to help those in need. He also called for federal assistance to be provided to those affected by Hurricane Maria and Hurricane Katia, both of which have been hit hard by hurricanes in recent years. Trump called on Congress to pass a bill that would provide $5 billion in federal aid to hurricane victims and their families, as well as help to rebuild their homes and businesses. 'We're going to do everything we can' The White House said in a statement Friday that it would work with Congress "to make sure that we have the resources we need to deal with this disaster." "We've got a lot of work ahead of us," said Trump, referring to Hurricane Harvey in Texas, where the Category 4 storm killed at least 13 people and left more than 1,500 others injured. FEMA also said it was working to restore power to thousands of homes, businesses, schools, hospitals and other critical infrastructure in affected areas. Federal officials said they would continue to monitor the situation closely, but they did not have a specific timeline for when the hurricane would reach Florida or the Lesser Antilles. They said there was no immediate threat to life or property in those areas, and that they were prepared for any eventuality. However, they added that there were "a number of factors" that could play a role in determining the exact path of Irma's path, such as the amount of money that will be available for rebuilding and rebuilding infrastructure. It was not immediately clear what those factors were, however, when Trump made the announcement. On Friday morning, US Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen announced that she would not be traveling to Florida to attend the inauguration of hurricane relief efforts. She was scheduled to travel to Mexico on December 13th, a day after Hurricane Florence made landfall in Florida. According to a US official, Irma was a Category 3 storm with a maximum strength of 185 mph (298 kpc). The hurricane is forecast to reach the Florida Keys on Saturday, December 15, at a time when it is predicted to cross into the Atlantic Ocean and become a category 4 hurricane on Sunday night. A total of $15 billion has already been set aside by Congress for hurricane recovery efforts, FEMA said. New Mexico President Ricardo Rossello, who heads the Department of Foreign Affairs, said on Thursday that the government was prepared to assist in any way it could. But he also warned that "it's not just a matter of time before we get there, it's a question of when and how much money we'll be able to spend." He said that if Congress decides to act, "we'll have to wait and see what happens." In the aftermath of Hurricane Michael, Florida's governor, Republican Gov. Doug Ducey, announced on Twitter that his state will receive $1 billion more in emergency aid than it has received since Harvey's landfall. "

The record-breaking storm has battered the Bahamas and Cuba, while Hurricane Jose followed in its path. As one of the Atlantic Ocean's largest storms plowed through the Caribbean, leaving destruction in its wake, residents of the US state of Florida prepared for what could be the worst storm to make landfall in over a century. At least 17 people have been killed and dozens more injured across several island nations in the Caribbean. Irma is expected to be there second major hurricane to make landfall in the United States in less than two weeks. Hurricane Harvey struck Texas last week, killing more than 60 people and displacing roughly 1 million others. In the US territory of Puerto Rico, 1 million people – nearly one-third of the population – lost electricity during the storm, said Puerto Rican Governor Ricardo Rossello. "It will be difficult to estimate how long the power outage will last," Rossello said. Later, officials confirmed that at least two people on the island had been killed by the storm's devastation. Two other major storms have developed in the Caribbean, namely Hurricane Jose and Hurricane Katia. Jose was east of the Lesser Antilles with maximum sustained winds of 120 miles per hour (195 kilometers per hour) as a hurricane watch was in effect for Antigua and Barbuda. Jose has followed the same path as Hurricane Irma, and was upgraded to a Category 4 on Friday by the US National Hurricane Center. Katia has remained relatively static, hovering off the coast of Mexico. Florida on edge Florida Governor Rick Scott said 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain were expected after Irma made landfall at the weekend as he urged evacuations during a press conference on Friday. Nearly 700,000 people have been asked to leave Miami and its surrounding areas. "Today is the day to do the right thing for your family and get inland for safety... Do not ignore evacuation orders. All Floridians should be prepared to evacuate soon," Scott said. Read more: How to reduce risks from mega-storms? "I know many of you are stuck in traffic, I’m sure it’s very frustrating. Evacuations are not convenient but they are absolutely meant to keep you safe," he added. On Friday, US President Donald Trump described Irma as a storm of "absolutely historic destructive potential." Trump also on Friday signed a $15 billion (13.5 billion euro) hurricane relief package passed by Congress, which also raises the debt ceiling and postpones the possibility of a shutdown of government funding until December. Downgraded to an "extremely dangerous" Category 4 but still packing winds of 185 mph (300 kph), Irma moved between the north coast of Cuba and the Bahamas as it neared the Florida Keys and the southern Florida Peninsula.

Amid widening criticism from residents in British territories that not enough was done to safeguard people from the storm, British Foreign Office Minister Alana Duncan said London has sent tents, vehicles and other relief equipment. "Anguilla received the hurricane's full blast. The initial assessment is that the damage has been severe and in places critical," Duncan told the British Parliament.

},{"Generated text": " German Chancellor Angela Merkel's Alternative for Germany (AfD) takes aim at Brexit The German Chancellor has taken a hard line against Brexit. She has called for a referendum on the EU's Maastricht Treaty, which aims to prevent the bloc from entering the single market. The AfD is a far cry from the conservative Christian Democrats (CDU), which has been calling for an EU-wide vote on EU membership since the end of the war in the Middle East in 2014. It is an anti-EU party, and it is not just the CDU, but also the Greens, the Social Democrats and the Green Party (SPD). It has also been called the "Alternative for Europe" party. In a statement, Merkel said: "We will not allow the European Union to enter into an agreement with the United Kingdom. We are not going to allow this to happen." She also said that she would not support a "hard Brexit" if the UK voted against it. "I don't think we will allow it," she said, adding that "it would be a mistake for us to vote against a deal that would allow Britain to become a member of a single EU." But she also pointed to the fact that Britain voted in favor of Brexit, as well as a number of other EU member states, including the Netherlands, Denmark, France, Germany, Slovakia, Czech Republic and Slovakia. And she pointed out that in order to achieve this, Britain would have to agree to a bilateral free trade agreement (MTA) with Germany. That is, if Britain does not sign the MTA, then it will be able to impose its own rules on Europe. But it would also be difficult for the German government to accept that this is the only way to get Europe back on track. So far, however, it seems to be working. There is no clear consensus on how to proceed with Brexit negotiations in Brussels. However, there are indications that the parties are in agreement on what to do about the situation in Eastern Europe, particularly in relation to Ukraine and Crimea. What is important is that all parties agree on a common goal: to have a stable and stable EU, not only in terms of economic and political stability. This is something that is very important to both parties and to each other. For the SPD, this means that they are willing to work together to make sure that Europe's future is secure and that there is stability and prosperity for all of its citizens. They are also ready to take part in negotiations with Russia and China. At the same time, they also want to ensure that Russia is fully integrated into the international community, so that it can participate in all aspects of European life. As a result, we are seeing a lot of cooperation and cooperation between the two sides. I think it's a good thing that both sides are looking at this as an opportunity to build a strong, stable, prosperous and prosperous Europe," said Kay-Alexander Scholz, a political analyst at the think tank Visegrad Group in The Hague, in an interview with DW. Merkel has said she is open to talks with other European leaders about a possible deal with Ukraine, although she has not yet decided whether or not she wants to go ahead with such a move. On the other hand, she says she's not opposed to any kind of deal, even if it means the withdrawal of Crimea from Ukraine. If the US decides to withdraw from NATO, that could be disastrous for European unity and stability, because it could lead to an unstable and unstable future for many European countries. Germany has already made a decision on whether to join NATO or leave the alliance. After all, what is NATO without a NATO? The US has a treaty with which it has agreed to provide security guarantees for its allies. Europe is also bound by the Schengen Agreement, an international treaty that guarantees the security of EU citizens and their rights to live and work in a free and democratic state. With the exception of Poland and Hungary, EU countries are bound to follow this treaty. These are the countries that have already signed the treaty and which have not ratified it, such as Poland, Hungary or the Republic of Korea. "
,"Reference text": " Opinion: Yet another crisis for Merkel A summery turquoise blazer and fresh makeup could not hide the fact that Angela Merkel was "not amused." Now she is needed as a champion in the fight against populist forces, DW's Kay-Alexander Scholz writes. Britain-EU divorce proceedings will probably last about two years. Until then, the status quo must be maintained, German Chancellor Angela Merkel emphasized in her press statement. If she is no longer chancellor after the upcoming parliamentary elections in 2017, then others will have to live with the consequences of Brexit. But that is not what she is actually thinking. It is not coincidental that foreign ministers and government leaders are visiting Berlin in the coming days. They want to discuss how things will continue. Berlin, under Merkel's chancellorship, has become a center of power outside of Brussels. Difficult international politics The Brexit decision has disrupted Europe's equilibrium. Germany has lost an important ally on European issues related to economic growth and budgetary discipline. Now, France presumably will be the next to raise its voice against Maastricht Treaty criteria. If the Netherlands and Denmark also decide to leave the EU, Germany will become isolated, as Eastern Europe is not as tight with Germany as it once was. Poland now plays a key role for the Balkan nations and the Visegrad Group (Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic and Slovakia). And Poland is still annoyed about Merkel's refugee policy. What about Germany's populists? They're giddy with glee as they feel that their anti-establishment policies have been validated. They are teaching potential AfD (Alternative for Germany) voters a lesson: "Here, have a look: it's possible. There is always an alternative. Vote for us!" Those are exactly the words that protest voters want to hear. Germany's AfD has forged ties with other right-wing parties in Vienna, Paris, The Hague and London. They are all pursuing a "European" plan to gain power. The recent Austrian presidential election was significant, as the populist candidate lost by a very narrow margin; in fact, the final election results are still undecided as they are being contested. The Brexit vote was also triggered by populist powers. Domestically difficult Many populists believe that the stronger populism becomes - no matter where - the more advantages there would be for individual parties of their persuasion. Many would also like to see Donald Trump as US president. That is how AfD may become even stronger in Germany, which also means that political majorities would fluctuate even more. Will there be enough seats after the next election for a Christian Democrat and Green coalition, or will yet another grand coalition made up of Christian Democrats and Social Democrats be formed? Can Angela Merkel change course? Can she counter the trend with a new political model in Europe and Germany? Or do we stand on the edge of a new era, a "political revolution," as the AfD calls it? Until now, Europe has survived attacks on its currency (euro crisis), the principle of peaceful coexistence (Crimea crisis) and its open borders policy (refugee crisis). Merkel deserves credit for defending these values, despite mistakes that have been made along the way. The outcome of the Brexit crisis is, however, still open. Have something to say? Add your comments below. " 

},{"Generated text": " German Chancellor Angela Merkel's 'Alternative for Germany' campaign kicks off in Berlin The German chancellor has kicked off her campaign for a third term in office in the wake of the fall of Berlin Wall. The party's leader, Helmut Kohl, has promised to continue the campaign until the end of 2017. Merkel, who was elected chancellor in 2005, is expected to run for re-election in September. She is due to be sworn in on Sunday at 7 p.m. local time (1700 UTC) as Germany's first female chancellor since 2005. German media reported that the party would run until at least 2017, when it would seek to form a coalition government with the opposition Christian Democrat Party (CDU). The CDU, which is currently in opposition to the chancellor's term, will be led by former US President Barack Obama, the Bild am Sonntag newspaper reported, citing a source close to Merkel. In September, Merkel announced that she would not seek a second term as chancellor. "I am not going to seek another term," Merkel said at the time, according to a statement released by her office. But she has said she will continue to fight for the right to stay in government, even if it means leaving the European Union. Germany has long been a center-right country, and Merkel has been one of its most influential figures in recent years. However, she is not the only one who has called for an end to EU membership. Her party has also called on the government of Germany to stand up to Donald Trump and the US president-elect, both of whom have criticized the EU's decision to withdraw from the bloc in June. A number of German newspapers and magazines have published stories about Merkel and her party, including the weekly "Berlin News" in which she was quoted as saying: "She is the most important person in Germany." The magazine also published a story about how Merkel was the first woman to lead a German government since 1989. It said that Merkel had a "strong sense of responsibility" and that it was important for her to make sure that her policies were in line with German values. Many of her supporters, however, have been critical of Trump's policies, saying that he has not been able to convince voters that his policies are compatible with those of other European leaders. They also say that Trump has shown a lack of respect for democracy and human rights in a country where the rule of law has become a central issue in his election campaign. This is a view shared by many German politicians and media outlets, but it is also echoed by the conservative ARD, a political party that holds a majority in parliament and which has a strong following among conservatives and liberals. On the other hand, many of these politicians have expressed concern about the impact Trump could have on German society. Some of them have said they would like to see a more open and democratic society, while others say they are more concerned about what the future of democracy looks like in their own country. For example, they say, if Trump is elected president, he will have a better chance of winning the popular vote than if he were to win the election in November. What's more, it's not clear whether Trump will win a general election or not. There are also concerns about a possible backlash against Merkel from within the German political establishment, such as the left-wing AfD party (AfD), which seeks to take over the reins of power from her conservative Christian Democrats party. That could be a problem for Merkel if she doesn't get the support she needs from voters in her own party and from other parties, as well as from outside the mainstream media. If she does not win, then she could face a backlash from those who oppose her. After all, there are a lot of people who think she should be the next chancellor, not just the current one. So far, so good. And that's exactly what she's done so far. When it comes to foreign policy, Germany is doing very well in terms of reducing its dependence on foreign aid and increasing its reliance on EU member states like the United States and Canada. "
,"Reference text": " Reports: Merkel to run for fourth term as German chancellor German Chancellor Angela Merkel has confirmed that she will stand for the chancellery in the 2017 election, German media reports. The Christian Democrat Leader (CDU) first took office in 2005. After months of speculation, German Chancellor Angela Merkel reportedly told her fellow Christian Democrats (CDU) in Berlin on Sunday that she is prepared to lead the party into next year's election. An official statement is expected from Merkel at 7 p.m. local time (1800 UTC) on Sunday. The 62-year-old has faced a number of difficulties in recent months, from criticism over her handling of the migration crisis to falling support amid a rise in right-wing populist sentiment. Since taking office in 2005, however, Merkel has also been praised for navigating Europe's largest economy through the financial and eurozone crises. According to an Emnid survey published in the German newspaper "Bild am Sonntag" 55 percent of Germans are in favor of Merkel remaining head of the German government for another four years. Thirty-nine percent said they were against her re-election. Sign of stability Should she be elected next September, another full four-year term would put Merkel on a par with her mentor Helmut Kohl who set the post-war record and presided over the Fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. In light of the UK's shock vote to leave the European Union in June and Donald Trump's election last week as US president, Merkel's re-election is likely to be welcomed in many capitals as a sign of stability. During his final visit to Berlin this week, US President Barack Obama said that if he were able to, he would vote for his longtime partner and friend. In an interview with German magazine "Spiegel" and broadcaster "ARD," Obama said: "She has great credibility, and she is willing to fight for those values in a way that is very, very important." "I'm glad that she's there and I think the German people should appreciate her. Certainly, I've appreciated her as a partner." Winning back votes With the less that a year until Germany heads to the polls, Merkel's CDU is now turning its efforts to wooing back disenchanted voters who have left the conservative camp to support the right-wing populists, Alternative for Germany (AfD). Formed as a Euro-sceptic party in 2013, the AfD won 4.7 percent of the popular vote in the last federal elections in 2013, just falling short of the 5 percent threshold required to enter the Bundestag - Germany's lower house of parliament. After benefiting from the rise in europsceptic, anti-immigration sentiment, seemingly sweeping across western Europe, the party now holds seats in nine of Germany's 16 states. "

NFL owner Shahid Khan and NFL team owner Robert Kraft are set to host the game, which will be the first of their kind in the world to be played at the iconic London stadium. The US football team, the Baltimore Ravens, will host their first game since President Donald Trump took office in January. In a statement released by the NFL on Friday, Khan said the team would play the "Star Spangled Banner" and "The Flag and Country" during the national anthem. "We're going to have a great game," he said, adding that he was "very proud" of his team's performance. However, he added that the Ravens would not be able to do so without the support of the league's commissioner Roger Goodell, who is expected to step down after Sunday's game against the Jacksonville Jaguars, due to a lack of interest from NFL owners. He also said he would be unable to attend the match because of a "personal matter." "I'm very proud of my team," said Khan, referring to the Jaguars' team that won last year's Super Bowl, beating the San Francisco 49ers 49-49 in overtime. Trump's visit to London comes just days after the Republican-controlled US House of Representatives voted to impeach President Barack Obama for failing to pass a health care reform bill in his first year in office. It was the second time in as many days that Trump has been in a position to veto a bill that would have allowed him to run for the White House. But he's not the only one who has expressed concern about the issue. On Friday night, President Trump announced that his administration would hold a special election to determine the winner of Sunday night's NFL game between the Los Angeles Rams and New York Giants, and he'll be running for re-election next year. White supremacy In the United States, there's a long tradition of white supremacy in sports and entertainment. That's why it's so important to me that I don't see myself as a white supremacist. I'm a black man who doesn't belong in this country, so I won't be a part of this game. What's more, I've always been a fan of Colin Kaepernick. And I'll always be one of those people who can stand up for what I believe in and fight for it," Trump said at a press conference in Washington, D.C. Earlier this week, Trump signed an executive order banning the use of racial epithets in sporting events, a move that was criticized by President Obama, as well as by Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus and Vice President Mike Pence. At the same time, White supremacist groups have been calling for a boycott of NFL games in recent weeks, saying they want to "demonstrate that we're not a racist, xenophobic or anti-Semitic organization." Trump also called for an end to racial segregation in America, calling it "anti-American." The president's announcement came just hours before the start of an NFL season opener in Atlanta, where the Atlanta Falcons are scheduled to face the New England Patriots in their home state of Georgia. During the pre-game ceremony, thousands of fans lined up outside the stadium to cheer on their favorite team. Some of them, however, were not in attendance. They were standing in line to watch as the anthem was played and cheered by NFL players and coaches, while others, like NFL general manager Ryan Grigson, said they were just waiting to see what the players would do if they got the chance to perform. Kaepernick's protest against racial injustice was not enough to convince Trump to drop his presidential bid, but the president did not seem to care. Instead, it was a message of unity and respect for those who have stood up against racism and injustice. While Trump may have won the popular vote in Alabama, his supporters in other states, including the Golden State Warriors, have not been as vocal about his opposition to racism as he has in past years.

,"Reference text": " NFL stars defy Donald Trump's call for boycott Baltimore Ravens and Jacksonsville Jaguars players "took a knee" during the national anthem after Trump urged fans to boycott football matches. The kneeling protest, to highlight social injustice, has stepped up a gear. Hundreds of National Football League (NFL) stars protested President Donald Trump's call for fans to boycott the league by refusing to stand for the US national anthem this weekend, starting Sunday's game between the Baltimore Ravens and Jacksonsville Jaguars. A number of other players locked arms in solidarity ahead of the game at Wembley Stadium in London. Jacksonville Jaguars' owner Shahid Khan, who last year donated one million dollars (840,000 euros) to the Trump campaign, locked his arms with players - a rare scene, as owners almost never take to the field. US media reported that about 200 players on Sunday sat, knelt or raised their fists in defiance of Trump's comments. In one of the most memorable moments, singer Rico LaVelle took a knee and held up a fist at the last line of the Star Spangled Banner ahead of the game between the Detriot Lions and Atlanta Falcons. The protest came in response to Trump's tweets on Sunday morning urging fans to boycott NFL games to pressure the league into firing or suspending players to kneel in protest during the national anthem. In an early morning tweet, Trump posted: "If NFL fans refuse to go to games until players stop disrespecting our Flag and Country, you will see change take place fast. Fire or suspend!" "NFL attendance and ratings are WAY DOWN. Boring games yes, but many stay away because they love our country. League should back US," he added. Later, the president said that his rant "has nothing to do with race," despite the fact that the origins of the protest are to do with police brutality against minorities, especially African Americans. Trump said his comments were instead about "respect for our country and respect for our flag." Trump's spat with US professional sports began at a Republican rally in Alabama on Friday, when the president attacked activist NFL players for kneeling or sitting during the national anthem, labelling them as "sons of bitches." "Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, 'Get that son of a bitch off the field right now... he is fired'?" Trump told a crowd of cheering supporters. That day, basketball star Stephen Curry, the top player for California's Golden State Warriors, announced that he would not be attending a traditional White House reception honoring the National Basketball Association champions. The kneeling protest was started by former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick who refused to stand for the anthem back in 2016. Kaepernick's gesture came amid a spate of deadly police shootings of black men and was aimed at drawing more attention to treatment of minorities in the US. However, Kaepernick has since become a free agent, after failing to be signed by a new team for the new NFL season. NFL executives decry Trump's calls Trump also drew the ire of senior NFL executives and team owners. Responding to Trump's tweets, Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti, said he "100 percent" supported his players' decision to kneel during the anthem. Robert Kraft, the owner of the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots, who is also a close friend of Trump, said in a statement on Sunday that he was deeply disappointed by the president's comments in Alabama. Kraft defended players' rights to "peacefully affect social change and raise awareness in a manner that they feel is most impactful," and said that sports were a unifying force in the US. "Our political leaders could learn a lot from the lessons of teamwork and working together toward a common goal," he said.

Denouncing Trump's remarks, Goodell said: "Divisive comments like these demonstrate an unfortunate lack of respect for the NFL, our great game and all of our players, and a failure to understand the overwhelming force for good our clubs and players represent in our communities." But Trump hit back later on Sunday at a worsening furore, saying the row "has nothing to do with race." Instead, he said: "This has to do with respect for our country, and respect for our flag."

},{"Generated text": " Buchenwald Concentration Camp A Nazi concentration camp in the Weimar region of Germany has been described as a "blood street" by historian Volkhard Knigge. It's a place of concentration camps where thousands of Jews were murdered and their families were forced to flee their homes. In July, 1937, Adolf Hitler and his followers set fire to the camp, which was then known as the "Blood Street." The camp was located on the German side of the river, near the border with the Soviet Union. There, the Nazis set up a camp for the Jews, who were to be deported to Germany in 1937. During the summer of 1937 and the winter of 1938-39, hundreds of people were killed and hundreds more were injured. The Nazis were able to escape with their lives, but they were unable to return to their home country, where they remained until the end of World War II. Many of these people died in camps in other countries, including South America, Rwanda and South Africa. Historians believe that the Nazi regime was responsible for many of those deaths. "Weimar is a blood street," said historian Ronald Hirte, referring to a street that was named after the city where the camps were located. He added that it was also the place where many Jews died, and that there were many others who died as well. At the time of his death, he was one of only a handful of Germans who survived the Holocaust. Today, there are more than 1.5 million Jews in Germany, according to statistics compiled by the International Holocaust Remembrance Project (IJN). The majority of them are Roma and Sinti. They have been persecuted and persecuted for their faith and are now persecuted in many countries around the world. These are the conditions that led to Hitler's rise to power. And they are still there today. We have a lot to learn about the history of this place. But we also have to remember that we are not the only ones who have suffered this fate. For example, we have the GDR, a former Soviet republic, in which the Jewish community was persecuted. That's why we need to look at what happened there and what we can do to prevent it from happening again. This is what I want to do. I will do my best to make sure that I don't do anything wrong. If I do, it will be because I am a Jew, not a Roma, or a Jewish. So I'm not going to go into the ghetto and say, 'Oh, I didn't know you were Jewish,' because that's not how I feel.' But I think it's important to keep in mind that if you are Jewish, you will also be in a situation where you can't go back to your Jewish roots, because you're not Jewish at all. You will never get what you deserve. Author Knud Kurtz / Staff Photographer Editor: Michael Cornelia The German Armed Forces (GDR) in 1945-1946, when the war broke out, were the first of its kind in Europe. Since then, they have had to deal with a number of problems. Among them was the lack of proper training and equipment. As a result, many young men and women were not allowed to join the armed forces. Some were even forced out of high school. Others were sent to internment camps. Other problems, such as overcrowding and poor living conditions, forced them to live in overcrowded conditions. One of my favorite things about being a member of a Nazi party was that you could never leave the country without having a job. When you leave a country like Germany and go to another country and work for a company like the Germans, then you have no choice but to come back and do something for yourself and your family. A lot of things have changed since then. Nowadays, most people are working for themselves, so there's no reason to think that they will ever return. However, that doesn't mean they won't try to get back into Germany. What is important is that people who are no longer Jewish can return home and start a new life, even if that means leaving the old one behind. Not only that, people from other parts of Europe are returning home to find their old lives. "
,"Reference text": " Buchenwald: Lessons from past and present 75 years ago in July, 1937, the concentration camp Buchenwald was built near the city of Weimar. The memorial there today draws people from around the world, and its program has seen some shifts in recent years. Once a favorite area for hiking and vacationing, Buchenwald was transformed in 1937 into a site designed to annihilate people. Beyond clusters of trees, a valley opens up, dotted today by one or two villages. Back then, the cold and windy north side of the valley was set aside for Buchenwald's prisoners, and the more comfortable climate on the southern side was reserved for the guards and camp directors. An open secret "The camp was no secret," noted historian Ronald Hirte during a visit to the grounds. Everyone could have seen Buchenwald from below, he said, because the surrounding forest was not as thick as it is today. Buchenwald was situated about five kilometers (3 miles) from the city of Weimar. Among local residents, its existence was an uncomfortable fact. The concentration camp was a place of horrors that people in the cultural and political focal point of Weimar wanted to know nothing about. "But many local companies did very well thanks to the work of the prisoners," Hirte said. Thousands of people from throughout Europe were deported to the camp beginning in 1937, and they were forced to march from Weimar to Buchenwald. Later the city was connected with the camp by a railway built by the prisoners, who also built a service road still called today by its original name: Blutstraße - literally, Blood Street.On a now barren and empty spot on the hill, prisoners had to gather each morning and night for a role call that could last hours. A gateway bearing the words "Jedem das Seine" (Translated literally: "To each his own," but figuratively: "Everyone will get what he deserves.") still stands, along with bunkers and the dark and musty rooms in which Nazi guards tortured and murdered the prisoners. Bringing the present into focus It is not uncommon for 20 groups of young people to visit the memorial on a given day. "Interest continues to grow, and so does the number of visitors," said Hirte. It is now Germany's third and fourth post-war generations that can come to ask questions here and learn what happened. The memorial offers a wide-ranging educational program. But the point is not to moralize and point fingers into the past, said the director of the memorial, Volkhard Knigge: "We want to direct questions of contemporary society toward the past." More concretely, that means that issues including human rights violations, persecution, right-wing extremism and nationalism are taken up as contemporary topics against the historical background of the Holocaust. "Today, that is our central historical, political, and ethical educational task," Knigge said. During a recent visit, two 14-year-old boys sat in front of a plaque listing the home countries of former prisoners. "We are here with our school, and our teacher just showed us around. Now we have a couple of assignments to do - for example, finding out where the prisoners were from and how many lived here," one boy explained. Watching them, it is apparent that this is not just a routine field trip. There is a bit of horsing around when the school groups first arrive, but silence and solemnity are the norm once students pass by the execution chambers and furnaces used to incinerate bodies. There are also groups from Poland, Russia and the USA in attendance. One American student relates that her grandfather was among those who helped liberate Buchenwald but that he never spoke about the experience. No "trite effects" Addressing questions about what should be shown today, how the site should be commentated, what is authentic and credible - and what isn't - forms the core of the work done by the memorial's team. The administration has generally tried to avoid reconstructing what Buchenwald might have been like. "We don't want to create any trite effects," said Ronald Hirte. "The noisiness and narrowness of this place, how terrible the smell was - we could never convey that to visitors today anyway." The memorial's head said that Buchenwald has become a model for other countries around the world - in a partnership sense rather than in a presumptuous way. "Everywhere in the world, in South America, Rwanda, South Africa, Hungary, in the former Yugoslavia, there are people examining and dealing with their history. We support and encourage them in their search for ways to honor and respect victims without concealing the horrors of what happened," he said. Asking why In recent years, other less visible groups have been added to the list of those memorialized. Alongside Jewish victims, politically persecuted individuals of various nationalities, Soviet prisoners of war and Roma and Sinti people, the grounds now also house memorials "

The new policy aims to reduce the number of migrants entering Europe and to ease the burden on the EU. EU leaders agreed Thursday to discuss the crisis in the Mediterranean, after Turkey and Greece agreed to a raft of measures aimed at stopping the flow of refugees into Europe. "We are very concerned about the situation in Turkey," German Prime Minister Ahmet Davutolgu said at a news conference in Brussels, adding that "we will continue to work closely with Turkey on this issue." "Turkey is a very important partner in Europe," he said, referring to Turkey's NATO ally, the alliance of the European Union, NATO and the United States. However, he added that Turkey would not be the only EU country to take action against the migrants, saying that it would be "a very difficult task" to prevent them from crossing the border. Turkey has said it will not allow migrants to enter the country without first obtaining a visa. Germany, however, said on Thursday it was willing to cooperate with Ankara in its efforts to stop the influx of asylum seekers. Ankara and Germany have been at loggerheads over the issue for months, with the two countries accusing each other of harboring terrorist sympathizers. On Thursday, Ankara accused Germany of trying to use the migrant crisis as a pretext to impose a border blockade on Greece and Italy, a move Ankara said was "unacceptable" and "illegal." The Turkish government has denied the accusations. cw/msh (AFP, dpa, Reuters)The EU is also considering a plan to send a combat support ship to Greece to help deal with a wave of migrant arrivals from Syria and Libya. It is unclear whether the ships will be able to reach Greece in time, or if they will only be sent to Italy and Spain. Turkish officials have said they are not aware of any plans to do so, but they have not ruled out the possibility of doing so. Last week, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he would consider sending a "strong and decisive" force to the Greek-Turkish border to try to stem the tide of migration. He also called on EU member states to step up cooperation in their fight against terrorism and extremism, and urged EU countries to "use all available means to protect themselves and their citizens." Turkey, meanwhile, has called for an end to EU-Turkey border controls, warning that they could endanger the lives of thousands of people who cross the sea every day, including migrants and refugees fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, Iraq, Libya and Africa. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said in a statement that she was ready to support Turkey in any way that would help it fight its own war against terror. In a separate statement, German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel said that Germany would continue its support for Turkey as long as the Turkish border remained open and that Ankara did not want to interfere with its operations in Syria or in other parts of Europe, particularly in Africa, Asia, Africa or the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region, where the conflict has been raging for more than two decades. According to Gabriel, Germany's defense minister, Frontex, could not immediately be reached for comment, citing "technical difficulties" in reaching a decision on how to respond to Ankara's request for a naval base in northern Syria. Cw-MSh: "I don't think we can say that we are going to give Turkey the green light to carry out this mission," Gabriel told reporters in an interview in Bonn, Denmark, earlier this week. His comments came amid growing concern over a lack of cooperation among EU states and NATO allies in securing Europe's borders, as well as between the countries' security forces and those of other EU nations, according to Reuters news agency citing unnamed unnamed sources close to Turkish foreign ministry sources. Foreign ministers have also expressed concern about a possible Turkish-German alliance that could lead to an arms embargo on Europe if Ankara fails to act on its demand for aid from the West and other allies.

,"Reference text": " Turkey, Greece seek NATO mission in Aegean, says German official Germany, Greece and Turkey will ask NATO to approve a maritime surveillance mission in the Aegean to combat illegal people smugglers. Greece had previously voiced reservations about the proposal. The proposed mission to be discussed at a NATO defense ministers meeting in Brussels on Thursday comes days after German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutolgu said they would raise the issue of refugees with the Alliance. According to a Reuters report citing a senior German official, initially reticent Greece has now given the green light for the operation, which could see NATO assets deployed in the Aegean in a mostly intelligence and reconnaissance role. Under the proposal, which would need to be approved by Alliance members, NATO maritime assets would provide information to national coastguards and the EU border agency Frontex to combat illegal smugglers using rickety boats to bring migrants to Europe. Turkey would then take back the refugees, as envisioned as part of a 3 billion-euro ($3.2 billion) EU-Turkey deal agreed to last year. According to German sources, the mission would not be similar to the NATO mission in the Mediterranean intercepting migrant boats making the dangerous run from Libya to Italy. However, NATO ships could intervene in emergency situations to save passengers. "It is not NATO's remit to push back or stop refugee boats," the official told Reuters. The mission would use assets from the Alliance's standing naval group, a permanent reaction force deployed in the Mediterranean. The naval group's current flagship is the German combat support ship "Bonn." Denmark has already said it would provide additional ships to the mission, according to the official. However, it is unclear whether NATO members will approve the mission which may fall outside the bounds of the Alliance's mandate. Complicating matters is a long-running maritime dispute between Greece and Turkey over sovereignty in the Aegean, where the two NATO members' jets regularly engage in dogfights. Turkey has taken in more than 2.5 million Syrian refugees, and is a major transit point for migrants from Asia and Africa. More than a million migrants and refugees reached Europe last year, many making the dangerous boat journey from Turkey to Greece by boat. So far this year, more than 340 have perished in the cold waters trying to reach Europe. cw/msh (AFP, dpa, Reuters) "

Kerry is expected to meet Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi and Israeli Defense Minister Ron Prosor in Cairo. The two leaders are scheduled to hold talks on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly, which is due to take place later this week. On Sunday, Kerry met with Egypt's foreign minister, foreign ministers and the heads of state of both countries, the US and Israel, in an effort to ease tensions between the two countries. "We have a lot of work to do," Kerry said, adding that he would be "very interested in meeting with the Egyptian prime minister." Kerry's visit to Cairo comes a day after Israel announced that it would suspend its military operations in Gaza for the first time since the end of a six-day war in which the Israeli army and its allies have been fighting each other for more than a year. Israel said on Sunday that the military operation would continue until a ceasefire agreement was reached between Israel and Hamas, a Palestinian militant group that has claimed responsibility for a series of deadly attacks on Israeli forces and civilians. Israeli officials have said they have no plans to withdraw troops from the territory, but that they will continue to monitor developments closely. A US State Department spokesperson told reporters that Kerry would visit Cairo next week to "discuss what is going on" with Hamas and other militant groups, including the Islamic State (IS, formerly known as the "Islamic State"). Kerry also spoke at a press conference in New York, where he said he was "deeply concerned" by the latest developments in Israel's war against Hamas. He also said that Israel was working to find a solution to the ongoing conflict. US President Barack Obama, who visited Cairo last week, has called for an end to Israeli-Egyptian military conflict, calling for "a peaceful resolution" to end the war. In a statement issued on Thursday, US Defense Secretary Ash Carter said Israel had acted "with the utmost restraint" in its response to Hamas' attacks. Carter also called on Israel to refrain from further military action against the Islamist group, accusing it of "playing a dangerous and dangerous game." The White House said Kerry had been in touch with Israel for several days, and that "it is clear that we are not going to allow any further escalation of hostilities." "The situation is very serious," Carter added, referring to a possible military confrontation between Israeli and Palestinian forces, as well as a potential conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. It is unclear whether Kerry has spoken directly to Israel or whether he has been briefed by Israeli military officials about the current situation, or if he will speak to them directly. Washington has said it is "open to discussions" about how to resolve the conflict in a way that does not conflict with international law. However, it has not ruled out the possibility of an arms embargo against Israel. According to US officials, there is a "strong possibility" that a military embargo could be imposed on Gaza in retaliation for Hamas's actions in recent weeks. But Kerry did not directly address the issue, saying that there was no evidence of any imminent threat from Hamas or any other terrorist organization. Speaking to reporters in Washington on Tuesday, Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman said: "I have not seen any evidence that Hamas has any intention of doing anything that could harm the security of our country." Lieberman, however, said there were "no indications that this is the case at all." He said the government was prepared to act "in the strongest possible way" if it wanted to protect its citizens. Lieberman added that Lieberman's comments "were not intended to be a threat to our national security," but rather an attempt to reassure the international community that Israeli troops would not be used as weapons of mass destruction. Meanwhile, Lieberman also expressed concern over the continued presence of US troops in Syria and Iraq. “We do not see any reason why Israel should not act in this way,” Lieberman told a news conference after Kerry left the meeting.

Israel's army said several militants were killed after tunneling into Israel. Secretary of State John Kerry is due to arrive in Cairo on Monday where he is expected to urge Hamas to accept a cease-fire agreement offered by Egypt that would halt nearly two weeks of fighting with Israel. Meanwhile, the death toll in Gaza continues to rise. Medics on Monday said the number of Palestinian deaths in Gaza has risen to more than 501 since fighting intensified on Jul 8. Most of the dead are civilians. On the Israeli side, 13 soldiers were killed inside Gaza on Sunday, raising the number of soldiers killed since a ground operation began late on Thursday to 18. Two Israeli civilians also died in mortar and rocket attacks. The Israeli army said that more than 10 militants from Gaza were shot dead on Monday after infiltrating southern Israel. According to army spokespeople, two squads of militants were killed after tunneling into Israel. Israel's UN ambassador Ron Prosor, meanwhile, denied a claim by Hamas that an Israeli soldier had been kidnapped by the Islamist group, saying: "Those rumurs are untrue." US President Barack Obama expressed concern about the rising death toll of civilians in a telephone call Sunday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, according to a White House statement. The US State Department confirmed late Sunday that two US citizens were killed in Gaza violence and released their names, but did not immediately disclose their occupations. US media reported, however, that the two were American members of the Israeli Defense Force, citing relatives and friends. "We can confirm the deaths of US citizens Max Steinberg and Sean Carmeli in Gaza," spokesperson Jen Psaki said in a two-sentence statement.

},{"Generated text": " Bashar Assad and Turkey in Syria The Syrian president has been accused of using chemical weapons against his own people. Turkey has accused the Syrian government of being a terrorist organization. However, the government has denied this accusation. On Wednesday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan accused Syrian President Bashar Assad of having a "terrorist organization" and that he was involved in the chemical attack on civilians in Aleppo. According to a report by the German Institute for International and Security Affairs (DIY), the allegations were made against the president by Turkey. The report also accused Turkey of supporting the Assad regime, which Ankara denies. In a statement, Erdogan said the accusations were "baseless," adding that Turkey had "no evidence" that Assad was responsible for the attack. "Turkey has no evidence that the regime was behind this attack," Erdogan told DW. He added that "there is no proof that this is the case." Turkey's accusations are not only baseless, but they also contradict the claims made by German Chancellor Angel Merkel and Turkish Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle, who accuse the Turkish president of "playing a dangerous and dangerous role" in Syrian affairs. DW: Do you agree with this assessment? Volker Perthes: I don't think so. I think it's a bit of a stretch to say that. But I do think that there is a lot of evidence to back up this claim. It's not just about the alleged chemical attacks. There is also the question of whether or not Turkey is supporting Assad in his fight against terrorism. This is something that is very much a part of the ongoing conflict between the two countries. What is it about Turkey and Syria that makes it so important for Turkey to support Assad's regime? The question is whether Turkey will be willing to stand up to Assad, or whether it will stand by and allow Assad to continue to rule Syria as long as he does not commit atrocities against civilians. That's something I'm not sure about, because Turkey doesn't have the resources to do anything about it. We have to look at the situation in Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Lebanon," Ruth Jüttner, head of Amnesty International's Middle East office in Berlin, said in an interview with DW on Wednesday. She said Turkey was "very concerned" about what was going on with Syria and how it was affecting the lives of its own citizens, particularly the children of those who have been killed in recent years. And, she said, Turkey "is very concerned about how Assad is going to deal with the consequences of his actions." "I think he will have a very difficult time dealing with these consequences," she added, referring to the fact that his regime has not been able to control the flow of refugees from Syria to Lebanon or Lebanon since the war in neighboring Iraq ended in 2011. Her comments come as a surprise to many Syrians who had been hoping for a peaceful resolution to their suffering. They are also a warning to Turkey, as well as the US and the EU, that it should not be allowed to intervene militarily in a conflict that has become a humanitarian catastrophe for millions of Syrians and their families. At the same time, it is important to note that Syria is not the only country in conflict with Turkey that needs to be taken care of. As a result, there are a number of other countries that have taken part in this conflict, including the United States, Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iran and even the European Union. These are the countries which have supported Assad for many years, and who are now supporting him in many ways. Many of these countries have also supported him, such as in Lebanon, where he is currently fighting alongside his Syrian counterpart, Bashar al-Assad, for several years now. So far, however, they have not done anything to stop him from continuing his war against Syria. For this reason, Erdoğan and other Turkish officials have criticized Turkey for not doing more to help Syrian refugees in their own country. Erdogan has also called for an end to Syrian civil war, saying it would be "unacceptable" if Assad were to return to his former role as Syrian leader. "
,"Reference text": " A borderline war The crisis in Syria is in danger of drawing in neighboring countries. Despite the Syrian government's immediate apology, the shelling on the Turkish border has led to concerns about possible escalation. These weren't the first incidents on the Syrian-Turkish border, but the fact that several people on the Turkish side were killed by Syrian shells on Wednesday (03.10.2012) has brought the conflict between the two countries to a new level. It has led the Turkish military to retaliate for the first time. Several people were killed when Turkey shelled Syrian territory. But neither Turkey, which is a member of NATO, nor Syria would benefit from a broader conflict. An adviser to the Turkish president tweeted, "Turkey has no interest in a war with Syria." Volker Perthes, director of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs in Berlin, agrees: "Assad has no interest in an escalation," he told DW. "That can be seen from the fact that the Syrian information minister apologized and expressed his regret over the victims immediately after the attack on Turkish territory." Perthes doesn't think it's likely that the Syrian President, Bashar Assad, wants to provoke Turkey to intervene in Syria. "That would only accelerate the fall of his regime," he said. It's not yet clear who was responsible for the shelling. According to Syria's ally, Russia, it was a "tragic accident." Relationship damaged The armed incidents on the Syrian-Turkish border have been going on for months. According to Amnesty International, some 300,000 Syrians have left their country since the start of the uprising against Assad, and many of them have fled to Turkey. The relationship between the two countries, which used to be close, has deteriorated dramatically, and the Turkish government is now openly supporting the Syrian opposition. "Turkey is itself a player in the Syrian conflict," said Perthes. "It provides shelter for many refugees and it's through Turkey that supplies come for the opposition." NATO has lined up behind Turkey and told Syria to end its "flagrant violations of international law." Call for 'great discretion' The German chancellor, Angel Merkel, has also positioned herself alongside Turkey. "We call on all parties to show great discretion," she said in Berlin. The foreign minister, Guido Westerwelle, declared that everything must be done to deescalate the situation, so that the Syrian conflict did not turn into a conflagration in the region. Indeed, the Syrian crisis is not only spreading to Turkey, but also to Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon. According to Perthes, "The neighboring countries are partly victims and partly instigators. Jordan too has taken in refugees and supplies the rebels. On the other hand, Iraq has tended to support the government of Bashar Assad." Even so, he said, all the neighboring countries had an interest in ensuring the conflict was confined to Syria. Appeal to the international community But the number of Syrian refugees is rising by the day. Ruth Jüttner, a Middle East expert with Amnesty International, believes this will continue in future months. "It's important that the countries bordering on Syria are supported by the international community in providing accommodation, medical and psychological care and schooling for children," she told DW. It's an appeal she directs especially to European countries. The shelling on the Syrian-Turkish border has made it more likely that there will be armed conflict between Syria and its neighbors. According to Perthes, "It's probably the case that political resistance in Turkey to intervention in Syria is decreasing right now." "

He added that IS would not be allowed to carry out attacks on the UN-backed government in Tobruk, the capital of North Africa's second-largest city. IS has claimed responsibility for the attacks, which have killed at least 40 people and wounded more than 100. UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said IS was "a terrorist organization." The group is believed to be affiliated with al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), a group that controls the country's oil and gas industry.

Is it a threat to UN peacekeepers? Is IS a terror organization? IS is a radical Islamist group. Its leaders have been accused of plotting to overthrow the internationally recognized government and of supporting the armed groups. They have denied any involvement in any of these crimes, and have said they are not planning any attacks against UN forces in their own country, but rather to attack UN officials in a bid to stop IS from gaining control of government-controlled territory. In a statement released Friday, IS said it had launched an "extremist attack" on UN headquarters in Tripoli, demanding the withdrawal of all UN troops from Libya and the removal of UN special envoy Ban's envoy to Libya in an attempt to quell the violence that has gripped the region since the end of last year's civil war in which thousands of civilians were killed and hundreds of thousands displaced by the chaos that followed the fall of dictator Moammar Gaddafi, who was toppled by a pro-democracy uprising in January 2011 and whose regime was overthrown by an army of loyalists in his own government. But IS denied the accusations, saying it was an act of terrorism and that its members were "terrorists" who wanted to undermine the government's rule of law and protect the interests of its own citizens and to prevent a peaceful transition to democracy and a return to civilian rule.

If IS were to take over the city, then IS will be able to control the entire city and prevent it from falling into the hands of a rival government, said Ismail Haddad, head of an IS affiliate in Benghazi, Libya's state-run news agency, in addition to its allies in neighboring Tunisia and Egypt.

Despite not attending the UN-brokered meeting, the militias have agreed to "a ceasefire on all fronts," according to a statement issued by Islamist group Fajr Libya (Libya Dawn). The only condition is that "the other parties respect the truce." The announcement came hours after the United Nations declared that Libya's warring factions had agreed to a roadmap for forming a unity government. Nearly four years after a NATO-backed revolt saw Moammar Gadhafi removed from power, two rival governments each backed by different groups of militias have plunged the country back into chaos and threatened all-out civil war.

The fighting and violence has displaced hundreds of thousands of civilians, left hundreds killed and thousands wounded. Most foreign diplomats fled the country and shut their embassies last year.

French politicians are expected to vote for the far right candidate in a runoff election on Saturday, with the FN leader facing a hard-fought contest against conservative Christian conservative leader Marine le Pen. "I'm not going to run against the right," said Henrik Uterwedde, head of the German-French Institute for Research in Germany, referring to the country's conservative Republican Party (NRG). "But I'm going against what I think is the way forward for France," he said, adding that the party's candidate would be able to win a majority of votes if he or she could win the election. However, he added that he was not sure how far he would go in terms of winning the popular vote, and that his chances of becoming prime minister would depend on the outcome of a general election, which will be held in May. He said he had no idea how close the race was to being decided, but that it was a "very close race." "It's a very close contest and I don't think there's any way that we can win it," the NRG leader, Andreas Jung, told rbb-Inforadio. Germany's parliament has been divided over the issue of migration since May, when French Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was forced to leave her post due to a lack of support from the French public. In the end, however, it's not clear whether the situation in France is any different from that in other European countries. It's unclear, for example, whether French President Emmanuel Macron will seek a second term in office, or whether he will run for a third term as France's next president. Rival parties have also been split over whether or not they want to take part in an election in which French voters will have the chance to cast their votes in favor of Macron, who is widely seen as a centrist. Some French media outlets have speculated that Macron could be the candidate of choice, while others have suggested he might not be a candidate at all. According to one report, "Le Pen's campaign has received a lot of media attention," with a number of commentators calling for him to step down from his position as party chairman. Another report said that French conservatives were more likely to back Macron's candidacy because of his "extreme" views on immigration and the need to protect the rights of minorities, such as women, minorities and women. A third report suggested that conservative Republicans would have a better chance of gaining the support of voters if they were to form a coalition government with Macron. German media reported that conservatives would also be more willing to support Macron if the president-elect won the vote. Meanwhile, the left-of-centre French Republican party (FRF) has said it would not support a pro-EU candidate, despite the fact that they have already secured the backing of several conservative candidates in recent weeks. On the other hand, some conservatives have expressed concern about the prospect of an anti-European vote in parliament, as well as the possible loss of seats in next year's parliamentary elections. Many of those who have voted for Macron have said they will not back him, saying he should be allowed to stand for re-election. Others have called for an outright ban on all political parties, including the Republicans, in order to prevent him from becoming the next French president and vice-presidential candidate. But the FRF leader has also expressed reservations about his stance on migration, calling it "dangerous" and "unprecedented." The party has already faced criticism from some quarters for its policies on refugees, migrants and other minorities in Europe and in particular the United States. Critics have accused him of being too soft on immigrants and Muslims, a charge that is not supported by his own party and which is opposed by many in his home country. "
,"Reference text": " France's conservatives: Combating the National Front with a swing to the right A staunch conservative is joining the race for the French presidency. Republican candidate Francois Fillon could turn into a big problem for right-wing extremist Marine Le Pen's National Front. France's Republicans are moving to the right: by choosing Francois Fillon, voters nominated a presidential candidate who has a reputation as a staunch conservative. The former prime minister has already announced that he intends to refocus politics with the traditional family in mind. Fillon takes a dim view of homosexual couples adopting children. He wants to introduce a cap on the number of refugees allowed into France, he intends to make it harder for foreign nationals to access the social welfare system, and he wants to put Muslim communities and mosques under government control. In addition, Fillon advocates a renationalization of school curricula. Fillon makes gains in FN territory Fillon's agenda could turn out to be a problem for the "National Front" (FN). The 62-year-old appeals to similar sentiments as the right-wing party's base: concern about foreign domination and loss of identity, fear of terrorism and crime. "For a long time, FN was the only political force that addressed those fears," said Henrik Uterwedde of the German-French Institute (dfi) in Ludwigsburg. "Now a politician has arrived on the scene who addresses those fears using a different language and makes them a political offer." In rural, Catholic France especially, where traditions still matter a great deal, the avowed Catholic Fillon strikes a chord with his proposals pertaining to family and society policies. He receives support from traditional Catholic groups who, for years, have been able to mobilize crowds for demonstrations against gay marriage. During the intraparty election campaign, Fillon predominantly traveled to France's villages and small towns - regions which FN leader Marine Le Pen had labeled the "forgotten France," regarding herself as their foremost lobbyist. "Fillon has made gains in an environment that is also canvassed by Le Pen," Andreas Jung, Chairman of the Bundestag's German-French parliamentary group, told German broadcaster rbb-Inforadio. "He does not represent the lofty levels of Parisian politics, but rather provincial entrenchment. Fillon is committed to traditional values, like the family. Therefore, he may not only be capable of defeating Le Pen, but also of taking the lead during the first ballot." 'Most dangerous candidate for FN' Consequently, the FN camp is less than enthusiastic about the conservative's candidacy. "Because of Fillon, we now have a strategy problem," Marion Marechal Le Pen, the FN leader's niece, recently told journalists. "He is the most dangerous candidate for the National Front." Pollsters' findings appear to support that statement. Recent surveys establish Fillon as the current favorite in the French presidential election scheduled for next May. However, Fillon's election is not a foregone conclusion. By denouncing the conservative candidate as a member of the establishment, FN tries to win over those who are frustrated with politics and politicians in general. There is persistent opposition against his economic-liberal plans in particular. Fillon wants to abolish the 35-hour working week and raise the retirement age to 65 years. In addition, he wants to cut 500,000 jobs in the public sector and reform industrial law. Fillon is known as an admirer of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. "Issues pertaining to liberal economic policy have always been heavily contested in France," said Uterwedde. "Fillon's adversaries have already taken up their positions, criticizing what, in France, is called 'ultra-liberalism.'" That was one of the nastiest words in French politics, he added. An offer for the left Fillon wants to raise VAT by 2 percent. This would predominantly hurt low-income households. Exactly that clientele, however, is wooed by FN with a program that is regarded as rather left-wing. The right-wing extremists are on a clear anti-globalization course, intending to seal off the French economy against foreign countries and exit from the European Union. The party is already trying to present Fillon as a symbol of anarchic, ultra-liberal capitalism. "Francois Fillon will even go beyond EU demands for austerity and liberalism," David Rachline, Marine Le Pen's election campaign manager, wrote on Twitter. According to current polls, it is very likely that Fillon will have to face Marine Le Pen in a runoff election in May. The main hazard for the Republican candidate: his economic-liberal course could deter left-wing voters from choosing the conservative in order to avert Le Pen. "Francois Fillon will have to start making offers, also to those voters who are closer to the center and more moderate," said France expert Uterwedde. "And he will, prior to the runoff election at the latest, have to make offers to left-wing voters - without changing his original course." " 

},{"Generated text": " Effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Austria A new study has found that greenhouse gases in the atmosphere can be harmful to human health. Environmental health specialist Mia Landauer has taken a closer look at the effects of climate change on the environment. In a study published in Environmental Health specialist, Christian Härtel, a professor of environmental health at Vienna's Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IASA), the temperature of the Vienna Woods has increased by more than 50 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) over the past few years. The temperature in Vienna has risen by about 40 degrees since the beginning of this year, according to the study, which was carried out by a team of researchers from the institute. "Climate change is a serious threat to our health," said Mia, adding that it could lead to an increase in greenhouse emissions. However, the researchers are optimistic about the long-term impact of global warming on air quality, especially in Europe, where temperatures are expected to rise by up to 100 degrees C (102 degrees F) by the end of next year. Climate change could also have a negative impact on human life, as the number of people living in extreme heat-trapping conditions increases by 50 percent. But the scientists are also optimistic that the warming trend will continue, with more people moving to warmer climates and warmer temperatures in warmer regions. Environment experts say that despite the high temperatures, there is still a lot of room for improvement, particularly in areas such as agriculture, forestry and water management. This is especially true in regions where the climate is already warming up, for example in places like the Alps and the Saarland region in southern Germany. There is also the possibility of a rise in global temperatures as a result of warmer air temperatures and a decrease in carbon dioxide emissions, says Mia. So far, however, no major changes have been made in this area, but there are still some areas where temperature increases are likely to be a problem. For example, in some parts of Austria, it is possible to build a greenhouse that can withstand temperatures of around 110 degrees (105 F). In other regions, temperatures can reach around 100 F, and in certain areas, they can rise to around 120 F. At the same time, temperature rises in other areas of Europe are predicted to increase by at least 10 percent, leading to higher levels of greenhouse-gas emissions (CAGs) and higher temperatures. That is, if the greenhouse effect has been reduced by 10 to 15 percent over a period of several years, then it will be able to cope with higher CO2 levels.   The study's findings suggest that this could have an adverse effect on humans' ability to adapt to climate-related changes in their environment and on their health and well-being. It also points to a possible link between climate changes and increased carbon emissions from fossil fuels and carbon-based products. A recent study showed that a large proportion of fossil fuel reserves are being used to fuel the development of new energy sources, including coal-fired power plants and wind turbines. These sources could be used for power generation and to power the power grid. Energy efficiency is another important aspect of energy efficiency, said the researcher, who is working on a project that aims to improve the efficiency of electricity generation by reducing the carbon footprint of nuclear power stations and other energy-intensive industries. He said that in order to achieve this goal, energy production would have to become more efficient and more environmentally friendly by 2050, when it would be cheaper to produce electricity from renewable sources and less polluting fuels. What's more, he said, "We need to make sure that we have the energy we need for energy generation in a sustainable way, not just by increasing our energy consumption and reducing our carbon footprints." The research is being conducted in collaboration with the Austrian institute for applied systems analysis (ISA) which is an important step in improving energy conservation and energy security in an effort to address the challenges facing the country's energy sector.

,"Reference text": " Keeping cool on Europe's urban heat islands Due to the drought in Europe, Austria experienced a particularly hot summer this year. Urban areas run warmer due to the heat island effect - and as the climate heats up, cities like Vienna are tackling this problem. Europe was hit by drought this summer, with parts of the continent experiencing the longest and hottest heat waves on record. In the Austrian capital of Vienna, temperatures were well above the summer average - and stayed there for weeks on end. This summer, the city recorded the most days over 35 degrees Celsius - including its hottest-ever night temperature - and medical calls rose by 20 percent. Environmental health specialist Hans-Peter Hutter says that on particularly calm, hot days, recommended public health limits for ozone were are significantly exceeded. And it's not just people with allergies and other conditions who suffer. "We know that in these acute periods, unfortunately, people will die," he says. The heat is becoming such an issue that the government has resolved to tackle what is known as the urban heat island effect. Like most cities, Vienna is hotter than its surrounding areas as a result of humans having altered the landscape, covering the earth with heat-absorbing asphalt and concrete. The phenomenon was first described more than two centuries ago - but global warming and industrialization are pushing it to new extremes. "The densely built-up parts of the city can be 4, 5, up to 10 degrees [Celsius] warmer than the surroundings," says Christian Härtel, an expert in building and planning who is researching this effect and its causes for Vienna's environmental protection department. More green roofs, less air-con There are many reasons for the dramatic temperature differentials between city and countryside. Fresh air and wind don't circulate as freely through cities. Colors and materials play a role too, with dark surfaces absorbing more heat than lighter ones. And due to the sealing over of soils, urban landscapes retain less moisture than natural ones. Up on the roof terrace of the city block where he works, Härtel points to two different roof types. "One is a pebble roof - when the sun shines it gets very hot," Härtel says. "On the other there is a colorful garden with a variety of herbs - I can see mint and over there, sage, chives, we have a water surface and a terraced area. It's a garden in the city," he points out. Vienna's city administration wants many more green roofs on buildings and residential blocks. As global temperatures rise, says Härtel, the need for natural methods to keep cities cool is becoming more urgent. Otherwise, artificial methods result in a negative feedback effect. "It's getting hotter, and so we cool our living spaces by consuming fossil fuels - and so we are then making this hothouse effect even worse," Härtel explains. Pocket parks Vienna's imperial past has left a legacy of grand parks and open spaces. Once, only royalty could kick up their heels in these pleasant grounds. But now, they provide a welcome haven for all the city's residents to literally chill out when temperatures rise. "Vienna has had luck with the empire times, because these places became protected," says Mia Landauer as she strolls through one such grand park beside her office at the Institute for Applied Systems Analysis to the south of Vienna, where she works as a research scholar on climate governance. The city is also fringed by the Vienna Woods on its northern side. Landauer sees this as an asset that mitigates the urban heat island effect. “We might have lost the Vienna Woods many times - but because of this history of Vienna, they realized that it is important to have this much green space in a city." Like in most cities, Vienna's population is growing rapidly, driven partly by immigration and partly by lack of jobs in rural areas. So does that mean the urban island will become even hotter as the city grows? Landauer says this need not be the case - but "the pressure is on" because of climate change. That pressure comes from the conflict between the need for green spaces, and the need to cut greenhouse gas emissions by reducing commuting distances through more dense urban living. Landauer believes "pocket parks" could provide a solution. "That means parks like any park, but of a very small size," she says. It's been demonstrated that in dense urban environments, even small parks can reduce the urban heat island effect. Landauer says these tiny green spaces also reduce flooding by absorbing water, and preventing the overflow of drains and sewers. Not to mention added benefits in terms of quality of life and enjoyment for residents with access to these parks. Cool cities make the most of rainwater While new buildings can be designed with green walls and roofs, it's more difficult to reduce heat in older areas of the city. In Vienna's 5th district most buildings are at least 100 years old, and there are few parks. But a new system could use rainwater to cool this dense urban environment " 

},{"Generated text": " Jochen Langer: 'Islam is the enemy of the people' In Syria, the Islamic State (IS) is waging an insurgency against the Syrian government. The jihadists are using the Internet to spread their message. In the past few months, there have been a number of attacks on Christians in Syria and Lebanon. Most of these attacks were carried out by the jihadists, who have a large presence in the country. But in recent weeks, they have also spread to other countries, such as Lebanon, Turkey, and the United States, where they are fighting alongside the Assad regime. This is not the first time that a group of jihadists has taken to the streets of Damascus. It's the second time in three months that the jihadist group al-Qusayr (Islamic State) has attacked a Christian church in northern Syria. Last week, a suicide bomber blew himself up in a Damascus suburb, killing at least 10 people and wounding dozens more, according to local media reports. According to reports, al Qaeda is planning to use the attack as a pretext to launch an attack on the Christian community in Aleppo. However, it's not clear whether the attacks will be successful. There are also reports that some of them are planning attacks in other parts of Syria as well, including the town of Ma'loula, which is near the border with Turkey. These attacks are part of a wider jihadist insurgency that is spreading across the Middle East and is being supported by jihadist groups. At the same time, radical Islamist groups are spreading their propaganda on social media, particularly on Facebook and Twitter. Some of this propaganda is aimed at the West, but it is also being used to discredit the regime in Damascus and to undermine the legitimacy of its rule. For example, in April, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced that Turkey would no longer recognize the "Islamist" movement as an "Islamic state." Turkey's Foreign Office has also expressed concern about the rise of radicalization among Syrian Muslims. "We are concerned that there is a rise in radicalisation among young people," Turkish Foreign Minister Sadiq Mansour told DW in an interview last month. He added that "radicalization of young Muslims in Turkey and other European countries is an important step in this process." In addition, he said, "It is important for Turkey to recognize that it has a responsibility to protect the interests of all Syrians, not just those who are in favor of Assad's regime," and that this is something Turkey must do in order to prevent it from spreading its propaganda. 'Terrorists' are not alone in their concern for the security of Syrian Christians. They also have an interest in spreading the message of Islam, especially among the young and those in need of protection in Europe. As a result, many Syrians are becoming radicalized and are turning to radical Islam to fight for their country's future. Many of those young men and women are fleeing from the violence, while others are returning to their homes and seeking refuge in countries like Syria or Iraq. And while they may not be able to escape from their own country, their faith is still very important to them, as long as they don't commit suicide bombings and carry out terrorist acts. If they do, then they will have to face the consequences of their actions. That is why we are very concerned about them. We are worried that if they continue to do so, we will see more and more terrorist attacks and attacks against our country and our own people. What is more important is that they cease to exist, so that we do not have the opportunity to create a situation in which they can continue their terrorist activities. I am not sure how long it will take for them to cease their attacks. Is it too late to stop them from doing so? It is too early to tell, however, if the situation is going to get worse. On the other hand, I think it could be a very long time before we see any signs of an end to this war. So far, this has not been the case. Since the beginning of last year, thousands of people have fled to Syria in search of safety and security. Now, these people are being driven out of Aleppo and into the countryside by jihadists who want to take over the city and establish a caliphate there. A new wave of violence is sweeping through the region, with the aim of creating a new state of terror. Not only is it becoming increasingly difficult for people to flee from Syria but also the fact that so many of our neighbors are suffering from a lack of security and economic conditions. Just as we have seen in Iraq and Afghanistan, people from all over Europe are beginning to leave their home countries and seek refuge elsewhere. "
,"Reference text": " Syria's Christians flee rebel crosshairs Groups of Jihadists are increasingly targeting Christian communities, lumping them together as "pro Assad." More than a third of Christians have fled. Some worry about the future of Christianity in the country. In the days after a sharpshooter put his brother in the crosshairs and pulled the trigger, Jalal Gazouha lived as if in a cloud. "I almost went crazy with grief," the Syrian explained on the telephone. The connection crackles. The 29-year-old's brother was killed by al Qaeda fighters in the western Syrian city of al-Qusayr, close to the Lebanese border. Gazouha is convinced that his brother was killed because he was Christian. "They want to drive us out of Syria," he told DW. By "they," he's referring to Jihadists from countries neighboring Syria - with a few hundred from Germany mixed in - who have joined in the Syrian civil war to fight against the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. According to Gazouha, they're also targeting Christians. Twenty of his family members have been murdered, he says. When Gazouha received death threats, he fled the country. "I saw my name on a list on the Internet. That list contained names of Christians who were supposed to be killed, he says, written by "the terrorists of al Qaeda." Jean Kawak, a Syriac bishop from Damascus, chose his words carefully when he spoke about the subject with DW. "We Christians have recently felt threatened by particular radical Islamist groups," he said. Kawak's own sister was forced to flee Ma'loula, a small, largely Christian village just an hour's drive north of Damascus. Islamist rebel groups attacked that village, carried out fire attacks on two churches in Rakka in north central Syria and also kidnapped two Syrian bishops in April; the culprits behind the latter attack, eyewitnesses said, were foreign Jihadists. All of these things, the Aramaic bishop says, "affect our Christian presence within Syria." One-third of Christians have fled the country in the last two years due to the civil war - with numbers increasing. These radicalized groups are not only targeting Christians though, Kawak says. "Moderate Muslims are also being threatened." Fears of displacement Kawak fears that Christian refugees may not be able to return at war's end - something comparable, he says, to what happened in southern Turkey. "Christianity has been there for 2,000 years. And we hope that Christianity is not going to leave that area." To prevent that, Kawak traveled from Damascus to Europe for a short trip. He met with Swedish politicians, German aid organization employees as well as members of Germany's Foreign Office, showing statistics related to refugees and handing out so many business cards that he had none left by the time of the interview with DW. His goal? More humanitarian aid for people in Syria - but also a political solution to the conflict. The West must do more, he says, to bring both sides to the negotiating table. "Reconciliation is possible," says Kawak - of that he is convinced. But what kind of reconciliation could be possible between Bashar al-Assad and the rebels, the latter of whom have rejected any form of political solution that leaves Assad in power? The bishop shakes his head. "You can't make demands before you begin negotiations. A real dialogue has to take place without preconditions," he said. Otherwise, the bishop worries, murders and tit-for-tat attacks will continue for years - perhaps decades - with an unforeseeable end for Syria's Christians. Praying for peace Jochen Langer, Middle East expert at the International Society for Human Rights, shares the bishop's concerns. "The Syrian army is trying, as well as they can, to protect Syria's Christians," he told DW. "But that's only possible to a limited extent." Lately, the regime has been hard-pressed to secure any single area within Syria. Daily, sometimes hourly, the fronts between rebel forces and the Syrian army change. Christians are in particular danger, Langer says, "when they, wherever they live, end up between the fighting." In other words, Christians, like all Syrians, die from the bombs and grenades that land in their villages and cities. In some regions, Langer says, Christians have already been singled out, often by the Islamist al-Nusra Front, a group moderate opposition forces have no control over. But the expert also added that "those could also be very personal acts of rage." Sadiq Al-Mousslie, a member of the Syrian National Council in Germany that forms part of the Syrian National Coalition, acknowledges that there were cases of "sporadic attacks by sick individuals." But were they targeted attacks? "No," he says firmly. "That's part of the Assad regime's propaganda that's been taken up by the West." Behind it, he says, is the regime " 

},{"Generated text": " German court rules against Google Street View in Berlin A German court has ruled in favor of Google's search engine in the city of Berlin. The court ruled that the company had violated the terms of its agreement with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in November 2010. According to the court ruling, the German government had failed to provide sufficient evidence to justify the decision. In a ruling that was published on Tuesday, Germany's highest court said that Google had breached its agreements with Germany in a way that violated German law. "The court's decision is a clear signal that we are in violation of the law," said Peter Fleischer, a professor of computer science at the University of Münster in Germany. He added that it was "unacceptable" for Google to violate the agreement, which was signed by Merkel and other German leaders, in order to protect the privacy of German citizens. However, he added, "Google has a responsibility to ensure that all citizens of Germany have the right to privacy and that they are protected from unreasonable searches and seizures." The ruling is the latest development in an ongoing legal battle between Google and the Berlin State Supreme Court over the issue of copyright infringement. German courts have already ruled on the case, and a decision by Berlin's lower court is expected to be made by the end of this month. Google has said it will appeal the ruling. Germany has long been the world's largest market for search engines, with more than 1.5 billion users worldwide, according to Deutsche Welle's Thomas Hören. It is also the first time that a European company has been accused of infringing the rights of a German citizen to search for information about his or her whereabouts. This is not a new development, but it marks the beginning of an era in which the search industry has become a global leader in search technology. Read more: Google searches for 'Google street view' The decision comes after a series of court rulings that have led to a number of legal challenges. One of those cases involved the use of search results to track the location of people who are searching for a particular location. Author: Cyrus Farivar Editor: Nancy Isenson The second case was brought by a Berlin-based law firm called the Oxford Internet Institute (OxI), which argued that searches should be restricted to only those who have a certain amount of information on a specific location, such as a person's name, address, phone number, email address and social media status, as well as the date and time of their searches. Another case involved Google using the same search terms as other companies, including Yahoo, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Apple and others. Both of these companies have been criticized for the way they have handled the situation in their search products. They have also faced criticism for not doing enough to address the root causes of problems. For example, when it came to Google’s search algorithm, there was a lack of transparency in how searches were conducted. Now, it appears that there is no transparency at all about what Google is doing with its search product. What is Google doing? The search giant is trying to make sure that its products are not being used by people in other countries. That is why it has not been able to do anything about it, because it does not have enough data. And it is still not clear whether Google will continue to work with the government to find a solution to this problem, or whether the problem will only be solved by Google. There are a lot of questions, however, that are being raised in this case. Some of them are related to whether or not Google can be trusted to carry out its own search. Others are more concerned about the legal implications of such a move, since it could lead to an increase in legal costs for users. But it's not just Google that has to worry about this issue. As a result, many people are worried about how Google might affect the lives of millions of users, especially those with low incomes and who don't have access to internet access. So, what does Google have to say about that? Well, I think the answer is: It's a good question. If Google wants to continue using its product, then it should do so by providing a service that is free and easy to use. I'm not sure if that will be enough for people with lower incomes or if they want to buy a house or a car. Either way, we're not going to have any problem with it. We're just not ready to give up on it yet. "
,"Reference text": " Berlin court rules Google Street View is legal in Germany A Berlin court has ruled that Google Street View is legal. But that doesn't mean the lawsuits will end, legal scholars say. A Berlin court has ruled that Google Street View is, in fact, legal in Germany. Last Tuesday, the Berlin State Supreme Court (Kammergericht) announced its decision in a court case from late last year, in which a woman had sued Google, fearing that photos of her, her family and the front of her house would be posted on Google Street View and would thus violate her property and privacy rights. The court ruled that it is legal to take photographs from street level, rejecting her argument that Google was trying to take unauthorized pictures. Part of her argument rested on the fact that Google used cameras mounted at three meters (9.84 feet) high, which could see over her two-meter-high hedge. However, the court did not find this argument convincing, given that the photographs were taken from the street, and not the sidewalk. Furthermore, because Google automatically blurs faces and license plates and did allow Germans to opt-out of the service to have their house obfuscated as well, the court did not find any potential violations. This is the first high-level court ruling, which cannot be appealed any further, regarding Street View since the service debuted in Germany at the end of last year. An ongoing debate Since Google announced plans to launch Street View in Germany last summer, debate around the service has become heated, with some politicians trying to stop it at every turn, while German Chancellor Angela Merkel famously said that she would not remove her house from Street View. In November 2010, the company announced that 244,000 German residents in the 20 cities had chosen to opt out of Street View - less than three percent of residents. However, in Germany and everywhere else, the company also allows people to report abuse, inaccuracies or request that something be blurred using an online tool. "Our job is to develop services that respect these cultural differences," Peter Fleischer, Google's global privacy counsel told Deutsche Welle in November 2010. "We try to anticipate them. We're all internationally-minded people ourselves. We try to guess how people will react to them. But a lot of these services are new and have never been on the market before, so we learn and we adapt as we go along." A 'landmark decision' European legal experts called the Berlin ruling a "landmark decision," saying that this would now become part of German case law regarding property rights. "Yes, other people are now warned: Don't sue Google simply claiming that Google Street View violates personality [or] property rights," wrote Thomas Hören, a professor of media and communications law at the University of Münster, in an e-mail sent to Deutsche Welle. But, he also warned that this decision was very narrow, focusing on the issue of property rights, and not on the larger issues of data protection from Google. "The problem of Google Street View - to be honest - has never been a problem of personality rights or property rights, but the enormous risk of personal data compilations in cases where people use Google Street View for compiling personal profiles (such as building insurance companies; future employees, et cetera)," he added. "And this risk has not been considered by the Berlin courts." Similarly, Viktor Mayer-Schönberger, a professor at the Oxford Internet Institute, agreed that this case was "limited in scope," adding in an e-mail, "The plaintiff never alleged an actual invasion of privacy, just a potential one."

The bank is one of three major banks in Britain to have raised its benchmark rates by as much as 50 basis points, according to an official statement from the British government on Wednesday. hg/ipj (AFP, Reuters) - type-of-x - British lawmaker Andrew Tyrie, who is also a member of parliament, said the move was an "important step forward." "It is important to note that this is a very important step in our efforts to improve the banking system," he said in an interview with British newspaper The Sunday Telegraph, quoting a source close to Treasury Secretary George Osborne, added: "This is another step we need to take in order to increase the standard of living for our citizens." The Royal Bank has denied the allegations, saying it did not have the legal authority to make such a claim and that any such claim would be "completely false" and would not be accepted by British authorities. Tyri said he was not aware of any allegations of wrongdoing and had not seen any evidence to back up his claim. He said there were "no allegations" of fraud, but that he had been told by his parliamentary colleagues that such allegations were being made by people who had no knowledge of what was going on at the time and were therefore unable to prove that they were not being investigated for fraud or abuse of power. His comments came after a parliamentary committee on banking and finance recommended that Britain increase its minimum lending rate by at least 10 percentage points to 25 percent from current levels, a move that is widely seen as an attempt to reduce the cost of borrowing by banks and other financial institutions to compete with one another and to cut costs by cutting costs and raising taxes on the wealthy and the middle class, he told the committee.  hsg/ips (Reuters) – type - of-X - UK Parliament has approved the bill, and it is expected to be voted on by a vote of no confidence in parliament later this week.

They said they would vote against the measure if it passed the House of Commons, as expected, because of concerns about the impact it could have on households' financial stability and their ability to pay for their own bills. But they also expressed concern over the prospect of higher minimum wages and higher living standards for those who work in financial services, they added, pointing out that "it is not a question of whether or not they can afford to live in poverty or if they have to work for a living." They also called for greater transparency in how banks are paid and how much money they receive from their customers, particularly those with low incomes. "
,"Reference text": " UK lawmakers propose jail sentences for reckless bankers A British parliamentary commission has completed its work on the overhaul of the domestic banking sector. Among other things, it proposed jail terms for bankers displaying grave malpractice and causing huge damage. Members of the UK's Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards agreed Wednesday that Britain needed a radical overhaul of its scandal-hit lenders. The panel, which was mostly composed of lawmakers, concluded in its final report that senior bankers must be made personally responsible for malpractice through the introduction of a new criminal offence of reckless misconduct. It would carry a prison sentence. The reputation of the country's banking sector had been damaged in recent years by a string of scandals, including Libor rate-rigging, credit insurance mis-selling and a controversy over staff behavior and bonuses in the run-up to the 2008 global financial crisis. The level of malpractice had been "shocking and widespread," said the commission's chairman, Conservative party lawmaker Andrew Tyrie. RBS cut in two? "Taxpayers and customers have lost out, and the economy has suffered," the 500-page report said. "Under our recommendations, senior bankers who seriously damage their banks or put taxpayers' money at risk can expect to be fined, banned from the industry or in the worst cases go to jail." The commission called for bankers to sign up to a new code of conduct under which all key responsibilities within a bank would be assigned to specific senior officials who would be held responsible. The panel also proposed that more remuneration for bankers should be deferred for longer periods of up to ten years in order to "reflect the longer run balance between business risks and rewards." The commission recommended that the government consider splitting the state-rescued Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) into a good bank and a bad one mopping up toxic assets. The report was published ahead of a key speech by Finance Minister George Osborne on his bank reform plans. hg/ipj (AFP, Reuters) "

The ministry of economics has been asked to step down from its role in the foreign ministry. Foreign ministry spokesman Steffen Seibert told the Hamburger Abendblatt newspaper on Thursday that the ministry would take over the role from the finance minister. "The ministry will be responsible for the external affairs of all foreign ministries," he said in an interview with the German Institute for Economic Research (DZU) in Berlin. He added that he would not be able to do so without the help of the ministries of finance, economics and finance. According to the chancellor's spokesman, Rainer Bruederle, the position would be taken over by a deputy minister of Economics, Klaus Zimmermann, who is also the deputy chancellor for Economics and Finance. In a statement, he also said that "the ministry's role is to ensure that foreign policies are implemented in accordance with international law and international standards." "We have a responsibility to protect the interests of our foreign partners," said the minister, adding that it was "not possible for foreign governments to interfere in our internal affairs." The minister said he was not aware of any plans to close the Foreign Ministry, which had been set up by the FDP government in 1992. However, a spokesman for Merkel's conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU), said there was a "clear and present danger" to Germany's free-market liberal government, including the right-wing Free-Market liberal party (FDP). The CDU spokesman also pointed to a lack of clarity on the issue, saying that there were "no clear signals" on how the government would respond to criticism of its handling of international affairs. Author: Matt Zuvela (Reuters/dapd/derse) Editor: Sean Sinico The finance ministry has said it will continue to look into the matter, but has not yet decided whether to make a decision on whether or not to open its doors to foreign companies. It is not clear whether the current government will take any action to prevent foreign firms from operating in Germany, or whether it is going to act in a way that would allow them to continue operating as they have done since 1992, when the Berlin Wall was built. This is the second time in less than two years that Germany has had a minister who has resigned from his position. Earlier this year, it announced it would no longer allow foreign businesses to operate outside the borders of Germany. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has called for an end to free trade agreements with foreign countries, and said she would like to see a return to "free market liberalization" in Europe. But she has yet to announce a date for a meeting of EU finance ministers in Brussels, where she is expected to hold talks on a possible EU-Turkey trade deal. On Thursday, she said Germany would hold a referendum on EU membership next year on its membership, although she did not rule out the possibility of such a move. Her spokesman said: "I don't think there is a clear path forward for Germany at the moment. I think we will have to wait and see what happens. We will see if there are any concrete steps that will lead to an agreement between Germany and the EU," she told a news conference in Hamburg, referring to talks between the two sides. She also called on European Union member states to work together to find a common strategy for dealing with global economic challenges, such as the eurozone crisis, in order to reduce the number of migrants entering the bloc. Germany is currently at a low point in its economic growth, with a deficit of around 1.5 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) and a surplus of about 0.4 percent in net exports, according to figures compiled by economists at German institute for economic research. There is no clear timetable on when Germany will open up its borders to international companies, however, some analysts believe it could be within the next few months or even a couple of years. For now, though, there seems to be little chance of a deal being reached, despite the fact that Berlin has already agreed to sign an EU deal with Russia. "

But a leading think tank has warned against giving raises too soon. Germany's foreign minister and deputy chancellor, Guido Westerwelle, has added his support to comments made by Economics Minster Rainer Bruederle about increased wages for German workers. "When the economy grows and this growth is substantial and sustainable, then the benefits of this upswing should be felt by the people who worked so hard for it," Westerwelle told the Hamburger Abendblatt newspaper in an interview. Westerwelle heads the free-market liberal FDP, which shares power with Chancellor Merkel's Christian coalition. Earlier this week, Bruederle, also an FDP member, said in light of Germany's currently growing economy, those economic gains should trickle down to employees in the form of higher wages. Merkel, who is also the head of the Christian Democratic Union, supported Bruederle's idea. "That is something the chancellor sees the same way, letter for letter," said Merkel's spokesman, Steffen Seibert. Not so fast Earlier this week, analysts predicted growth of 3.5 percent this year and 2 percent in 2011. Germany's five leading economic think tanks also predicted that the number of unemployed would fall below 3 million next year, the lowest level since 1992. Despite the current rosy outlook for the German economy, not everyone is convinced that a growing economy should inevitably lead to higher wages. The president of the German Institute for Economic Research, Klaus Zimmermann, warned against reacting too quickly. "I can't support the idea of a general wage increase, I think it is too dangerous," Zimmermann said in an interview with the Handelsblatt newspaper. Zimmermann wasn't opposed to the idea of raising wages, but said he was against across-the-board increases for all sectors and pointed out that not every industry is benefitting the same from the growing economy. "We can't forget that the German economy did not resort to mass lay-offs when it wasn't going so well last year," Zimmermann said. Raising wages in some branches could be a good idea, Zimmermann said, as that would make those branches more attractive option to potential workers from outside of Germany.

The move comes a day after a meeting between the heads of state of Belarus, Poland and Poland in Minsk, was condemned by Western leaders as a "grave mistake." Belarus has accused the West of trying to undermine its sovereignty with its nuclear weapons program, which was launched in 1994. "This is a grave mistake," German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle told a news conference on Friday, adding that the EU would not accept any asylum application from Belarus until the end of this year. Belarus is the first EU country to accept asylum from a member state after the Chernobyl disaster in 1986. In a statement, the foreign ministry said it was "deeply regretful" for the decision to grant asylum to Belarus. However, it did not say whether Belarus would accept the asylum request, saying it would be "inappropriate" to do so under the conditions of asylum. Author: Darren Mara (Reuters, AFP) Editor: Nancy Isenson The meeting was the latest in a series of tense exchanges between Belarus and the Western powers over the past few days. On Thursday, Belarus's president, Alexander Lukashevich, announced that he would seek asylum at the request of Germany, France and Italy. He also said he was willing to cooperate with the United States in its efforts to find a solution to the nuclear crisis. But he also called on Moscow to respect the sovereignty of its own citizens, who have been living in exile in Germany for more than 30 years. Ukraine and Belarus have long been at odds over Ukraine's nuclear programme, with Moscow accusing the former Soviet republics of meddling in their internal affairs. Last week, Russia accused Ukraine of attempting to influence the outcome of a referendum on whether to allow Belarus to resume nuclear power. Russia has denied the accusations, accusing Belarus of being behind the disaster, and has said that Moscow has no reason to believe that it is responsible for its actions. Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that his country had "no intention" of letting Belarus continue nuclear cooperation with Russia, but that Russia had no intention of backing down from its commitments to a nuclear-free world. Ukrainian Prime Minister Mikhail Myasnikovich said Moscow was not interested in giving Belarus a chance to negotiate a new nuclear deal, although the two sides had agreed on the terms of an interim deal before the crisis broke out in early March, according to Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesman Dmitry Peskov. Poland, however, has rejected the idea of granting Belarus an asylum, arguing that Belarus should be allowed to use nuclear energy as an alternative energy source. Meanwhile, Ukraine has called for an end to sanctions against Russia over its alleged involvement in nuclear tests and missile tests, as well as the annexation of Crimea from Ukraine by Moscow and its use of chemical weapons by former Russian president Mikhail Khodorkovsky, a move that has angered the Kremlin and led to accusations of human rights violations in both countries, including the murder of dozens of people in eastern Ukraine last year by a pro-Kremlin separatist group in retaliation for Moscow's alleged support of separatists in an attempt to overthrow the government of former president Viktor Yanukovich. Kiev and Moscow have said they will continue to work together to prevent a possible nuclear war, while the US and EU have also expressed concern about the situation in Ukraine, where the Ukrainian government is believed to be at risk of losing its influence in international affairs, said Ukrainian foreign minister Sergei Ryazanov, speaking on condition of anonymity in order to protect his family from possible reprisals from Moscow. “We are very concerned about this,” he said, referring to Ukraine’s nuclear program.

,"Reference text": " Belarusian president accuses Germany, Poland of coup plans Before being sworn in for a fourth term, the reclusive leader of Belarus fired a warning salvo at the European Union, accusing Germany and Poland of plotting a coup and threatening action against sanctions. Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko was sworn into office on Friday in a lavish ceremony boycotted by Western diplomats. The previous day, the 56-year-old leader openly accused Germany and neighboring Poland of planning a coup against him. "There were [in Germany and Poland] plans worked out for an overthrow of the constitutional order," Lukashenko said in the Belarusian capital, Minsk, on Thursday. "This is not an invention of our intelligence agencies." Lukashenko, who came to power in 1994, was re-elected last month with 80 percent of the vote in what the opposition and international monitors said was a rigged election. Relations between the reclusive Belarusian government and the West have been strained ever since. 'Belarus question must be answered' German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said in a statement that the accusations were "baseless" and an attempt by Lukashenko to draw attention away from his own wrongdoing. "The EU needs to find a clear political answer to events surrounding the presidential election and the continued incarceration of opposition politicians and their supporters," Westerwelle said. A wide-reaching crackdown against the regime's opponents followed Lukashenko's re-election. Hundreds of his critics were arrested and dozens threatened with long-term jail sentences. Poland also dismissed the accusations as absurd and said that relations with Minsk would not be normalized unless all political prisoners were released. Sanctions threat The situation in Belarus pushed the European Union to adopt a resolution on Thursday in support of economic sanctions against the country. The threats earned a sharp rebuke from Lukashenko, who promised the "hardest possible reaction" should the bloc impose sanctions against his country. At the same time, the Belarusian prime minister, Mikhail Myasnikovich, travelled to Moscow in a effort to shore up Russian support for Minsk during its standoff with the EU. That meeting ended with a Russian promise not to impose its own set of sanctions on Belarus over an unrelated spat over oil exports and a commitment to resume a nuclear power plant project shelved after the 1986 Chernobyl disaster.

India's interior ministry said on Monday that it had warned the Myanmar government of its "grave concern" over the situation. "We are very concerned," said Colin Gonsalves, a senior ministry official in the ministry of interior and external affairs, adding that the government was "deeply concerned" about the security situation in Myanmar. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has promised to take action against the Rohingya, who have been living in India for more than a year. But India has so far refused to do so, saying it is "too sensitive" for the country's security forces to intervene militarily. In August, India banned the use of force against Rohingya in Rakhine state, which borders Bangladesh. On October 3, the Supreme Court of India (SCI) ordered India to stop using force. The SCI has said that India will continue to use force if it deems necessary to protect its citizens. However, Indian officials have said they have not yet decided on the exact nature of any force used against them. A UN report released on August 25, however, said India had not made any decision yet on whether or not to allow the refugees to return to their home countries. According to the UN's report, "India is deeply concerned about this situation." The UN has called for an urgent meeting between the Indian and Myanmar governments to discuss the issue. It has also called on both sides to hold a meeting in Jammu and Kashmir, where India and Bangladesh have agreed to cooperate in resolving the crisis. Human rights groups, including Amnesty International, have criticized the move, calling it a "clear violation of human rights." Lawyer Prashant Bhushan told DW: "It is clear that there is a grave concern over this issue, and that we are taking steps to address it." He added that "we have to be very careful about what we say and do not do in this regard." India is also concerned that Myanmar's military might not be able to deal with the plight of Muslims in its own country, he said. Legal experts say India should take a more active role in dealing with these issues, as it has been doing for many years now. They say that if India does not act now, it will have a very difficult time in terms of resolving this problem. There will be a lot of pressure from the international community, especially from India, to act in a way that will not only protect the interests of Myanmar, but also the rights of other countries, such as Pakistan, Bangladesh and the United Nations. This is something that has not been done before, according to legal experts. DW spoke to lawyer Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, an expert on Myanmar law and legal affairs at the International Criminal Court (ICC). He said it would be "very difficult" to say whether India would take any action in response to this, given the number of cases being brought against it. He also pointed out that in some cases, there were cases in which the army had used force to detain people who were suspected of committing crimes against humanity. At the same time, many people have accused India of not acting in accordance with international law when it comes to handling cases involving Rohingya. Many of these cases are being handled by Indian courts, lawyers and civil society groups. One of them is the India-Bangladesh High Court, whose verdict on September 25 last year was upheld by a lower court in August. Another case is pending before the high court. Last year, in an attempt to clear the way for a new court to hear the case of a case involving the alleged massacre of Hindus by Buddhists, several Indian judges rejected the application of an Indian court's order and ordered the trial of two Hindus accused of being part of that case. Since then, some of those accused have fled to Bangladesh, while others have sought refuge in neighboring Pakistan. Some have also been arrested in connection with this case, leading to speculation that they could face charges of murder. "

The government said intelligence data showed links between some Rohingya and terrorism. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government told the Supreme Court of India on Monday that the Rohingya were "illegal" immigrants. The hearing is taking place as Rohingya face severe violence in their native Myanmar. More than 400,000 Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh in the past few weeks to escape military and civilian reprisals that the United Nations has described as "ethnic cleansing." Later on Monday, Myanmar's national security advisor said that his government was willing to welcome the refugees who had fled to Bangladesh back to their native Rakhine state, but that the details of the process still had to be worked out. "We will make sure that everybody who left their home can return to their home but this is a process we have to discuss," Thaung Tun told Reuters news agency after a meeting with British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. It was unclear how this would affect the estimated 40,000 Rohingya believed to have settled in India, including 16,000 of whom are registered with the UN's refugee agency. Read more: Myanmar's Rohingya - A history of forced exoduses The Indian government told the court that it had intelligence data that showed links between some Rohingya Muslims and Pakistan-based terror groups and other international terror organizations. It argued that such links made them a "serious threat to national security." The government also said there was a "serious possibility of eruption of violence against Buddhists in India by radicalized Rohingya." Lawyer Colin Gonsalves, who in a separate case is representing about 7,000 Rohingya living in the northern Indian city of Jammu, countered the government's assertions. "We just want to know: 40,000 people have been here, many of them for the last five years. Have you [the government] filed a single charge sheet, is anyone being prosecuted in the criminal court for being a terrorist? The answer is: no," he told DW. The court has adjourned the hearing in the matter to October 3. Lack of evidence India says it is not bound by the UN convention on refugees as it is not a signatory to the accord, but human rights activists disagree. "The principle of non return of a person to a place where he will be executed or tortured has become a principle of customary international law which India follows," Gonsalves told DW. "And it has attained the status of 'jus cogens,' which is a principle of law that no country can say is not applicable to it, such as torture and genocide." In a communication sent to all states in August, the Home Ministry [interior ministry] said the illegal migrants were more susceptible to terrorist recruitment efforts. But an investigation by Indian broadcaster NDTV found "little evidence of the government claim." The investigation that was carried out at major Rohingya settlements in the country showed little involvement in criminal wrongdoing by the refugees. Lack of any evidence to support the government claim has led to speculations that the Rohingya were being targeted for their religion by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu-nationalist government. "It is really unfortunate that the government is going back on its commitment to refugees which it has reiterated several times in the past merely because these Rohingyas are Muslims," said lawyer Prashant Bhushan, who filed the plea on behalf of two Rohingya men. "I mean this is clearly a case of religious discrimination and an attempt to arouse a sort of feeling of... an anti-Muslim feeling or try and communalise the situation," he told reporters outside the courthouse. The UN's human rights chief last week deplored Indian government's move to deport Rohingya refugees. "India cannot carry out collective expulsions, or return people to a place where they risk torture or other serious violations," Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein said. The Rohingya are an Indo-Aryan people, the vast majority of whom are Muslims. They usually migrate to India through a rather porous border to escape persecution in their native Rakhine state in Myanmar, where they have been denied citizenship rights. They are viewed by the local authorities as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. Myanmar's Buddhist majority is often accused of subjecting them to discrimination and violence.

Myanmar's government maintains the crackdown is part of a counter-terrorism drive, while the UN's al-Hussein has said that it "seems a textbook example of ethnic cleansing." "

The two-time world champion said he had tested positive for anti-doping substances in October. "I'm very happy," Armstrong said in a statement released by the International Cycling Union (IUCU) on Monday, adding that he was "very happy" with the results. Armstrong, who has been doping for more than a year, was among the world's top cyclists at the start of this year's Tour. He was one of the fastest men in the history of cycling, with a time of 1.6 seconds per kilometer (0.8 seconds) and a total of 2.5 seconds on the yellow jersey. In October, Armstrong was banned from cycling for one year for failing to meet the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency's (UDA) criteria for drug testing. It is unclear whether Armstrong will be allowed to compete in any other major sporting event next year. jr/rc (Reuters, AFP, AP) "We are very pleased with Lance's performance," said the IUCN's Pat McQuaid, a spokesman for Armstrong's Armstrong Foundation, referring to the cyclist's participation in cycling's most prestigious sporting events. However, he added that Armstrong had not been tested for a banned substance, which is prohibited by law in all sports, and that the test would not be carried out in his home state of Texas, where he currently lives. That would be a major blow to Armstrong and his wife, Lance, as the two have been married for nearly two years and have two children together. They have a son and two daughters, but the couple have no plans to move on to other sporting activities, such as cycling or racing. Jr /rc, Reuters, Agencies, Travelers and beer maker Anheuser-Busch have also been accused of doping Armstrong for several years, although the company has denied the allegations and said it was not aware of any such allegations against Armstrong. According to a report from the Dutch news agency Rabobank, the investigation was launched after Armstrong failed a drug test in Texas last October and was later found to have used banned substances on his own, according to an investigation by a Dutch law enforcement agency. If the tests were to be confirmed, it would have resulted in Armstrong being banned for five years from competing in an event that is scheduled to take place on October 1 and 2, in which he will compete as a professional cyclist for four years. While Armstrong did not say whether he would accept the ban, his team has said that it is "a matter of time" before he takes part in such a race and has not ruled out the possibility of a return to cycling as long as he is fit to continue racing as an athlete. His wife has also said she would like to see him back in competition, even if it means he has to go to another country to finish his racing career in order to earn a place in professional cycling. But Armstrong is not the only athlete who is hoping to get back into the sport. A number of other athletes have already been banned in recent years due to doping scandals, including former cyclist Robert Downey Jr., who was suspended for doping last year after he failed to show up at a cycling event in New York in 2014. Many of those banned have since returned to racing, while others have said they will continue to do so until they can prove that they are no longer fit for racing in their home country. Some have even accused Armstrong of using steroids to boost his performance. Others have accused him of abusing his right to race, saying he should not have taken the risk of doing so because he didn't want to risk his family's well-being or his reputation being tarnished by his doping. On the other hand, some have called for him to step down from his position as president of Armstrong’s foundation, an organization that promotes cycling and encourages cycling to become a more competitive sport, rather than just a spectator sport for spectators and spectators. As a result, many have criticized the decision to ban Armstrong from participating in events that are not part of his foundation's mission to promote cycling in light of allegations of drug use. "

"Lance Armstrong has no place in cycling," said McQuaid. Addressing his remarks to cyclists, McQuaid said the fight against doping was his priority. "UCI is listening and is on your side. We’ve come too far in the fight against doping to return to our past. Cycling has a future and something like this must not happen again." The scathing USADA report included testimony from 11 former teammates, accusing Armstrong of running the "most sophisticated" doping program in the sport's history.

US Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Texas Governor Greg Abbott (D-OR) were among the mourners at a memorial service for the late conservative justice.

If the election were held today, Republicans would have to pick a replacement for Scalia who died two years ago at age 85, according to a spokesman for McConnell. That would be a difficult task, given the number of Republican senators who are expected to seek re-election in November. It would also be difficult to replace Scalia with a more conservative candidate, despite the fact that many Republicans have long been calling for him to step down from his post as the nation's highest court judge. However, McConnell has said he will not be leaving the post until after the November election, when he has the chance to make his final decision on whether or not to run for president again in 2020. Both McConnell and Obama have said they will seek a second term in office if they are unable to secure the support of their party's conservative base. But McConnell also said that they would not rule out the possibility of another Republican presidential candidate running for another term, even if it meant losing the popular vote. Neither McConnell nor Abbott have been able to win a majority in either the Senate or the House of Representatives. Instead, they say, it is up to voters to decide whether they want to keep Scalia on their ballot or whether to give him a third term. This year's election will be decided by how many Republican candidates are running in their respective states and which ones are likely to get the most votes. For now, however, there is little doubt that the Republicans will have a chance of winning the general election next year. Last year, Republican candidate Mitt Romney won a landslide victory in Michigan, beating Democratic incumbent Sen. Ted Cruz by two votes to one. On the other hand, Texas Republican Senate leader John Cornyn won by just one vote in June. "

President Obama vowed to nominate a successor 'in due time,' despite political opposition. The 79-year old justice died in his sleep, presumably of natural causes, local media reported on Saturday. Scalia was visiting Texas for a hunting trip, and his body was discovered after he failed to appear for breakfast in the resort where he was staying. US President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama extended "their deepest condolences to Justice Scalia's family," White House deputy spokesman Eric Schultz said. Texas Governor Greg Abbott described the conservative justice as a "man of God, a patriot and an unwavering defender of the written Constitution and the rule of law." "He was the solid rock who turned away so many attempts to depart from and distort the Constitution. His fierce loyalty to the Constitution set an unmatched example, not just for judges and lawyers, but for all Americans," Abbot said. Battle for the empty seat His passing is likely to open a new political front between President Barack Obama and the Republican Party, as Scalia's replacement could shift the composition of the court towards a more liberal persuasion. Several Republican lawmakers have already urged Obama to leave the decision to the next president who will be voted in later this year. "The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court justice," Senate Republican majority leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement, referring to the upcoming November general election. "Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president," McConnell concluded. President Obama, however, said he would fulfill his constitutional duty and nominate Scalia's successor "in due time." "These are responsibilities I take seriously, and so should everyone. They are bigger than any one party," he said. Decades of controversy Scalia joined the Supreme Court in 1986, becoming the first Italian-American to serve in the top judicial body. He was nominated by US President Ronald Reagan. Throughout his long carrier, Scalia voted in favor of privacy and protecting defendants' rights, but also against legalizing abortion, same-sex marriage and gun control. He also drew public attention for his theatrical flair and sharpness of tongue, as well as his alleged unwillingness to compromise. In June last year, the nine-person Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage with a five-to-four vote. Scalia, who was in the minority, commented he would "hide my head in a bag" if his own name were associated with the decision. He also said that the majority opinion was "couched in a style that is as pretentious as its content is egotistic." dj/jm (AP, Reuters, AFP, dpa) " 

},{"Generated text": " German Studies in Mexico City: Tonatiuh Ibarra A German Studies student from Freiburg has found a new passion for the language: German. He has been studying German for more than 20 years. "I want to learn German," he told DW. His passion is to study the history of German in the German-speaking country of Mexico, where he hopes to become a professor in German studies at the Goethe Institute. In the past, he has studied German and Mexican studies. Now he wants to pursue a career in Germany, and he is looking forward to working with the Federal State of Baden-Württemberg to further his education. The German language is important to him because it is the only language he can speak in his native Germany. It is also important for him to be able to communicate with his family and friends in a way that makes him feel connected to his homeland and his country. But he also has a lot of questions to answer: How does he feel about his German education? "It is very difficult for me to explain to my family why I am here. I don't have a German background, but I can tell you that I feel very strongly about my country and that my German is a very important part of my life," said the 22-year-old, who has lived in Berlin since she was five years old. She hopes that her German will help her find her way back to her homeland, which she hopes will give her a better understanding of her country's history and culture. Her father is German, so she has always been interested in learning German from her father. However, she is not sure if she will ever have the opportunity to travel to Mexico for her studies, because she doesn't know how to speak German at all. So she's looking for a job that will allow her to stay in her home country for as long as she wants. That's why she decided to take up German as a hobby in order to get a degree in foreign languages. After all, it's a foreign language and she can't speak it well enough to go to a university. And that's not to say that she won't study German again. There are a number of other German students who are studying abroad, as well as some who have been to Germany and Mexico. They are also studying the philosophy of language, culture, history, literature, philosophy, art and literature. These are just a few of the many things that can be said about them. For me, the most important thing is that they are all very well-rounded and they all come from very different backgrounds. This is what makes them so special. When I was a child, my father taught German to me and I learned to read and write German very quickly. My mother taught me German so I could study it in high school. At the age of 16, I started to understand German fluently. During my first year of university I had a dream of becoming a doctor. A dream came true when I got married and my wife and two children came to live with me. We became very close to each other. Our dream became a reality when we were both in our 20s and 30s. Since then, we have become close friends and we've become very good friends. As a result, our relationship has grown stronger and stronger. Over the years I have learned more and more about the culture of our country, especially about our culture and our language. Today I'm very proud of what I've learned in my foreign studies classes and the way in which we are learning about ourselves and how we live in this country," she said, adding that it has helped her develop a strong sense of self-confidence and confidence in herself and her ability to do well in life. What's next for you? Well, you'll have to wait and see what happens in your life after you get married. Do you have any plans for your future? What do you think about your next move? I'd like to find out. If you're married, then you can start a family. You can have your own home. "

},{"Generated text": " Pope Francis calls for dialogue with Russian Orthodox Church Pope Francis has called for a dialogue between Russia and the Roman Catholic Church in Mexico. "We need dialogue," the pontiff said in a letter to Patriarch Kirill in September 2014. Astrid Prange, a journalist for DW, asked Francis if he would be willing to work with Russia to find a peaceful solution to the crisis in the country. Francis said that he was "open to dialogue" between the two countries, but that it was too difficult for him to reach a consensus on the issue. The pope also called on Mexico's Catholic bishops to cooperate with the Vatican in its investigation of the situation in Iguala, which has been the subject of a number of investigations by the US and other countries. He also urged Mexico to take a closer look at its relations with Cuba, Cuba and Cuba. In his letter, Francis stressed the importance of dialogue among the three countries and urged them to "take a stand" in their dealings with each other. But he also stressed that there was a need to be dialogue, not confrontation, and that dialogue must be based on mutual respect and respect for the interests of all parties involved, including the Church, the state of Mexico, as well as the international community. It is also important to note that the pope is not alone in his desire to engage in dialogue. For example, he said, "I think it is important for us to have dialogue and dialogue in order to move forward in our relationship with one another." The Vatican has also expressed its concern about a possible conflict of interest between Moscow and Mexico over the treatment of Christians in prison. However, it has not been ruled out that this could be the case. On the other hand, there is the question of whether or not Russia should be allowed to continue to treat Christians as if they were its own citizens. This is something that is very difficult to do in Latin America, where there are so many different religions and cultures. There is a lot of debate about what is right and wrong in this country and how to deal with it. I think the most important thing is that we can all agree on a common goal: to make sure that all religions are treated equally. That is what we are trying to achieve here. We are not going to allow this to happen in any other country, because we don't want to create a situation where people are being treated differently than they are in other places. And that's not a good thing." In the past, this has led to a series of heated debates about the role of Russia in Mexican politics. At the beginning of this year, President Enrique Peña Nieto announced that Russia would no longer be a part of his foreign policy. Instead, his government would have to decide whether to accept Russia's position as a partner in international relations, or whether it should accept it as an ally. So far, Russia has rejected the idea of accepting Russia as its partner, saying it would only accept a "one country solution." But that doesn't mean it will accept the Russian position. Russia is still a country with a long history of anti-communist policies. What is it like to live in one country? Is it really possible for Russia? The question is whether Russia will be able to stand up to these policies? And if so, how long will it take for it to get to that point? It's a very long time before the Russians will have a chance to come to an agreement on this. If they do, they will not be happy with what they see as Russia being the only country that does not accept them as their own. They will only be interested in Russia. Is Russia a threat to Mexico? In a statement, Russian President Vladimir Putin said: "Russia is an important ally of our country." He added that his country is "not a hostile country to Russia," adding that Moscow "will not tolerate any kind of interference from the outside world." "The Russian government has always been hostile to us," Putin added, referring to what he called the "Russian Legion of Christ," a group of Orthodox priests who have been accused of supporting the Kremlin's efforts to overthrow the government in recent years. Putin's comments have also been criticized by some observers. "
,"Reference text": " Opinion: The pope's impossible mission in Mexico Pope Francis's trip to Mexico is a dangerous mission - a diplomatic as well as political balancing act, one that brings with it enormous expectations. Francis won't be able to meet them, says DW's Astrid Prange. Dead prisoners, disappearing students, refugees shot dead and murdered priests. Mexico has lived through one violent episode after the other. The mood in the nation is explosive. And now this: just a day before the pope is set to arrive, more than 50 people died in the largest prison revolt in the country's history. What meaning does the pope's presence hold on such an occasion? Only one thing is certain: Francis won't be able to resolve the problems of the world's second largest Catholic nation in just a five-day trip. The unrealistic demands placed on him are not something he can fill. Yet the pope carries with him an important message: you don't have to love your enemies but you do need to speak with them. And he's living the example himself by meeting with the Russian Orthodox Patriarch Kirill on a stopover in Cuba on his way to Mexico. Cuba all over again It's sensational! Bannings and mutual ex-communications are ancient history. Nearly a millennium after the split, the head of the Roman Catholic Church and the head of the Russian Orthodox Church are speaking to each other. It's not as if the two will become friends - their positions are far too different. Yet their centuries-old enmity feels out of place and in view of the massive worldwide persecution of Christians, almost unchristian. And both of these church leaders know this. In Mexico, efforts to stem the polarizing forces at play in society have not been successful. The extreme differences between rich and poor are dividing Mexican society. President Enrique Peña Nieto has prioritized economic growth over dialogue with his critics - a group which includes students as well as teachers and union members who regularly protest against government policies. They demand an end to lawlessness and corruption. The presumed murder of 43 teaching students in Iguala in September 2014, a crime which remains unsolved, stands as a symbol of the lawlessness sweeping Mexico. The recent mutiny in a Monterrey jail serves as further proof of the country's shortcomings in regard to human rights and the rule of law. With a visit to Ciudad Juarez and the largest prison in Mexico, Francis will only make that deficiency more transparent. Even the pope of peace has enemies. The route he's chosen to take on his travels through the country has displeased the staunchly Catholic president. A meeting with the relatives of the Iguala victims is therefore hush-hush and participation in a holy mass remains secret. Considering the tense situation in the country, it's still possible that the pope's route will change once again. The church in the pillory Even within his own church, Francis has met with opposition. A meeting he requested with victims from the church's abuse scandal will not take place - a bitter disappointment for many former seminarians who were abused by Marcial Maciel, the founder of the Legion of Christ, and members of his order. It's just one example of how impunity continues even within the church itself. None of the perpetrators have yet to answer for their crimes in court. It appears as though the pope has accomplished more on the world stage than he has brought on reforms to the Vatican. Despite the revolutionary coming together of Cuba and the US and the revolutionary meeting with Patriarch Kirill, the revolution in Rome has yet to materialize. Do you have something to say?

},{"Generated text": " Amnesty International: Torture in Europe is a crime The Council of Europe has released a report on torture in the European Union. The report, which was prepared by Amnesty International, calls for Europe to take action against the perpetrators of the crimes committed by the EU's 27 member states, including Armenia, Azerbaijan, Ukraine and Moldova, as well as the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Ukraine. "This report is an important step forward in our fight against torture," said Carla Ferstman, Amnesty's executive director for the Eastern European region, in a statement released on Wednesday. Amnesty said the report was "deeply disturbing" and that it "represents a serious and serious violation of international human rights law." "It is deeply disturbing," she said, adding that "it is the first time that we have ever seen such a systematic and systematic practice of torture." Amnesty also called for a "total and complete end to torture" in European countries, saying it would be "unacceptable and unacceptable" for European states to be subjected to the practice. According to Amnesty, this is not the case in any other EU member state, and it is "a grave and grave violation" that should be investigated and prosecuted. In addition, the committee is calling for an "immediate and transparent" investigation into the allegations made against members of parliament and the government of Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, Serbia, Montenegro, Macedonia, Russia, Poland, Spain, Italy and Russia to all be held accountable for their actions. At the same time, there is also a growing concern that the US-NATO alliance, led by President Letif Hüseynov, will not be able to stop the torture of its own citizens. US President Barack Obama has said he would not allow torture to continue in Eastern Europe, but that he is willing to do so in order to protect the interests of his own people. He has called on the UN Security Council (UNSC) to investigate the accusations made by some EU states against their citizens, particularly those in Ukraine, who have been accused of using torture as a weapon of war in their own country. A UNSC report has also been released, with the aim of finding a way to prevent torture from spreading to other countries. It is expected that this will take place within the next few months. However, it does not appear that there will be a permanent solution to this problem. On the other hand, many EU countries have already made it clear that they do not want to see torture carried out against them. For example, Bulgaria and Greece are among the countries that have suffered the most from the recent wave of anti-Macedonian protests in recent years, while the Czech Republic and Hungary have also suffered from similar incidents. There are also reports that some of these incidents have occurred in other European nations, such as Romania and Bulgaria. These are all part of a wider pattern of systematic torture that has taken place in many countries around the world. As a result of this pattern, European governments have become more and more reluctant to impose harsh punishments on people who are suspected of carrying out acts of violence against others. This has led to a number of cases being brought to international courts, where the perpetrator has been convicted of crimes against humanity and sentenced to life in prison. Some of those cases have even been tried in absentia, for example in Hungary. Others have resulted in sentences of up to 10 years. But the UK has yet to receive a single conviction for its role in these cases. And the United States has not yet received a conviction in this case, although it has made a few arrests in relation to its actions in Kosovo and other parts of eastern Europe. What is clear is that these crimes are not being committed in accordance with international law and international humanitarian law. They are being treated as if they are crimes, not as though they were perpetrated by a foreign state. That is why the Council is so concerned about the situation in Macedonia. I think it's important to have a clear picture of what is going on in that country and how it will affect the lives of people in those countries," Dempsey said. She added that she is concerned that in some cases, torture is being done in an attempt to undermine the rule of law, especially in countries where there are no legal standards for torture. "
,"Reference text": " Report: Torture is a European problem too A day after Amnesty International published a report on Europe's collusion with the CIA's torture program, the Council of Europe published its own shocking survey of abuse in detention centers across the continent. Prison guards in several European countries carried out reprisals against detainees who talked to the Council of Europe's Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT), the new CPT report has revealed. The council considers this a violation of the spirit of cooperation between the CPT and the Council of Europe's member states. According to the CPT's 24th General Report, released on Wednesday, reprisals were carried out against prisoners in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Greece, Hungary, Moldova, Russia, Spain, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and Ukraine. "Intimidation or retaliation against persons the CPT has interviewed may not only violate their human rights but also strikes a blow to the preventive mechanism established by the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture," CPT President Letif Hüseynov said in a statement. "I urge national authorities to respect their obligation to prevent, investigate and punish such actions." The report also highlighted several problems with the detention of juveniles around Europe, and proposed a series of practical measures to protect young people's rights when detained. Ad hoc visits The little-known CPT, now 25 years old, represents a unique approach to international torture prevention. A team of specialists make roughly 180 visits a year to all kinds of detention centers (including prisons, police stations, holding centers for immigration detainees, psychiatric hospitals, and even social care homes) all across the 47-member Council of Europe - one of the few international blocs that offer platforms for dialogue with Eastern European regimes considered to have poor human rights records, such as Russia, Azerbaijan, and Ukraine. The method combines the carrot of talks with government officials and the stick of ad hoc visits, which all members are committed to allowing into their prisons. Once inside, the CPT also has the right to interview any detainees it chooses - in private, though of course the detainees have the right to refuse. "The first thing to say is how important the CPT is," said Carla Ferstman, director of Redress, a UK-based organization that helps torture survivors. "As a result of their boot work over a very long period of time, the UN has set up a global system which in many ways mirrors the approach of the CPT." But given that the committee has no powers to enforce its proposals to governments, there are question marks over its effectiveness. "In the report, they complain about how some of the recommendations they've made have not been implemented," said Ferstman. "It's a sign that they're a little bit frustrated." But in the long run, she maintains, the CPT has more than proved its value. "The dialogue that they are able to have is really important," she said. "Looking long-term, they have been very effective." CIA collusion, asylum seekers The CPT's report comes a day after Amnesty International released its own report on European collusion with the CIA's torture program. While the CPT's report examines more prosaic day-to-day mistreatment, rather than mass rendition of terrorist suspects at the behest of the US, there are obvious links between the two, since some countries - such as Poland, Macedonia, and the UK - are highlighted in both reports. "What is finally coming out in all of this is that the Europeans, despite all the criticism of the Bush and Obama administrations on the use of torture - so many of them connived," said Judy Dempsey, senior associate at Carnegie Europe. "It's really a double standard. This report is quite damning and quite shameful, and it follows the Amnesty International one as well." The CPT's work also mentions the mistreatment of asylum seekers, a problem increasingly afflicting European countries that take in the largest number of asylum seekers - particularly Spain, Italy, and Greece. "With Greece there are two things to remember," Dempsey told DW. "A - the appalling situation of the prison system, and B - the lack of training among police of how to deal with asylum seekers. Awful things have happened. Parallel to this is the illegal detention centers. There have been lots of cases of terrible mistreatment over the last several years." "Immigration detention is a growing issue," added Ferstman. "In the UK, there was a whole parliamentary inquiry into one immigration detention center, where some of the women alleged that guards propositioned them in order to get quick treatment on their claims. Each country has its own history of torture." " 

},{"Generated text": " Dresden: A history of anti-Semitism in the West Dresden, Germany, is one of the oldest cities in Europe. The city's mayor Helma Orosz is the first woman to be elected mayor of a German city. On February 13, 1945, Dresden was the capital of East Germany. She was elected in a landslide victory over the Soviet Red Army in 1945. At the time of her election, the city was divided into two parts: East German and West German. In the former part of Dresden there was a war between the Allied forces and the Soviets, which led to the creation of Germany's Third Reich. Now Dresden is a city of 1.5 million people, with a population of 2.6 million. It is also the only city in Germany that has ever had a mayor who has never been elected. "I'm not a politician, I'm a lawyer," she said, adding that she had no idea what she was talking about. But she did know that the German government was willing to work with the United States and Great Britain in order to bring about the end of World War II. And she knew that it would take a long time before she would be able to get the job done. That's why she decided to run for mayor in 2005, after the war broke out. Her first term as mayor came to an end in October. Since then, she has been trying to find a way to make Dresden a better place to live, and she's been working hard to do just that. So far, however, her efforts have been met with little success. After all, it's not just the East Germans who are suffering from the effects of war, but also people from other countries who have suffered the same fate as Dresden. Many of them are still living in poverty and have no hope of making it back to their homeland. This is not to say that Dresden doesn't have its problems. There are a number of problems, for example, that are not being addressed by the government. One of those problems is that many people in Dresden do not want to go to war. They don't want their country to suffer from war and poverty, they want it to stay in peace and to have a peaceful future. However, there are also a lot of other problems that can be solved by working together as a community. For instance, if you have to travel to a new country, you can't get to Germany without having to pay for a train ticket or a bus ticket, or even a car ticket. All of these problems are caused by a combination of factors, such as the fact that there is no central government in this city and a lack of political will to deal with them. As a result, people are more likely to come to Dresden for political reasons than they are to arrive at the new city, where they will be forced to leave their homes and work for the next few years. These are the reasons why the current mayor has to step down from his position as Mayor. DW spoke to Yadegar Asisi, an Iranian-German-born artist who was born in Berlin in 1943. He is currently studying at Dresden's Frauenkirche and is planning to attend the University of Göttingen next year. His father, a professor of German history, has also studied there, as well as in other European countries. During his time in office, he worked for several years as an assistant professor at a university in Cologne. When he retired, his father died in an accident and he was unable to take care of his own health, so he had to return to his native Germany to care for his wife and two young children, who were in need of medical care. While he is still alive and well, "he has a great deal of respect for what he has done in his life," says Naomi Conrad, editor in chief of DW's German-language newspaper. 'He's a very good man' In his last term, German President Joachim Gauck has said that he would like to see Dresden become a "great city." "He wants to build a strong, strong city," he says, referring to "a strong and prosperous city" in which he hopes to expand his political influence. "
,"Reference text": " Dresden marks 70 years since massive Allied bombing Seventy years ago, Allied bombers attacked Dresden, killing tens of thousands of people, the majority of them civilians and refugees. Every year, the East German city remembers its dead. DW's Naomi Conrad was on hand. As the tram trundled through Dresden's drab suburbs on Friday morning, a prim, elderly woman suddenly turned to her friend sitting on the seat beside her: "You know, my mother never told me about the bombings." She shrugged, then, after a moment's pause, continued. "It must have been such unspeakable hell that she just couldn't talk about it," the woman said. She was referring to February 13, 1945 - the morning, exactly 70 years ago, when Allied bombers swooped down on an unsuspecting city famous for its baroque architecture and that, until that point, had survived the war mostly unscathed. That was to change in the course of three dreadful days: As the bombs rained down on the city, its churches and palaces were turned to rubble. Up to 25,000 people - many of them refugees fleeing the advancing Soviet Red Army - died in the inferno that raged in the city for days. "There was nothing left, nothing," a frail, bent man with a checkered cap recalled, "just rubble and death." He was leaning on the balustrade of a viewing platform in Dresden's old gasometer, staring down at the 360-degree painting by the Iranian-German artist Yadegar Asisi; sirens howled from hidden speakers and strobe lighting illuminated the ruined churches and black smoke billowing from the burnt skeletons that were once buildings. The man swallowed, his voice hoarse, barely audible: "It's so hard being here." The soundtrack and images, he said, "bring back too many memories." 'So, so many dead' He was 15, he recalled, working on a school essay when the sirens began to wail. He never finished the essay. Instead, he ran for shelter with his family. When they returned home three days later, the roof had been blown off, the windows smashed. "But we were lucky: We survived," he said. "There were so, so many dead." His voice broke and, muttering an apology, he shuffled off. The bombings were intended to break the German population's morale - a decision that to many was incomprehensible, given that the war had long been decided and Dresden's economic and strategic importance was relatively minimal. Consequently, the death and destruction wreaked by the Allied bombers quickly became a tool, first for the Nazi propagandists in the last months of the war, then by the East German regime for its anti-West propaganda, and then later by neo-Nazi groups, who traditionally congregate on February 13. Even today, "the debate continues about guilt and innocence, even about the exact number of victims," Dresden Mayor Helma Orosz told a packed audience, including delegations from abroad, gathered for a memorial service in the city's Frauenkirche, which in 2005 was rebuilt with the help of private donations after Germany's reunification, many of them from the United States and Great Britain. Call for peace "War, hatred and violence begin in people's minds," Orosz said. "We must resist any attempt at once again categorizing people based on their origin and skin color," she added, referring to what has often been described as a right-wing catchall movement called PEGIDA, generally translated as Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West, which has taken to the streets in Dresden since October. Later, on a platform overlooking thousands of people, many of them wearing white roses as a sign of peace while bracing the icy cold outside the church, Orosz called on Dresden to remember every victim of the Nazi terror - a plea that was reiterated by German President Joachim Gauck when he took to the microphone: “We don't want the pain that people suffered here to be misused by others.” Behind him, the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, who, back in the Frauenkirche, had talked of the “miracle that peace in Europe represents,” leaned in closer to his interpreter. Then, as evening fell over Dresden and church bells tolled, thousands - possibly as many as 10,000, according to the city's press office - lined up along Dresden's riverfront, holding hands to commemorate the dead and call for peace as police men dressed in black riot gear looked on. "I can remember it all," Siegfriede Leonhard, a vivacious woman in her late 70s said. She was 7 when the bombs fell, she said, and had been coming to the commemorations in Dresden "for at least 60 years." Sometimes, she said, stomping her feet to keep warm, she wondered whether she shouldn't remember at home, alone. " " 

},{"Generated text": " Afghanistan: Taverna Du Liban in Kabul A Lebanese restaurant in the Afghan capital Kabul has opened its doors to the public for the first time since the Taliban took over power in April. The restaurant, which is located in Wazir Akbar Khan, is one of Afghanistan's most popular tourist spots. It's located on the outskirts of the city of Kabul, just a few kilometers (miles) from the provincial capital, Kabul. "The restaurant has been open since April," said Thomas Ruttig, a journalist with the Kabul-based Afghan Analysts Network (AfD). "It's been a long time coming," he said, adding that the restaurant had become a popular destination for tourists and locals alike. In April, Afghan President Hamid Karzai announced that he would be stepping down from his post as president in order to take care of his country's security. However, the government has yet to announce a date for his ouster, and it's unclear whether the decision will be made before the end of 2014, or if he will step down as the new president. Tauran's opening is the latest in a series of events that have taken place across the country, including the opening of a new restaurant and the inauguration of new government officials. Last month, Taliban leaders announced they would no longer be allowed to open their own restaurants and bars in Afghanistan. They also announced plans to shut down a number of other restaurants in their country. A new Taliban leader is also set to be sworn in, according to Afghan analysts Nils Wörmer, who has worked at the Konrad Adenauer Institute for more than a decade. He told DW: "I don't think there's any reason why we shouldn't be able to continue to operate in this country." The Taliban have been in power since 2012, when they seized control of most of Parwan Province, where the capital was located. Since then, however, they have gained control over the region and have become more and more powerful. This has led to an increase in attacks on Afghan security forces and civilian life, as well as a rise in suicide bombings and other attacks against civilians. At the same time, it has become increasingly difficult to convince the international community that they are not responsible for these attacks. There is a growing sense of insecurity among the population, particularly among young people. Many of them have fled to neighboring countries, while others have returned to their home countries and are seeking refuge in Europe or the United States. For many Afghans, this is an opportunity to escape the violence that has plagued them for many years. But it is not an easy task to get out of their homes and into the streets. As a result, there are a lot of people who are afraid to go out and try to find a place to stay. That's why I'm here. I want to talk to you about what I can do to help you. What can you do? Do you have any suggestions for how you can help? What are you going to do about it? How do you make sure that you stay safe in your own country? I think the most important thing is to keep your head above water. You can't just leave your house and go to your car and drive away. If you leave the house, you're not going anywhere. And if you go there, then you'll never be safe again, because you won't find your way back home. So, what can I do for you? You have to work for yourself and your family, so to speak. Is there a way to make it work? Is it possible to have a relationship with your neighbors? If so, that's the way it should be. How long will it take you to reach your destination? It depends on what kind of country you live in and how long you are willing to travel to. When you get to a destination like this, chances are that it will not be as easy as it was in 2012 when you left your home country and went to Afghanistan to seek a better life. Why is it that people are so afraid of Taliban fighters? Because they're afraid they'll come back and kill you if they see you coming back? There are many factors that can affect the outcome of this conflict. One of those factors is that there is no one who knows what is going on. People are scared of what will happen to them. Some people think that this will lead to more violence, but it doesn't really happen. We have no idea what the future holds for them in terms of security and stability. These are the things that are at stake in our lives. "

Experts don't believe the Taliban have changed their strategy to target more civilians. Dramatic scenes must have played out in the restaurant: Guests sought cover under tables as a group of terrorists shot wildly into the dining rooms. News agencies report the restaurant owner tried in vain to fend off the attackers. He was among the more than 20 people who perished, most of whom were employees at international organizations. The attackers were also among the dead. During the evening dinner rush, at 7:00 p.m. Friday (17.01.2014), one of three Taliban members detonated his explosives-laden vest and blew a breach in the highly secured restaurant. Neither the man-high blast walls, nor the secured access points with armed guards could stop the attackers. The two remaining terrorists were killed later in a firefight with security forces at the scene. No change in Taliban strategy The suicide bombing on the popular Lebanese restaurant, Taverna Du Liban, in the high-end Kabul neighborhood of Wazir Akbar Khan was the worst attack so far in 2014. Afghanistan votes for a new president in April; and the international troops are scheduled to withdraw from the country by the end of the year. Although there are plans for a small contingent to remain in Afghanistan, President Hamid Karzai first has to sign a bilateral security agreement with the United States. But he continues to play for time. In this context, the Taliban may be targeting civilians more in order to drive out not just the military coalition, but the entire international community. Yet "as horrible as this incident is, I don't see a change in strategy," said Thomas Ruttig, the co-director of the Afghan Analysts Network. Similar attacks have also been launched before, "at least 12 to 15 times in the past eight years," Ruttig said. The worst attack was in 2012 at Qargha Lake, a popular weekend destination near Kabul. More than 20 people were killed, all of them Afghans. Extensive security precautions The Taliban, which normally doesn't miss an opportunity for fiery rhetoric, hasn't declared a change in strategy. A spokesman for the Islamist militant group said the attack was retaliation for a NATO airstrike in Parwan Province, a few kilometers north of Kabul. According to an assistant of the Afghan president, seven children and one woman died in the coalition strike. "You have to carefully monitor the security situation," Nils Wörmer, head of the Konrad Adenauer Institute in Kabul, told DW. "But I think it's a bit early to talk about a change in [Taliban] strategy." Wörmer's office lies just a few hundred meters from the site of Friday's attack. He could clearly hear the explosion, which shook the window panes in his office. "It was immediately clear to me that something had happened," Wörmer recounted. But the Konrad Adenauer Institute was prepared. "We had a relatively concrete warning in the last week related to our neighborhood, and we were very cautious," Wörmer said. He met with colleagues in his secured office. Like most of the international organizations, the Konrad Adenauer Institute is also integrated into the security networks. "The security precautions are high," Wörmer said. "But that doesn't exclude the possibility that something similar could happen again." But the Afghan security forces have succeeded in preventing many attacks in the past few months, he said. Kabul residents criticize Taliban An informal, impromptu poll by DW's Kabul correspondent, Hussein Sirat, suggested the Taliban are not winning Afghan hearts and minds with such attacks. "Wherever the Taliban have killed civilians, they have not achieved their goal," said Mirwais, a pedestrian in the Kabul city center. Idris, another Kabul resident, seconded Mirwais' sentiment. "The Taliban intimidate the people so that the security agreement won't be signed," he said. "But the people won't bend to this intimidation." How the international organizations adapt to the tense security situation in Kabul will come after many conversations, analyses, and briefings in the following days. But Wörmer is not thinking about giving up. "We have a clear agenda and long-term projects, which I considered to be very sensible," Wörmer said. "I am of the opinion, as I was before, that what I'm doing here with the Konrad Adenauer Institute is worth the risks." " 

},{"Generated text": " South Africa's water crisis highlights the challenges facing the country The South African government is facing a crisis in its water supply. The country is struggling to cope with rising levels of pollution and rising water prices. Marelize Botes, a researcher at the University of Stellenbosch in Johannesburg, told Deutsche Welle that the situation in South Africa is becoming increasingly dire. "The situation is getting worse and worse," she said, adding that she was concerned about the impact of the crisis on the nation's drinking water supplies, which are currently at a critical low point in their supply chain. In the past few years, the government has been trying to reduce the amount of water that is being pumped into the water system. This has led to a rise in the number of deaths due to the use of pesticides and herbicides, as well as the spread of diseases such as diarrhoea and cholera. At the same time, there is a growing concern over the health and safety of people who drink water, particularly those who have been exposed to toxic chemicals and are not able to access the clean water they need. There is concern that this could lead to an increase in human health problems, especially in developing countries, where the risk of exposure to toxins and other toxins is high. So, we have to take a look at what we can do to prevent this from happening again. We need to make sure that we are doing the right thing and that there are measures in place that will protect our health, our environment and our communities from the dangers of climate change and the effects of extreme weather events, and we will do that in a way that minimizes the risks associated with these risks." The crisis is particularly acute in Somalia, Sudan and Mauritania, according to Eugen Cloete, who heads the UK-based risk consultancy firm Maplecroft. He says the problem is not just in Africa, but also in other African countries where people are suffering from high water levels. Climate change is also a major factor in this crisis, he says. It's also affecting the lives of millions of South Africans living in extreme poverty and unemployment. According to him, it's not only the poor who suffer from this problem, that it is the middle class who suffers the most from it. Many of these people have lost their jobs because they are unable to afford to live in poverty. They have no access to health care, education, healthcare, transportation or other basic services. These are the main reasons why they can't get the job done. And, of course, they don't have the resources to do it all themselves, so they're not going to have a lot of money to spend on education and training. That's why we've got to get them trained and educated so that they know how to deal with the issues that are going on around them. But we also need them to be educated and to understand what is happening in these situations. I think that's a very important part of our job as a risk consultant and one that can help us understand how we're dealing with this situation. Author: Joerg Poppendieck, Sean Sinico Editor: Anke Rasper The problem with water quality is that many people do not know what to expect when it comes to sanitation and hygiene. Some of them have never even heard of it before. Others have only heard the term "water quality" and they've never seen it in any context other than as an umbrella term for sanitation. However, this is something that has become more and more common in recent years. For example, in Kenya, for instance, when there was an outbreak of typhoid in 2011, people were told that water was being used to clean up the streets of their villages. What is more important is to know that people can be trained in hygiene, hygiene and sanitation in order to protect themselves and their families from diseases like typhus and diphtheria. To learn more about this, please read this article: "Water quality in SA is at an all-time low in terms of its quality, safety and effectiveness," says M.J. Bote, an expert in water and waste management and a professor of environmental science and policy studies at Georgetown University's Water Institute. "
,"Reference text": " Teabag filter cleans water with nanotechnology A new water filter developed in South Africa could provide millions of people with clean drinking water. The filter, about the size and shape of a teabag, would be inexpensive, easy to distribute and simple to use. Marelize Botes is conducting a final set of tests on a new type of diminutive water filter before industrial production can begin. The microbiologist pours water from a plastic bottle though a high-tech, teabag-sized filter before analyzing it in her in her laboratory at the University of Stellenbosch in South Africa. "The filter is much cheaper than bottled water as well as any other filter on the market," she told Deutsche Welle. Instead of being filled with black or green tea, the bag contains active carbon granules and is made from nanofibers treated with biocide, which kills bacteria rather than simply filtering them from the water. Nanotech for pennies "This project takes nanotechnology to the poorest of the poor people who live in this world, and it will make a difference in their lives," said Eugen Cloete, who in addition to inventing the filter is dean of the faculty of science at Stellenbosch University and chair of Stellenbosch University's Water Institute. With some 300 million people in Africa - and over a billion worldwide - living without access to clean drinking water, the need for such a filter is huge. When in mass production, the developers said they expect the teabag to cost just a few South African cents (under half a US cent and under a third of a euro cent). In addition to being inexpensive, Botes said, the filter is also easy to distribute to rural area and simple to use as it can be place in an adapter that fits on nearly any regular-sized plastic bottle. Each filter can clean one liter (one quart) of the most polluted water to the point where it is completely safe to drink. Once used, the filter can be disposed of and is biodegradable. African countries, led by Somalia, Mauritania and Sudan, were ranked to have the most vulnerable water supplies, according to a June report by UK-based risk consultancy firm Maplecroft. Decentralized use The filter's small size and light weight make it ideal for rural areas where other means of filtration do not exist, Cloete said. "It is simply impossible to build purification infrastructure at every polluted stream," Cloete said. "So we have to take the solution to the people. The water is cleaned right then and there when you drink from the bottle." The filter is now undergoing testing by the South African Bureau of Standards, after which Cloete and his team hope it can be rolled out to the United Nations and non-governmental organizations that have expressed interest in it by the end of the year. The project grew out of research into larger filters, according to Cloete. "We were busy developing filters for larger applications, but when you do the tests in the labatory you do the tests on a much smaller scale," he said. "The results we were getting on a smaller amount of water promoted me to think about a smaller application." Author: Joerg Poppendieck, Sean Sinico Editor: Anke Rasper "

The data is very, very different from what you would normally see from a distance. For example, there is a lot of data that is not available online. There is also data on how long it takes you to get to a certain point in your life where you want to live. That is, if you can get there in the first place. And then there are the things that you need to know about yourself. Like, for instance, how much time you spend on your phone. How long does it take to reach that point? I don't know. But I do know that it is going to be a long time before I can reach the point where I feel like I am on my own. I know I'm not the only one who feels that way, but I think it's important to remember that we are all in this together. We all have our own strengths and weaknesses, and that's what makes us so special. So we can all relate to each other in some way. It's not like we're all the same person, right? That's because we all are different people, so we have different strengths that make us different. One of those strengths is our ability to communicate with one another, which is what we do best. In other words, we communicate in a way that allows us to express ourselves in terms of our feelings. This is something that can only be achieved through communication, communication and communication. Communication is the key to understanding what is happening in our lives.Communication is important, because communication is key. Communicating is critical, as is communication between the two sides of the conversation, especially when it comes to communication with the other side of things, such as social media, email, social networks and so on.This is where communication comes into play. You can talk about it in detail, or just by looking at it from the perspective of a person who has never been in contact with another person and who knows what will happen when they reach a point of no return. What is it about communication that makes communication so important? Communication between two people who have never met and are not connected in any way at all can be very difficult, even if it means communicating through a phone call or a text message to someone who does not know what to say or how to do it, etcetera.And then it all comes down to one thing, namely communication: communication! Communication with people that are communicating clearly and clearly, including communication through text messages or through pictures or video, both of which are important in communicating effectively and also communication channels that work well together and communicate effectively, that works well for both parties.That is why communication matters so well, in many ways, it does wonders for the relationship between people and the world, particularly when communicating directly and effectively.But communication also matters, too, when communication becomes difficult and communicates effectively between individuals and groups of people.So communication needs to improve communication skills are key in order for communication to function well and to work effectively together, says the authors of this piece of paper.It's also important that communication can also be communicated through channels, like email or text messaging, to other people so that people can communicate directly. Because communication communicates clearly between them, they communicate easily and efficiently. Also communication must also communicate clearly. communication communication should be important communication among people communicating securely and securely, this is how communication works, not just communication in general, said the author of that paper and this paper, the paper itself, together with data and information from other sources and data sources like this one and more. and therefore communication of information is essential. Read it carefully and carefully here and obviously, everything else that matters. Then it gets better and becomes important and then you get better communication and finally, ultimately, is good news for everyone else.., and ultimately — and sometimes both, respectively — is bad news and is great for everybody else, alike.

It's very easy and the best bit is, it can be reused. Maybe it will come back to you on your birthday. 1. All you need is a piece of fabric big enough to wrap your gift, a ribbon long enough to go right around it, and if you want to make a gift tag, you will also need a piece of old cardboard, a hole punch and another small piece of ribbon. Ready? 2. No, wait, we forgot the present. Get that, and you have everything you need. Spread the fabric on the ground and put your gift on top 3. Fold the fabric around the gift you are wrapping 4. With the last little bit, you don't tuck it under, but create a little flap on top 5. Fold that flap over like this 6. Take one end of the parcel and tuck the fabric inside, BEHIND the gift inside 7. You can take your time to wiggle it all inside. Make it as flat as you can 8. Once it is all inside, turn to the other end and do the same thing again 9. When you have done both ends, it should look like this. Your present is all tucked up inside and you don't need any tape to keep it closed 10. Now for the ribbon. Place the gift on top of it 11. Tie the bow 12. So it looks like this. Finished? If you want a gift tag, that comes now. If you don't you're done! 13. Cut a piece out of an old cardboard box and make a hole in it using a hole punch. Watch your fingers though ;) 14. Put a piece of short ribbon through your hole 15. Tie the tag to your gift 16. And you are finished! P.S. You can either ask your friend to reuse the fabric, and show them how to wrap with it, or if they don't like that idea, you can take it home with you to use again the next time. And remember, you don't have to buy the fabric. You can use an old pillow case, an old t-shirt or skirt, or whatever you want. You can even make your ribbon from an old t-shirt if you don't have any. Happy wrapping. " 

},{"Generated text": " German court rules against Turkey's EU membership The European Court of Justice has ruled against Germany's membership of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA). German courts have ruled that Germany should not be included in the 28-member association. The court ruled on Thursday that German membership should be excluded from the EU's free trade agreement (FTA) with Turkey. "Germany is not a member of this association," the Goethe Institute said in a statement. Germany is the only EU member to have joined the FTA, which was created in 1970 with the aim of creating a single market for goods, services and services from Germany to the United States, Switzerland, Australia, Canada, Japan, Israel and New Zealand. But the court said Germany was not entitled to membership in any of these countries, and that it would have to be allowed to participate in other member states' trade agreements. In the case of Turkey, Germany would be the first country to join the ETA without the support of a European Union member state. However, the decision to exclude Germany from membership was seen as an attempt by Ankara to weaken the bloc's ability to compete with other EU members. It was also seen by some observers as a move by Turkey to strengthen its position in EU-Turkey relations. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said that she will not allow Germany and other European countries to enter into a free-trade agreement if Turkey does not agree to its terms of accession. European court ruling The decision by the German court of justice comes after a series of rulings by European courts in recent years, including one in 2007 that found that Turkey had violated EU rules on free movement of people (FTAs) and the right to self-determination of citizens (TFTs). The case was brought by a group of German citizens who had been living in Turkey for more than a decade. They said they had not been able to obtain a visa to travel to Turkey because they were afraid of losing their jobs. slk/xx (AFP, AP, dpa, KNA) Slk, who asked for anonymity to discuss the matter, said it was "unfortunate" that a court in Germany had ruled in favor of Germany, but added that "it was a mistake" to allow the courts to rule against the country's entry into the union without a license to do so. Slovakia, Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Switzerland were among the countries that had applied for membership, while Australia and Canada were denied entry. Slovakian prosecutors said the move was politically motivated, adding that they did not want to risk losing the rights of European citizens to vote on the issue of free and fair trade in their home countries.Slk-xx, bp, kNA, AFP, news agency AFP/AP, pd/kNA (Reuters, smh/jd, Reuters, euw/iStockphoto) The EU has been trying to prevent Turkey from entering into an FTA with Germany since 1970, when it signed a deal with Japan and South Korea to open up trade between the two countries in exchange for free access to EU markets. Earlier this year, however, Turkey announced it had decided to withdraw from an agreement that would allow it to continue to operate as part of its free association, although it has yet to make a formal decision on whether or not the agreement would remain in force until the end of 2007. Slkl/x (AP/dpa), knh, a Reuters newswire, sjf/y (EPA, PT, DPA), the AFP-EFE/KNA), Reuters News Agency, was unable to immediately confirm the ruling, citing a lack of information from German prosecutors. On Thursday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said his country would not accept membership. He also said he would appeal to European Parliament to approve the deal, saying it "would be unfair" for the Turkish government to refuse to give up its rights to free market access in its home country. Turkey has denied the allegations, accusing Germany of violating EU law by refusing to recognize its own obligations under the Free Association agreement. "
,"Reference text": " European court overturns law requiring German-language skills for spouse visas The European Court of Justice has overturned a German law requiring foreign spouses from certain non-EU countries to take a language test before receiving a visa. The ruling primarily affects Germany's Turkish minority. The European Union's highest court on Thursday ruled in favor of a Turkish citizen, who was denied a visa to live in Germany with her husband, because she was illiterate and therefore unable to demonstrate basic German-language skills. According to the court, a lack of language skills shouldn't automatically lead to the rejection of an entry visa application. Instead, Germany must consider the unique circumstances of each individual case. The court went on to say that quickly granting visas for spouses improves the quality of life and promotes the integration of foreign residents. Specifically addressing the case of the Turkish plaintiff, the court ruled that the rejection of her visa had violated a bilateral treaty between Turkey and the EU. In 1970, Brussels and Ankara agreed not to tighten their residency laws for each other's citizens. Law only applies to some In 2007, Germany introduced the requirement that spouses from certain non-EU countries must demonstrate a basic grasp of German before being granted a visa to live in Germany with their husbands or wives. Spouses affected by the law are required to obtain a basic language certificate from recognized centers, such as Germany's Goethe Institute, proving that they have an A1 level, or "Beginning German" language ability. The German government claims that the goal of the language requirement is to prevent forced marriages as well as marriages made simply for the sake of obtaining a visa. Citizens of European Free Trade Association (EFTA) member states are exempt from the language requirement. That includes Iceland, Lichtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. In addition, citizens of Australia, Canada, Israel, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea and the United States also don't have to demonstrate German-language skills. slk/xx (AFP, AP, dpa, KNA) "

The Bavarian side, who have won the league for the first time in three seasons, have been knocked out of the top flight by Hoffenheim in September. Bayern, however, are still in contention for a spot in next season's Champions League, where they will play host to the German league's top-seeded side on Saturday. "We have a lot of work to do," Bayern coach Jose Manuel Neuer said after the match, adding that he was "very pleased" with the way his side had responded to their first defeat in four years. He added that "we have to work hard" in order to get back on track, and that is what he has been doing since the end of September, when he scored his first goal for his club in a 3-2 win over FC Augsburg at the age of 19. It was his second goal in as many games for Bayern this season, having scored twice in his last three games. But it was not enough to convince him to stick with his team, which has lost three of its last four league games and is now in danger of being relegated. In the second half, Bayern were forced to settle for just one point from their last five games, as they lost at home to Mainz and Frankfurt respectively. That was the only goal they scored in their previous three matches, but they still managed to hold on to a one-goal lead at halftime. They were also able to keep a clean sheet, with Mario Gomez and Phillipp Lahm also on target for their side. However, they were unable to find a way past the visitors' penalty area, despite the fact that they had a number of players on the pitch who had been playing in front of them for some time. Goalkeeper Ribery, meanwhile, was on hand to make sure that the scoreline remained the same, scoring a goal and setting up a second for Cisse to equalize with a shot from close range.

"[W]e are in good shape," added the coach, pointing to his squad's form in recent weeks. Defensively, though, the team has struggled to cope with injuries and the loss of several key players, including the likes of defender Franck Ribéry and midfielder Phillip Lahmann. On the other hand, it is not as if Bayern have given up hope of making it back to Europe, given that it has already lost its first two Bundesliga matches in Europe. For the third time this year, a German club has failed to win a single Bundesliga match in its past four seasons. Last year's Bundesliga title was decided by a penalty shootout between Bayern and Cologne, in which Cologne lost to Cologne. This year the club is hoping to avoid a repeat of that fate, after losing to Frankfurt last year and drawing with Cologne last time out.

Slovakia's prime minister will visit the Iranian capital of Isfahan, where he will meet with Iranian President Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and other officials. Slovaks have long been wary of Iran's influence in the Middle East. In May, Slovakia announced that it would ban paragliders from entering the country. The move came after a series of protests by pro-Iranian politicians, including the head of the opposition Bratislava's parliament, who had called for a referendum on the issue. "We are very concerned about the political situation in Slovakia and the situation there," said Slovaker Josh Fattal, a member of parliament from the city's upper house, in an interview with the BBC's "Newsnight" program. He added that Slovakia would not allow the Iranians to enter Slovakia unless they were willing to give up their country's sovereignty, which they have not been able to do since 2009, when they fled Iraq, Iraq and Oman. A number of Slovakers have also been arrested in Iran over the past two years, with one of them, Amir Hekmati, accused of plotting to overthrow the government in 2009 and 2011. lw/ipj (Reuters, dpa) - type-footer: Shane Bauer, an Iranian-American citizen who has been living in exile for more than a decade, said he was "very concerned" by the prospect of a return to his homeland. But he also said that he did not see any reason why the U.S. government should not be allowed to intervene militarily, he said, adding that the United States would have to step up its efforts to prevent the return of Iranian troops to Slovakia. 'We don't want to see this happen again,' he added, referring to the US intelligence agency's assessment that Iranian forces were planning to attack Slovakia in 2011 and 2010, and that they would be responsible for the deaths of 1.56 million US dollars ($756,000 euros) and 1-million euros (1.0-kilogram) of American troops stationed in southern Iran, as well as in Oman, Libya, Oman and Syria, according to a CIA report released on Sunday. It said the Americans had been planning the attack for several months, but had not yet made a decision on whether or not to allow it to take place. However, the report said there was a "strong possibility" that a deal could be reached, given the high level of cooperation between the two countries and a willingness by both sides to cooperate in a way that would allow Slovakia to protect its citizens from being targeted by a hostile foreign power. If the deal is struck, it will be the first time Slovakia has had to deal with such a threat since the end of World War II in 1991. That is because it is a country with a long history of war crimes against its own citizens, such as the murder of hundreds of thousands of people in Iraq or the kidnapping and torture of millions of innocent civilians in Afghanistan and in other conflicts in recent years. At the same time, there is also the possibility of an attack on Slovakia by Iranian soldiers stationed at the border with Iran. There is no evidence that any of these attacks have been carried out in any way, even though they are believed to have taken place during the summer of 2009. Last year, Iranian officials accused Slovakia of planning a coup against the democratically elected government of President Hosni Mubarak, accusing it of trying to influence the elections in order to win the popular vote in favor of Assad's re-election. They also accused the regime of financing the coup attempt, saying it was an attempt to undermine the democratic process in which the president was elected. According to one intelligence source, "the regime is not going to accept a vote of no confidence in its ability to carry out its democratic reforms." In addition, some observers believe that this could lead to an increase in anti-government protests, particularly in areas where the incumbent government is in power and where there are high levels of corruption. Some observers, however, see the Slovaking government's involvement as a potential threat to national security. "

They were originally arrested for taking photographs of restricted areas. Slovak citizens detained by the Iranian authorities on suspicion of taking photographs out of bounds have returned home, said Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico. Eight people in total were arrested in May after taking photographs of restricted areas. A Slovakian news website said the group was detained near the central city of Isfahan, where Iran has nuclear facilities. The six that have been freed attended a news conference held by Prime Minister Fico in the capital, Bratislava on Sunday. Fico told reporters that the government was working to secure the release of the remaining two paragliders who are stiil in custody. "Negotiations were fair and their result is the release of six out of eight detainees," Fico was quoted as saying on the government's website. He added that Slovakia had not made any "financial commitments" in the negotiation process. Detainees 'unaware' of rule-breaking One of the released paragliders, Vladislav Frigo, said the group did not break any rules it was aware of. "We had information that there was a ban on taking photographs below the height of 2,300 metres. We were taking pictures from higher (altitudes)," said Frigo. He added that the detainees were well treated, had access to television, a refrigerator and could cook for themselves as well as getting regular meals. Foreign nationals accused of spying In recent years, Iran has levelled accusations of espionage against both foreign nationals and Iranians. Two U.S. citizens - Josh Fattal and Shane Bauer - were sentenced to eight years in jail for spying after being arrested while hiking along the Iraq-Iran border in 2009. They denied espionage - neighbouring Oman helped secure their release in 2011 by posting bail of 1-million US dollars (756,000 euros). Last year, Iranian-American Amir Hekmati was sentenced to death for spying for the CIA, but judges overturned the decision and ordered a retrial. lw/ipj (Reuters, dpa) " 

},{"Generated text": " France's National Front candidate is a political amateur, but he has a lot to prove. The French presidential candidate, Emmanuel Macron, is an aspiring politician from the French Fifth Republic. He has the backing of the European Union, France's largest trading partner, and the country's second-largest economy. But he's not the only candidate who has had a difficult time in the first half of his campaign. French political student Thibault Cirier, who is studying economics at the Elysee in Paris, has also had trouble in his first few days in office. "I'm not a politician, I'm a journalist," he told DW in an interview on Tuesday, adding that he doesn't want to be a "political amateur." "But I have to say that I am very happy with the results of my first round of interviews. I think it's a good thing that the candidates have a chance to show that they are serious about what they want. They have the potential to make a real difference in France. And they've got the votes to do that." But it is not just Macron who needs the support of French voters. It's also Francois Fillon and Jean-Luc Melenchon, the two leading candidates for the right-wing party, which is currently in second place in opinion polls. Both candidates are running on a platform of economic growth and social justice, while the far-right candidate Marine Le Pen has been campaigning on the same platform for years. What's different about Macron's platform is that it has more of an appeal to voters than his own. For example, if he wins the presidential election, he'll be able to put his name to the ballot box and win a majority of votes. That's why he needs to win the popular vote, as well as the general election. If he does, it will be because he wants to give France a better chance of winning the next election than the current one. So far, so good. In the polls, Macron has won the most votes of any candidate so far. However, there is still a long way to go before he can become a serious contender for a third term. There are a number of candidates who have already made it into the second round. One of them is François Mitterrand, a former finance minister who was elected to parliament last year. Another is Francois Pena, an economics professor at Paris' Ecole des Beaux-Arts who hopes to become the party's next president. His party is far from being a party of populists. Instead, they're running as far as they can go in order to stay in power. This is because they don't have enough money to pay for their own party. Macron is the candidate of choice for both candidates, with a total of 1 million euros ($1.1 million) for each candidate's ticket, according to a poll conducted by the centrist Les Republicains party (Le Pen's party), and a further 1,000 euros for every candidate. At the moment, however, that's too little, too late for Macron to get a clear majority in parliament. As a result, his chances of becoming a candidate are very low. On the other hand, many voters are hoping that Macron will win his party in a landslide. Many of those who voted for him are still undecided about whether or not he should run for re-election. Some of these undecided voters, for instance, are in favor of Macron. Others are against the idea of a second term and want him to run as an independent candidate instead of as a centrist. These are the kind of people who can't be counted on to vote for themselves, or who are willing to stand up for what is right and what's wrong with them. Even if Macron wins, people will still be skeptical about his ability to form a government that will work for them, especially if they believe he is too far away from their values and interests. A third candidate has already been named for his or her views on social issues, such as climate change, immigration and human rights. Despite the fact that France is facing a crisis of its own, French politicians are not afraid to speak out about their concerns about the future of their country. "
,"Reference text": " French presidential debate does little to woo undecided voters This year's French presidential race is perhaps the most closely watched election in recent history. Many voters are still undecided, including those in the Paris café where DW's Jake Cigainero saw the latest TV debate. Just over two weeks ahead of the first round of voting in France's presidential election, all 11 candidates met for the second televised debate of the campaign. It was the first time in the history of French elections that the entire official ballot shared a television stage. This race for the Elysee is perhaps the most closely watched election in the history of the Fifth Republic in view of conservative candidate Francois Fillon's embezzlement charges, the deterioration of the left, political amateur Emmanuel Macron's surprise surge to the top, and the rise of Marine Le Pen's National Front. With so much media attention on the five main candidates, Tuesday's debate felt almost like a consolation for the six other candidates rarely in the spotlight. For French voters watching the televised debate at Cafe des Phares on Place de la Bastille, the saturated stage kept the candidates from detailed discussion of pressing issues. For those who are still undecided, the debate did little to bring them closer to choosing their pick for president. Vincent Couronne, a researcher, said it was good to see candidates who don't get as much media attention. However, 11 candidates at once for the political spectator was overkill. "It wasn't very interesting. It's just one position after another. There's no real debate. It's not like when it was just five candidates." Boredom all round Charlotte Theuvenin and her friends, all students in their early 20s, tuned out early on from boredom and exasperation. "It was too flat and too hypocritical. Fillon and Le Pen play with our money, then say they did nothing and that they are good for our country," she said. As though addressing the candidates in front of her on the TV screen, she added, "How dare you talk about being president when you use our money for your own interests." Le Pen had come under fire over accusations that she misused public funds to pay bodyguards as parliamentary assistants. Francois Fillon of Les Republicains, meanwhile, is under investigation for allegedly paying family members more than 1 million euros ($1.1 million) for government work they never carried out. Frequently casting a blank stare at his opponents, Fillon also seemed bored, or at least more subdued compared to the first debate. Couronne said, "Fillon seems to be not there. Probably because he knows all the small candidates can attack him on the criminal offenses he's accused of." Debate watchers cited Europe as the most important issue of this election, with many fearing Le Pen's promise to tear France out of the European Union in a so-called Frexit. Though no one at the cafe vocally supported Le Pen's plan, several acknowledged the EU is a pressure point for France. "France's place in Europe in relation to Germany is a very important issue," said student Thibault Cirier. "The general problem is France has lost its influence at the European level over the years, and that needs to be remedied, because France is one of the founders of Europe and should have a strong place in the union. The EU is also important for cohesion and to have a strong position internationally." Café viewers say no to Le Pen Cirier was initially excited by Macron when he launched his campaign, but ultimately decided there was no substance. Now he says he will probably vote for far-left candidate Jean-Luc Melenchon. Kevser Taspinar also said she liked Melenchon for his fighting spirit and that "he throws barbs." As a practicing Muslim who wears a headscarf, she said the most important issue for her is laicite, France's state institution of secularism. "For me Hamon has the best interpretation of this. Maybe Hamon," Taspinar said hesitating. "I'm still undecided, because there's Melenchon." Another viewer, Marie Dubois, said that although she really liked Melenchon, she had definitively decided on Macron. "Melenchon has a way of putting humanity in politics and giving hope," she said. "But Macron is the only possible candidate." With polls putting Le Pen and Macron in the second round on May 7, the undecided voters at this Paris cafe said they were certain which candidate they would not for vote for in that scenario. "Definitely Macron. There is no way I am going to vote for Le Pen," Theuvenin said. "I will never vote for that woman or Front National, no matter who is running against them in the second round." Tuesday was the final debate for Macron and Melenchon, two of the crowd-pleasers among the candidates. Both have pulled out of the third debate on grounds that it cuts too close to the first vote just two days later on April 23. " 

},{"Generated text": " German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble resigns as interior minister The German Interior Ministry has announced the resignation of the German Police Officers' Union (DFU), which represents German police officers in Berlin. The resignation comes after a series of scandals over the past two years. In 2006, Germany's interior ministry announced that it would no longer be responsible for the deaths of German policemen in the city of Frankfurt am Main. According to a statement released by the ministry on Tuesday, the number of deaths in Germany in 2006 had risen by more than 10,000. "We have a very serious problem," said the statement, which also said that the police force had suffered a "severe and serious" loss of life. It was also the first time in German history that a police officer had been killed in an accident. Last year, police in Hanover, Düsseldorf, Bremen and Bergisch Gladbach were among the worst hit, according to police union leader Konrad Freiberg, who was killed by a stray bullet in 2005. He added that he was "very concerned" about the situation in his city, adding that "it was very difficult" for him to find a replacement for Körting. But he said he would continue to work with the union to try and find new solutions to the problem, and that there would be "a lot of work" to be done to make it a better place to live and work. A new police chief has also been appointed to fill the role of chief of police, but he has yet to receive a formal mandate from the federal government. His predecessor, Erhart Köhler, has been in office since 2005, when he took over as the country's top police official. On Tuesday he resigned from his post at the end of 2006 and was replaced by former police commissioner Konstantin Kürting, a former SPD member who has since left the SPD and joined the Federalist Party (SPD). The SPD leader, however, remains in a position of strength to take on a new role. Kühler is the party's parliamentary candidate for mayor of Berlin and a member of SPD's national executive committee. After the election, he is expected to run for re-election next year. However, it is not clear whether he will be able to win a second term, or if he'll be forced to step down as a result of his resignation. Germany has a long history of anti-terror laws, including one that bans the use of firearms in public places, as well as other forms of violence against civilians, such as those committed to protecting the lives of people who have been shot or injured in self-defense or to protect the rights of those who are injured or seriously injured. There is also a growing concern among SPD members that Germany is becoming a more militarized state, with more police forces being deployed in cities like Frankfurt and Frankfurt-Am Main than in other parts of Germany. Police union president Heidi Klum said she was concerned about a possible rise in crime in her city. She said: "I don't think there is any reason to think that we should be more vigilant than we are right now. I think we need to do something about it." In the meantime, she said, "we have to put a stop to it, because it's not just a matter of time before it becomes a political issue." "It's a social issue," she added, pointing out that many people are afraid to speak out against police violence in their own cities, especially in areas where police are heavily armed and where there are large numbers of law enforcement officers. This is a problem that has not been solved in recent years and it will not be solved until the current government takes steps to prevent it from happening again. At the same time, Berlin's mayor has expressed his concern about police brutality, saying he wants to see a change in law and order in all of its cities. Berlin is one of several German cities that have seen a surge in police activity since the fall of communism in eastern Europe. That has led to an increase in shootings in some areas, particularly in northern Germany, where the death toll has risen to around 1,500. "
,"Reference text": " German Interior Ministry Claims Progress on Crime Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble released his department's official statistics concerning crime in 2006 in Berlin on Tuesday. And the news was good -- most of the numbers were down compared to the preceding year. Germany's streets were never particularly dangerous, but according to the Interior Ministry, they are now safer than at any time since statistics have been collected. Reported criminal offenses on the whole dropped by 1.4 percent over 2005 -- to a total of just over 6.3 million. "The statistics show reductions in crime among children, adolescents and teenagers, as well as adults," said Schäuble. He added that criminality among foreigners living in Germany also fell, saying that this development reflected Germany's efforts to integrate non-Germans. Drugs offenses were down 7.8 percent, followed by theft and street crime, which both declined by four percent or more. Youth violence Vandalism, on the other hand, was up 5.9 percent. Fraud rose slightly, as did violent crime -- among young people by an alarming 4.5 percent. Berlin Interior Minister Erhart Körting said that was part of a decade-long trend in Germany. "As many experts have pointed out," Körting said, "the potential for violence in society is increasing." The head of the German Police Officers' Union Konrad Freiberg also said those figures showed that German society was not truly getting safer. Frankfurt tops most-dangerous list Crime was down in Frankfurt am Main, but it's still the German city with the greatest number of criminal offenses per 100,000 people. Hanover was a close second, followed by Düsseldorf, Bremen and Berlin. The total percentage of criminal cases solved by German police also improved slightly from 55 to 55.4 percent. According to the study, Germany's safest place was Bergisch Gladbach, a city of 100,000 inhabitants in the west of the country -- coincidentally, model Heidi Klum's home town. " 

},{"Generated text": " Borussia Dortmund vs. Bayern Munich Preview: The Blues are looking to win the Champions League for the first time since 2005. Petr Cech has been named the Blues' coach of the year for this year's competition. "I'm very happy with the way we've been playing this season," he told reporters after the match at Allianz Arena in Munich on Thursday. The German Cup is the most important competition in the Bundesliga, and it's not just about scoring goals. It's also about creating chances for other teams, too. In the last two seasons, Bayern have been able to score goals in all competitions, but they've failed to do so in this one. That's because they're not good enough to beat the likes of Real Madrid, Barcelona and Bayern. They're too good to be true to themselves. And they don't have the kind of players who can do that. Last season, they were the only team in Europe to reach the quarter-finals. This year, though, the Germans are hoping to make it back to the final, where they'll face a tough task against a Bayern side who have won three of their last four league games. But it will be a different story this time around, as Bayern will have to rely on a lot more than just a few key players to get through the group stages. For Bayern, it'll be an uphill task to keep up with a strong Dortmund side that have already won the league twice in a row and are on course for their first title in five years. After a difficult first season in Bavaria, coach Roberto di Matteo's side have struggled to find consistency in recent years, with only a handful of wins in their past five league matches. At the same time, last season's title-winning team, Borussia, have had to cope with an influx of young talent, which has led to a number of injuries and a drop in form. With the exception of goalkeeper Raul Meireles and captain John Terry, there's little doubt that Bayern are going to have a hard time finding the right balance in terms of quality and quality in attack. On the other hand, Dortmund have plenty of attacking talent to choose from, especially in front of home fans. Coach David Alaba has made it clear that he wants to see the best of his young players, even if it means losing the next few games in Germany. He's been in charge of Bayern's squad since the summer of 2005, when they lost to Barcelona at the World Cup in Russia and were knocked out by Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. Now, he's trying to build on that success in his first year at Dortmund. His first goal for Bayern came on the back of a mistake by Real's captain, Franck Ribery, in which he was unable to clear a cross from the left-hand side. A few minutes later, Rufal Ramires scored his second goal in as many games for his side, giving Bayern a 2-0 lead over the visitors. Real, meanwhile, are still searching for a way to avoid a repeat of last summer's disappointment, having lost their opening two games to Bayern and then losing to Manchester City at home last week. However, that's unlikely to happen this weekend, given the fact that the German champions have yet to qualify for next year’s European competition and that they have no chance of reaching the knockout stage. Even if they do qualify, their chances of making it through to next season will depend on how well they perform against the top-four teams in Group A and Group B. As a result, Real are expected to go into Saturday's group stage with their hopes of securing a first European title since 2006. There's a good chance that Real will come out on top again, after they beat Bayern 3-1 on aggregate last year. If they can get past Dortmund on away goals, then they should be in good position to take the lead in next week's Bundesliga final against Barcelona, who are also in danger of missing out after a poor run of form against Real last weekend. "
,"Reference text": " All or nothing for Bayern in Champions final Bayern Munich have one last chance to salvage a season that has otherwise been marked by their inability to beat Borussia Dortmund: a win against Chelsea in the Champions League final at their home stadium. All season long, Bayern Munich have been consumed with achieving one goal: reaching the final of the Champions League, held at their own Allianz Arena in Munich, and raising the trophy in front of their home fans. After finishing a distant second place to Dortmund in the Bundesliga and dismally losing to them 5-2 in the German Cup final, Bayern Munich are in a must-win situation Saturday against Chelsea. A loss would be the final straw in a disappointing season for a team that can't stand second place. A win for Bayern would mean redemption, to some extent, for their shortcomings in the league. Key players were rested down the stretch in the Bundesliga, especially before the two legs of Bayern's European semifinal against Real Madrid. That was an indication that Bayern had given up on the league and put all their eggs in one basket, hoping for a big payoff with the Champions League title. The same can be said for the German Cup final against Dortmund: true, Bayern essentially beat themselves by making mistake after mistake, but Bayern could, if they win Saturday, wipe the slate clean. Saving the season Win this match, and all will be forgiven in Munich. Lose, and it will be Bayern's second straight season without a piece of hardware, not to mention the heartbreak of losing the biggest match at Allianz Arena since it opened in 2005. "We must not even think about [losing]," said Bayern's Franck Ribery on Thursday. "If we win the Champions League, then we can forget about not winning the league or the cup, nobody will care about that." Bayern are a team that thrives under pressure, and the high stakes of this match will be good for them. Chelsea are a team that showed in their semifinal upset of Barcelona that they can rise to a challenge, even if that challenge is simply holding on against a superior opponent. "We are not the favorites of the game, we are playing away," Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech said on Thursday. "It is very rare when you have the home team playing in the home stadium, using the home dressing room, so I think the advantage goes to Bayern Munich because of that. But we know we have a chance and we will fight for it." But this match will come down to the team that can better take advantage of holes that have been blown in each team's defense due to injuries and suspensions. Filling the gaps Between the two sides, seven starting players will miss out on the final. Chelsea saw Raul Meireles, Ramires, and Branislav Ivanovic each get their third yellow card in the second leg against Barcelona, and captain John Terry was given a straight red. Terry and Ivanovic are fixtures on Chelsea's backline, which was already at half-strength due to hamstring injuries suffered by Gary Cahill and David Luiz. Chelsea coach Roberto di Matteo hopes those two are fit enough for the final, since Chelsea will need all the help they can get in the back. For Bayern, David Alaba and Holger Badstuber - both defenders - and Luiz Gustavo, a defensive midfielder, are also suspended for picking up three yellow cards. The impact of the suspensions will hit Chelsea the most. In addition to a weakened back line, Meireles and Ramires are mainstays on offense, supporting strikers Didier Drogba or Fernando Torres. With Ramires out, Drogba could start as striker, with Torres moving to the wing. At any rate, there is more uncertainty in The Blues' lineup than there is in Bayern's, who will be able to rely on striker Mario Gomez and the dynamic-duo of Arjen Robben and Ribery on the wings as they have all season. Most of the question marks will still be defensive for both teams, but to think that this is an indication of a high-scoring affair on Saturday would be a discredit to both team's last lines of defense. Between the posts Neither side would be competing in the final if it wasn't for the heroics of the teams' keepers. Cech defended against wave after wave of attacks from Barcelona in the semifinal for Chelsea, and Manuel Neuer showed nerves of steel in Bayern's penalty shootout in the final leg against Real Madrid, blocking penalties from Madrid stars Cristiano Ronaldo and Kaka. Chelsea's best shot will be to come out of the gate at a sprint and gain an early advantage against Bayern, who will be doing everything they can to keep their long-cultivated dream-final in their control. Otherwise, Bayern's determination to salvage their season may be enough to carry them through to the trophy ceremony - at home, just like they planned it.

},{"Generated text": " Capella sentenced to life in prison for child sex abuse The Vatican has sentenced a Chilean priest to a life sentence of life imprisonment for sexually abusing a child. Cardinal Carlo Alberto Capella was sentenced on Saturday, June 22, to two years of hard labor and a fine of €2,500 (€50,000). The sentence is part of a Vatican investigation into allegations of sexual abuse of minors by priests in the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. The charges stem from allegations that the priest sexually abused children under the age of 15. In a statement, the Vatican said the charges were "inappropriate" and that it was "not appropriate" to sentence a priest who had sex with minors. "This is a very serious matter," the statement said. It was not immediately clear how serious the allegations were, but Vatican officials have said they believe the accusations were made in an attempt to cover up the abuse, which was first reported by the Australian newspaper "The Australian" in September. According to Vatican documents, prosecutors had asked for the sentence to be reduced to one year and three months. They also said that they would seek an appeal against the conviction of another priest, Cardinal George Pell, who was also convicted in a similar case in Canada in 1990. A Vatican spokesman told reporters the decision was made after "a thorough review of the facts and the evidence presented to the court." The pope has said he is "deeply concerned" about the case, and has called for an independent investigation. He also called on Pope Francis to step down from his post as Vatican secretary of state and to appoint a special prosecutor to look into the matter. Last year, Francis announced that he would be stepping down as pope from the post of Vatican Secretary of State. Aw/kms (AFP, Reuters, dpa) The Pope has also ordered the resignation of two Chilean bishops who have been accused of covering up child abuse. Vatican investigators have also been looking into accusations of child pornography and sexual exploitation of children. An investigation is underway, however, with the aim of uncovering the full extent of what is being done to protect children from pedophile priests, including those who abuse minors, as well as other cases where children are abused or neglected by their parents or other family members. This is the first time that a pontiff has been removed from a post for sexual misconduct by a cardinal, according to an investigation by archdiocesan investigators. However, it is still unclear whether the cardinal will be reinstated. aw/ kms/dpa (AP, AFP, news agency) aw / km (Reuters, sbk), AFP/Reuters)The Vatican is also looking at the possibility of new charges against a former Chilean cardinal and former Vatican archbishop, whose case was brought to light by Pope Benedict XVI last year. That could lead to charges of abuse and child molestation, said Vatican spokesperson Jorge Luis Borges, adding that "it is possible that there could be a number of charges." "We have a long list of cases that are pending before the Supreme Court," he said, referring to cases in which children were abused as young as 10 years old by Catholic priests and other clergy, such as the former Cardinal Fernando Karadima of Chile, or the current Archbishop of Canterbury of Australia, John Paul II, for instance, in 1980 or 1990, when he was convicted of molesting a boy in his home country of Buenos Aires, Argentina. His conviction was later overturned by an appeals court in 2009. But the Catholic Church has yet to rule on whether or not it will continue to prosecute pedophiles, calling it a "disgraceful act" that violates the rule of law. What's more, many Catholics believe that Francis' decision to remove Francis from office was a decision made by Francis himself, rather than by his predecessor Cardinal Josephine K. Curley, a Catholic priest in Washington, D.C., who served as cardinal for more than 30 years, at a time when the pope was in charge of handling cases involving pedophilia in Chile and Australia. Or, perhaps, because Francis has a different view on the issue, he might be more lenient with Francis. "

Catholic priest Carlo Alberto Capella was indicted on Saturday after a Vatican investigation found he had allegedly possessed and exchanged "a large quantity" of child pornography during his diplomatic posting. His trial will start on June 22 in front of a Vatican magistrate. If convicted, he could be sentenced to between one and five years in prison and fined between €2,500 and €50,000 ($2,100 to $42,000).

The move comes as the EU prepares to impose sanctions on Russia over its handling of Ukraine's conflict with the West. "The EU is calling for Russia to step up its support for Ukraine and to give Ukraine a chance to win back its sovereignty and independence from Russia," the Russian news agency RIA reported on Monday, citing unnamed sources close to the Kremlin. EU officials have said the move would give Russia a "clear signal" that it is willing to cooperate with Ukraine, which has been fighting a bloody war with Russia since the end of the Cold War in 1991. Ukraine has accused Russia of meddling in the internal affairs of its own country, accusing Moscow of being involved in a conflict between the two sides. Moscow has denied the accusations, saying it was merely acting in self-interest. Russian President Vladimir Putin has also called for an EU-wide aid package to Ukraine to be sent to Kiev in order to prevent the conflict from spreading to neighboring countries. In a statement, Putin said Russia would not accept any aid from the United States or other EU member states. However, he also said that Moscow would continue to support Ukraine as long as it had the necessary political will to do so. Russia has a long history of supporting the Ukrainian government, and the country's oil giant Rosneft, the world's second-largest state oil company, is a key player in this conflict. Last year, Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine after the Soviet Union invaded it in an attempt to overthrow its government. Since then, Russian oil companies have been accused of backing the annexation of Crimea and other Crimean territories, including Crimea, as part of a deal with Moscow to restore Crimea's sovereignty. uhe/nz (Reuters, rIA) - You can read the full statement here: "Russia is committed to a peaceful resolution of all disputes between Russia and Ukraine," it said. It added that Russia had no plans to intervene in Ukraine at this time, adding that the situation was "unacceptable" and that Ukraine should not be allowed to take part in any kind of political process that could lead to an arms race between Moscow and Kiev. Putin's comments came after a meeting between Russian and Ukrainian officials in Moscow last week, during which Moscow said it would seek to improve relations with Kiev, a move that was seen as a threat to Moscow's stability and stability. Today, however, Moscow says it has no intention of intervening in Kiev's affairs and will only act as an intermediary between Kiev and Moscow if it sees a need for it to resolve the crisis peacefully and with a fair and transparent way of dealing with it. This is not the first time that a Russian government has taken steps to try to solve the Ukraine crisis, but it's the second time in less than a year that Russian authorities have taken action against Ukraine over the issue of oil prices. There is also a growing sense of unease among Russian citizens about the state of affairs in Russia, particularly in relation to its oil sector. Many of them have expressed concern about Russian state finances, while others say the government should take a more active role in helping Ukraine resolve its economic problems. They also say Russia should be more transparent about how it deals with its external affairs, such as its financial situation and whether it will be able to pay its debts in full to Ukrainian authorities in return for the support it receives from international donors. But Russian officials say they have no reason to believe that this is going to happen, despite the fact that Kiev has already agreed to provide Ukraine with an alternative source of funding for its energy needs. That's not to say Ukraine will not receive the same amount of money as Russia is currently receiving from Moscow, according to Russian media reports. What is important is that there is an end to sanctions against Russia. If the sanctions are not lifted, then Russia will have to find a way to compensate Ukraine for what it did to Crimea. And that is something that has not been done before. So far, Ukraine is the only country in Europe where sanctions have not yet been imposed on Moscow. "

The money is to come from the Russian pensions system. Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov unveiled a plan Monday aimed at creating a "multi-billion-dollar" funding vehicle for companies hit by Western sanctions. Moscow-based news agency RIA quoted Siluanov as saying that the emergency fund would be set up next year with money originally earmarked for the State Pension Fund and leftover funds from this year's budget. According to RIA, Moscow was planning to devote "at least 100 billion roubles" (2 billion euros) to the fund, which will mainly be aimed at helping cash-starved Russian banks and key oil companies. "These 100 billion roubles will be added to the reserve next year, which will allow us to help companies," RIA quoted Siluanov as saying. "We are planning to create a reserve of significant size." Just last week, the European Union and the United States imposed a third round of sanctions on Moscow for Russia's involvement in the Ukraine conflict. The latest sanctions target the Russian banking sector as well as key energy firms and arms manufacturers. As one of several companies that have asked for government help, Russia's oil giant Rosneft said it would need 1.5 trillion roubles ($39.70 billion) in aid to keep exploring for oil. Siluanov also told RIA news agency that the decision to stop transferring money to the Pension Fund would hand the budget an extra 309 billion roubles. It will be the second year running that Moscow has stopped transfers of funds from the budget to the Pension Fund, which provides benefits for Russia's pensioners, some invalids and families who have lost their breadwinners. uhe/nz (Reuters, RIA) "

The award was announced on Thursday, July 7 2001. Heidi was born in Zürich in 1937. Her father, a Swiss inventor, inventor and musician Johanna Spyri, was the first person to receive the award. "Heidi" is the name given to Heidi by the Swiss film company Vega, which made the film "Vega." The film is based on a novel by Swedish inventor Hans-Joachim Heidrich. It was first published in the German newspaper "Die Zeit" in July 2001, and has since been translated into English as "Him and Heidi." In the novel, Heidi's inventor husband, Hans, is named after the Austrian Alps, where he was discovered by a group of German scientists. He was later found to be the inventor of the transistor radio in his home town in Switzerland. In his book Heidi, the story is told through the eyes of a young girl named Clara, who is now a shepherd and shepherd to Peter's shepherd, Peter. Clara and Peter have been living in Germany for the past seven years. They were first introduced to each other at the age of 15, when Clara was found by Hans and his wife, Joanna, in an Alpine village near the city of Berlin. Now, they have become close friends. Their relationship has developed over the years, as Clara has become more and more involved with Peter and the dog, Dete. As a result, Clara's relationship with Hans has grown stronger and closer. She has also become a close friend of Hans', with whom she has had a long relationship since they first met. Together they share a love of music and have a mutual respect for one another. But they also share the same passion for making a film about a man who has lost his mind and is trying to figure out how to cope with the loss of his life. 'Friend' and 'Dete' are the two main characters of Heidi and Hans. Both of them have lost their minds in recent years as they try to find a way to reconcile their conflicting emotions and feelings about the world around them. Hans - who died in a plane crash in 2009 - is one of her closest friends and co-workers. His death has left her a widow and a daughter, both of whom live in Berlin, but who have also lost hope of finding a place in their own lives. And Hans is still the only person who can help her find her way back to her former home. After a few years of searching for a new place to live, she finally found one that she can call home and reunite with her family. That's when she decided to move to Germany and start her own business, Vega. Since then she's been working as a freelance writer and editor at a local newspaper for more than a decade. When she returned to the United States last year, her husband Peter was still working for Vega and she was looking forward to a return to his old life as an independent woman. Then she met Hans again, this time with a different kind of passion. On the night of their wedding anniversary, he had to decide whether or not he wanted to continue working on Heidi or to stay in her new home for another year. So he made a decision to leave her and take a chance on his new life and find his own adventure. For now, it's just a matter of time before he finds out what he's going to do with his time and what his next move will be. What's next for Heidi? "I want to make Heidi again," she said, adding that Heidi is "the most beautiful woman I've ever met." "She's the most wonderful woman that I have ever known." Heidi has a lot to say about her, including the fact that her father is an inventor who invented the radio and television show "The Beatles." She's also a singer and songwriter, whose career has spanned over 40 years and which she hopes to one day make into a successful film. "
,"Reference text": " Heidi hits the Big Screen Heidi, the world famous girl from the Swiss Alps who first appeared in a novel 121 years ago, has hit the big screen in a fresh look. A century after the death of Heidi inventor Johanna Spyri, the lovable Alpine heroine is being portrayed in a new film which replaces grassy slopes and mountainous range with city skyscrapers and city streets. The $ 3.5 million "Heidi", funded by the Zürich-based film company Vega and directed by German film maker Markus Imboden, is to be launched in Germany on Thursday. The making of the film was one of the highlights of a past year of events including exhibitions, lectures and fireworks celebrating the July 7 2001 centenary of the death of Spyri, whose novel "Heidi" sold 20 million copies and has been translated in 50 languages worldwide. It is thought to be one of the most successful books of all times. The book has inspired 17 films, including Shirley Temple’s Oscar winning portrayal of Heidi in 1937 and a Japanese cartoon series. Imboden’s remake is the 18th "Heidi" film. Blue hair in Berlin According to Vega, "the film was transmitted to today’s world without losing sight of the original novel". But Imboden’s new movie is far from the charming original, with its rosy-cheeked, curly-headed Heidi, delicate Clara and goat-tending shepherd Peter’s frail old grandmother. In the first film, Heidi, who lives happily with her grandfather in a tiny hut in the Swiss Alps is plucked from her contented life by her Aunt Dete to live in a stiff, rich family in the bustling metropolis, Frankfurt. Heidi becomes so home-sick, she starts to sleepwalk and is eventually sent home. But not before she causes confusion in the otherwise prim household and brings laughter in the life of the disabled and homely, Clara. The Heidi in the latest film has blue hair, surfs the net and roams the streets of Berlin. Friend and shepherd Peter sheds his rustic pastimes and whizzes down streets on his mountainbike. Clara is not the weak, lame young girl of the Spyri novel, but a moody Britney Spears wannabe. Aunt Dete is a modern-day stylist living fashionably in the German capital. The new surroundings are a far cry from the tranquil days of cow milking, goat- tending and flower-plucking in the verdant meadows of the Swiss Alps. Transforming the Heidi myth According to a Berlin daily, the remake is a "refreshing Heidi", adding that the script writers had managed to transform the Heidi "myth" into an independent, self-assured girl and not into a "transfigured mountain heroine". However, it is just this portrait of a naive and charming alpine heroine that has made Heidi so popular all over the world. Heidi has become a well-known Swiss brand worldwide. Some 60,000 tourists – half from Japan – are said to visit the picturesque wine-growing village in Graubuenden, which boasts the original Heidi House and other Heidi related attractions such as winding mountain trails and pastures. Imboden’s film, which is to be launched in Germany on Thursday, will also open elsewhere in Europe, and may reach fans in Japan and South Korea too. Whether Imboden’s blue-haired, computer savvy Heidi will charm her Asian viewers, however, remains to be seen. " 

},{"Generated text": " Pakistani journalist Ruby Hamad: 'It's a sad day for Pakistan' A British freelance journalist has spoken out about the brutal murder of a Pakistani journalist in Pakistan. Shehnaz Khan was among the first people to speak out against the killing of Qandeel Baloch in July. Samia Shahid, a journalist based in the UK, is one of the few journalists who has been able to share her story on social media. Her story has sparked outrage across the world, with many people calling for her to be released from prison. "I'm so sorry that I can't share my story with you," she told the Daily Life newspaper in an interview published in Australia on July 24. The British-born journalist said she was shocked to learn that the murder had taken place in a remote area of Pakistan, where she had been living with her family for a year. In a statement, she said: "It was a tragic day, and I'm very sorry for the loss of my family and my friends." She also said that she would like to thank the British government for their help in finding a way to help the families of those who have lost their loved ones in recent months. But she added that it would be "difficult" if the government did not do more to find a solution to the family's problems. According to Khan, "the government is not going to do anything about it." "The government should be doing everything it can to make sure that we have a justice system that works for all Pakistanis, not just the poor and the downtrodden," Khan said, adding that he was "very sad" to hear about what happened to his family. Khan's family, however, said they were "deeply saddened" by the news. They said the Pakistani government had not done enough to address the issue, but that they would do everything in their power to prevent it from happening again. However, they also stressed that Pakistan is a country that has a long history of human rights violations and that there is no place for people like Khan to go to when they are in need of help. As a result, Khan and other journalists have been unable to reach out to their families and friends, who are still in shock over the death of her son. Guardian journalist Juanita Phillips also spoke out on the matter, saying that "it's sad that so many of our friends and family are suffering from the same kind of pain and suffering as we are." Pakistan's government has also been accused of failing to provide adequate security for its citizens, which has led to a number of deaths and injuries. Pakistani media outlets have also reported on a spate of attacks on civilians, including at the hands of police officers and soldiers. Last week, the United Nations reported that at least 10 people were killed in one attack in Karachi, killing a man and injuring dozens of others. It is unclear how many more were injured in that attack. Pakistan has yet to announce its next steps in its fight against terrorism, although the UN has said it will continue to monitor the situation closely. There are also reports of an increase in anti-terror raids and a rise in suicide attacks in other countries, as well as the rise of radical Islamist groups such as al-Qaeda and Boko Haram. Meanwhile, there are reports that Pakistani authorities are planning to launch a new wave of airstrikes in Afghanistan, possibly targeting the country's largest Muslim population. This could lead to an escalation of violence against civilians and increase the risk of civilian casualties. Read more: Pakistan: What is the next step in fighting terrorism?

In the end, it's all up to you to decide what you want to say. Do you have any idea what your next move will be? I don't think so. I think the most important thing is to get the facts out there and see if you can find out what's going on in your own country. You have to know that you are not the only one who's been targeted by this type of information. If you're not careful, you will find that people are being targeted. That's why it is so important for us to have an independent media outlet like the Guardian and Al Jazeera to report on this issue. What do we do now? We need to look at what we can do to protect our own citizens and our communities. And we need a strong media presence in our country so that more people can be exposed to what is happening to them. We can only do so much at once. How can you protect yourself and your family? And how can we protect ourselves? "
,"Reference text": " Rethinking the term 'honor killing' The murder of 28-year-old Samia Shahid comes less than two weeks after Qandeel Baloch was killed by her brother. The media was quick to report them as "honor killings." We have to rethink that term, writes Gouri Sharma. When news broke that Samia Shahid, a British-Pakistani woman, had been found dead while visiting relatives in Pakistan at the end of July, mainstream media outlets were quick to report it as an honor killing. It was the second time in two weeks that the media had reported a killing of a woman this way - the first being the murder of Pakistani social media star Qandeel Baloch. There are strong similarities between the cases. Both were murdered in places where they would have felt they were at their safest - in their family homes. It's likely they knew their killers - in Baloch's case, her brother has admitted to strangling her, and Shahid's father and cousin have already been questioned. And as more reports emerge about Shahid's death, it's clear that both were killed because they didn't behave in a way deemed acceptable in a conservative, patriarchal society. 'Deeply offensive' term The debate around terminology in "honor killings" isn't new, and after Baloch's murder there were members of the media - such as ABC Australia journalist Juanita Phillips - who decided against using the term, calling it "deeply offensive" and referring to it as a "family killing" instead. And there are outlets, like the Guardian, that already use inverted commas with the word honor. But some commentators argue that more needs to happen if media consumers are to gain a better understanding of the problem. "I think an important step for the media would be to refuse to give weight to the term 'honor crimes,'" said UK-based freelance journalist Shehnaz Khan. "While it is imperative to highlight that these crimes and murders stem from the roots of misogyny and therefore a false sense of 'honor,' there is absolutely nothing but'shame' within them, as murder is nothing but dishonorable." "The word 'honor' can sometimes carry an almost positive connotation that we are inclined to automatically accept just because it's not happening to us, when the reality is, this a huge problem affecting thousands of girls and women across the world," she added. Naming the issue But this isn't a view shared by all journalists. Ruby Hamad, a writer at Australia's Daily Life newspaper, said that the first step in dealing with the issue is naming it. "There are some deeply patriarchal societies that still limit women's freedom according to old tribal concepts of honor, where, unfairly, the behavior of women reflect on their entire family," Hamad said. "By naming these 'honor killings,' we are acknowledging the role that this misogynistic concept of honor plays, not only in the murders themselves but in these entire societies, and how it entraps both men and women." Through the eyes of the perpetrator? There are other issues with the term though. Some have argued that by framing it as such, media outlets are showing the crime through the eyes of the perpetrator - and not through the victim - as they should. And with such cases regularly hitting the headlines, framing is important. The United Nations estimates that around 5,000 women - predominantly from Asia and the Middle East - are killed annually in honor-related crimes, a figure that women's advocacy groups say is closer to 20,000 worldwide. This raises an important cultural element for the media to consider - how far does the term play into cultural stereotypes? "When honor is considered the most important thing in life, then all family members become expendable," Hamad said. "The collective outweighs the rights of the individual. Does this feed into cultural stereotypes? Perhaps. But that doesn't mean we should pretend that this cultural context isn't there." Looking for answers - and alternatives There have been many alternatives put forward by women's advocacy groups, including hate crime, misogynistic murder, femicide and shame killings. But which one should we pick? Al Jazeera for one has decided which one they won't use. "We are always updating our style guidelines to convey a deeper and more authentic understanding of world affairs. Recent events in Pakistan ignited a healthy debate in Al Jazeera on the term 'honor killings' in particular. Our editors are currently studying alternatives to the term, but'misogynistic murder' is not one of them," said an Al Jazeera spokesperson. Terminology in the media matters, and for murders as complex as these, it's the media's responsibility to find a name that better fits the crime. Only then will it become easier to work towards a solution. "

The Nobel Peace Prize laureate died on Friday, the first anniversary of the country's independence from the Soviet Union in 1988. She was survived by her husband, Zaw Win, and their two children. Insein, where she was born, was one of Burma's most important cities. It is the only place in the world where the state of Myanmar has been able to establish itself as an independent state. "I have lived my entire life in this country," said the Nobel laureate, who died at the age of 88 in 1990 after a long illness that left her paralyzed and unable to walk. A posthumous Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded to her for her efforts to end the suffering of millions of Rohingya Muslims. Her death was the last of her kind in Myanmar, which had been ruled by the military for more than a century. Since then, she has lived in exile in Brussels and has worked as a translator for the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). She has also worked for a number of international organizations, including the London School of Economics (LSE) and the Euro-Burma Office (IPO). The former prime minister's wife, Mya Than Than Nu, died of cancer in 2008, leaving her with only a few months to live. Author: Disha Uppal Editor: Anne Thomas, October 2, 2018 The death of former Prime Minister U Nu was a major factor in her decision to run for re-election in 2009. But it also played a role in making her the face of a new generation of political leaders. After her death, her body was taken to a military hospital where it was treated for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and her family was sent to the United Nations for treatment. There, they were treated as if they had just been released from a hospital. They were then sent back to Myanmar where they spent the rest of their lives. Now they have returned to their home country, a country that has seen a resurgence of democracy since the end of decades of military rule. This time around, however, there is still a lot of work to be done. Many of those who are still alive and well, such as the journalist Harn Yawnghwe, have been waiting for their chance to return home. So far, it's been a slow process, but the government has managed to find a way to get them back on track. Some of them have even begun to look forward to returning home in October, when they will be allowed to stay in their new homes. However, this is unlikely to happen until the new government is sworn in. According to experts, if the Myanmar government does return to civilian rule, then it will have to make sure that it does so in accordance with international humanitarian law and human rights standards. That is not the case with the current government, for example, as it has not been clear how long it would take for it to come to an end. On the other hand, many people are hoping that the next government will come with a more stable constitution and a stronger constitution than the one in which the former president was elected. At the same time, some have expressed concern about the possibility of another military coup, saying it could lead to "a new wave of ethnic cleansing." In the past, Myanmar was governed by a pro-democracy constitution that was passed by parliament in 1989. Although the constitution does not allow the use of force against ethnic groups, its constitution allows the army to take part in any kind of martial law. As a result, people have become more and more aware of what is going on around them. For instance, in recent years, security forces have started to use tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the crowds of people who have gathered in front of government buildings to protest against the crackdown on the Rohingya. These attacks have led to widespread fear among the population that they could be used as weapons of mass destruction. What is happening now is a worrying sign that Myanmar is becoming increasingly isolated from its international community. "
,"Reference text": " Myanmar Junta Announces Amnesty The junta in Myanmar, also known as Burma, announced an amnesty for more than 7,000 prisoners on Friday, including a few political detainees. The amnesty came on the 21st anniversary of the brutal crackdown of a student-led pro-democracy movement in 1988 and the subsequent seizure of power by the current junta. Journalists were invited to Yangon’s notorious Insein prison on Friday as the authorities released the first batch of prisoners. At least 600 inmates were freed as part of an amnesty for over 7,000 inmates nationwide. Among those released in Yangon were two journalists and 25 political prisoners -- rights groups say this is only 1 percent of the total number of political prisoners held by the military regime. Maung Zarni, a research fellow at the London School of Economics, was “happy for the prisoners who were part of the release”. “This is a very positive personal development and I am happy they have been released but we need to understand that the junta is using the prisoners’ release as a public relations exercise. It is the 21st anniversary of the military coup so they are using this as a way to pacify political discontent in the country.” Amnesty comes ahead of next year’s polls Myanmar's director general of prisons, Zaw Win, said that the prisoners had been freed so they could take part in next year's polls. In recent months, rights activists, pro-democracy activists and Western countries have cast doubt on the credibility of the planned elections as many key political activists are still in detention. This includes pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who recently began a new 18-month period of house arrest after being found guilty of violating her house arrest order in a widely condemned trial. “The whole Suu kyi trial is rather unlawful,” said Zarni. “Because the country does not have an independent judiciary, the judges are just puppets who dance to the tune of the top leadership.” Junta is holding on tightly In 1990, Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy won Myanmar’s last general election by a landslide. But the junta never recognised the results and has since tightened its control over the country. The 2008 constitution, which was drafted and approved by the military generals, which guarantees the army 25 percent of parliamentary seats, is yet another sign of its desire to consolidate power. “The military is going to be in power for a long time,” warns Zarni, “because they have got control of all the political and economic institutions in the country as well as the entire state of Burma. So with or without elections, this is likely to remain the same.” New Democratic Party formed Meanwhile, a new political party has been formed in Myanmar. The Democratic Party is headed by Mya Than Than Nu, who is the daughter of the country’s first democratically-elected prime minister, U Nu. The party has proposed a power-sharing deal with the military, which would give 40 percent of power to politicians and 60 percent to the military rulers. Harn Yawnghwe, the director of the Brussels-based Euro-Burma Office, doubts the new party stands a chance: “It is possible that they they would be able to get some votes. But it is not likely, even if they were able to contest the elections freely, that they will be able to form a new government because the military is not prepared to let any party rule.” Democrats should exploit elections He thinks the only way out for the democratic forces in Myanmar is to use the upcoming elections wisely and “to take part in them even if they are against them. I think we have to look at the elections as a process which will lead to democracy -- maybe in few more years.” The National League for Democracy has indicated that it will not take part in the polls unless all Myanmar’s political prisoners, including Suu Kyi, are released. Suu Kyi’s lawyers have filed an appeal against the extension of her house arrest and the court is expected to give a ruling on October 2. But few are hopeful that the junta will amnesty her anytime soon. Author: Disha Uppal Editor: Anne Thomas "

The report, published in Bonn on Thursday, aims to improve the lives of people living in developing countries by 2030. "Healthy environment, health people" is a term used by the UNEP to describe the effects of climate change on people's health and well-being. It refers to people who live in countries with high levels of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) and who are exposed to high concentrations of these greenhouse gases in their homes, workplaces, schools, offices and workplaces. This is in line with the Paris agreement, which was signed in 2012, and is aimed at improving the quality of life in the developing world. However, the report also highlights the challenges faced by developing nations, particularly in Asia and the Western Pacific. In addition to the high GHG emissions, there is also a lack of access to clean drinking water and sewage treatment facilities, as well as poor sanitation and water management systems. These are the main challenges facing countries such as China, India and Southeast Asia, according to WHO Executive Director Achim Steiner. Climate change is the most pressing challenge facing the global economy, he said, adding that it will take time for countries to adapt to a changing climate. He said that in order to do so, they will need to make sure that they have the right policies in place to meet the needs of their populations. Global warming is expected to increase by 1.5 to 2.6 degrees Celsius by 2050, compared with 2 to 3 degrees C in 2011. That means that people will have to spend more time outdoors and more energy on their own than in previous years, leading to an increase in global warming and a decrease in life expectancy. So, for the first time in a long time, people are going to be able to live longer and healthier lives than they used to. And that's a good thing, because it means more people can get to work and have more opportunities to learn about their environment. But it's not just the environment that is at stake. There are many other challenges, too. For example, in many countries where the climate is warming, it is becoming increasingly difficult for people to get enough sleep and to have enough time to exercise their right to take care of themselves and their families. As a result, we are seeing a lot of negative effects on our health, especially in rural areas, where there are fewer opportunities for healthy living. We are also seeing the impact of environmental protection in cities and towns, but we don't see the same effects in urban areas. What we have seen so far is that cities are becoming more urbanized and that the number of young people moving to urban centers is increasing. People are starting to realize that urbanization is an important part of a healthy society. They are beginning to see a shift in how people live and how they interact with each other. When it comes to reducing the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere, this can be a big problem. Environmental protection is not only a problem for cities but also for their communities. If you have a large population, you can see how that can affect your health. You can also see it in other cities, like the cities in which you live, or the towns and villages where you work. How do you deal with this problem? What are you doing in your community? Do you think you are doing well? How can you make a positive impact on your environment? Are you living a healthier life? Is there a way to reduce the carbon footprint of your city? I think so. I would say that if you had a choice, then you would be doing a very good job of reducing carbon emissions and increasing the use of renewable energy sources. One thing is for sure: you will see that this will not be the case in all cities. Even if it was just one city, cities will continue to grow and become more industrialized. Cities will still need more renewable sources of energy, water, electricity and transport. "
,"Reference text": " A quarter of deaths caused by environmental degradation, says UN A new United Nations report warns that pollution and global warming are causing millions more deaths than conflicts. The UN's environment agency has called for an urgent roll-back on harmful substances and fossil fuels. In its report "Healthy Environment, Health People," the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), the World Health Organization and several other environment organizations said that, in 2012, an estimated 12.6 million deaths were attributable to deteriorating environment conditions. The largest numbers of deaths took place in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific regions, followed by sub-Saharan Africa, where around a quarter of deaths were likely caused byair pollution, chemicals, climate change and a lack of access to sanitation. "By depleting the ecological infrastructure of our planet and increasing our pollution footprint, we incur an ever-growing cost in terms of human health and well-being," said UNEP Executive Director Achim Steiner. He added that humanity's life support systems had been compromised by globalization and powerful economic interests. The report was released during UN climate talks in the German city of Bonn which are drawing up rules pertaining to the Paris agreement, which seeks to lower carbon emissions. The document suggested that several drivers were responsible for the threat to human health, including ecosystem disruption, climate change, inequality, unhealthy and wasteful lifestyles, along with unsustainable consumption and production. Worsening effects UNEP estimated that an extra 250,000 deaths could occur each year between 2030 and 2050 as a result of climate change, leading to malnutrition, malaria, diarrhea and heat stress. Between them air pollution and a lack of access to clean water and sanitation cause almost 8 million premature deaths each year. Environmental impacts are responsible for the deaths of more than one quarter of all children under the age of five, the report states. UNEP called for governments to act to remove harmful substances from working environments, reduce the use of carbon fuels and rely instead on renewable energy, and change lifestyles to allow a more sustainable use of the world's resources. The report also called for a bigger investment to protect the planet's natural ecosystem. UNEP predicted a further increase in emerging zoonotic diseases (spread between animals and humans), and called on developing countries, in particular, to prioritize prevention methods. "Never before have so many animals been kept by so many people - and never before have so many opportunities existed for pathogens to pass through the biophysical environment and wild animals to livestock and people," the report warned.

According to a report by the Institute for the Study of Trade (IST), farmers in Lower Saxony and the German Vegetarian Association are facing a shortage of produce. The German Farmers Association (DFA) said on Wednesday that farmers had to reduce their vegetable production by 454 million euros ($474 million) over the next five years. "We are faced with a situation where we cannot grow enough vegetables," the group said in a statement. It added that the government was also considering cutting back the amount of meat it produces. Farmers are also facing an increase in prices for meat and dairy products due to the high cost of producing them, the institute said. In addition to cutting down on meat production, farmers have also faced a rise in taxes on their produce, which is expected to increase by 6.5 percent in 2015 from a year earlier. Mb/sms (dpa, epd) (h/t: Reuters, AP, Reuters) The government is also planning to introduce a tax on beef and pork products, a move that will increase the tax burden on farmers, who are already suffering from high prices. Germany's farmers' association said the increase would be driven by a reduction in meat prices, as well as a decrease in dairy production. However, it said that this would not be the case for all farmers and that it would only be a matter of time before farmers were able to produce enough meat to meet the growing demand for their products. German farmers say they have already begun to see the impact of the new tax law on them. They say it will have a "significant impact" on prices as they are set to go up by 5 percent next year, while the price of beef, pork and chicken will rise by 2.6 percent, according to an institute report published Wednesday in German newspaper "Die Welt" (Dpa). The institute's report says that in order to achieve the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 10 percent by 2015, Germany will need to double its production capacity from 2010 to 2020, and increase it by 1.4 percent from the current level of production of 3.2 million tonnes. mb /srs (AFP, Getty Images, iStockphoto, bp, hti, dpa) M.P. Morgan Schmidt, Minister for Food and Agriculture (SPF), told the Bild newspaper that he was "deeply concerned" about the situation in his home state. He said farmers would have to find new sources of income to cover the costs of growing their vegetables and meat, adding that there was a need for more efficient and efficient methods of raising the prices of their product. But he said he would continue to look at ways to make sure farmers could grow more vegetables in their home states, such as Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Switzerland. His comments came after a visit to Germany last week by German Chancellor Angela Merkel, during which she met with farmers from across the border in her native Germany. She said she was pleased with Schmidt's visit, saying he had made "a lot of progress" with his new government and was looking forward to working with them on a plan to expand the agricultural sector. Schmidt also said his government would work closely with the private sector to improve the competitiveness of German agriculture, particularly in low-income regions. 'We will work together to ensure that we can grow our own food,' he told Merkel's press conference in Berlin, where he spoke at the opening of a cabinet meeting in which he discussed his plans for a new agricultural policy. Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Dietmar Schäuble, told reporters that "we are going to work very hard to get this right." "The German government has been very clear in its stance on this issue," he added, "that we will not allow anyone to take advantage of what we have in our country." The minister's comments come at a time when farmers across Germany are struggling to cope with rising prices and rising costs. Last week, Schmidt announced that Germany would increase its minimum wage by 25 percent this year to $7.25 per hour, up from $5.50 an hour in 2010. "

Minister wants ban on meat names for plant-based foods Terms like "vegan sausage" and "vegetarian schnitzel" confuse consumers and need to be replaced, according to German Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt. He wants new names for plant-based dishes. Germans shouldn't be biting into a "vegan sausage" or cutting a slice of "vegetarian schnitzel," German Minister for Food and Agriculture Christian Schmidt told the daily "Bild" newspaper on Wednesday, adding that names traditionally used for meat-based dishes should not be applied to plant-based foods. "I don't want anyone to pretend that these pseudo-meat dishes are actual meat dishes," Schmidt said. The minister said manufacturers should come up with distinct names for plant-based meat-substitutes. Schmidt also said meat was part of a healthy and balanced diet and belonged on the menu in schools and kindergartens. Soy? Steak? Soy-steak? Schmidt's statements echo demands from the German Farmers Association and German Butchers Association. Both lobbying groups have asked for a ban on terms such as "vegetarian ham" or "soy steak." Schmidt's call for plant-based foods to have their own name was also made in October in the state of Lower Saxony, a state with many large livestock farms. The German Vegetarian Association, however, argued against the proposal. A spokesperson for the organization said that "names that are used for animal-based products should without a doubt also be legal to use for vegetarian substitute products." More meatless 'whatever-you-want-to-call-thems' The market for vegetarian and vegan dishes has grown steadily in the past few years in Germany, partly at the expense of the meat industry. According to a research paper by the Institute for the Study of Trade (IfH), revenue for vegetarian and vegan products in Germany was 454 million euros ($474 million) in 2015 and grew by more than 100 percent between 2010 and 2015. In the same time period, the demand for meat products fell by almost 10 percent. mb/sms (dpa, epd) "

The Canadian government is expected to announce the details of the plan by the end of this week. A spokesman for the prime minister, Stephen Harper, said Tuesday that the government would meet with the president and the New Democratic Party (NDP), the opposition party of outgoing President Barack Obama. "We are going to meet at the federal level," the spokesman said in a statement, adding that he would not comment on the matter at a later date. Harper said he had no plans to seek a second term in office, which would allow him to run for re-election in 2011. Obama has been criticized for his handling of key issues such as climate change and energy security, but he has also been critical of his predecessor, former President George W. Bush, who led the Republican Party from 2001 to 2011 and who is now running for president. In 2011, the Obama administration signed a bill that would have allowed the Keystone pipeline to be built in Canada without the approval of Congress. That bill, known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), was signed into law by Obama and passed by Canadian lawmakers on Monday. es/cmk (AP, Reuters)The plan was criticized by some as a "disgraceful" and "unnecessary" step for Canada's economy. It also drew criticism from the Canadian public broadcaster, CBC, saying it was "a disgraceful step" for Harper to step down from his post and that it "would have been a disaster for our economy and our country." The Conservative Party, however, has said it will continue to support the project, calling it an "important step forward" in its quest to secure the country's energy and economic future. Last year, Harper's Conservatives won a majority in both houses of Parliament, defeating the Liberals in an election that was widely seen as an attempt to stave off the prospect of a new federal government. But the party's new leader, John Walsh, criticized the move as "absurd." "It's a shame," Walsh told the CBC news program, "that the Conservatives would be able to do this without a third party." Walsh also criticized Harper for not doing enough to protect the interests of Canadian farmers and ranchers. He also said that Harper should have done more to ensure that farmers were not forced to sell their produce at prices that were higher than what they were paying for it. Walsh said the Harper government should be more transparent about the costs of producing the oil and gas in order to avoid a repeat of last year's debacle, when it failed to deliver on its promise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2011-2012. However, Walsh did not rule out the possibility of changing the law to allow farmers to grow their own crops at higher prices, and he said there was no evidence that this was a threat to farmers' livelihoods or their ability to produce their products at lower prices. What's more, he added, that there is no need to rush the process of building the pipeline, because it is already being done and will take years to complete. His comments come as Harper and Walsh have said they will not seek to change the laws to make it easier for Canadians to get their food, clothing and other goods from their farms to their homes. They have also called for a referendum on whether or not Canada should approve the expansion of natural gas exports to other countries, including the United States, as part of an effort to spur economic growth and job creation. Both Walsh and Harper have criticized Obama for failing to act on his campaign promises to ease the burden of environmental regulations on farmers. On Tuesday, they said Obama should step up his efforts to help farmers in need of relief from a growing number of high-cost, expensive and expensive imports from countries like China and India. Officials in Obama's own party, New Democrats, have rejected the idea of allowing Keystone to enter the market, arguing that such a move would harm the environment and create jobs. "

Stephen Harper has stepped down as leader of the Conservatives after nine years in the top job. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper resigned as Conservative Party leader on Tuesday after the Liberals, led by Justin Trudeau, emerged victorious in legislative elections. "I have spoken to Prime Minister Stephen Harper, and he has instructed me to reach out to the newly elected parliamentary caucus to appoint an interim leader," Conservative Party president John Walsh said in a statement. "The people are never wrong," Harper said of his defeat. "The disappointment is my responsibility and mine alone," Harper said, adding that he had called Trudeau to congratulate him. Trudeau calls for hopeful, diverse future In electing Trudeau, the charismatic son of a former popular prime minister, Canadian voters illustrated the growing discontent with nine years of Conservative rule that saw lowering of corporate taxes, avoidance of climate change legislation and disagreement with the Obama administration over the controversial Keystone XL pipeline. "Canadians have spoken," Trudeau said, adding that he would be the man to lead the "hopeful, positive" country "with a vision" that they had asked for. In his victory speech, Trudeau said his government "believed deeply in the diversity of our country," striking a contrast with the strain of nativism that had become apparent under Conservative rule. "We beat fear with hope," said Trudeau, a 43-year-old former teacher. Liberals blow past projected results Projections ahead of the elections had Harper and Trudeau in a dead heat, but as polls closed on Monday night it became clear that the Liberals had won an outright majority, with a projected 175 of parliament's 338 seats. This represented a huge leap from four years ago when Liberals were handed their most crushing defeat in history with a mere 34 seats. Harper will stay on as a member of Parliament for his constituency, public broadcaster CBC reported, as he was re-elected to his seat. The left-leaning New Democratic Party had hoped to capitalize on its second-place finish in 2011, but only managed to come in third with CBC estimating that the party had garnered 32 seats. es/cmk (AP, Reuters) Have something to say?

},{"Generated text": " Saudi Arabia to launch air strikes against Houthis in Yemen Saudi Arabia will launch airstrikes on Houthi-held areas of Yemen on May 12, the country's foreign minister Adel al-Jubeir said on Tuesday. The move comes after US Secretary of State John Kerry announced on Friday that the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) would hold a meeting to discuss Yemen's ongoing conflict. "The GCC will hold an emergency meeting in Sanaa at 11.00 pm (local time)," Kerry said in a statement, adding that he was "deeply concerned" about the situation in the war-ravaged country, which has seen the death toll rise since March 26. Kerry also said the US would continue to support the Saudi-led coalition in its fight against Iran-backed Shiite rebels, who have seized large swaths of territory from the internationally recognized government of President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi in March. On Tuesday, Kerry called on Riyadh to step up its support of the coalition, saying it would "fight back" against Iranian-supported forces, including Shiite Iran and Iran, if it failed to do so by the end of this month. Riyadh has said it will continue its air campaign against the rebels until they give up their weapons and leave the fighting to Iran. Washington has called for an end to the conflict, calling for a "total and complete cessation of hostilities" between the two sides. Iran has accused Riyadh of backing the Shiite-dominated government, accusing it of supporting the regime in Saada, a southern Yemeni province where the government has been fighting for more than a year. Saudi officials have denied the accusations and said they were not aware of any such accusations. A Saudi Foreign Ministry spokesman told reporters that Riyadh would not comment on the meeting until after it was over. Yemen is the first Arab country to formally recognize Iran as the sole legitimate state sponsor of terrorism, and the United Nations has warned that Iran could use its influence to influence the outcome of a military conflict there. In March, Riyadh announced that it had agreed to allow Iran to take over the Yemeni government's oil and gas fields. It also announced plans to increase the number of troops deployed to Yemen, with the aim of reducing the threat of attacks by Shiite militias. However, it did not say how many troops would be deployed, or how long the operation would take. US-Saudi relations have been strained in recent months by a series of missile attacks on Saudi targets, as well as a spate of bombings and rocket attacks targeting the kingdom's capital of Riyadh. Last month, US President Barack Obama said he hoped the Saudis would act quickly to prevent a repeat of last year's deadly missile attack on Yemen. He said that "it will be a long time before we see any kind of change in Saudi policy." The US, however, has not ruled out the possibility of an arms embargo on Iran or any other form of military action against Tehran, but has expressed concern over Iran's alleged involvement in some of its ballistic missile programs. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said last week that Tehran was ready to help Iran in any way it could. His comments came a day after a US envoy to Riyadh said Iran was willing to cooperate with Riyadh in resolving the Yemen crisis. According to Iranian state media, Iran had also expressed "serious concern" over a possible military confrontation with Saudi forces. Tehran has denied any involvement, though, in launching a missile strike against Riyadh last month that killed at least 15 people. Adjel bin Laden, spokesman for the Iranian embassy in Riyadh, told the Associated Press news agency that US officials were "very concerned about Iranian involvement." "We are very concerned," he said, referring to a recent missile launch by Iranian forces that hit Saudi territory, killing dozens of people and injuring hundreds of others, according to an Iranian official. Yemeni officials say the attack was carried out in retaliation for US air support for Saudi efforts to oust President Abd-Rabbuh Mansur HADI from power. They say it is an act of aggression by Iran aimed at destabilizing the Arab world's largest oil exporter. 'We will not allow it to happen again' "

Meanwhile, US Secretary of State John Kerry has urged all parties to find a political solution to the conflict. "We have made a decision that the cease-fire will begin this Tuesday, May 12, at 11.00 pm and will last for five days subject to renewal if it works out," Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir told a meeting of Gulf ministers in Paris on Friday alongside US Secretary of State John Kerry. The minister added that the cease-fire could be extended depending on the response from Yemen's Shiite Houthi rebels. Al-Jubeir said he hoped the Iran-backed rebels would "come to their senses" and agree to the truce. He urged them to stop fighting. "We hope the Houthis will come to their senses and realize the interests of Yemen and the Yemeni people should be the top priority for everyone," he said. It is unclear whether the Houthis would reciprocate the Saudi gesture. "The cease-fire will end should Houthis or their allies not live up to the agreement - this is a chance for the Houthis to show that they care about their people and they care about the Yemen people," the Saudi foreign minister emphasized. At this point, US Secretary of State John Kerry said anyone who cared about Yemeni people "should take clear notice of the fact that a human catastrophe is building," adding that a cease-fire was "not peace" and that all parties must find a political solution to end the conflict. Kerry urged all sides to hold talks immediately. Saudi ultimatum Hours before the cease-fire announcement, Saudi Arabia declared a Houthi stronghold along its southern border a "military target," giving an ultimatum to the residents to leave the area, Saudi state-run TV reported. Lately, the northern Yemeni province of Saada has become a battleground for the Shiite rebels and the Saud-led coalition forces as the Houthis carried out border attacks on nearby Saudi cities. More than 50 airstrikes hit Saada overnight and in the early hours of Friday morning, Yemeni officials said. A Saudi-led coalition of Arab states launched an air campaign against the Houthis on March 26. Riyadh accuses Tehran of backing the rebels, who have made significant territorial gains in the impoverished Middle Eastern country, capturing the capital Sanaa and ousting internationally recognized President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, who fled Yemen back in March. The Sunni Gulf states are wary of Iran's increasing influence in the region, and they see the Houthis' advance in Yemen as a move that threatens their regional and geopolitical interests. Over 1,200 people have been killed in Yemen since the start of the Saudi campaign, according to the United Nations. shs/bw (AFP, dpa, Reuters, AP) "

The Ukrainian prime minister is set to take over the reins of power in Kyiv on Sunday. Ukraine's government has announced that it will no longer be able to form a coalition government with the West. Ukrainian media reported Sunday that the new leader of the pro-Western opposition party, Andrij Shevchenko, would be stepping down from his post as head-of-state. "Poroshenko is not going to be replaced," she told DW, adding that she would not be allowed to run for another term in office. However, she said, "We will continue to work together to make sure that we have a stable and stable government." The announcement came after a series of protests in the Ukrainian capital, Kiev, which saw thousands of people turn out in droves to protest the government's handling of a crisis that has rocked the country since the beginning of this year. In response to the protests, the president called for a general election in June and promised to hold a referendum on the issue. He also said that he would seek a parliamentary majority in parliament in order to win the election.

Many of them have been in power for more than a decade, and the crisis in their own right has only grown worse since they took power. They have become more and more isolated as a result. This has led to a lot of speculation about who will be next in line for the post - and what role will it play in this crisis?" DW-TV - In an interview with DW last week, Prystina Kuznetsova, a journalist based in Berlin, said she was "very concerned" about the situation in her home country. She added that there was a "clear lack of coordination between the two sides" and that "there was no coordination at all" between Ukraine and Russia. According to her, there had been "no coordination of any kind" at the time of her election, but that was because she had not been given a clear mandate to carry out her duties. rg/liw - DWDW: How does this affect the political process?

There are people who are not happy with what is going on in politics. People are unhappy with how things are going.

The Red Cross has been working with the Nigerian government to find out. What has happened since April 14-15, 2014? According to information provided to DW by Nigerian authorities, the militants took over a town in the north of the state of Yola. The town was the site of a terrorist attack in April 2014 that killed at least 40 people and injured more than 100 others. At the time, there were no reports of an attack on the city. However, in May, Buhari's army chief, Alex Badeh, told DW that the terrorist group had taken over the entire town. "We are still trying to figure out how they got in and how we can get out of this town," he said, adding that he was "very concerned about the security situation in this area." The attack came just a few days after the government had declared a ceasefire between the military and the Islamist group, which had claimed responsibility for the attack. In the end, a truce was reached, but the situation was still tense. Bodeh and his wife, Hauwa, fled to the nearby town of Kano, where they were forced to return to their homes. They were not able to reach their families, and they had to stay in their houses for a couple of days before they could return home. Since then, they have been living in a house with a small kitchen and a refrigerator. Some of their belongings were taken from the house and taken to a nearby farm. There were also reports that a number of people were killed, including a woman who was pregnant with their first child. Many of them were Christians, who had fled the war-torn country to escape persecution in neighboring countries. But they did not have the means to leave the country. On the contrary, many of those fleeing the conflict were Christian, while others were Muslim, according to Umar Faruq Baba Inna, an analyst at the International Crisis Group (ICG) in Chad. It is not clear how many people have died in these attacks, although it is possible to estimate that around 10,000 people lost their lives during the fighting. Boko haram is believed to be the largest terrorist organization in Nigeria, with around 1.5 million members. This is the first time the group has attacked a major city in northern Nigeria since the beginning of 2014, when it was known as the "Boko Haram" area. A few months later, Boko Haram fighters took control of some towns in northeastern Nigeria and seized a large part of its territory, killing hundreds of civilians and displacing thousands of internally displaced people. During the fight against the jihadists, Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan ordered the army to take action against them. He also called for an end to all attacks on Christians and Muslims, as well as a halt to bombings and kidnappings of Christian and non-Christian worshipers. These attacks were carried out by Islamist militants, some of whom had been killed by soldiers and police. As a result, Nigeria's security forces have struggled to contain the threat posed by the insurgency, particularly in rural areas of northern and central Nigeria. Although the attacks have not been particularly successful, security officials have said they will continue to try to prevent further attacks. And they are not afraid of reprisals against Christians or of attacks by other religious groups, such as al-Qaeda and Islamic State (IS). The Nigerian military has also said that it will not tolerate attacks from other countries, even if they do not want to do so. So far, however, it has not done anything to stop the violence. For example, on March 28, 2015, military leaders in Cameroon, Chad, Niger, Cameroon and Chad announced that they would no longer be allowed to carry out attacks against Christian churches and mosques, despite the fact that many churches in those areas have already been destroyed. That is why many Nigerians are now calling for military action, especially in areas that have suffered heavy losses in recent years due to insecurity. "
,"Reference text": " #BringBackOurGirls still hopeful one year on One year ago, more than 200 schoolgirls from Chibok were kidnapped by Boko Haram militants. Parents of the missing girls told DW's correspondent in Nigeria, Adrian Kriesch, that they remain optimistic. Lawal Emos clenches his fist and kneads his fingers. He had firmly resolved not to cry when he talks about Comfort. She is a lovely girl, Emos says, always helpful and determined. Comfort is his 17-year-old daughter. A year ago she was abducted by Boko Haram from their school in the village of Chibok, northeastern Nigeria. Like other tens of thousands, Emos, his wife and their five remaining children fled to Yola, a city located 270 kilometers (167 miles) from Chibok. He has gotten thinner in recent months as his family survives on irregular donations from friends and the Red Cross. Formerly a farmer in his home town, Emos has been unable to get land in Yola. "Do you have a photo of Comfort?" I ask. And immediately the father of six breaks down in tears. Emos admits that he can't control his emotions whenever he sees his daughter's picture. He left all of them in Chibok. Opening wounds This is the third time I am in Yola since the kidnapping of the Chibok girls on the night of April 14 -15, 2014. It is also the third time while covering for DW the plight of the girls still in Boko Haram captivity. As emotional wounds of the parents are ripped open once again, tears flow, I film, and I get this bad feeling. Lawal Emos says he knows of twelve fellow parents who have died following the kidnapping. "The constant crying and thinking of their daughters killed them." Emos and his wife Hauwa sometimes find themselves thinking that it would be easier for them if they knew their daughter was dead. "I have lost my hope in politicians because they are not doing anything," Hauwa says. "Only God can still help us to find them - dead or alive. But our government, forget it." Three weeks after the abduction, the Islamist terrorist group Boko Haram claimed responsibility. For six years, the Islamic sect has carried out a deadly insurgency especially in northeastern Nigeria. Initially, Boko Haram said it was fighting against the corrupt Nigerian government, but with time its objectives have become increasingly unclear. Thousands of Christians and Muslims have been killed in raids and attacks by the militants. As for the kidnapped girls, Boko Haram's leader Abubakar Shekau said in one of his bizarre speeches, they had been sold off as slaves. Government's inconsistency An international outcry for the Chibok girls became a phenomenon with the hashtag #bringbackourgirls on Twitter. Nigeria's neighbors declared war on Boko Haram and the US sent military advisers to help locate and free the girls. On May 26, 2014, Alex Badeh, Nigeria's supreme commander of the armed forces, proclaimed that they knew the whereabouts of the girls but a rescue operation would be too dangerous. In mid-October last year, army chief Badeh went before the press again saying an armistice had been signed and that the girls will be freed. It turned out to be another lie. It took outgoing President Goodluck Jonathan and his wife three months before meeting with the parents of the girls for the first time. "He said, 'Within three weeks, you will all have your daughters back, and within three weeks, we will renovate all destroyed schools in the region,'" recalls Lawal Emos. "Three weeks passed, then several months and nothing happened." Meanwhile Boko Haram continued their attacks on villagers unabated. Will Chibok girls ever be found? Shortly before Nigerians went to the polls on March 28, the Nigerian military together with neighboring countries of Chad, Cameroon and Niger began an offensive to drive out Boko Haram from occupied territories. Many Nigerians believe the timing of the offensive in the middle of the election campaign is not entirely coincidental. "The confidence in the military is at its lowest ebb," says journalist Umar Faruq Baba Inna from Yola. The outcry on the internet for the release of the Chibok girls has gotten quieter, only a few activists are now seen protesting on Nigerian streets. Many observers believe that senior military officials have no interest in ending the insurgency because of the benefits from the massive security budget. "The incoming administration of Muhammadu Buhari has a lot to do to reassure the citizenry that we can trust government and the armed forces," Baba Inna says. Buhari's opposition APC party won a resounding victory in the northeast, where the conflict rages. Even Lawal Emos voted for the former general, who has promised to crush Boko Haram in just six months. However, Nigerian political analyst Edgar Amos doubts if Buhari will ever find the Chibok girls. "A whole year has passed and they are in the hands of heartless, brutal terrorists " 

},{"Generated text": " Rio de Janeiro Olympics judge sentenced to life in prison A Brazilian court has sentenced a judge to serve a life sentence for corruption. Patrick Hickey was sentenced on Monday to a year in jail for bribery and money laundering. The judge, Juliana Leal de Melo, is scheduled to begin her sentence on 10 August. She will serve the life term of a suspended sentence and is due to be released from prison in the summer of 2020. A trial date has been set for 1.5 million Brazilian real ($435,000) and the trial is expected to last three to six months. Judge Jurgen Lefebvre, president of the European Olympic Committee (EOC), said the sentence was "inappropriate" and "unacceptable" for the Brazilian government. "The sentence is not appropriate for a country where corruption is rampant," he said in a statement released by the Olympic Council of Ireland (OOC). "It is inappropriate and unenforceable for any country to have a judicial system that does not respect the rule of law." The trial dates back to the 1990s, when Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff's government banned the use of public funds to pay bribes. In the end, the judge was found guilty of corruption and was ordered to repay the money she received from the EOC. Jbh/bw (AP, AFP) "This is a very serious case and it is an extremely serious one," the OOC president said, adding that it was a "very serious and serious matter." "We are very concerned about the situation in Brazil and we are going to do everything we can to prevent this from happening again," she said. Judges have said they will continue to monitor the case closely, but they have not yet made a decision on whether or not to release the jailed judge. jbh-ben (AFP, dpa, AP, Reuters) The court also said it would consider a request for an appeal against the conviction of two other judges, who were also convicted of bribery, for failing to comply with a court order and for violating the terms of their probation. It is unclear whether the two judges will be allowed to appeal their sentences. If they do not appeal, they could face a fine of up to 1 million euros ($1.2 million) or both, according to court documents. They could also be sent to prison for life if they fail to cooperate fully with the court's investigation, which could result in an automatic release from their jail sentence, or they can be deported to their home country of Brazil, where they were convicted in absentia in 2015 of tax evasion and bribery. Both men have denied any wrongdoing and have pleaded not guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit a crime and two counts of financial misappropriation of funds. Neither of them have been charged with any crime, however, and both men are appealing their conviction. On Monday, a Brazilian judge said she would appeal the decision to throw out the charges against them, saying she had "no legal basis" to proceed with her appeal and that she did not have the legal authority to challenge the convictions. However, she has not ruled out a return to jail if she is convicted. That would be a major setback for Brazil's bid to host the 2020 Tokyo Games, in which the country's president, Michel Temer, has said he will appeal his conviction, arguing that he should be spared jail time if he fails to prove his innocence. He has denied the allegations against him and says he has no intention of returning to Brazil to face the courts. His conviction comes as Brazil prepares to hold a referendum on the constitution of its Olympic membership in 2020, after which he hopes to run for re-election in that country next year. According to Brazilian media reports, he plans to seek a second term at the Olympics in 2021, although he is currently barred from running for another four years. Some observers believe he may be eligible for that position, given the high level of political pressure on his country. But others say he might not be able to make it to Tokyo because of his political views and his lack of experience in politics and public life. "

The 71-year old can now leave the country for medical treatment. Brazilian judge Juliana Leal de Melo - who serves on a court overseeing amateur and professional sports - authorized the release of Hickey's passport upon payment of 1.5 million real ($435,000) bail. Hickey could now have medical treatment, the Rio state court system said in a statement. Reported to have a heart condition, Hickey was arrested three months ago during the Rio de Janeiro Olympics on ticket scalping charges. He is awaiting trial, though has not been imprisoned. Hickey has denied any wrongdoing. He is one of 10 people facing charges of ticket scalping, conspiracy and ambush marketing related to the Olympics. Hickey said he would fight "each and every one” of the Rio Games ticket-touting charges he faces. Hickey, who was also the head of the Olympic Council of Ireland, was released from custody last month, but must remain in Brazil until the case is heard. "For clarity, I am not under house arrest as, like with so many things with this case, has been misreported by the media,” Hickey said in a statement on Monday. Hickey was arrested on 10 August at a luxury beachfront hotel during the games. The authorities told Reuters last week that they believe the ring had operated for around eight years and was preparing for other Olympic events such as the 2020 Tokyo Games. jbh/bw (AP, AFP) " 

},{"Generated text": " Libya: The story of the German Embassy in Tripoli A German diplomat has described the events of April 5, 1986 in the Libyan capital, Tripoli, as a "disco" of disco. Said Abdulaati, a resident of Berlin, described it as "a disco." "It was a disco," he told Bernd Westphal. "There was no disco at all. There was only one disco, and that's where the disco was," said the diplomat, who was not authorized to speak to the media. He added that he had no idea what was going on in Libya at the time, but that it was "very important" for him to be able to tell the truth about what he was doing there. In the end, he said, "it was very important for me to know that I was the right man for the job." In 2001, the European Union (EU) approved a $35 million ($57 million) loan to Libya to help finance the country's reconstruction. The money, which was supposed to come from the United States, was used to pay the salaries of Libyan doctors and nurses. It was then that the government of former Libyan Prime Minister Moammar Gadhafi, now the head of Libya's government, decided to give the money to a charity organization. According to an estimate by the Gaddafi International Foundation for Charity Associations (GFI) in 2004, about 6 million euros ($7.7 million), would have been spent on the reconstruction of Tripoli. But the EU did not approve the loan, saying it would not be enough to cover the cost of rebuilding the city. Instead, it will have to rely on other sources of income, such as the Turkish government and the British government. That's why the Germans are so concerned about Libya. They want to make sure that they don't lose their jobs. This is the first time since the fall of Gaddafi in 1990 that a German government has been accused of supporting the regime of terror. Since then, however, Libya has suffered a number of economic and political catastrophes, including the collapse of its oil industry. At the beginning of this year, German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder announced that Germany would no longer be contributing to Libyan reconstruction efforts. After all, Germany has a lot of money in its coffers, according to German officials. However, that doesn't mean it won't continue to contribute to reconstruction, says the Berlin-based German ambassador to Tripoli Bergd Westphalia. She said that in order to do so, she would need to find a new source of funding for reconstruction and reconstruction projects. So far, this has not been done, said East German Foreign Minister Berhard Württemberg, adding that there is still a need for more money. And he is not alone in his concern that Libya will not recover from its economic crisis. As a result, there will be no new aid from Britain, France, or the US. For example, in 2003, Britain agreed to provide $25 million in aid to aid the rebuilding of a country that had suffered from decades of civil war and economic stagnation. Westthalia, meanwhile, wants to see a return to economic growth and prosperity. Her government is also looking for ways to boost the economy and create jobs for young people, especially in developing countries like the Middle East. On the other hand, her country is suffering from a shortage of skilled labor and is in dire need of more skilled workers and skilled construction workers. A lack of foreign workers is a major reason why she is unable to get a job in her new country. Another reason for her reluctance is that she has to work in a foreign country, like Britain or Germany, where she does not have a permanent job. When she first came to Germany in 2001 she said she wanted to go back to her home country of Tunisia and work there for a year and a half. Now she's working in London, hoping to secure a contract with a company that will provide her with training and technical assistance. If she can't get that contract, then she'll be forced to move to another country in search of work. What's next for Libya? "I'm not sure what the next step is," she says. "

Twenty years later, relations between Libya and Europe have done an about-face. The Berlin disco "La Belle" was packed as usual on the night of April 5, 1986. Among its guests were many US soldiers, who were certainly not thinking of politics, the Middle East or strained relations between the United States and Libya. But reality caught up with them: a bomb detonated near the dance floor that night, killing two Americans and a Turkish woman. Over 200 people were injured. A Berlin court ruled that Libya and its intelligence services were responsible for the bombing. In 2001, following a nearly four-year long trial, the judges convicted a Libyan diplomat and three others to prison sentences between 12 and 14 years. The big oil-exporting country in the meantime was busy working on its reputation. Already in the 1990s, Tripoli began striving to improve its relations to the European Union. Financial reparation opened the door to Europe In 2004, the Gaddafi International Foundation for Charity Associations and the legal representatives of the German La Belle victims settled on $35 million in compensation. This opened the door to Europe. Just a few weeks later, Germany's chancellor at the time, Gerhard Schröder, visited Moammar Gadhafi in a traditional Bedouin tent outside of Tripoli. Britain's Prime Minister Tony Blair also paid Gadhafi a visit. A few months earlier, in April 2004, the European Union had welcomed the Libyan leader to Brussels. It was Gadhafi's first official visit to Europe in 15 years. Bernd Westphal, the German ambassador to Libya, said bilateral relations had been through difficult times. "The German Embassy in Tripoli today is working for a quick return to the liveliness of close relations between Germany and Libya," Westphal said. "We want to build on our traditional friendship with Libya and we want to strengthen the political, economic and cultural cooperation between our two countries and peoples." Business interests booming in Libya In the past few years, Libya has moved from being the supporter of international terrorism to an attractive economic partner for the West. European business representatives have been increasingly knocking on Libya's door. Even the United States is showing increased interest in the northern African nation. Washington is pleased that Libya announced at the end of 2003 that it would discontinue its efforts to develop and produce weapons of mass destruction. Libya's ambassador to Germany, Said Abdulaati, said political and economic relations between Libya and Germany were "excellent." Libya is one of Germany's strongest trading partners in northern Africa. Last year, Germany exported goods to Libya worth 657.7 million euros ($805.7 million), according to the German Federal Statistics Office. "The economy is the driving power in German-Libyan relations," said Abdulaati in an interview with the Arab-German association for trade and industry. But Germany isn't the only European country making deals in Libya. France last month signed an accord with Libya on peaceful nuclear research. "This accord represents a qualitative leap in relations between the two countries and proves that Libya has transformed its weapons of mass destruction into constructive weapons," Public Works Minister Maatuk Maatuk said at the signing ceremony in March. "We are telling the world that we are moving towards the development of Libyan nuclear technology for peaceful purposes." This week, the Netherlands' Economics Minister Laurens Jan Brinkhorst will visit Libya to negotiate gas and oil agreements. It will be the first high-level visit by a Dutch official since Gadhafi took power in 1969. "

He is to be replaced by another member of his party, Thomas Röwekamp. The mayor resigned on Wednesday after a series of corruption scandals surfaced in the German city. "It's a shame that I have to step down from my position as the Mayor of this city," he said in a statement issued by the Bundesrat, referring to the scandal that has rocked the mayor's office over the past few days. On Sunday, the Social Democrats (SPD) and the Greens (CDU) were accused of trying to cover up the affair, which they called a "witch hunt." The SPD, however, have denied the allegations, saying it was a witch hunt and that they had no evidence to back up their claims. Mayor Bündchen said he was not aware of any wrongdoing, but that he had "no idea what was going on." He also said that the SPD and Greens had not been charged with any crime, and he did not believe the accusations were politically motivated. However, he added, "I have no reason to believe that there was any such thing as an honest investigation into the matter." "This is not the first time that we have seen this kind of behavior," Börn told reporters after his resignation. A spokesman for the Left Party (left and right) said the party was "deeply concerned" about the situation, adding that "it's very difficult to see how this can be resolved without the involvement of other parties." A number of SPD members have also resigned from their posts in recent weeks, including the right-wing Christian Democrats, who have been critical of Merkel's handling of allegations of sexual harassment and abuse of women. In the case of one SPD member, a Greens member has been suspended from his post as party leader and is expected to remain in office until a new election is held in September. Meanwhile, other SPD politicians have said they will continue to work on the issue of police brutality in their respective districts. 'We don't want this to happen again' The Social Democrat party has called for a general election in Germany next year, with a majority of its members to run for re-election. It is unclear whether the election will be a referendum on whether or not it will take place, or whether it would be decided by a vote of no-confidence in Chancellor Angela Merkel and her government. If it is decided to hold a runoff election, it could lead to a hung parliament. But it's not clear how many SPD-led parties will support the idea of holding a special election to determine who will run the country's next federal election. There are also concerns about a possible split in opinion among conservatives and liberals, as well as between the two main parties. Both parties are divided over how to deal with the fallout from Sunday's scandal and what to do about it. Left party member Christian Döhler told the Bundestag newspaper: "We are not going to stand by and let this happen. We will not let it happen." Left-right SPD candidate Thomas Uhlmann said on Tuesday that it should not be allowed to take part in any election because it "would damage the reputation of our party." German media reported on Sunday evening that a poll of more than 100,000 people showed that only 1.5 percent of voters supported the Green party's candidate for mayor. That number was down to just under 10 percent, according to an opinion poll taken at the end of last week's parliamentary session. And the poll also showed a significant drop in support for Merkel, whose party is currently in third place with just over a quarter of seats in parliament, compared to its two-thirds majority in last year's elections. Merkel has said she will seek a second term as chancellor, although she has not said whether she would seek another term. She has also called on her party to form a coalition government with other opposition parties, such as Greens, to ensure that she does not lose support in her own party. "
,"Reference text": " Bremen Election Results Could Have National Repercussions It might be Germany's smallest state with a population of less than 700,000, but the make-up of Bremen's new government could curb the ability of Angela Merkel's coalition to continue with planned reforms. The Social Democrats (SPD) and Christian Democrats (CDU) have ruled the small northern city-state of Bremen in a coalition for the past 12 years. But after winning state elections on Sunday with 36.8 percent, the SPD is now flirting with the idea of ditching their previous coalition partners to rule together with the Greens, who made their best-ever showing in a German state poll with 16.4 percent. Bremen's state SPD leadership is to hold talks later on Wednesday with the CDU, which polled 25.7 percent. After an SPD meeting in Bremen, Mayor Jens Böhrnsen made the first signal he could be favoring the Greens. He said that during the campaign he had deliberately abstained from mentioning the possibility of a renewed CDU coalition because "after 12 years it shouldn't automatically be continued." Bremen's acting head of government and CDU member Thomas Röwekamp, however, warned against an SPD-Green coalition. "The majority of people don't want a red-green experiment, but a continuation of the grand coalition," he said. Both the SPD and CDU conceded heavy losses in the election, which showed a swing towards the Greens and the Left Party, which scored an unexpected 8.4 percent to win representation in a western German state legislature for the first time in its brief history. Block reforms? If Bremen's SPD decide in favor of the Greens, this would affect the ability of Chancellor Angela Merkel's grand coalition of CDU and SPD to push ahead with reforms requiring constitutional changes, such as stage two of Germany's urgently needed federalism reform. The federal Bundesrat, which is made up of state cabinet members, has to approve the majority of legislative bills passed by the lower chamber, the Bundestag, before they become law. Also, any proposed constitutional changes require two-thirds of all votes in order to be passed by the Bundesrat. The CDU and SPD currently hold 47 of the Bundesrat's 69 seats, which is one seat more than the necessary two-thirds majority. But without Bremen, the number held by the grand coalition would fall to 44 seats, meaning they would need the cooperation of one of the small opposition parties for any constitutional changes. Internal strife Earlier in the week, Chancellor Merkel called for unity within her ruling left-right coalition after the losses in Bremen set the stage for more infighting between the two parties. Merkel also warned the SPD against moving to the left after it lost some five percent points. The chancellor said the outcome showed the SPD had made a mistake by attacking the coalition and campaigning on promises of a minimum wage, which she believes will hamper efforts to fight unemployment of just under 10 percent. "The result showed that this strategy did not pay off," Merkel told a press conference. "

The US is warning of a possible escalation of tensions between Russia and Ukraine as tensions rise in the region. NATO said on Saturday that Russia was preparing to use lethal force against Ukraine in a bid to prevent the country from becoming a member of NATO. "We are warning the Russians that they are going to take advantage of this situation," said US Secretary of State John Kerry in an interview with reporters in Vilnius, Lithuania. He added that the US was "very concerned" about the possibility of an escalation in tensions with Russia, which he described as "a very dangerous situation." "The situation is very tense," he said, adding that he was not sure how the situation would be resolved in time for the conflict to escalate to a full-scale war. US officials said they were not aware of any imminent escalation, but they had been told by the Russian military that it would take place in Minsk, Belarus, as soon as possible. Ukraine's capital, Donetsk, was also under the control of Belarusian troops, while the capital of Kyiv, Luhansk, is under Russian control. Russia has denied the allegations, saying it was merely acting in self-defense. Russian President Vladimir Putin has accused Ukraine of using its territory as a bargaining chip in its war against the West. Moscow denies the accusations, however, and says it has no intention of doing so. se/ksb (AP, AFP)The US military said it had no reason to believe that Moscow was planning an attack on Ukraine, despite the fact that Ukraine had declared war on its neighbor. It also denied allegations that Russian troops were planning to launch a missile strike on the Ukrainian territory of Donetsk in retaliation for Moscow's alleged annexation of territory from Ukraine by Moscow in return for a cease-fire with the separatists. However, Moscow has repeatedly denied any involvement in any such attack and said Moscow had "no intention" of interfering in Ukrainian affairs. In a statement, the White House said the United States did not believe Russia had any plans to attack Ukraine at the same time as the ceasefire was in place.

Russia also warned Ukraine not to allow its forces to enter Ukraine without permission, according to an official statement from the military's office in Moscow. Last week, Russia warned the EU against allowing Ukrainian troops into the territory it annexed from neighboring Ukraine following the fall of President Viktor Yanukovich in 2014. Putin said he would "not allow it to happen again" if Ukraine continued to violate the terms of its international obligations under international law, including the right to defend itself from attacks by other armed groups, such as Hezbollah, Hamas and the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIL). The Russian government has also threatened to cut off communications between Ukraine and Russia if Kiev does not comply with its demands for an end to its nuclear weapons program. As a result, Ukraine has been accused of violating international humanitarian law and is seeking to impose sanctions on Russia for violating its obligations to protect its citizens. There are also fears that sanctions could be imposed on Moscow if it fails to fulfill its commitments to stop the nuclear arms race with Iran and other nuclear-armed states.

US General Philip Breedlove said Russian forces were still operating inside Ukraine. Speaking to reporters after a meeting with NATO military chiefs in Lithuania's capital Vilnius on Saturday, US General Philip Breedlove expressed "sincere hope" about a renewed peace plan, agreed to earlier in the day in the Belarusian capital Minsk, by separatists and representatives from Ukraine's and Russia's governments. The new pact, including an artillery buffer zone, was a move to strengthen a peace plan signed earlier this month, also in Minsk. However, Breedlove said violence levels in Ukraine in recent days were as high as prior to the earlier ceasefire. "The ceasefire is still there in name, but what is happening on the ground is quite a different story," Breedlove said, adding that Russian forces were still operating in Ukraine, although he could not pinpoint how many. "The fluidity of movement of Russian forces and Russian-backed forces back and forth across that border makes it almost impossible to understand the numbers," he said. A convoy from Russia consisting of about 170 trucks arrived in Ukraine on Saturday, with a reported cargo of humanitarian aid. Previous aid convoys sent from Russia were met with outrage in Kyiv, as it was suspected they may have been used to provide support to the pro-Moscow separatists in eastern Ukraine. Russia has repeatedly denied such accusations. The separatists have said they want to break from Kyiv and have already declared "people's republics'" in Donetsk and Luhansk.

},{"Generated text": " Bundesliga: China under-20s to compete in Germany's Bundesliga The Bundesliga is set to open on Friday with the opening match of the 2018-19 season in China's Regionalliga Südwest. German football association TSV Schott Mainz has announced that it will host the Bundesliga's first-ever Chinese team in 2018. "We are very excited about the prospect of playing in the German Bundesliga for the first time in a long time," head coach Michael Görner told the Stuttgarter Zeitung, adding that he was "looking forward to the challenge." "It is a great opportunity for us to show that we can compete," he said, referring to his team's chances of qualifying for next year's World Cup in Russia, which is scheduled to take place in Beijing in June and July. The league is expected to field a total of 22 teams in all competitions this year, including 12 teams from China, the world's second-biggest economy and the most populous country, according to a report by the Chinese Football Association (CFA). "This will be a very exciting year for our country," said the CFA's vice-president Ronny Zimmerman, who was also in attendance at Friday's opening game. China is the only country to have hosted the tournament since 2016, when it was held under the auspices of FIFA. Germany, however, has yet to host a team from the Asian country. It is not yet clear how many teams will participate in Saturday's match, but it is believed that at least one team, FSV Frankfurt, could be among those to be invited to participate. In the event of a draw, Germany will have to decide whether it wants to send its players to China or send them back to their home country for a training camp. There is also the possibility that Germany could send one of its own, as well as a squad from other Asian countries, to play in its first ever Bundesliga competition. However, there is no guarantee that the two sides will agree on a date. According to German media reports on Monday, China will send two teams to Germany for an exhibition match on Saturday, while the other team will travel to Hong Kong for training. Both teams have already signed a contract with Chinese football associations, and Germany is hoping to secure a spot in next season's tournament. But there are concerns that China may not be able to provide the necessary financial support needed to make the move. On the one hand, it would be easy for Germany to sign a player from another country who has been playing professionally for more than a decade, or to get the chance to train with a German team. At the same time, though, they would need to prove that they are willing to work with Germany in order to reach the next level of competition in their respective countries. They would also need the financial backing of Germany and China. As a result, both sides are likely to receive a lot of financial assistance from Germany. Although Germany has not announced a specific date for its participation, a number of senior players have expressed interest in participating in this summer's competition, with some saying it could take longer than the usual two years to qualify. Some of those who have been invited have said they want to go to Beijing. Others say it's too soon to say whether they'll be allowed to join the national team or not. For example, some of them say they don't know if they're going to attend the games in which Germany plays. Other players are also interested in joining the club, such as youth players from Shenzhen, Shenyang, Shanghai and Wuhan. Another possibility is that German fans will also be drawn into the competition to see who plays for whom. If they do, then they will get to know the players better. That's something Germany hopes China can do for them. After all, in 2016 the country's football federation was founded by a group of former Communist Party of China officials, led by former President Mao Tse-tung. Now it has a new president who is in charge of organizing the league's youth development program. This is something that has long been a source of tension between the Communist regime and its supporters. "
,"Reference text": " German FA calls off matches with China under-20 team after protests Germany's football association has called off several friendly matches between China's under-20 team and German lower league sides. The move follows a political protest at the first such match. In a statement released on Friday, the German football association (DFB) announced that the games would be rescheduled for 2018 and that talks would take place between them and their Chinese counterparts in order explore how to move forward. "To the regret of all parties involved, the project has not received the broad approval that had been expected," the DFB said. "In fact, the project was used by a handful of spectators to send messages that were considered hurtful by the Chinese team, officials, the Chinese Football Association's support staff and Chinese spectators." Protests in opening match The first of the arranged matches, against TSV Schott Mainz of the fourth-tier Regionalliga Südwest was interrupted midway through the first half when the Chinese players left the field because a small group of activists had unfurled Tibetan flags. The team later returned to the field after the flags had been taken down, before succumbing to a 3-0 defeat. On Monday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry strongly criticized the protest. Initially, it had been thought that the Chinese side would play in the Regionalliga Südwest - a regional division of Germany's fourth tier which has only 19 teams but the plan was revised so the matches would just be friendlies. This followed an agreement signed in 2016 between the German FA and the Chinese government to help boost the sport in the Asian country, where the Bundesliga is increasingly popular. Financial boost not enough to soothe concerns Despite the financial boost for the clubs – TSV Schott Mainz were reportedly paid a fee of €15,000 ($17.800) for last weekend's game – the move hasn't proved entirely popular with German fans, many of whom see it as just another example of commercial interests trumping sporting concerns. But the protests, and potential for further disruption, seem to be behind the cancellations - the DFB said both federations were aware of "substantial evidence of further escalation," FSV Frankfurt, who were due to host the Chinese side on Saturday, said earlier this week that they would not ban protests despite an angry response to last week's incident from Beijing. "We will not back a single centimeter off the basic rights our our democracy, including those relating to freedom of speech," FSV Frankfurt President Michael Görner said in an interview with the Stuttgarter Nachrichten and Stuttgarter Zeitung newspapers. His words echoed those of DFB vice-president Ronny Zimmerman, who said that the games should be played "within the framework of freedom of expression." The fixtures that have been abandoned include games against Wormatia Worms and Bundesliga club Hoffenheim's reserves. mp/pfd (dpa, SID) "

In 1995, the club started selling cars in Germany. Since then, it has sold more than 4.2 billion euros worth of cars each year. The club's goal is to increase sales by 1.40 euros per car, or 3,340 euros for a total of 4,380 euros ($4.3 billion) by 2009. This is the second year in a row that the car club has been able to sell more cars than it sold in the past five years. It is also aiming to double its sales from 2000 to 2009, with a goal of reaching 5,940 euros. Author: John Blau Editor: Sam Edmonds "In 2000, we sold our first car," he said. "We sold it in 2005, and now we sell it again in 2009." In 2005 and 2006, car sales increased by 2.5 percent, to 3.9 billion Euros. However, sales declined by 7,740 euros over the same period. Car sales dropped by 3 percent from 2005 to 2008, when sales fell by 5 percent. That was followed by a drop in sales to 7 percent and an increase of 6 percent to 8 percent in 2008. At the end of the year, there was a net loss of 1,000 euros, which was due to the cost of a new car being sold. But the industry still managed to keep up with the demand for new cars, as the number of vehicles sold rose by 10 percent year-on-year. Last year's sales were up by 6.6 percent on the previous year and by 8.7 percent over a year earlier, according to a report by the German government's statistics office. Meanwhile, auto sales grew by 9.4 percent during the 2009-2010 period, up from 5.1 percent a decade earlier. Overall sales of car parts increased 7.8 percent compared to 2007, while the average sales price of an average car was down by 4 percent at the time of sale. Compared to 2005's figures, this year sales are expected to be flat at 2,890 euros a car. According to figures from the auto industry trade association, Germany's car industry is now valued at $1.84 billion (around $2.25 billion). The car market has also seen a rise in car prices, driven by increased competition from China and the United States. Despite this, German car manufacturers are still struggling to find buyers for their new models. For example, BMW and Mercedes-Benz have struggled to attract new customers. BMW, for instance, have been unable to convince customers to switch to their current models, despite the fact that it offers a range of models that can be used for many different purposes. They also have to pay a premium to get their cars to market. And they are not happy about the way the market is playing out. As a result, they have had to cut back on their investment. So far, only 1 percent of their sales have come from their previous model. What do you think will happen next year? "I don't know. I'm not sure. Maybe we'll see a lot of people who are interested in buying cars," said a spokesman for BMW. He said the company is still looking for ways to reduce its reliance on foreign carmakers, but it's not clear how long it will take to achieve that goal. There is no guarantee that BMW will continue to make a profit from its current model, although it is expected that sales will increase by at least a tenth of what it did in 1995. If it does, then BMW is likely to lose its market share of around 10 to 15 percent by 2010. Why is this so important? Because BMW's new model is not the only model that is being used by German auto clubs. Other models are also being developed in other countries, such as France, Italy, Spain and China. These models have also been developed by other manufacturers. Some of these models include the following models: They are designed to compete with each other. "

German auto club ADAC says costs associated with owning a car have risen more than 40 percent since 1995. In 2010, German car owners had to pay a high price for their mobility, according to ADAC, which cited record-high fuel prices as the major cost factor. "For drivers, 2010 will go down in history as the most costly year ever," ADAC said in a statement. High taxes The cost of acquiring and operating a car has risen 42 percent since 1995, compared to a 24 percent increase in the general cost of living. Due to tax increases and higher production costs, fuel prices soared 86 percent over the 15-year period. In 2010 alone, the average price for a liter of super gasoline was more than 1.40 euros ($1.84) - the highest the average price ever. According to ADAC, urban singles spent an average of 3,340 euros on their cars in 2000. Five years later, that figure had jumped to 3,900 euros. By the end of 2010, their expenses reached 4,380 euros, or 1,000 euros more than a decade earlier. Driving is also pricey for four-person families with two cars. According to the automobile club, their annual costs have risen 30 percent over the past 10 years from 5,940 euros to 7,740 euros. Taxes account for the lion's share of gasoline and diesel prices. The German government's mineral oil and value added taxes account for nearly 88 cents of the 1.35-euro price of a liter of fuel. Low toll revenue While the German government reaps more revenue year for year from vehicle-related taxes, income generated by its highway toll for trucks is expected to fall this year for the first time since the haulage charges were introduced in 2005. The government predicts this year's toll revenues will amount to 4.2 billion euros, down from 4.3 billion euros in 2009. Author: John Blau Editor: Sam Edmonds " 

},{"Generated text": " Germany's Max Mueller Bhavan in India A German-German business school in New Delhi has become a hub for German students studying in the United States. It's a place where students can learn German, German and other foreign languages. But it's also a location where Germans can get a taste of their own medicine. The German school is located in a small town in Uttar-Pradesh, near the border with India. There, students from the school are able to learn the German language. They can also get an idea of what it means to be a German student in Germany. "German is the language of choice," says Rohail Aslam, who teaches German at the Fachhochschule für Technik und Wirtschaft in Berlin. German is also an important language for students, she says, because it allows them to study German in an environment that is conducive to learning German. In India, Germany is one of the few countries where German can be used as a medium of exchange. Germany, however, is not the only country that can use German as an exchange language, as Germany has a similar exchange rate to Germany and the Czech Republic. India also has its own language exchange program, which allows students to exchange German with other languages in order to gain a better understanding of German culture and language skills. For example, in Bhadohi, there is a school for English-speaking students in Delhi, where there are many German speakers. And in Bad Oeynhausen in Spain, the students learn Spanish, Portuguese, Spanish and Portuguese. This is very important for them because they have a very high level of education and are very well-versed in German literature. However, they also have to deal with the fact that they don't speak the same language as other European countries, and that's something that has to do with their culture, language and culture. That's not to say that Germany doesn't have an interest in Indian culture as well, but it does seem to me that the Germans are more interested in European culture than in developing it. So, I think Germany should take a closer look at India's cultural background, especially in terms of its history and its culture of integration and integration with Western Europe. I would also like to think that India is an example of a country with a strong cultural and linguistic identity, like Germany or the Netherlands or Spain or Portugal, or even Portugal and Portugal. These countries have very different cultural backgrounds and cultures, so it would be interesting to see how they compare to the rest of Europe if they were to come to India and exchange their knowledge and skills with another country. What is different about India though is that it has different customs and customs than any other country in Europe, such as the Middle East, North Africa, South Asia, Central Asia and even the European Union. How does India differ from other countries in this respect? Well, first of all, India has an interesting history of integrating itself into the Western European world. When you think about it, you see a lot of different cultures in different countries. You think of Germany as being the first European country to integrate with Eastern Europe and then you start thinking about how different it is in other places. Then you realize that you are not alone in your own country and you have the opportunity to assimilate into a new culture in which you do not need to go to school or work or study abroad. Now you can't go back to your native country because you're not going to get the education you need. At the very least, this is what you want. If you come from a different country, it will be easier for you than it was for the Europeans to introduce you to other cultures and to understand your country better. We are talking about a whole new way of thinking and we want to share that with you. Go ahead and try to find out what your culture is like. Do you know what kind of country you live in? Go here and see if we can help you find that out. Or do you just go there and learn a little bit more about the country? I'm sure you will find it hard to believe that this country has such a large population of Germans, Indians and Moroccans who are from different ethnicities and who have never been to Europe before. Is it just a matter of time before you get to know them better? Yes, of course there will always be people from all over the world who speak different languages and have different ideas about what is important to you and what makes you different from others. Of course, we are all different in our own countries but we all have our differences and differences in cultures that are different to each other. "

But he was eager to spend more time abroad and this time he chose Germany. His host country has thrown many challenges at him but he's been here for over five years. Small-built, smiling and very gentle, Rohail explains why he stayed. DW-WORLD: Why did you choose Germany in the first place? Rohail Aslam: I already knew a little bit of German, and I joined the Goethe Institute (Max Mueller Bhavan) in New Delhi to fine-tune it. After almost a year in Delhi, I finally landed in Germany to do an MBA at the ‘Fachhochschule für Technik und Wirtschaft’ in Berlin. What made you stay for so long? It was pretty much understood that after I had graduated, I would stay back for a while to gather some knowledge of the country, the country’s business structure and the working culture. I also had the intention of doing an internship here and getting a job to gain some experience here. My family has a carpet manufacturing company back in India. My parents wanted to expand it and start exporting abroad. So, while I was studying, they set up a company in Bad Oeynhausen in north-west Germany. We've been actively exporting rugs to Germany, Western Europe and the US for four years. What could be better than giving my knowledge and expertise to my parents and to their company instead of offering those services to someone else? Does the manufacturing process also take place in Germany? No, everything happens in India -- in Bhadohi in Uttar-Pradesh, which is a renowned carpet-belt -- and the services are much cheaper there. Once the product is completed, it's exported to Germany in huge quantities. Who designs the rugs? Designing is a two-way process. Either we pick our own designs and work on them -- we have two specialised designers who work for us. But if clients come to us with certain designs, colours and patterns then we make the rugs according to their requirements. Where is your company based? We have two companies which are both owned by my mother. The parent company is the manufacturing unit based in India -- called ‘Rohail Teppich Export’ - and the daughter company exports from Germany and is called ‘Handel Kontor’. So we sit here in Germany communicating with our clients, showing them our new products, introducing new colours and designs, inviting them to visit our showroom in Germany in case they cannot visit India. Do your carpets have a lot of Indian colours or designs? Well, I would not exactly classify them as Indian designs or colours. It's more about the trend of the market -- this could be anything. If it's called ‘Indian’, then it is. But the only justification for calling our carpets Indian is that they are manufactured in India. Unless, of course, somebody wants a carpet which has an Indian palace in its design. Otherwise, we mostly have modern and abstract designs -- for example, a bunch of boxes and dices. What is the market in Germany like compared to that of other European countries or the United States? The market is, of course, better in the comparatively colder countries. Having said that, conditions in Spain and in Portugal have actually been booming in the last decade or so. But overall the market is slow at the moment because the entire purchasing and selling pattern has changed. For example, 15 or 20 years ago a carpet or rug was almost a status symbol -- it was valuable. Now rugs are available everywhere. Not only that, earlier a rug meant handmade work and precision work by hand. But now you have machines, even robots, making rugs. Are your carpets also machine-made? The rugs we have are entirely hand-made. We have no machine work anywhere in our enterprise -- we don't have a production plant as such. The entire work process, from ‘start’ to ‘finish’, of a rug is entirely hand-made. Was it very difficult to start up a company in Germany? In fact no. Some might say it was as easy as child-play -- there were very little bureaucracy or paper-work. The whole company had been set up within a couple of hours. So, the set-up procedure is simple. But how easy is it to keep the business going? Well, that's the challenge. Because here there are not only other Indians who have stalls, shops or companies, there are also Persians, Turks, Moroccans, Germans, and English people. So there is a lot of competition. And the guarantee for success is dependent on the amount of effort and, more importantly, on market support. How do you cope with this "

Obama will visit the US military prison in Cuba on January 22, 2010. The visit will be accompanied by a visit by Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos, who is due to arrive in Madrid in the next few days. "We have a lot of work to do," Obama said at a news conference on the sidelines of his trip to Cuba, where he will hold talks with Cuban President Nicolas Sarkozy and Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy. Spain is the first European country to host a US president since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on US soil. President George W. Bush's administration has been accused of using torture and other forms of torture to try to gain access to US detainees. In a statement released by Obama's office, Spain's interior minister said the visit was a "positive step" for the country's security and expressed "deep concern" about the situation in Guantanamo, which is currently under review by the United States and the European Union for possible use as a detention center for terrorism suspects. A US official said Obama would visit Cuba "in the coming days and weeks" to discuss the issue, adding that he would be "very interested" in meeting with the Cuban government. jen/AFP/AP Editor: Andreas Illmer The US has accused Spain of being behind the attacks, accusing the Spanish government of not doing enough to stop them. On the same day, US Secretary of State John Kerry visited Spain, saying he had "no doubt" that the attack had been carried out by terrorists. He also said there was no evidence of a plot to use torture against US citizens, and that US officials were not aware of any such plot. However, he added, "I have no doubt that there is a plan in place to prevent this from happening again." Obama also visited Cuba in January 2011, when he visited the island nation to see his wife and two young children. During his visit, Obama met with Cuba's foreign minister, Jorge Luis Borges, during which the two men discussed the possibility of returning to their home countries, according to Spanish media reports. According to the reports, the meeting was attended by several Cuban officials, including the head of state of Cuba and a former US ambassador to Spain. It was not immediately clear whether Obama intended to return to his home country, but Spanish officials said he did not want to go back to Guantanamo because he was concerned that it could be used as an interrogation facility for terror suspects, such as the Palestinian Abu Nidal al-Zawahiri, a suspected mastermind behind September 11 attacks in 2001. That was also the case during his time in office in Washington, D.C., and in his first term as president in 2009. After his election in 2010, President Obama announced that Spain would no longer be allowed to send US troops to war-ravaged Syria, Iraq, Iran and Libya. At the time, Spanish President Bush said that his country would not allow the use of force against the Syrian regime in its fight against terrorism. Since then, however, there have been a number of attempts at military intervention in Syria and Iraq. Many of those attempts have failed, with many of them in vain. Some of these efforts have resulted in an escalation of tensions between Madrid and Washington over the past few months, while others have led to a rise in anti-American sentiment among Spanish politicians and members of Congress in favor of Israel's right-wing nationalist party, Podemos (PvdA) and pro-Israel parties. But the latest round of attacks has not been without controversy. Last month, Madrid's mayor, Josep Maria Lopez, accused Obama of trying to undermine the government's efforts to end the war on terror by sending a message to Washington that "the US is not going to give up on terrorism." In his speech, Lopez also criticized Obama for failing to act on his promise to protect the interests of Spain and its citizens in a way that would make it more difficult for US forces to defeat the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIL). "This is an attack on our sovereignty," Lopez said. "

The move shows Madrid's support of US efforts to close the controversial prison. Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said the first inmate from the US prison at Guantanamo Bay had arrived in his country. Madrid has agreed to host five prisoners, the largest commitment yet from a European country. Citing privacy concerns, Rubalcaba refused to give the prisoner's name or any identifying information, except to say he was a Palestinian. The new arrival will be able to work and move around Spain as he wishes, but will not be able to leave the country. "He is a Palestinian, he has already arrived in our country. We do not want to give out further details because we want everyone who comes to live in our country to be able to live their lives normally," he told a news conference. Spain urges others to 'do the utmost' Spain's decision to take five Guantanamo detainees is part of an effort to help US President Barack Obama with his plans to shut down the jail. The prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, was set up at a US navy base by former President George W. Bush in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos has urged other European countries "to do their utmost" to take in former Guantanamo detainees as well. Third countries are being asked to take in detainees who are cleared of any charges, but who can't be sent back to their homelands for fear of persecution. Obama had said he would close the prison by January 22, 2010, yet the deadline passed unmet. Some 200 detainees remain there, but finding places to take in the prisoners - even the dozens already cleared for release - has proved controversial. jen/AFP/AP Editor: Andreas Illmer " 

},{"Generated text": " Brexit news: British Prime Minister Theresa May on the brink of a hard Brexit The British government is on course to leave the European Union by the end of the year. But there is still a long way to go. The House of Commons is set to vote on May's plans for the country's exit from the EU in the coming weeks. It is due to take place on March 29, 2019, and it will be the first time that a UK prime minister has taken the oath of office since the start of her term in office. She is expected to be sworn into office in a few weeks' time, but it is not yet clear whether she will do so. Brexiteers have been calling for a "hard Brexit" for some time now. They want to see a smooth transition to a free and open EU. However, they are concerned about the impact of Brexit on their own country. "It is a very difficult situation," said Birgit Maass, a member of parliament for Britain's pro-European parliamentary group, the British People's Party (UKIP). "We have a lot of work to do," she said, adding that she would be "very happy" if the UK voted to stay in. May has been in Brussels for more than a year and a half to prepare for her departure. In the past, she has had to deal with a number of challenges, including a lack of clarity on how to proceed with Brexit negotiations, as well as the uncertainty over the future relationship between Britain and EU member states. This time around, however, it has not been easy. On the one hand, there are no easy answers to the question of whether or not Britain should be able to negotiate its own divorce from EU membership. There is also no clear answer as to whether Britain is prepared to accept the terms and conditions of its exit. That is, until the Brexit vote, which is scheduled for later this year, when Britain will have to decide whether it wants to remain in or exit the bloc. And it's not just Brexit that is being discussed. Brexit is the most contentious issue in British politics right now, with the prospect of an EU-UK divorce looming large. For many British politicians, this is an issue that has long been a thorn in their side, especially when it comes to negotiations on a future trade deal. Many of them are not even sure whether they would like to have the option of staying in, or if they'd rather stay out of, because they don't like the idea of having to pay the price for their country being left behind. Some of those who are, for example, opposed to Brexit have said that they will not vote for it because it would hurt their interests. Others say that the government should not be allowed to choose between the two sides and that it should have no say in how the negotiations are conducted. So far, so good. As far as I know, no one has come out in favor of either side. I think that's a good thing. If you look at the current situation in Britain, you can see that we are in an extremely difficult position in terms of negotiating our own future. We are very much at a point where we can't agree on what kind of future we want for our country and we cannot decide for ourselves whether we're going to continue to live in this country or move forward with our current position. What is important is that Britain has a clear and clear vision of what we have in mind for its future and how we will act on that vision. At the same time we must also be clear about our commitment to our relationship with Europe and our willingness to work with it in order to ensure that this vision is achieved. With that, we need to make sure that all of our commitments to Europe are fulfilled, not only to us but also to each other and to Britain itself." The UK government's position on Brexit has also been challenged by US President Donald Trump, who has called for an "open and transparent" approach to negotiating with EU leaders. Trump has said he wants Britain to "move forward" in its negotiations with Brussels. He also wants the US to step up its support for Brexit, saying that he is "looking forward to working with them." "I am very optimistic," Trump said in his speech, "but I am not optimistic about what the outcome of this negotiation will look like," he said. 'It will take a while for us to get over this uncertainty.' "The UK is going through a period of uncertainty and uncertainty," May added, pointing out that "it is difficult to predict what will happen if we do not get a deal." "
,"Reference text": " Opinion: A decision against heart and mind The House of Commons has passed the Brexit bill - despite most parliamentarians being against it. But now they should take care that Great Britain does not move further away from Europe, writes Birgit Maass. If only they had done it out of full conviction. If they at least believed that they could really benefit their country by withdrawing from the EU. But many of the parliamentarians whose vote will finally set Brexit on its wayhave voted against their hearts, as well as their minds. It was a vote against their minds, because the withdrawal from the EU will almost certainly, at least on a short to medium term basis, have negative repercussions for the British economy. And it was a vote against their hearts, because for many, a view of the future, divorced from Brussels and increasingly reliant on an unpredictable US President Donald Trump, is somewhat alarming. In recent days, many members of parliament have described it as "a catastrophe." No vote "against the will of the people." Of course there are "Brexiteers" who believe that a Britain independent of Brussels will be able to return to its former greatness, once it is no longer held back by the "Little Europeans." But they are in the minority - the majority of parliamentarians already declared their support for remaining in the EU during the referendum campaign. Yet despite this, Theresa May's government was able to push its legislative proposal through the House of Commons without any great difficulty. The predominant view, also amongst members of the two leading parties, is that to hinder Brexit and to fail to support the government in its endeavors to do so, would be to go "against the will of the people." Anti-EU newspapers have targeted Brexit opponents. And those who have publically come out in support of the EU have had to reckon with death threats. The at times passionate debate in the lower house, that went on over several days, was a temporary highlight in this European tragedy, which in the worst case could contribute to the continent disintegrating into individual sovereign states. Don't be intimidated The British public supports the hard-line position taken by Prime Minister May in withdrawing from the common market. Polls are showing that her strategy is gaining increased support. There is no turning back now. The British are now looking for clarity on the repercussions of their withdrawal from the EU. They want the negotiations with the EU to start as soon as possible. It was an historical misjudgement by David Cameron that he could win the referendum. Most of the members of the lower house believed the then-prime minister and voted to hold a referendum. But now they can no longer stop Brexit. But they should not let themselves be intimidated by party discipline, nor the leading Brexiteers, nor by voter impatience. Over the next two years they should use every chance they can to influence the withdrawal process. May announced that although they are leaving the European Union, they will not be moving away from Europe. The parliamentarians must now hold her to her word. Have something to say?

The answer is simple: It means drinking water that is not contaminated with chemicals. This is what happens when you drink a lot of water. That's why it's called no-diet water, because it doesn't have any chemicals in it. It's like drinking a glass of wine, but with a lid. You drink it from the tap, and then you pour it into your mouth. Then you rinse it off. And you put it back in the water bottle. The solution is the same as the one you used to have. But this time around, you have to use a different kind of solution. There's a whole new meaning to the word "water," and that means different things to different people. For example, there's the whole idea of a water purification system, which is supposed to be used for the purpose of cleansing the body, rather than to clean it up. In other words, it has to do with the fact that you can't get rid of chemicals that are not in your body. So that's what we're talking about here. We're going to try to make sure that we don't use chemical products that aren't harmful to human health, or that they're not toxic to our environment. These are the things that lead to cancer. They're the ones that cause cancer and are responsible for causing the death of hundreds of thousands of people every year.  And this is just one of those things. I'm not sure what the other side of the equation is. What do you mean by that? Well, I think it means that there is a certain level of toxicity in water which we can all live with, even if we have no idea what it is that makes it so toxic. Or that it makes us sick of our bodies and our brains. Which is why we drink so much water? And what does that mean for our health? I mean, we all drink this stuff, right? We all use it to detoxify ourselves, so we should be able to live without it for a long time. Why do we do this? Because we need to protect ourselves from toxins that can be released into the environment, like mercury, arsenic, lead, mercury and other toxic substances. Our bodies are made up of these chemicals and we use them in a way that allows us to stay healthy and prevent diseases like cancer, heart disease and cardiovascular disease. If you want to prevent these diseases from happening to you, then we'll do it by poisoning you with our own water."

In 2004, a lecturer at American University in Beirut told Deutsche Welle that the "Arab Spring" was a failed attempt by Islamists to overthrow the country's government. "It was an act of terrorism," he said, adding that it was the first time that Western journalists had been able to understand what was going on in the Arab world. It was also the beginning of the end of an era of radicalization in Lebanon, which was marked by a wave of anti-Western protests and the rise of Islamist groups in Europe. But it wasn't just the Islamists who were behind the uprising. There were also a number of other groups, such as the Lebanese Democratic Left Movement (DSM), that were involved in it. Some of these groups were linked to al-Qaeda, the Islamic State (IS) and other terrorist organizations. Others were associated with the so-called "Islamic State," a terrorist organization that claimed responsibility for the 1989 Beirut Spring Forum. These groups had a long history of fighting each other on the streets of Beirut and Alexandria, and they were all linked by the Internet and social media. Many of them had connections to the Muslim Brotherhood, as well as to radical groups like Hamas and Hezbollah. However, they did not have the resources to carry out their own attacks. They had to rely on a network of Internet connections, where they could communicate with one another and get information about the other's activities. This was not the case in 2005, when a Tunisian activist was killed in a car bomb attack in Cairo. At the time, there was no Internet connection between the two groups. Now there is, of course, an internet connection and a social networking site that allows users to share their views and opinions on various topics, including politics, religion, politics and much more. That is why there are so many people who do not share the same views as those who are critical of Islam and want to impose their faith on others. And that is not to say that there isn't a lot of information out there about what is happening in Syria, Lebanon and Syria. What is important is that this information is available to all of us, whether it is from the internet or via the social networks. We have to be careful what we say and do, because we don't want it to spread to other people. If we are not careful, we can't be sure that we're going to get the information we need. So we will not be surprised if we find out who is behind this terrorist attack and what the perpetrators of it are. I have no doubt that they are behind it." "I am not an Islamist, I am an Arabophone," said Khalid Said, who was shot and wounded in Alexandria in 2004. He died of a heart attack on his way to a hospital in Tunisia. His body was found the next day. After the attack, he was taken to an Egyptian hospital where he underwent surgery for a brain tumour. As a result of his injuries, his family was forced to flee to Egypt and he died the following year. During the summer of 2009, thousands of people fled to Tunisia and Egypt to escape the violence. According to eyewitnesses, hundreds of thousands were killed and thousands more were injured in Egypt, Tunisia, Syria and Lebanon. Most of those killed were women, while others were men, according to one eyewitness. One eyewitness said that at least one woman died from a gunshot wound to her head. Another eyewitness told him that she was raped by an unknown assailant. A third eyewitness described the incident as a "terrorist attack," but said he had no idea who the assailant was. How did he know? "He was just a young man in his 20s and 30s," the witness said. Was he a member of Hamas or Hezbollah? The witness told the interviewer that he didn't know what to make of what he saw in that video. Is he still alive today? He said yes, yes he is alive and well. "
,"Reference text": " 'The term Islamist doesn't mean anything anymore' Not since 1989 has a whole region undergone democratic revolution, but what are the common denominators in the Arab Spring? DW asked Lebanese lecturer and activist Ziad Majed, and he gave some surprising answers. Ziad Majed is a lecturer in political science at the American University in Paris. In 2004, he co-founded the Democratic Left Movement and participated in the Lebanese uprising of 2005 against the Syrian occupation of Lebanon. In 2009 he joined the Beirut Spring Forum. Deutsche Welle: We hear a lot about the relatively young age of populations in the countries that have overthrown rulers this year. But your take on that is somewhat different, isn't it? Ziad Majed: The demographic boom that we had in the past was over a few years ago, but the product of this boom is there, and it was young people taking to the streets now. However, the birth rate of this generation is much lower than that of its parents. That means at the age of 25 or 26, when their parents had two or three or four children, they don't have any kids. That makes them more capable of being mobilized. In addition, the fact that the age of marriage, whether for economic reasons or changing values, is becoming higher allowed them to take to the streets. This explains why the revolutions happened now and not five or 10 years ago. But youth still plays a role. You have to realize that people were simply extremely tired of seeing the same old faces in power who ruled when their parents were young. What I could also add is urbanization. That means territorial and social continuity. Young people are no longer isolated in small villages or small towns. The role of global media feeds into that trend, doesn't it? The first thing is satellite media. Anywhere you go in the Arab world, you'll see small dishes or even illegal satellite TV receptors. So direct governmental censorship and control of the media is no longer an issue. Everyone goes to al-Jazeera or al-Arabiya or even Arabophone European stations. Then, Internet penetration is becoming much higher. People can meet in cyber-cafés and discuss what they read. In Egypt, for instance. Khalid Said was a young guy in Alexandria who owned a cyber-café. The police were trying to force him to pay bribes and he refused. He even took pictures with his mobile phone of policemen beating someone. So they kidnapped him, and he was beaten and killed. The anger following his death led to the creation of a facebook page, which was one of the most important sites at the beginning of the revolution. In Syria, what was most important was that every citizen became a reporter. Independent, international media aren't allowed. So the only way for people to cover what's happening is by making mobile-phone images and uploading them to Youtube so the world can witness what's going on. A moderate Islamist party just took the most votes in elections in Tunisia, and the Muslim Brotherhood may emerge as the strongest party in next month's vote in Egypt. How does that square with democracy? The term "Islamist" doesn't mean anything anymore. The word arose in the 1980s and 90s to describe the rise of political Islam. Today, there's a whole sprectrum of groups that can be described as Islamist from the Wahabis to the Salafis, the Muslim Brotherhood to Hezbollah and Hamas. All these groups are different and don't agree on a single version of the sharia. The West should understand that under repressive regimes mosques were places of refuge, and that there's a tendency after the fall of a regime to vote for groups representing the victims of that regime. So it's logical that there should be some Islamist parties doing well. But that doesn't mean the same thing it did in the 1980s and 90s, when the movements concentrated on changing regimes by violence or force. For the first time, Islamist movements have achieved power through elections, and that will change them, making them part of the political game. They may win now. But if they don't deliver on problems like unemployment, why would anyone vote for them again? But won't they try to turn back the clock in a lot of ways? They might be very conservative in their mindset, but they cannot impose what they consider to be an Islamization of society. They are not the strongest part of the democratic movement, only the most organized. I'm not scared because I think the Arab Spring is irreversible. People have discovered the power of the street and of mobilization. So if the "Islamists" try to impose something on society, what's stopping people from going back out on the street and saying "We're not happy with this?" And what can Europe and the West in general do to help ensure that the democratic promise of the Arab Spring becomes a reality? Four things. We need investment that's decentralized so as to bring prosperity to neglected regions and that's guided by a principle of corporate responsibility. We need observers who monitor progress and " 

},{"Generated text": " Manfred Bätje: 'Satan is the devil' The Norderney Museum in Brighton, England, is a museum dedicated to the discovery of the North Sea. It's the first museum in the world to explore the phenomenon of Satan. The Bade-Museum is located on the north side of Brighton's seafront, just off the coast of England. In 1799, the museum opened its doors to visitors who had come to Brighton for a visit. There, they were greeted with a warm welcome. "It's been a long time since I've been here," Manfred told the visitors. He said he was "very happy to be here." "I'm very proud of what we've discovered," he said. But he also said that it's important to remember that there are many people who have come here to learn about Satan, and that he's not the only one who has done so. For example, in 1793, a German physician named Georg Christoph Lichtenberg was sent to England to study the occult and discovered that Satan was a devil. This led to a series of events that took place over the course of several years. One of these events, he told visitors, was when he discovered the existence of a "Satanic god" who was trying to control the human race. That's when the British began to believe in Satan as well as the German scientific community. After that, it was the Germans who became obsessed with the idea of God, which they called "the devil." In the early 17th century, German scientists and physicians began searching for the source of this evil. They found it in Cuxhaven, Germany, at the end of 1780. At the time, there were only a handful of people in Germany who were convinced that God was real. And that was before the advent of modern science and technology. Today, many of those people are still alive and well, but there is still a great deal of uncertainty about whether or not they will ever be able to live in a world where they don't know what they want to do with their lives. Many of them have lost their faith in God because of his influence on them, or because they believe that they can't live without him. These are the things that have been lost to us for thousands of years, because we can no longer see the light of day. We can only imagine what it would be like if we could just go back in time and see what God had planned for us. I'm not sure what he would have done if he hadn't given us the information we have now. What I do know is that we are living in an age where there's a lot of doubt about the nature of our lives and the meaning of life. So, I think we're going to have to make a decision about what kind of future we want for ourselves and for our children." The museum also has a collection of artifacts from the 19th and early 20th centuries, including the works of German physicist and mathematician Georg Friedrich Hufeland, who worked as a physician in England and Germany. His work was published in 1817. During his time in Habsburg Germany he visited the Baltic Sea, where he lived for many years with his wife and three children. When he returned to Germany in July 1818, his family moved to Heiligendamm, near the city of Hamburg, to take refuge in his father's house. A few years later he moved back to his native Germany and became a doctor there. Since then he has lived there ever since. Now he is working as an electrician at a medical school in Cologne. On the other hand, this is not his first time to travel to Europe, so he doesn't have the luxury of traveling to other European countries. As a result of all the discoveries he made, "it's very difficult to find a place to stay in Europe." He is also a member of Germany's first scientific team and has been studying the history of science for over a century. From 1794 to 1797, Hausenbühler was in charge of building a ship that would sail across the Atlantic from Hamburg to London and then to Cologne to Hamburg and back again. "
,"Reference text": " A Brief History of the Seaside Holiday These days, millions take seaside holidays for granted as one of life's pleasures. But 200 years ago, a dip in the sea was more a test of courage. Hardly anyone could swim. As late as the 18th century, many Europeans still thought of the sea as the realm of Satan: storm-tossed and inhabited by terrifying monsters. "Unlike the mountains, the coasts were terra incognita as a holiday spot," says Manfred Bätje, director of the Bade-Museum on the North Sea island of Norderney. Anyone who set foot in the water was "stepping into the unknown". Brighton showed the way That only began to change after the British aristocracy discovered the healing power of salt water. As early as 1780, Brighton, England's biggest and oldest seaside resort, was a bustling spa. Philosopher and physicist Georg Christoph Lichtenberg (1742-1799) of Göttingen gave Germans the starting signal with his 1793 essay "Why doesn't Germany have any large public seaside resorts?" In it, he called for the creation of a resort in Cuxhaven on the North Sea. He received support from the most notable German physician of the time, the Prussian king's court physician, Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland. But things turned out somewhat differently. Germany's first seaside resort was indeed built in September, 1793, but in Heiligendamm on the Baltic Sea. Four years later, permission was granted for construction of Germany's first resort on the North Sea, on Norderney. "For the first bathing season on July and August of 1800, only around 250 guests turned up. Now, the nearly 6000 residents host a good 530,000 bathers annually, plus around 230,000 day-trippers," Bätje reels off the figures. Romanticist inspiration In the 19th century, the landscapes of Caspar David Friedrich, such as his famous Chalk Cliffs on Rügen (1818), gave seaside holidays added impetus. From then on, the sea was no longer a voracious beast. From the shore, the cultivated, modern European contemplated the vast melancholy of the deep. "The calm sea became an embodiment of unspecified yearning, the waves an expression of vitality and dynamism," soliloquizes museum director Bätje. But the journey to the sea long remained an arduous, time-consuming one. It took the mail coach a good thirty hours to cover the distance from Hamburg to the North Frisian town of Aurich over bumpy, muddy roads. The express cab from Bremen only took about 16 hours to reach the East Frisian town of Norden - including six changes of horses along the way. "It wasn't comfortable," explains Bätje. Not until the introduction of seaside tourist steamers out of Hamburg and Bremen to the islands and the expansion of the railways did the journey become easier. Strict bathing rules At first, it was primarily the well-to-do bourgeois and nobility who were able to afford a seaside holiday. Victorian-era society is known for its extreme prudishness, and the beach was not exempt. Bathing machines were essentially changing cabins on wheels that could be rolled into the surf. The sexes were kept strictly separated. Wet swimsuits could not be allowed to cling, thus revealing the body's contours. Women sported baggy flannel garments with bloomers underneath that swiftly became waterlogged to where the bather was risking her life. Hardly anyone really knew how to swim anyway. "Most bathers wouldn't stay in the water any more than two minutes, often just seconds at a time. The English had a rule: 'Three dips and out'," quips archivist Manfred Bätje, whose Bade-Museum is housed in a building for a former wave pool, just a few steps from Norderney's Weststrand, where, during the summer months, vacationers sunbathe in wicker beach chairs and on blankets, cooled by a salty sea breeze. Sunbathing first came in style early in the 20th century, and the first true swimsuits were produced in the United States. "Starting in 1919, today's bathing culture gradually began to take shape," Bätje looks back. At the same time, ideals of beauty were in flux - such as the attitude towards tan skin, which had long been regarded as a mark of farmers and manual laborers. Bätje: "People were still cultivating their genteel pallors." Water, Waves, Wellness Today, the sun worshipers are the devout masses, and seaside holidays are their pilgrimages. The North Sea resorts alone count some 12.9 million overnight stays annually. Health is once again a primary concern: sea air, sea water, sea salts and the algaes and mud used in " 

},{"Generated text": " German journalist Nikolas Brender dies in the Spiegel Affair German journalist Dirk C. Fleck has died in a plane crash in October, 1962. He was a member of the German public broadcaster, Spiegel. His death was the result of a series of events that took place during the summer of 1962, when the Bundeswehr, the country's military intelligence agency, was attacked by a group of anti-aircraft missiles. The German government, which was at the time led by then-Defense Minister Franz Josef Strauss, reacted with shock. "I was shocked," he said in an interview with Deutsche Welle, adding that he had never heard of such an incident before. In the end, he went on to write a book about the events, and how it affected him and his family. After all, it was only a few days after the attack that Spiegel published a story about a man who had been shot and killed in his home town of Schleswig-Holstein. It was then that the war in Europe began to take a toll on the media, with Spiegel and other German media outlets, including the state-run German news agency WDR, being the first to report on it. Spiegel was one of several German newspapers to be attacked in 1962 by the NATO-led alliance of NATO and the United States. A number of journalists were killed and hundreds of thousands of people were injured. Some of them were seriously injured or even killed. Others died of their injuries. Many of those who survived the attacks were journalists, but they were not the only ones. They were the ones who suffered the most. There were also many others who died as a result, such as former defense minister Michael Konrad Adenauer and former interior minister Bodo Hombach, who were among the journalists who lost their lives. All of these journalists are still alive today, even though they are no longer working for the government. What happened to them? What did they do to deserve this fate? In a letter to the editor of Germany's leading newspaper, Welt am Sonntag, a journalist from the Scandinavian state of Hesse-Hesse was quoted as saying: "It's a shame that we have to live with the consequences of what happened in our country." The letter was signed by Spiegel's editor-in-chief and publisher Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (WDR) and was sent to a German court of justice, where it has since been translated into English and published in German. Since then, there have been several other cases in which Spiegel has been accused of covering up the murder of an ex-spiegel journalist. But it's not just Spiegel that has drawn the attention of politicians and journalists alike. This is also the case of one journalist who was killed during an attack on a public radio station in Hessen-Württemberg. Another journalist was injured when he was shot in front of his car while trying to cover up a terrorist attack. Both men were later arrested and charged with attempted murder. According to Spiegel, this was an act of revenge against the "Nazi regime" that had taken place in Germany during World War II. Der Spiegel also published an article in September of that year, calling for a "total and complete shutdown" of radio and television broadcasting. At the same time, its editor, Wolfgang Schöpfer, said that it would be "a total and total shutdown of all radio, television and radio broadcasting." He also called for an end to airtime restrictions on foreign broadcasters, saying that broadcasters should be allowed to carry out their own broadcasts without fear of reprisals from foreign governments. However, Germany has a long way to go before it is able to do so without the threat of war. So far, so good. As far as I know, no one has come forward to say that Germany is willing to give up its freedom of speech and press freedom. That's because it doesn't want to lose the freedom to broadcast its own news. And that's exactly what happens when you have a free press. If you don't like what you're doing, then you can't do anything about it, because you've lost the right to free speech. "
,"Reference text": " Taking stock of press freedom in Germany Fifty years ago, the offices of "Spiegel" magazine were searched and leading journalists arrested as a result of political pressure. Press freedom eventually prevailed. Today too the media's independence is under threat. What happened in October, 1962, had a lasting effect on the relationship between politicians, the judiciary and journalists in Germany. Spiegel news magazine had published an article critical of Germany's armed forces, the Bundeswehr. The German army, it said, was only "prepared for defense to a limited extent", adding it would certainly have to employ nuclear missiles to counter attacks. That was the author's conclusion following an evaluation of a NATO maneuver. Leading politicians - first and foremost Chancellor Konrad Adenauer and Defense Minister Franz Josef Strauss - accused the magazine of treason. A constitutional lawyer filed charges against the editorial office, arrest warrants were issued for the author and the chief editor. The latter remained in custody for more than 100 days. The Spiegel editorial department was shut down for weeks. There was a public outcry against the state's handling of the journalists, even protest from members of the coalition government. In the end, Defense Minister Strauss was forced to resign after his considerable participation in the reprisals against the news magazine became evident. Germany's Federal Court of Justice also ruled there was no proof of treason. What became known as the Spiegel Affair still touches issues that are highly relevant even today. Is a democratic state allowed to reprimand critical reporters? And how freely can the German media report on politics? Press freedom today "Such featherbrained attempts by politics to influence the press are today no longer possible," Bodo Hombach, former Social Democrat and director of WAZ media group, told Deutsche Welle. The head of the German Federation of Journalists (DJV), Michael Konken agrees. "We have a critical media with quality publications and broadcasters who bring such problems to the public." At the same time, Konken has to admit that Reporters without Borders has in the past years ranked Germany only in places 17 to 19 in its press freedom index. The top places where occupied by the Scandinavian countries. This, Konken said, pointed to problems in Germany. And indeed, there have been examples confirming that in the recent past. Politics has grip on public broadcasters The "Brender case" is often viewed as an example of a blow to freedom of the press. Nikolas Brender was editor-in-chief of Germany's public broadcaster ZDF. As he was an independently minded journalist who would not refrain from saying what he thought, he was not always popular with politicians. It was first and foremost Roland Koch, premier of the state of Hesse at the time, who opposed renewing Brender's contract - and Bender lost his job. How was this possible? All public broadcasters are officially controlled by their supervisory and administrative boards. After the experience of government controlled media under the Nazis, broadcasters in post-war West Germany were supposed to be democratically controlled. The boards are made up of a cross-section of society, including politicians from all major parties. In the case of ZDF when Brender was editor in chief, the board was dominated by conservative politicians. And that's what stacked the odds against Bender when it came to extending his contract. Powerless The way in which Brender was treated by the politicians on the board caused an uproar across the entire media landscape in Germany. Even representatives of the conservative media thought that a line had been crossed. "An act of unbelievable high-handedness" of those responsible, says Mathias Döpfner, who is at the helm of the conservative Axel Springer publishing house. "A dangerous interference with the DNA of a broadcaster," criticized Frank Schirmacher of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung daily. But, again and again, there have been attempts - mostly by politicial leaders - to interfere with the internal affairs of a broadcaster; a claim confirmed by Hartmann von der Tann, former coordinator for politics with Germany's other big public broadcaster, ARD. Print media also affected Newspapers in Germany experience limits to press freedom for different reasons. Dirk C. Fleck, for his book "The Fourth Power," spoke to 25 leading journalists and editors-in-chief about how independent they are. There's not a lot of room, he says. Speaking to DW, the author described the sobering answers he got and how almost all of the journalists describe the same vicious circle. It began with the boom of the Internet. More and more people got their news from the Web; in particular, young people who are important for advertising. Many companies therefore shifted their advertising budgets to focus on the Internet. German publishers responded by setting up online newsrooms to get some of the money going into online ads. But the free content offered online has not generated enough revenue through advertising. The print media has failed to capitalize on the online market. With the same budget, publishers have since tried to sustain both their print and online editions. As a result, editorial "

Obama is expected to meet with military leaders in Washington, D.C. The president is scheduled to hold a press conference at 9 am local time (9 am GMT) to discuss the deployment of US troops to the base. President Obama has been in the country for more than a year and a half and is due to travel to Maryland later this week for medical treatment at the Malcolm Grow Medical Facility. On Thursday, Obama visited the facility, which is located in Camp Springs, a suburb of the capital city of Baltimore, where he has spent the past two years. "I'm very happy to be here," Obama said in a statement, adding that he was "deeply concerned" about the situation in his home state of Ohio. He also said that his administration was working closely with the military to ensure that the troops would be able to return to their base safely and that they would have a safe and secure environment to live and work in once they returned from their deployment. In addition, he said, "We're going to do everything we can to make sure that our troops are safe, secure, and well-equipped." Obama's visit comes at a time when US President Donald Trump has called for an end to US involvement in Afghanistan and the ongoing US-Afghan conflict. US officials have said they have no plans to withdraw troops from Afghanistan until the end of this year. However, the Obama administration has said it will continue to support the Afghan government in its fight against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIL). The US president has also called on the international community to cooperate in efforts to end the conflict, saying that it is "not acceptable" for US forces to interfere with US foreign policy. “It is unacceptable for the United States,” said Vice President Joe Biden, who is traveling with Obama on his trip to Afghanistan with his wife and two young children, according to a US official.

During the meeting, both Obama and Biden said the two leaders had agreed on a number of issues, including the use of military technology to combat the ISIL, as well as the need to provide medical care to Afghan troops. But Obama did not directly address the issue, instead saying: "The US is committed to ensuring the safety and security of Afghan soldiers and their families. This is a very important issue for our country and we will be doing everything possible to help them." The meeting was also attended by the president's wife, Ohio's vice president of foreign affairs and foreign minister, in which Obama also spoke to reporters. It was not immediately clear whether Obama would attend the event, but the White House said he had been invited to attend. A spokesman for Obama told reporters that Obama had not yet spoken to any of his team members. According to Obama, there was no immediate word on whether or not the plane would take off from Andrews. His visit was scheduled for Thursday morning, after the first day of combat operations. After the second day, however, it was unclear whether the aircraft would land at Andrews or whether it would remain there for a few more days. As the day wore on, more and more troops were being deployed to other US bases around the world. There were also reports that some of them had already been deployed in other countries, such as Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Russia, Romania, Turkey, Lebanon, Egypt, among others. Some of these deployments have been cancelled, while others are still being planned for next week. At the same time, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Twitter that there were "no plans" to fly to Andrews for any military deployment, despite the fact that many troops have already deployed there. And he added that "it is not a question of whether we'll be returning to our base anytime soon." "It's a matter of time before we get back to Washington," the spokesman said.

He had been suffering from a heart attack and was rushed to the hospital where he was being treated for it. According to a report in Deutsche Welle on Monday night, the Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, which killed at least 40 people and injured more than 500. The Taliban claim responsibility, but the government has denied the claim. "The Taliban are not responsible for this attack. They are responsible only for what they have done to our country," Hasan said in an interview published on the website of the German political expert, Disha Uppal. In Pakistan, where the Taliban have been waging a war against the country's Sunni population for decades, there is no evidence that the attacks were carried out by the militant group. However, a number of people have died in connection with the incident, including a woman who was shot and critically injured in a shootout with a police officer on Friday, according to an official statement from the Pakistan government. It was not immediately clear how many people were killed, however, and whether the death toll was due to any terrorist attack or the suicide bombing of a civilian hospital. Hasan's death is the latest blow for Pakistani political analysts, who have warned that a new wave of violence is on its way. Last week, Pakistani media reported that Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif had called for an end to violence against Shiites in Punjab, saying that it was "unprecedented" for Pakistan to see a rise in sectarian violence. This is not the first time that such violence has taken place. Earlier this month, an Indian government official said that Pakistan was facing a "new wave" of sectarian attacks, as a result of an increase in anti-Shia sentiment and a surge in attacks on Shia communities in recent months. At the same time, Pakistan is also facing an influx of Sunni and Shiite communities fleeing the violence in their own country. As a consequence of this influx, many Sunni communities have fled their homes and fled to Pakistan. Many of them are now living in rural areas of Punjab and Kashmir. Some of these communities, such as the Ahmadi community, have also fled from Pakistan in order to seek refuge in India. A recent report by German news agency dpa suggested that many Shias had fled Pakistan because they were afraid of reprisals from their Sunni neighbors. But the report did not prove that this was the case. While there were reports that some of those who fled the area were planning to return to their home countries, others said they had not been able to do so because of their fear of being attacked by Pakistani security forces. DW spoke to Hasan about the situation in Karachi and how it has affected his life. Dish Uppsal, editor-in-chief of DW's Pakistan bureau, told DW: "It's not just a matter of whether or not you want to go back to your home country, it's about whether you're going to stay in your country for a long time." "I don't think there's any reason why you can't return home," he said, adding that he doesn't believe in returning to his home state of Pakistan after a year in which he has been living there for 10 years. What's more, he says, is that there are a lot of "Shias" in his country and that they are becoming more and more aware of what's going on in other countries. That's why he believes that people are fleeing Pakistan for their lives, rather than fleeing their country in search of safety and security. And that's what he hopes to achieve with his new book, "Afghanistan," which is set to be published next week.

,"Reference text": " Threat of the Punjabi Taliban is growing Deutsche Welle talks to Pakistani political expert Hasan Askari Rizvi about the growing ties between militants in northwest Pakistan and Punjab province. At least four gunmen disguised in police uniforms raided a hospital in Pakistan's eastern city of Lahore on Monday night, claiming at least five lives. Local officials said the gunmen were trying to free a militant, who was being treated there after being captured during attacks on two mosques last Friday. The police said the gunfight at Jinnah Hospital had lasted around 45 minutes but the gunmen had managed to flee. Friday's twin attacks on the minority Ahmadi community left more than 90 people dead. They were claimed by a group, which identified itself as the Punjabi wing of the Taliban. Deutsche Welle spoke to political expert Hasan Askari Rizvi in Lahore, where there has been a wave of violence in recent days. DW: Who are the "Punjabi Taliban"? It is a kind of a pejorative term, which includes a host of groups. Initially in Punjab, you had two types of militancy: One, the groups that focussed mainly on Indian-administered Kashmir and there were other types of groups that focussed on Pakistan. Those were the sectarian groups targeting mainly the Shias, and there were some Shia groups targeting the Sunni leadership. Over the years a lot of factions have broken away from these groups and these small entities are functioning more or less autonomously. They have trainings in the tribal areas because these are secured for them and certain parts are not under Pakistani control so these groups go there. They operate with the Pakistani Taliban based in tribal areas against the Pakistani troops in the region. They also have an autonomous agenda, which they pursue in Punjab, as they have been doing in the past days. These groups also play host or are a kind of a local link to Taliban suicide bombers who come into the main part of Pakistan from the tribal areas (let's say to Punjab). If they have to target some place, they park themselves with these Punjab groups, and then do it. All these factions and groups that have broken away from traditional militant groups and are functioning in close collaboration with tribal area Taliban are often described as the "Punjabi Taliban". Why do you think these militants are resurfacing now? They have always existed here and there and generally the trend is that they undertake a couple of operations, one after the other. Then the government comes in and takes action against them. Then they just disappear or become sleeping groups and suddenly after a couple of months they resurface. That's the standard pattern. The last major incident in Lahore was in the first week of March. Then there was nothing in April and now towards the end of May you have this kind of incident. Do you think the government should have taken stronger action against them? They should have but the problem is that the Punjab government has a kind of ambiguous approach and I think there is some element of denial within the leadership also. These groups also have some sympathy if not support at the societal level and that makes it difficult for the government to go against them openly. They need to work together and to emphasise to the people that they are terrorists. They use different names and Islam but actually their agenda is terrorism. Somehow the government of Punjab has been rather confused and ambiguous regarding these groups. Interview: Disha Uppal Editor: Anne Thomas "

He will take over from Pep Guardiola, who was fired by the Catalan club in November 2011. "It's been a long time coming," said the 56-year-old, whose first season in charge of the Catalans came to an end on Friday. The club had been in dire financial straits since the end of last season, with the loss of two of its three top-flight players to injury and a loss to relegation-threatened Sevilla in mid-July. In his first full season as coach, the former Barcelona player was sacked by Guardiola in July after failing to win a single league game in four years. Vilanca took over at the helm of a club that has struggled to cope with a drop in form since Guardiola was brought in to replace the sacked Luis Enrique. However, he is expected to stay on as Barcelona's coach until at least July, when he will be handed the reins to Guardiola. pfd/lw (AP, dpa, AFP)Pep Guardiola has also been given the chance to take charge at Barcelona, where he has led his side to three consecutive league titles in a row. Last year, Guardiola won the Spanish league title with Barcelona and was named the league's top scorer with 15 goals to his name. But the Spaniard has yet to make an impact on the team's fortunes since taking over in late 2011, and has not been able to convince fans of his ability to lead his team to the next level of play. Guardiola's side have struggled in recent years, losing their last three league games and drawing just one point in their first four league matches. It is unclear whether Guardiola will continue to coach his club, which is currently in third place in Spain's Primera Liga, or whether he plans to step down after this season. Pfd /lwb (AFP, news agency)The move comes after a period in which Barcelona failed to reach the Champions League final for a second consecutive year. That was followed by a 3-1 defeat at home to Real Betis in early July. Both teams have since been relegated to third-place, but Guardiola said he was "very happy" with his squad's performance. At the same time, Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde has said that he would like to see his players return to their former club to play for them in next season's La Liga. 'I want to be a part of this team,' he said, adding: "I don't think I can do it alone. I'm not going to let this happen to my team. We've got to get the best out of our players and we have to work hard to improve our squad." The move to Barcelona comes at a time when Barcelona are struggling to find a new coach and Guardiola is in his third year as a coach. His first two seasons in Barcelona have been marked by poor results and poor form. On Friday, they lost to Valencia 1-0 in LaLiga, their only league win in three games in all competitions. They are now in second place, behind only Real Madrid, in fourth place. And they have lost three of their past four games, including a draw against Valencia in last weekend's Copa del Rey play-off final, to a side that was eliminated from the competition last week. According to Spanish football's official website, "La Liga" (English: Spanish for "English Premier League) is the most difficult league to qualify for. There is a lot of pressure on Barcelona to do well in this league and it is very difficult to achieve that because they do not have the resources to compete with other top teams." "We have a very good squad," Guardiola told reporters after the match, saying that Barcelona would be "a very strong team" if they could win the title. After all, it was Guardiola who led them to victory over Valencia last year and they are the only team in Europe to have won a title in that competition. "
