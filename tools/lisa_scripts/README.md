THis Folder contains the script for launching on lisa. I suggest you copy the the script outside of the git repo (thus 2 level up from here). As the outputs of the experimenet will also show up outside.
They can then be checked and then moved to the reults folder in this git repo (IF you are outside then [ $ mv results ./KGNarrative/results ]) and then be pushed
