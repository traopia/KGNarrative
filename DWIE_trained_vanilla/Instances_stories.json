Google has announced plans to launch a new book library in the German city of Frankfurt, Germany. The company said on Thursday that it hopes to expand the library's reach beyond the US market.
The search giant said it would launch the Google Library in Frankfurt on Friday, a day before the Frankfurt Book Fair kicks off in San Francisco. "We are excited to announce the launch of our new library," Google spokeswoman Jennifer Grant said in a statement. Google said the company would expand its library to include more than 100,000 titles, including books, short stories, novels and short fiction, as well as books on topics such as gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, sexuality and gender roles. It also said that Google would be the first company in Germany to offer a library for women and girls, in addition to the existing library of books for men and women in their 20s and 30s, and would offer free books to women of all ages, regardless of gender or age. In addition, Google will be offering a free digital library, which will allow women to choose from a wide range of genres, according to a Google press release. Read more: Google's "Google library" seeks to help women find work in tech The Google library is one of the largest online book libraries in Europe, with over 1,500 titles in print, online and print. According to Google, it will also be available in English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish. But Google is not the only company that wants to sell books in German. Author Patricia Schroeder, head of publishing at the Association of American Publishers, said she was "deeply disappointed" by the decision. She said Google had been unable to find a publisher willing to take on the challenge of selling books at a price that would allow it to compete with Amazon.com and Barnes & Noble, among other publishers, for a total of $1.5 billion. That's a lot of money to spend on a book, she said, adding that "it's not just about the books that are being sold, but also the people who are selling them." "It's about making sure that they're getting a good deal out of it," she added, referring to Amazon's Kindle and Apple's iPad, both of which are available for sale online. Book sales are also expected to be up, although Google has not yet announced a release date for the book. Publishers are still waiting for word on whether the publisher will make a final decision on how to proceed with the sale of their books. Some publishers have already said they will not be able to make any final decisions until the end of this year. However, they expect Google to continue to push ahead with its efforts to increase the number of booksellers and increase its online presence. They also expect to see a rise in online sales, especially as more women are entering the workforce. And they are expecting a surge in sales from women, who have traditionally been left behind by male-dominated industries like Amazon and Google. So far, there have been no signs of a shift in consumer attitudes toward women's rights. As a result, the online bookstore has seen an increase in its stock price, while online retailers have seen a drop in business activity in recent months. Meanwhile, bookstores are seeing an uptick in demand for their products. Online retailers, meanwhile, have also seen their stock prices rise. New book launches are expected in September. Last month, Amazon announced it was launching its new online store, "The Book Library," which is aimed at women who want to explore the world of digital publishing. Amazon has also launched its own digital bookstore, called the "Bookstore for Women," in which women can buy books online for $5.99 a month. At the same time, Apple and Amazon have launched their own e-book store in New York City, where they hope to open their doors to more female-led publishers. There is also talk of expanding their digital presence in China, India and the Middle East. "
,"Reference text": " German Publishers Warm to Google Library
Google is heading for a legal battle with American publishers over its plan to digitize books from five major libraries. But German publishers seem warm to the idea.
Five major US publishers filed suit in San Francisco on Wednesday to block Google from scanning books without the permission of copyright holders. The project, already underway but stopped by Google in August, is the Silicon Valley company's bid to make the world's books searchable online. Five major libraries are already participating in the project and Google sent executive Jennifer Grant to the Frankfurt Book Fair on Wednesday to present the idea to European and German book publishers. This week Google introduced print.google.de, the German version of the search engine Google posted online this time last year. Google lets users type in a search term then scans its digitized library for the word or expression and produces a list of books where the term is mentioned. Users can then click on the results and a few pages of the text appear allowing users to read up online. The idea is to supplement Internet users with another source of material. In contrast to their American colleagues, German publishing houses have reacted well to the database. Some German publishers on board Google said that is discussing terms with all major German publishers. Langenscheidt, which publishes a large selection of dictionaries, said they had got on board. "We are starting with 160 books," Hubert Haarmann, head of the electronic publishing division and the publisher, told the Financial Times Deutschland. "We see it as an additional distribution possibility." An increased and more direct reach to the consumer is just one way Google is promoting its new project to skeptical publishers. The company also says that publishers will be able to monitor interest in titles through the search engine, and use the information in deciding whether to reprint certain books. Google has also promised publishers a cut of the advertising that will appear on the site. Not all German publishers are on board. In fact, the German association representing publishers has announced it will begin its own project where publishers can scan their own books, rather than let someone else do it. The project is not a competitor to Google, but will allow publishers to create their own database, rather than turn it over to the search engine. If Google can, anyone can But American publishers don't want to even take that step. They fear a slippery slope if Google is allowed to digitize copyrighted material. "If Google can make … copies, then anyone can," Patricia Schroeder, president of the Association of American Publishers, said in a phone interview with Reuters. "Anybody could go into a library and start making digital copies of anything." At issue is the right of authors and their publishers to their own work versus the "fair use" of their work by the public. Google argues that their search engine will only offer users a "card catalog" function, with a few pages of text. No one will be able to read the entire book online. "

US President Barack Obama has spoken out against Cuba's harsh treatment of the island nation. The US Congress and the White House have agreed that Cuba must be held accountable for its human rights violations.
President Obama spoke out in favor of Cuba on Tuesday, calling on Congress to take action against the communist regime in Cuba. "The Cuban people deserve better," Obama said in a statement released by the US embassy in Havana. Obama also called on the Cuban government to cooperate with the international community in its fight against terrorism. He also said that "the US government must act to protect the rights of all Cubans." "We have a responsibility to uphold the rule of law," he said, adding that he was "deeply concerned" about the "violations" that have occurred in the country's judicial system over the past few years. But he added that there was no evidence that the regime had committed any violations of international law, and that this was not the case in any way, shape or form. In his speech, Obama made clear that his administration was committed to ending the abuses committed by President Raul Castro, who was sentenced to 15 years in prison for crimes against humanity and genocide. However, he did not directly address the issue of torture, which has been the subject of intense debate in Congress since the end of Obama's presidency in 2009. And he made no mention of Guantanamo, the notorious US military prison that houses US prisoners of war. US President Obama, however, did make a point of mentioning Cuba in his address to the nation's Congress last week. It was the first time that a US president had addressed Cuba since he took office in January 2009, according to a report in The New York Times. Cuba has long been accused of torturing and killing its own people, but the Obama administration has repeatedly denied this accusation, saying that it was a "hoax." The Cuban regime has denied the allegations, though, as well as the accusations against it by US officials, including former US Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and former CIA Director John Brennan. At the same time, Cuban officials have said they have no plans to close the prison, despite the fact that they believe it will be used as a detention center for terrorism suspects. They have also denied allegations that US intelligence agencies have been spying on them. This has led to accusations that Washington is trying to cover up the crimes committed against US citizens in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba and other US detention centers. These accusations have not been proven in court. On the contrary, Washington has accused Cuba of being a state sponsor of terrorism and of using torture to justify its actions against its citizens. There are also allegations of abuse of detainees at the Guantanamo detention facility, where US torture is carried out. Astrid Prange, a member of DW's congressional delegation in Washington, told DW: "This is a very serious allegation and it is not something that we are going to accept lightly. We have to be very careful in our reporting and we will continue to do so as long as we have the facts and evidence we need to make sure that these allegations are true." Obama is also expected to sign an executive order to end the torture program at Guantánamo Bay. That is, if Congress passes a bill that would allow US authorities to shut down the CIA's secret detention facilities there for a year and a half. If Congress approves the bill, it would be the second time in as many years that Obama will sign it into law. What do you think? "I think it's a good thing that Congress passed this bill because it gives us a chance to act on this issue," the president said. 'It's an important step for us to move forward' The president's comments came after a meeting with Cuban opposition leaders on Monday in which he expressed his support for the government's efforts to crack down on torture. According to US Senator John McCain of Arizona, "it's very important for Cuba to get its act together and get out of this situation." McCain said he hoped Obama would sign the legislation as soon as possible. McCain and Obama have already agreed on a number of important issues. "
,"Reference text": " Opinion: Obama's Cuban revolution
President Barack Obama has made a very special declaration of love to Cuba. It's as revolutionary as the Cuban revolution, and as peaceful as the biblical Sermon on the Mount, says DW's Astrid Prange.
US President Barack Obama has lost his old communist "enemy," and Cuban President Raul Castro has lost his hatred of capitalism. In the first phone call from president to president since 1961 the two heads of state came to a surprisingly swift agreement. They want to renew diplomatic relations, which have been on ice for more than 50 years, and exchange ambassadors. It's only a matter of time before the US lifts its trade embargo against Cuba. All the word "embargo" is really good for - at this stage - is as an ideological soapbox for political hardliners, especially Republicans in Congress who believe lifting sanctions would constitute defeat for the US. Yet the lifting of the embargo has already begun. In addition to medication, it has been possible since 2000 to export agricultural produce such as maize, cereal crops, and poultry to Cuba. Flirting with the rogue state Furthermore, 100,000 US citizens have travelled to Cuba since 2011 for cultural and scientific exchanges. Travel restrictions on Cubans living in exile in the US who wanted to visit their relatives on the island were also lifted. According to press reports, the two countries' military forces are even said to be cooperating, as are their coastguards, and military on the border of the US marine base in Guantanamo. Now Obama wants to officially open a "new chapter" in relations with the communist Caribbean island and remove Cuba from the US list of so-called "rogue states" that support terrorism. The travel ban on American tourists visiting the island will also largely be lifted. That's as far as things will go for the time being, as Obama would require a majority in Congress in Washington to lift the embargo entirely. But even if these are only small steps, the fall of the American-Cuban wall has begun. The easing of the sanctions and the resumption of diplomatic relations are setting the scene for an end to the embargo. Embargo as scapegoat The tearing down of this "wall in the mind" is long overdue. The blockade is obsolete, and has proved to be entirely ineffective. More than this, its advocates have achieved the opposite of what they actually wanted. The blockade has provided the leaders in Havana with an easy excuse for their economic failure. Raul Castro realized long ago that Cuba's economic problems can no longer be justified simply by citing the US embargo. It looks as though he was counting on the blockade being lifted: There is no other explanation for the completion of the Mariel container port in January this year. Cuba's biggest infrastructure project was, incidentally, financed by Brazil. The Brazilians also sent a declaration of love to Cuba. Raul Castro opened the door to them. He loves anyone who helps him - his friends even more than his enemies. "

Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi has been summoned by the European Union to answer questions over his handling of the crisis in Italy. He is expected to appear before the Council of Europe on Thursday.
The Italian government has summoned the EU's top diplomat to explain its decision to impose sanctions on Italy over the weekend. The move is the latest in a series of moves by Italy's government to try to prevent the country's exit from the bloc. Italian President Giuseppe Conte has said he will attend the meeting, which is scheduled to take place at the end of June. Italy is currently in the process of negotiating a deal with the United States on the future of its EU membership. "I am very concerned about the state of affairs in this country," said Giorgio Napoli, the Italian foreign minister, in an interview with Italian news agency ANSA on Sunday evening. It was not immediately clear whether the move would be welcomed by EU leaders, who have been in Rome for the past two weeks. In a statement, Italy said it was "deeply concerned" about what was happening in its relationship with Washington and that it would not be able to make any concessions to the US. EU officials have said they expect Italy to cooperate fully with efforts by Washington to find a way out of a crisis that has gripped the continent for months. Read more: Italy, EU prepare for possible EU exit The EU is set to hold a summit in Brussels later this week to discuss the next steps in negotiations on a new EU-wide trade deal. But Italy and Washington are unlikely to agree on how to resolve the issue, as the two sides have not yet agreed on an exact date for a meeting. Washington, meanwhile, has called for an end to EU sanctions against Italy for failing to comply with its obligations under the Lisbon Treaty. European leaders have also called on Rome to step up its anti-corruption drive, saying it could lead to an "unprecedented" crackdown on corruption and abuse of power. Last week, Rome's parliament passed a resolution that would allow the removal of all EU members except for those who are deemed to have committed crimes against the rule of law. However, it does not appear that Italy will be the only EU member state to be exempt from sanctions. After all, there are other EU states that are not bound to do so, such as Germany, France, Spain and the Netherlands. These are the countries that have the most to gain from an Italian exit. They are also the ones who will have to decide whether or not they want to go to Brussels. There is also a question of whether Italy should be allowed to continue to operate as a single EU state, or whether it should remain as an independent state. This is an important issue for Italy because it is one of many European countries which are trying to avoid the same fate as it did in 2008. If Italy wants to remain a member of EU, then it has to accept the terms of an exit agreement, but it must also accept that this is not the case for all of them. That is why the Commission of European Affairs (CEC) has asked the government of Italy if it will consider the possibility of holding a referendum on whether to allow it to stay in place for at least a year. As part of that process, CEC will hold an emergency meeting on Wednesday in Strasbourg, Belgium, to determine the fate of member states, including France and Germany. France has also asked for more time to prepare a plan for its own exit, according to French Foreign Minister Jean-Claude Juncker. French President Nicolas Sarkozy has already said that he would like to see Italy go back to its original position of being an EU country. According to France's Foreign Ministry, however, that is unlikely, given the current political situation in Europe. Author: dpa/jm (AFP, Reuters, AP, AFP) Editor: Michael S.

Citing his advanced age, Italy's President Giorgio Napolitano has announced his plan to resign. The 89-year-old did not say when exactly his resignation would take effect.
Calling the move a personal decision, President Giorgio Napolitano made his announcement during an end-of-year speech on Wednesday. "I'm about to step down, to resign as the constitution expressly allows," he said, adding. "I've reached an age that brings with it growing limitations and difficulties for me to do my institutional duties, which are complex and very demanding." Though he did not say when his resignation would take effect, a potential date is January 13 when Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi is due to give up the country's rotating six-month presidency of the Council of the European Union. Renzi faces a political challenge in organizing a replacement for Napolitano, dubbed by Italian media as "King George." The president has served as a key intermediary between political parties through numerous changes in government and other tricky political situations. Napolitano, a former communist respected by Europe and Washington, took office in 2006. At the end of his seven-year mandate in 2013, he was asked to stay on because parliament could not agree on his successor. At the time he warned he may not serve out the full term, given his age. In Italy, presidents have loosely-defined powers including the ability to nominate prime ministers, dissolve parliament and veto legislation, as well as use the moral authority of the office to influence politics. se/cmk (dpa, Reuters) "

Israel's envoy to the UN has said that he is not involved in any terrorist attacks in the Middle East. However, he did say that there are "certainties" between the US and Iran.
Israeli Ambassador for the United Nations (U.N. mission in Geneva, Switzerland, in January) Danny Israel said he was "not aware" of the possibility of an attack on Israel. "I don't know if I'm aware of any such possibility," he said. Israeli officials, however, said they had no reason to believe that Israel was planning to attack Israel, and that they would not be able to do so without the help of a US-led international coalition. The UN mission said it would be "very difficult" for Israel to prove that it was capable of carrying out such attacks. Israel's foreign minister also said there was a "clear possibility" that Iran was preparing to launch a missile attack against Israel in retaliation for its alleged support for Gadhafi's regime in Libya. Iran has denied the allegations, but Israel has insisted that the attack was an act of terrorism. It has also accused Israel of supporting the Syrian regime, which it accuses of backing the regime of Hafez al-Assad. In a statement released on Thursday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said: "We are not going to allow this to happen. We will not allow it." Iran's nuclear program The US has accused Iran and North Korea of trying to use nuclear weapons against the West. Tehran has repeatedly denied this accusation, saying it is "baseless" and "unlawful." The Iranian regime denies the accusations. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has called for an end to US sanctions against Iran, accusing Tehran of "provocative" behavior. He also called on Iran to stop supporting Assad's government in Syria, a charge Tehran denies. US President Barack Obama said in a speech to Congress on Wednesday that "Iran has no intention of interfering with the peace process." Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Liberman said Iran had "no intention to interfere" in negotiations with Israel over the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. His comments came as Israel and US officials met in Switzerland on Tuesday to discuss the Iran-Israel dispute. Both sides have accused each other of violating international law, including the Vienna Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ViNDA), which prohibits discrimination against Jews and prohibits the use of force against non-Jews. This is the first time that an Israeli envoy has been charged with a crime. According to Israeli media reports, the Iranian government has threatened to impose sanctions on anyone who criticizes Israel if it does not comply with Vienna's Vienna accords. But Israel says it will continue to cooperate with Washington in its efforts to prevent such a move. Last week, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Israel would "use all available means" to pressure Iran into giving up its weapons of mass destruction in order to protect its interests in Gaza and the occupied West Bank. On Wednesday, Israel announced a new round of sanctions aimed at preventing Iran from moving its embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. A spokesman for Iran said the sanctions were "inappropriate and unjustified," adding that Tehran "will not tolerate any form of violence against Israelis." "The sanctions will only be imposed by the international community," the spokesman said, referring to sanctions imposed on Tehran by Washington and its allies, according to Reuters news agency. Meanwhile, Iranian officials have been accused of plotting to assassinate Israeli President Hassan Rouhani in an attempt to influence US foreign policy. They have denied any involvement in Iranian-Israeli negotiations.

,"Reference text": " 'Bond between Israel and the US is unshakeable'
Israel’s former deputy foreign minister and Israeli Ambassador to the US Danny Ayalon spoke to DW this week about whether the Iranian nuclear deal has been a game changer in the relations between the US and Israel.
Danny Ayalon has served as Israel's deputy foreign minister and was Ambassador to the US from 2002-2006. DW: Have US-Israeli relations been damaged in light of the Geneva agreement? Danny Ayalon: Israel-US relations will not be affected by the agreement in Geneva with Iran. Yes, we do have our apprehensions; we do have our criticisms; but this is something that is legitimate between allies just as we have our different points of view about settlements, or about what should be the content of agreement with the Palestinians. The unshakeable bond between Israel and US is going to last on the natural alliance and political-strategical value of this alliance. Israel has proven again to be the only dependable ally for the US in the region in terms of American interests; in terms of countering and fighting proliferation of nuclear weapons - which is one of the most important things for American stability. How would you characterize relations at the moment between the US and Iran? I think it's very important to note that under President Obama the military cooperation and relationship between Israel and the US has reached an all time high and this continues. It's not just the administration though, it's also Congress, it's the people and the nationwide support that Israel enjoys in the US. This will not change although Israel has criticized and will continue to criticize the agreement with Iran. What do you think is behind the thinking of the Iranian leadership? The Iranians see two models - in terms of non-proliferation or in terms of dismantling the nuclear capabilities. They see Libya under the Gadhafi model and they see the North Korean model. Libya under Gadhafi voluntarily dismantled their capabilities and where is Libya now, where is Gadhafi now? On the other hand a decade ago the North Koreans went through what seemed like a consensual route and, boom, after a few years they detonated a nuclear device. For the Ayatollahs the nuclear capability is not just an objective in itself, it's a means for two things - to become the hegemony and the dominant force in the Middle East; secondly to put down the Sunii countries like Saudi Arabia and lastly their own internal stability. By becoming nuclear they believe it will be an insurance policy for them. The six parties involved in talks in Geneva should not be fooled by the charm offense of the Iranians because the Iranians came to Geneva not as a consequence of a policy change but as a consequence of their being on the brink economically. The main goal of Iran is to lift the sanctions and they have managed to do that without giving up any of their potential. Why does Israel's leadership think the Geneva agreement is bad? I believe that this agreement is bad on all accounts. It's not going to stop a nuclear Iran. Because of the message, it's going to make stabilizing the region much more difficult. It's going to induce more negative energy into the region in terms of terrorism, in terms of the Sunni-Shia clashes and it's quite obvious to foes and friends alike of the West that Iran has the upper hand. The danger is that Iran keeps the nuclear potential, the capabilities and the initiative in the hands of Ayatollahs. Any time in the future they can resume, they can actually accelerate their nuclear programme. The fact that Iran was on brink was not used well diplomatically by the six parties in the talks, because they could have gotten much more out of Iran. Iran played a brilliant game when they made the P5+1 blink first. The message to the region is that the belligerency of Iran pays off and that strengthens Assad, Hezbollah and all the very extreme radical forces. It also creates the counter offensive by the Sunni extremists. Where does this leave Israel? I think Israel's hands are now tied and there is no option at this point but the diplomatic option. Now it's just a matter of keeping Iran committed and answerable to the letter of the Geneva agreement. I don't think that this will be very simple to do. If a country is determined they can really overcome any monitoring regime, even the most robust. The last opportunity the international community has will be when the terms of the agreement are up in six months. When the P5+1 comes to the table for the final status agreement with Iran, this is the time to make all the demands with Iran. I don't think Middle East and the world can tolerate, or survive a nuclear Iran. Unfortunately it's been painted as if the duel in the Middle East is between Tehran and Jerusalem. It's not the case. The the threat of Tehran is first and foremost to the Gulf countries, to the Sunni countries, then to Israel and then to Europe. If you look at their delivery systems and their ideology it does not stop only in the Middle "

Swiss coach Urs Stadler has defended his country's Euro 2008 title, saying it was "a great tournament" and that the tournament was a "great success" for the country.
"The tournament is a great success for Switzerland," he said in an interview with the Swiss news agency DPA. "It's a fantastic tournament and we're very proud of our country." The tournament, which began on Sunday, has been dominated by the likes of Germany, France, Italy, Spain and the United States. It's the first time in the history of the sport that Switzerland has won the Euro. The country has a lot to prove, and it's no different this time around. We're in a very good position to win this year's competition, but we'll have to wait and see what happens next. I'm very happy to say that we've been able to get through the last few weeks, even if it takes a little longer than expected. In the end, we will have a chance to see if we can make it to the quarterfinals. That's what I was hoping for, because I think it would be a really good tournament for us to be in. But I don't think that's going to happen. There are so many things that can happen in this tournament. For example, if you want to go to Europe, you've got to do it in Switzerland. You can't just go there and play football. If you're not playing football, then you'll be playing in Germany. And you can play in Europe. So, I would say, this is one of those games where you really get to know the players, the coaches and even the referees. This is the kind of thing that happens when you play for a country that has so much talent and so little experience." "I'm not a fan of football at all," Schmid said, adding that he doesn't like the way the game is played. However, he believes that it is an important part of his job as a coach to make sure that his players are well-rounded, that they have the right attitude and are willing to work hard to improve their game. He also said that if they were to lose the match, they would have had a better chance of winning it. 'I think we could have won it' "That's why we have been playing so well for so long," said the coach, who is also a member of Switzerland's governing body, Prisec, a federation of sports federations and associations that represents the governing bodies of Swiss sports and sports. His comments came after the German media published a report in which he called on Swiss authorities to "use all available resources" to ensure that their athletes were playing well at the European level. According to a statement from the sports federation, "The Swiss government has decided to use every available resource available to them in order to help them achieve their goals." It was not immediately clear whether this was the case, however, or whether the decision was made on the basis of a lack of information about the team's performance. A few days ago, German sports media reported that a number of players had been arrested in connection with a bribery scandal involving a Swiss football team. At the same time, Germany's sports ministry said it had not yet decided whether or not to release the names of any of its players who had allegedly been charged with bribery or money laundering. Germany has also been accused of trying to cover up the scandal, while Switzerland is not the only country to have such a scandal. Both Germany and Switzerland have accused each other of being involved in bribery and corruption. They have also accused the other side of playing a role in such cases. While the two countries have denied any wrongdoing, both sides have said they will continue to cooperate in their efforts to find a way to resolve the issue of corruption and abuse of power. One thing is for sure: Germany will not tolerate corruption in any way. After all, there is no evidence that corruption is being committed by any country, nor is there any evidence of wrongdoing. "

In addition to enlisting foreign police during Euro 2008, Switzerland will also be bringing in private security personnel from Germany, reported a Swiss newspaper.
"We have to turn to about 500 private security personnel from Germany," Urs Stadler, spokesman for a security firm consortium told the Monday, May 26, edition of Swiss newspaper Tages Anzeiger. "Most of them were already in operation during the World Cup two years ago, and have relevant experience," added Stadler from Prisec, a consortium made up of the companies Protectas and Securitas. The spokesman said more help was needed, but could not give exact numbers "due to pending assignments." Recent soccer violence raises concern Swiss media has been questioning the security preparations for Euro 2008 after a spate of violence at recent games. In the latest incident, seats were ripped out and a goal post wrenched from the ground after St. Gallen faced the prospect of relegation following a 2-0 defeat to Bellinzona on May 20. St. Gallen was the third incident in a month that saw violent clashes with police who twice resorted to rubber bullets and tear gas. While Switzerland is seen as a low risk country in terms of hooliganism, violence has been on the increase in recent years and estimates claim there are around 400 hooligans and 600 sympathizers. Swiss Sports Minister Samuel Schmid said that hooliganism cannot be ruled out, reported German news agency DPA. But he expressed his belief that extra measures such as more policing, restrictions on alcohol -- which he has called "a catalyst for violence" -- and video surveillance will help keep trouble at bay. Private firms to boost European police The private security companies will be responsible for patrolling the stadiums and their surroundings, as well as the public viewing areas, team hotels and trainings areas. An international police force will manage the rest. Switzerland has committed some 31,200 police officers and soldiers. Another 1,700 police will be sent from Germany, which will have the authority to make arrests. France will offer the third largest contingent with 750 officers and Croatia, Poland, Sweden, Greece, Russia and Spain will also send reinforcements. "

German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere has ordered the closure of a mosque in the southern city of Wuppertal. Heiko Maas has also ordered an investigation into allegations of anti-Islamic propaganda.
The German interior minister said on Thursday that he had ordered a "total and complete shutdown" of the mosque, which is located on the city's main thoroughfare, in order to protect the safety of Muslims in Germany. "We are going to close the door on this mosque," he said in a statement, adding that the decision was made "in accordance with the German constitution." He added that "we will continue to monitor the situation in this area, and we will make sure that we do everything possible to prevent this from happening again." The decision comes after a series of public statements from the interior ministry, the Christian Democrat (CDU) and the Bavarian Christian Democrats (CSU), which have called for an end to the ban on all Muslims entering the country. The CSU's Volker Kauder, a member of parliament, told the Bild news agency that it was "unacceptable" for the government to allow such a ban to take place. In addition, he added, "it is unacceptable for a government that does not respect the rule of law and that is why we have to do this." "It is not acceptable for Germany to tolerate this kind of behavior. It is against the constitution and it should not be allowed to be tolerated," said Sven Lau, an MP for Mönchengladbach, who was among the first to speak out in opposition to Maisiere's decision. Migrants from other Muslim-majority countries are also being targeted by the authorities, according to a report in German daily Bild. A number of migrants have also been arrested in recent months, with some of them having fled to Germany in search of safety. Some of those arrested have been charged with crimes against humanity, including murder, rape, attempted murder and attempted rape. They are being held under house arrest and face up to 10 years in prison if found guilty of any of these crimes. Germany's interior ministers have said they will not tolerate such acts of violence against Muslims, but they have not ruled out the possibility that they could face charges of inciting hatred and violence. According to German weekly Welt am Sonntag, German Chancellor Angela Merkel's government has already announced plans to shut down the Islamic State (IS) in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Libya and Yemen, as well as the United States, Iran and North Korea. However, it has yet to announce a decision on whether or not these plans will be implemented. There is also a question of whether the planned closure will affect the security of mosques in other parts of Germany, such as in Bavaria, where the IS is based, or whether it will remain in place until the end of this year.

The German government has strongly criticized nightly patrols in the city of Wuppertal by men calling themselves "Sharia police." The 33-year-old behind the patrols claimed that their goal was only to raise attention.
Conservative members of Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition put forward a united front at the weekend against recent developments in the city of Wuppertal. Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said civilians wearing uniforms bearing the logo "Shariah police" could not simply start patrolling German streets. The groups reportedly hovered around sites like discotheques and gambling houses, telling passers-by to refrain from gambling and alcohol. Wuppertal's police have begun pressing charges. "Sharia law is not tolerated on German soil," de Maiziere told mass-circulation daily Bild on Saturday. "Nobody can take it upon themselves to abuse the good name of the German police." Justice Minister Heiko Maas, meanwhile, told Bild that "the state alone" was responsible for the administration of justice in Germany. It was obvious, Maas said, that any illegal parallel system of law enforcement would not be tolerated. Christian Democrat party whip Volker Kauder was similarly emphatic in an interview to be published in this week's Welt am Sonntag newspaper. "Under absolutely no circumstances can we tolerate self-styled 'Sharia police officers' patrolling our streets and dictating what people should or should not do," Kauder said. Ringleader: goal was attention The 33-year-old behind the Wuppertal patrols, former fireman Sven Lau, published a video on his website on Saturday. Lau said that a "Sharia police" never existed, and that a group of men had simply worn the mock uniforms for a few hours. "We knew that this would raise attention," Lau said, claiming that his goal was to spark a debate about Sharia law in Germany. Lau is a leading member of Germany's Salafist movement, advocates of a strict Sunni interpretation of political Islam. He works with a mosque in his native Mönchengladbach, not far west of Wuppertal, and used to head the fundamentalist group "Invitation to Paradise." (Einladung zum Paradies, in German.) The central council of Muslims in Germany (ZMD) condemned the activities. "These few teen yobs do not speak in our name," chairman Ayman A. Mazyek told the Tagesspiegel am Sonntag newspaper. "These people are perverting the name of our religion. With this shrill and foolish action, they are really hurting Muslims." Sharia law is the Arabic term for a legal system based on the Koran. Saudi Arabia and Iran are examples of countries where such a system officially applies. Wearing a veil is obligatory for women and corporal punishment such as stoning is legally tolerated. Human Rights Watch reported last month that Saudi Arabia had beheaded 19 people in just 16 days in August, for convictions on charges ranging from cannabis smuggling to "sorcery." msh/rc (AFP, dpa, Reuters) "

The city of Berlin has become a hub for train-making and construction, with more than 1,000 train stations across the country.
In Berlin, the city's commuter rail station has opened its doors for the first time since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. The station, which is located on the site of a former train depot, is one of Germany's most important rail stations. It is the only one in Germany that is open to train trains, buses and other public transport, as well as a number of private companies, including Deutsche Umwelthilfe, Deutsche Bahn, Siemens and others. There is also a railway station in the center of town, where the train tracks run parallel to each other, and a bus stop at the end of each train stop. In the past, trains used to take trains to and from the station. Now, they have to stop and re-route trains and buses to get to their destinations. "It's not just about trains anymore," Stefanie Albrecht, a train operator, told DW news agency in an interview. She added that trains were also being built in other cities, such as New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, but that there was a lack of infrastructure in those cities. So, she said, it was only a matter of time before trains would stop running and people would be able to pick up their train tickets. That's because trains are not supposed to run at night, so trains can't be used at all. And trains aren't meant to be run on weekends. They're meant for people who don't want to go to work on Sundays, when they can get home from work. This is because train schedules are set to change over the next few weeks, according to Thomas Fischer, head of train operations at Deutsche Bürgermeisterschaft (DBG) in Berlin. He said trains should not be allowed to operate at weekends because they are too expensive. But he said that the trains will be free of charge if they stop in a certain time zone or if there is a demand for trains that can only be operated at certain times of day. For train operators, this is an opportunity to make a profit, he added, adding that train services should be available at no additional cost to passengers. Train operators should also be aware of their own schedules, Fischer said. A train is scheduled to depart from Berlin on Sunday morning at 10:30 a.m. Eastern Standard Time (EDT) and return on Monday evening at 12:00 UTC (FST) for a two-hour train ride to Chicago. After that, train service will resume at 6:15 p. m. local time (ET) on Tuesday, Jan. 15. dpa/dpa (AP, Reuters, AFP, AP, DPA, wire services, FACEBOOK)The train will run for two hours at a time until it reaches its destination, before it is shut down for maintenance and repairs. According to a spokesman for DBG, there are no plans to cancel trains at this time. However, some train companies have already announced that they will stop operating trains in order to save money on maintenance costs. As a result, Berlin's train network is expected to remain open until the summer of 2019, although the timetable has not yet been set in stone. On the other hand, many train lines have been closed for several months due to safety concerns. Many train passengers have complained about the delays and cancellations that have occurred in recent months. One train conductor said he was concerned about delays in trains. Another train was delayed because of poor weather conditions. Other trains have also been delayed. At the same time, rail lines are being diverted to other parts of Europe, leaving passengers stranded on their way to Frankfurt, Frankfurt and Munich. Some train coaches are also working on a new train that will take them back to Berlin in two weeks' time to complete the journey. These train runs are designed to help train trainees and train drivers, who are trained in train safety. "
,"Reference text": " Will Berlin be the next city to ban plastic bags?
They are sturdy, thin and can handle a heavy load, but after a single use, plastic bags often end up outdoors or in oceans - with disastrous impacts. But a student in Berlin is trying to halt the plastic bag invasion.
It started off as a student job: Stefanie Albrecht contacted the environmental organization Deutsche Umwelthilfe to support its campaign in Berlin of approaching citizens on the streets to swap their plastic bags for reusable bags. The organization hoped to make people more aware of the environmentally destructive effects of plastic bags. Deutsche Umwelthilfe's anti-plastic bag campaign on Saturday (20.09.2014) also reused the bags campaigners collected off the streets. About 1,000 people strung together a 9-kilometer-long chain made of 30,000 plastic bags at the Tempelhofer Feld in the German capital Berlin, creating a world record. In Berlin alone, 30,000 plastic bags leave shops and market stalls every hour - amounting to 259 million bags a year. Across Germany, about 17 million plastic bags are consumed every day - or 6 billion a year. Albrecht, a natural resources management student, buys secondhand clothes, grows her own vegetables and tries to reduce her rubbish. But even she hadn't always been so conscious of the environmental problem that plastic bags present. "Before, I never thought about plastics and crude oil," she said. Stimulated by the conversations she had with strangers in the streets, she was motivated to sensitize others on the issue. In reading studies on polyethylene bags, she found out that 260 million liters (1.6 million barrels) of crude oil are processed into the plastic bags used over one year in Germany alone - not to mention the energy also needed in oil extraction and bag production. Eco-threat Plastic presents so many advantages: it is lightweight, strong, durable, waterproof, and cheap to produce. After the first department store in Germany started handing out plastic bags in 1961, many retailers followed. This packaging can be reused many times, and it is also recyclable. But because they are given away, plastic bags are carelessly disposed of: a plastic bag is typically used for 25 minutes on average - from the shop until you get back home. Plastic degrades very slowly in nature, over 100 to 500 years. In fact it never actually biodegrades - plastic just breaks down into ever-smaller pieces. And they can have fatal effects in the environment. Many places on land and water have become covered in a layer of plastic bags, bottles, canisters, furniture, forks and toothbrushes. In the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, a swirling island of plastic trash covers thousands of square kilometers. Plastic bags cause wild animals to die miserably. Animals think the plastic is food, and eat it. This can cause them to choke, and suffocate slowly. Or they starve to death: the material can't be digested and excreted, so it clogs the stomach and intestines. Animals can also get caught and strangle themselves in plastic; or it can cut off circulation to a limb, leading to a different type of slow and painful death. Scientists at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) recently found plastic in every second seabird off the coast of Australia. CSIRO has warned that continued plastic production could cause extinction of 95 percent of all living animals in the region by 2050. Fish, sea turtles, whales, dolphins, sea cows, crocodiles and crustaceans could all go the way of the dodo. Economic approach Stefanie Albrecht was shocked to learn all this. Together with the Deutsche Umwelthilfe, she collected signatures on the online petition platform Change.org to demand that the German government enact a law taxing thin plastic bags. Within only three weeks, the 100,000 signatures for that online petition had been gathered. Stefanie Albrecht is now planning to personally hand over the list to the German government. Other countries are ahead of Germany: retailers in Ireland have been taxing plastic bags since 2002. There, consumption of plastic bags has decreased from 328 to 16 on average per person due to the tax. In Germany, annual consumption is at 76 plastic bags per head - a lot lower than the European average of 198 bags. "Germany has more than 80 million inhabitants. By reducing our per person consumption, we can achieve greater impact than many other countries in the European Union," pointed out Thomas Fischer of Deutsche Umwelthilfe. A minimum charge of 22 cents could cause the consumer to rethink his plastic bag habit: "Do I really need this bag, or can I put the goods in my backpack?" Fischer said in describing the hypothetical question. Bans in other areas In Bangladesh, plastic bags were banned after plastic waste clogged sewers and led to flooding in 1988 and 1998. China, Kenya, Rwanda and South Africa have also banned ultra-thin plastic bags. Many cities "

A new outbreak of Ebola in the West African nation has been declared a national emergency. The WHO has warned that the outbreak could spread to other countries.
The WHO said on Tuesday that it had received a report from the country's health minister, Brima Kargbo, saying that Ebola was spreading across the entire country. "We have received reports that a number of people have died from Ebola," said Joanne Liu, WHO health commissioner in Geneva, adding that more than 1,000 people had been infected with the virus since the start of this year. Ebola is the most common cause of death in West Africa, according to a WHO report released on Wednesday. It also said that there was a "significant increase" in cases of acute and chronic diseases, such as malaria, tuberculosis and typhoid, among other things. A WHO spokesman said the WHO was "deeply concerned" by the report, which came out of a meeting with health officials in Switzerland on Monday. He added that "the WHO is very concerned about the health of our people and the situation in our country." The UN said it was working with local health authorities to identify and identify those who could be at risk of spreading the disease, as well as other health organizations, including the World Food Organization (WHO), which is working closely with WHO on the Ebola outbreak, and WHO's response to it. Read more: Ebola: How to prevent the spread of disease in Africa's most vulnerable countries The World Health Organisation said in a statement that its response was to provide "urgent medical care" to those in need. But it also stressed the need for urgent medical attention to be provided to all affected countries, particularly those suffering from acute or chronic disease. According to WHO, the epidemic has spread across Africa and is expected to last until at least the end of next year, when it will be completely eradicated. Health officials said they had not yet seen a case where Ebola had spread beyond the borders of Guinea and Liberia.  "This is not the first time that we have seen this type of outbreak," WHO spokeswoman Joanna Liu said. In the past, Ebola cases have been reported in other African nations, but the UN has not been able to find a single case in which a person has died of an Ebola-related illness, she added, citing a lack of information on how to respond to such cases. However, in recent years, it has become increasingly difficult to determine the exact causes of outbreaks and whether they are linked to an outbreak. Last year's outbreak in Guinea, for example, was caused by a virus that spread from an infected patient to another patient. Since then, there have also been reports of cases where the patient has contracted pneumonia. This has led to outbreaks of hemorrhagic fever in some parts of Africa. At the same time, many of these cases are being treated as a result of ongoing epidemics, said Liu. h/msh (AFP, dpa, Reuters, AP, AFP) pfd/jm (Reuters, DPA, DW, EFE-EFE) Editor's Picks: Editor: Robyn Lichtman, Staff Writer, Health Editor, "It's been a long time since we've had a chance to talk to you.

The medical charity MSF has warned that western Africa's Ebola crisis is "moving faster" than medics can cope with. Its warning follows a WHO admission that the epidemic requires "extraordinary measures."
The head of Medicins Sans Frontieres (MSF), Joanne Liu -- fresh from a visit to western Africa -- said in Geneva on Friday that more experts were needed in the hard-hit region. "It is deteriorating faster, and moving faster, than we can respond to," Liu told reporters. "Like in a war time, we have a total collapse of infrastructure," she added. Lui said the world community needed to get the "upper hand" over the next six months. While the viral spread had been slowed in Guinea, concerns focused especially on Liberia. "If we don't stabilize Liberia, we will never stabilize the region," Lui said. She was critical of the WHO for delaying its public health emergency warning until August 8. "We need people with a hands-on operational mindset," to combat the outbreak, Liu told the Geneva news briefing. WHO - 'vastly underestimated' On Thursday, the World Health Organization (WHO) said the scale of the epidemic had been "vastly underestimated" and that "extraordinary measures" were needed to contain the contagious virus. The UN health agency said the death toll had climbed to 1,069 in four afflicted countries, spanning Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia and more recently Nigeria. Sierra Leone's chief medical officer Brima Kargbo disclosed on Thursday that at least 32 of the nation's nurses and doctors had died from the Ebola virus while performing their duties between May 24 and August 13. Local staff suffered stigma, despite saving lives, Kargbo said. "We still have to break the chain of transmission to separate the infected from the uninfected."

Oracle has won a landmark European court ruling in favor of the European Union. The court ruled that the US-based software giant should be allowed to operate in the EU without EU approval.
The court said that Oracle must comply with the terms of an EU-wide agreement on the use of cloud computing technology. Oracle, a US company, said in a statement on Tuesday that it would not be able to do so without the consent of EU member states. "Oracle is a member state, and we have a responsibility to ensure that all EU citizens have access to this technology," Oracle said, adding that "it is not possible for Oracle to compete in this market." Oracle has said it will appeal the ruling, which is expected to be made public by the end of this year.  Oracle is one of several US companies that have filed a complaint in Luxembourg, arguing that EU law does not apply to them because they do not have the legal authority to use the technology in their own country. In addition, Oracle also argued that there was no legal basis for the court to order the company to change its business model, saying that such a move would be "unacceptable" and "disrespectful" to its customers and would violate the rules of European competition law.Oracle, the world's largest software company by market capitalization, has been accused of violating EU antitrust law by refusing to provide Oracle with a license to sell its software to a third party.

A European court has ruled that it's permissible to resell software licenses even if the package has been downloaded directly from the Internet. It sided with a German firm in its legal battle with US giant Oracle.
The European Court of Justice on Tuesday ruled that used software licenses may generally be resold by individuals or companies. The Luxembourg-based court thus sided with the German firm UsedSoft in a protracted legal battle with US software giant Oracle. The ruling made it clear that trade in used software was permissible even if the software had not been shipped on a physical medium such as a CD or DVD, but had been digitally downloaded from the Internet. UsedSoft's business model hinges completely on reselling used packages or legally obtained license keys for them. By reselling the keys to clients, the latter are then able to download the latest version of a given program directly from a company's Internet site and obtain all new updates and patches in the process. Legal clarity Oracle had sued UsedSoft over its business model, trying to prevent buyers of used software licenses from downloading programs again. But the European court ruled that the so-called principle of exhaustion applied whenever software was originally sold to a customer for an unlimited time span, not giving the maker of the software the right to prevent the resale of that software. "The door for the trade in used software has been pushed wide open throughout the European Union," UsedSoft said in a statement, welcoming "perfect legal safety on the market."

NASA has said it is "very optimistic" about Curiosity's future, saying it could become a key part of a broader exploration of Mars, as well as the Earth's atmosphere and its atmosphere. In the past, scientists have focused on Mars as a potential landing site for future exploration missions. However, in recent years, Mars has faced a series of challenges in its quest to find Mars. One of those challenges is that Mars hasn't yet been able to land on its own, which is a major challenge for NASA. It's also not clear how Mars will respond to this challenge, given that the spacecraft has not yet landed on Earth. So far, so good, but it's still a long way from being a success, according to a NASA spokesperson. Mars rover Curiosity was launched in 2014, after a successful landing mission by US astronaut Scott Kelly. But the mission has also been plagued by delays and technical problems, leading to the cancellation of several other missions, including one that was scheduled to begin in late 2015. Last year, it was announced that Curiosity would not be launching again until mid-2016. As a result, there are currently no new missions scheduled for this year or next, although NASA says it will continue to monitor the progress of Curiosity and other science missions to try to determine whether they are still capable of reaching Mars and potentially landing on it. A new mission is also being planned for next year's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) mission.

The US space agency has said its Mars rover appears to be working "flawlessly," with a lengthy period of instrument checks almost complete. The Curiosity rover will soon re-start its sluggish search for signs of life.
NASA's Mars rover, "Curiosity," will wrap up a lengthy self-testing phase on Thursday, freeing it up to continue exploring the surface of the Red Planet. Mission manager Jennifer Tropser told reporters in a conference call on Wednesday evening that the plan, once the final checks were completed, was to "drive, drive, drive" until Curiosity discovers a rock suitable for analysis. She added that the instrument checks have delivered positive results. "Through every phase of the check-out, Curiosity has performed almost flawlessly," Tropser said. "The success so far of these activities has been outstanding." Many of the tests have concerned Curiosity's robotic arm. The 2.1-meter (7-feet) appendage will be used to pick out and sample rocks and soil. NASA is investigating whether Mars can sustain life, or whether it could in the past. The tests were designed to identify any damage sustained during its interplanetary flight and also to ensure that the arm still functioned properly on Mars, with its different temperatures and gravity. The Mars rover landed in the giant Gale Crater, near the Martian equator, on August 5; it has so far moved about 109 meters within the crater. The rover is traveling east, heading first to an intersection called Glenelg, where three types of terrain meet. This is likely to be the location for the first rock and soil samples, though NASA said Curiosity was unlikely to arrive there for several weeks. Curiosity's ultimate destination is the nearby Aeolis Mons or Mount Sharp, a 3-mile-high mound of rock rising out of the crater. Mount Sharp is about 4.3 miles (7 kilometers) away from Curiosity's landing site.

World health officials have warned of a possible outbreak of Ebola in the United States.  
The WHO said on Thursday that the virus could spread to other parts of the world, including Asia, Africa and the Middle East. "The virus is spreading rapidly across the globe," the organization said in a statement, adding that it was not yet clear whether the outbreak was linked to the Ebola virus. The WHO also warned that "the virus can spread quickly and rapidly" and that there was a "very high risk" of infection among people who had been infected with the disease. Ebola is a highly contagious virus that spreads rapidly and can cause serious health problems, particularly in developing countries such as the US, China, India and South Africa. It is believed to be the first time Ebola has been transmitted to humans in more than a century. In the 1990s, Ebola was the most common cause of death among African people. Since then, it has spread rapidly to Asia and Africa, where it is now estimated that around 1.5 million people have died from Ebola, according to WHO data. At the same time, the number of deaths in Africa has risen by almost 10,000 percent since the beginning of this year, to 2.7 million. This is the highest level of mortality since World War II, which began in 1945. Epidemiology and epidemiology are closely related, but the WHO says that is not the case with Ebola. epidemiological data show that Ebola outbreaks are more likely to occur in countries with high rates of infectious diseases than those with relatively low rates. However, there is no evidence to suggest that this is an imminent threat to human health, WHO officials said. A WHO spokesman said the agency was "deeply concerned" about Ebola's spread and urged the public to "exercise caution" when it comes to their own health and safety, especially if they are in contact with infected people and their families. Read more: Ebola: How to prevent it from spreading to others in your own country, says WHO hcg/jm (AP, AFP, dpa, Reuters, AP, hwc/dpa), adding: "We are very concerned about the spread of disease in our own countries. We are also concerned that if we do not act quickly, we will not be able to protect ourselves and our children from the diseases that are spreading across our country." The UN said it would continue to monitor Ebola cases in its emergency response plan for the next two weeks. Health experts said they expect Ebola to spread throughout the developing world by the middle of next year. They also said that a new outbreak in Nigeria could lead to an increase in deaths among children and young people, as well as a rise in cases of cancer and other diseases in Europe and North America. But they cautioned against underestimating the extent of its spread, saying that such outbreaks could be prevented by a combination of factors including high temperatures, high humidity and a lack of food security. As a result, they said, "it is very difficult to predict when Ebola will spread across Africa." Health officials are currently working on a plan to reduce the amount of people infected by Ebola and treat them as if it were a disease, and they have been working to do so for a long time. So far, so good, that's what we have seen so far. There is still a lot of uncertainty about what is going to happen with this outbreak and how it will affect people's health. Some experts say it may be possible to avoid it altogether, while others say the risk of it spreading is too high for people to live in fear of being infected. That's a concern, because it's not something that can be easily resolved with a vaccine or a medical device. And it could happen in other countries, too, if people are not careful about their exposure to Ebola or other deadly diseases, like measles or mumps and rubella. These are the main reasons why the epidemic is so dangerous. Experts say that people should be careful not to underestimate the impact of these diseases on the health of others. "

In a new report on aging and health, the World Health Organization is calling for action on "population aging," as figures suggest the number of people over 60 will reach two billion by 2050.
People worldwide are living longer, says the World Health Organization in its World Report on Aging and Health. This is both good and bad. It gives us the chance to "pursue new activities" as we get older, such as in education and family life. But it all depends on our health. And for that the WHO says world governments need to act now to make sure our societies worldwide are ready. What are the take home facts from the World Health Organization's 2015 report on Aging and Health? The WHO says that in the next 35 years, the global number of people aged 60 years and over will almost double from 12 percent to 22 percent. By 2020, there will be more people over the age of 60 than 5 year olds. And a majority of older people (80 percent) will live in "low and middle income" countries. It's estimated that the world's population aged 60 years and older will total about 2 billion in 2050, which is more than twice as much as now. Furthermore, worldwide, about 125 million people are aged 80 years or older. But by 2050, it is expected that this number of people - aged 80 and over - will live in China alone. But I'm not old, so why should I care? Well, all this is happening at a faster rate than ever before. And the WHO says "all countries face major challenges to ensure that their health and social systems are ready" for this major demographic shift. It will cost a lot of money to improve health and social infrastructures, especially in more developed countries where traditional families structures have changed dramatically. Surely, there's "no typical older person," though. How does the WHO define aging? We tend to think of older people as physically and mentally frail. But that's not necessarily the case, not everywhere in the world. Old is a relative concept - especially in middle income to rich countries. For instance, some 70 year olds are as fit as some 20 year olds. Just think how many older folk are at your gym, and ask yourself whether you can keep up with all of them. But that still doesn't explain aging. What is it exactly? The WHO says that at a biological level, "aging results from the impact of the accumulation of a wide variety of molecular and cellular damage over time." Basically, this puts people at a higher risk of disease and, of course, death. But aging can also be associated with "life transitions," such as retirement or witnessing other people, such as friends and family, die around you. This can affect you psychologically and sometimes, as a result, physically. What sort of diseases come with old age? Some of the most common non-fatal conditions include hearing loss, cataracts, back and neck pain and osteoarthritis. Other conditions include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - which affects the lungs - diabetes, depression, and dementia. What needs to be done? The WHO is proposing a five-step plan of action, which includes: Committing to healthy aging and "evidence-based policies to strengthen the abilities of older persons." Aligning health systems with the needs of older populations Developing systems for providing long-term care Creating "age-friendly cities and communities Improving measurement, monitoring and understanding of "aging issues" worldwide. But don't forget: "a longer life brings with it opportunities, not only for older people and their families, but also for societies as a whole." "

A Ferrari driver will take part in Saturday's German Formula One race in Hockenheim, Germany. Ferrari's Fernando Alonso will be the first driver to take to the track.
Finnish driver Kimi Raikonen will compete for a place in Germany's F1 grand prix on Saturday. The Finn, who has been racing for McLaren for the past two seasons, will make his first appearance in the Formula 1 world championship on Sunday when he takes on McLaren's Juan Pablo Montoya. "I'm very happy to be here," he told reporters after the race, adding that he was "very excited" about the prospect of racing in his home country. He also said he would be looking forward to working with Alonso and his team-mates at the end of the season. Alonso, meanwhile, is hoping to make the most of his opportunity to race for Ferrari, which has struggled in recent years with a string of poor results. Raekonen, the world's most expensive driver, was the only man to qualify for Germany in qualifying, and he will have to wait until the final round of qualifying before he can take on Alonso's Ferrari team. Schumacher, a former world champion and Ferrari teammate, has also been in attendance, but he has not been able to attend the event due to a lack of interest from the German media. McLaren driver Alonso was also absent, although he did attend a pre-race press conference and spoke to reporters on the sidelines. His absence was a surprise, as he had been working on a new McLaren car and had not yet signed a contract with the team until last year. But Alonso is expected to return to McLaren in time for next year's season-ending season finale in Abu Dhabi, where he is scheduled to start on pole position. In his absence, Alonso has focused on his preparations for Sunday's race with McLaren, Ferrari and Williams. It is not clear how much time Alonso would have left to train with his new team, Williams, in order to prepare for his return from a two-year doping ban. On Sunday, however, it was reported that Alonso had already signed an extension to his McLaren contract until 2021. That would mean that the Spaniard would not be allowed to drive for Williams again in 2018, even if it meant taking a year off from racing. However, McLaren have already announced that they have no plans to do so and will instead focus on qualifying in Bahrain, Bahrain and Qatar. They are also looking to add to their squad for Bahrain's opening race at Bahrain later this month, when they hope to have Alonso back on track for their first race since he returned from suspension in July. Fernando's return will also be a welcome boost for Alonso as the Spanish driver is set to begin his second season at McLaren after missing the last two races with an ankle injury sustained in a collision with Williams driver Carlos Sainz last month. Both McLaren drivers have been battling for weeks to get back into the sport after being banned from driving for more than two years for failing to show up for qualifying. Fierce rivalry The two teams have a long history together, with both teams having a history of fighting each other's races in their home countries. One of them, Fernando and Alonso have both been teammates for years, while the other has never been a fan of McLaren. So it is no surprise to see the two drivers competing in an event that has become a rivalry between them. After all, they are both very close friends and have always had a lot of respect for one another. And that is something that makes them both so special to both drivers and racers. As a result, there is a great deal of tension between the teams and the fans. There is also a sense of unease over the possibility of Alonso returning to Ferrari after his suspension suspension was lifted after he suffered a broken collarbone in Malaysia in August. This is because Alonso does not want to play for Renault again this year, despite the fact that his contract was suspended for three races. What's more, he wants to stay in McLaren until he gets back to racing again. "

All eyes will be on a Finn and a Spaniard at the German Grand Prix at Hockenheim on Sunday as the title battle between Kimi Raikkonen and Fernando Alonso looks to put local hero Michael Schumacher in the shade.
It is a reflection of his current inauspicious Formula One campaign that World Champion Michael Schumacher is only featuring in reports on this weekend's German Grand Prix at Hockenheim dues to his nationality. The home grown champion equaled his own record of 11 wins in a season at last year's race but this year he will be hoping to just get on the podium at the end. Schumi lies in third place some 34 points off the top spot and has a lot to do if he is to record his 85th career win. Ferrari's poor season to date is unlikely to get better with hopes dwindling that the 36-year-old will add to his sole victory of the season although the seven-time world champion characteristically refuses to rule it out. Schumi and Ferrari still in the fight "Contrary to many other people's opinions, we have in no means written ourselves off, even though we have to admit that the situation has worsened recently, rather than improved," said the German, referring to the problems with this season's car. "But that doesn't mean that it can't be improved again, and that's exactly what we're working on." The limelight is falling on two young pretenders to Schumacher's throne as Sunday's race approaches. The battle between McLaren's flying Finn Kimi Raikkonen and championship leader Renault's speedy Spaniard Fernando Alonso is diverting eyes from the world record holding German on his own turf. Kimi aims to keep heat on leader Alonso Raikkonen must finish the German Grand Prix for the first time in five attempts to close the gap on Alonso if he is to keep his own championship hopes alive. The Finn retired from last year's race because of a rear wing failure and this season has been plagued by technical problems which most recently cost him 10 places on the starting grid in each of the last two rounds. Despite those penalties for engine failure, the 25-year-old managed to finish second and third but he will have to increase his total of three race wins if he is to make a significant impression on the 26-point chasm that separates him from Alonso. "The battle for the championship is still on and I am determined to get a good result and work on closing the gap," said the Finn. "The (car) has good speed and we need to make the most of it this weekend." Montoya doing McLaren team mate no favors Raikkonen's car is obviously a fast one this season but he's not the only driver in a McLaren hot seat. Colombia's Juan Pablo Montoya is not to going to make way for his team mate while his own hopes of the title, however small, remain alive. "I am really looking forward to racing again this weekend in Germany," said Montoya, who won at Hockenheim for Williams two years ago and got his first victory for McLaren in Britain two weeks ago. "I enjoy racing at Hockenheim, I have performed well here and won in the past and I am aiming for a strong result like at Silverstone." Consistent Ferdy the man to beat at Hockenheim Championship leader Alonso, meanwhile, has been impressively consistent for Renault so far this season, winning five times and failing to score points only at the Canadian Grand Prix, where he crashed, and in Indianapolis. The Spaniard is setting the pace and the standard this season so, problems aside, Alonso will again be the man to beat at Hockenheim. "

The Swedish Academy of Sciences has awarded the Nobel Prize to the American Nobel Laureate Elinor Ostrom for her work in economic sciences.
Oliver Williamson, a professor of economics at Indiana University in the United States, was presented with the prize for his work on the Economic Institutions of Capitalism. The prize, which was awarded in Stockholm on Thursday, is the first of its kind in Sweden. It was first awarded to a Swedish Nobel laureate in 1996. Oliver Williamson received the award in recognition of his research in economics. "I'm very proud of the work that I've done," he said, adding that it was "a great honor to receive this award." "It's an honor for me to be able to share this work with you," Williamson said. He added that he was honored by the Swedish government for "making it possible for us to work together in a way that makes the world a better place." Williamson's work is one of Sweden's most well-known economic studies, and it has been a source of inspiration for many Nobel laureates, including the late Swedish economist and Nobel Peace Prize winner, Oliver W. Williamson. In his Nobel citation, Williamson wrote: "This is a very important work because it is an important contribution to our understanding of how economics works and how it can be applied to society." The Nobel prize is awarded annually to an individual or group of people who have made a significant impact on society through their work. This year's prize will be given to one or more individuals or groups of individuals who made significant contributions in their field of study, such as the German economist Herta Mueller, the Romanian economist Carol Greider, Ada Yonath and the University of California, Berkeley, who were awarded prizes for their research on economic institutions of capitalism. Author: Michael G. Kuebler (AFP, dpa, Reuters) Editor: David M. Gaffney (Reuters, AFP, DPA)   The award is presented to "an individual who has made an impact in his or her field and whose work has influenced the way we think about the future of economic science and society in general." It's the second prize awarded by Sweden, after the Stockholm Prize for Economics in 1999, in which the country's largest private bank, Sverige, awarded a total of $1.5 billion (2.6 billion euros) in prize money in 2008. Since then, it's been awarded every year to two individuals, one for each of them, to make up the difference between their time and their place in society. One of those individuals is Swedish journalist and author Elina Ostr. She has written a number of books on economics and has published a series of short stories about her experiences as a journalist in Germany, Austria, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Romania and Greece. Her book, "The Economics of Economic Innovation," was published in 2009. Other authors have also won prizes in other fields, notably in English and German. Editor-in-chief of "New York Times" magazine, Michael Kübler, has also been named a "Nobel laureate" in recent years. Last year, he won a Nobel for economics in memory of Swedish poet and novelist Alfred "Eugene" Nobel. His work was widely praised by critics, with many calling it the "most important book in Swedish history." In addition to his prize-winning work, his book "Alfred Nobel: A History of Economics" was also named in honor of Nobel Literature laureate Hermann Göring, an American who died last year at the age of 88. Nobel-prize winning author and editor in chief of The Economic Institute of Literature, Hermanns Mueller was named the winner of a special prize in 2007. Both men received their prizes at a ceremony in Berlin, where they were honored with an honorary doctorate and a lifetime achievement award. They also received honorary degrees from the universities of Berlin and Paris, respectively, as well as from Harvard and Yale. Their work "helped to create a new generation of economists who are more interested in business than in politics," said Lawrence Krauthammer, Nobel's biographer and professor emeritus. "
,"Reference text": " US duo shares Nobel Prize for Economics
US researcher Elinor Ostrom is the first woman to win the Nobel prize for economics since it was created in 1968. She will share the prestigious award with US compatriot Oliver Williamson.
The jury from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said the Americans' research had shown how "economic analysis can shed light on most forms of social organization." Ostrom, a professor at Indiana University, was honored for her "analysis of economic governance," especially in relation to the management of common property or property under common control. The political scientist's work challenges the widely accepted belief that common property is poorly managed and should be either regulated by central authorities or privatized, it added. She carried out numerous studies showing how self-organization and local-level management work to keep common resources viable. Her studies included both natural resources, such as forests, and artificial structures, for example police forces. Ostrom told Swedish television that she felt "great surprise and appreciation" and was "in shock" about being the first woman to win the prize. The pros and cons of big firms In his work, co-prizewinner Oliver Williamson, of University of California, Berkeley, examines why large corporations tend to arise - and why they do not - based on the cost and complexity of transactions, according to the Nobel committee. "He has taught us to regard markets, firms, associations, agencies, and even households from the perspective of their contribution to the resolution of conflict," the jury said. Williamson authored 'The Economic Institutions of Capitalism' in 1975, a landmark text of the 'new institutional economics' movement that questioned the idea of firms as simple profit-making machines. Last but not least The Nobel prize for economics is the only Nobel award that was not created by the will of Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel in 1896. It was actually founded by the Swedish central bank, the Sverige Riksbank, to celebrate its tri-centenary a year earlier. It was awarded for the first time in 1969 under its official name: the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel. But although it was the last "Nobel prize" to be created and the last to be announced each year, the prize is not a poor relation in monetary terms. Winners of the awards for peace, literature, medicine, physiology, chemistry and physics all receive 10 million Swedish crowns (969,000 euros). A good year for women This year was a record year for women laureates. German-Romanian writer Herta Mueller won the Nobel Prize for Literature. Australian-American Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider of the United States were awarded the prize for medicine. And Ada Yonath of Israel was one of three scientists recognized for her work in chemistry. Americans more or less swept the board this year. Nine of the 11 laureates were US citizens. The most prominent of those was US President Barack Obama, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for his "extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples." jg/AFP/dpa/Reuters Editor: Sam Edmonds "

A German plane has crashed in the German city of Brandenburg, killing at least two people and injuring more than 100 others. The plane crashed into a rocky island off the coast of the southern German state of Malacca.
The plane was carrying a German passenger and three crew members when it crashed. It was the first plane to crash in Germany in over a year, according to a statement released by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Friday. A German pilot and crew member were killed in a crash on the island, which has been dubbed the "Tropical Islands of Germany." The pilot, Colin Au, was one of three people killed when the plane collided with a rock. He was taken to the hospital, where he was treated for head injuries and released on Saturday. His body was later found to be in stable condition, but his injuries were not life-threatening, the FAA said. Investigators are still trying to determine what caused the crash and whether it was a deliberate act of terrorism. "We don't know for sure," said FNA spokesman Steffen Kammrath, adding that the investigation is still ongoing. However, it is expected to take several days to complete. In the meantime, German authorities are continuing to investigate the cause of Sunday's crash. According to German news agency dpa, there were no immediate reports of any injuries or fatalities. There was no indication of a terrorist attack on Sunday, however, and German media reported that a number of people had been killed or seriously injured during the incident. German Chancellor Angela Merkel's office said Sunday that there was "no indication" that any terrorist attacks had taken place at the airport. Germany's federal aviation authority said it would continue to monitor the situation closely, with the exception of one incident in which a passenger was killed and two others injured when a bomb went off near the jetty. Federal aviation authorities have said they have no reason to believe that an attack was carried out by a suicide bomber. Berlin's transport ministry also said on Monday that it had received a report of "serious injuries" from a man who was shot and killed by an unknown assailant. Officials said the man was believed to have been a member of an international terrorist organization, known as the Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS) in Iraq and Syria. An investigation has also been launched into possible links between the two terrorist organizations, as well as a possible link between terrorism and the bombing of Malaysian Airlines Flight MH370 over the weekend in Kuala Lumpur. Malaysian officials have denied any links to IS, saying that IS was not responsible for the attack. kms/dpa (AP, AFP, Reuters) Editor: Michael Kramm (AFP, DPA, EFE, AP) Staff Writer: Thomas Hilderbrand (Reuters, e-mail): "This is a very serious incident and we are very concerned about the safety of our passengers and staff," he said in an interview with Reuters.

,"Reference text": " The Sun Sets Slowly Over Brandenburg's Tropical Dream
Having suffered many disappointments concerning publically funded projects, the state of Brandenburg hoped a tropical leisure center would offer a ray of hope. Instead the ailing concern is just bringing more gloom.
The economically depressed eastern German state of Brandenburg has seen its fair share of bitter experiences when it comes to huge public investment projects since German unification in 1990. Against this background, state authorities were pleased when Malaysian businessman Colin Au built a huge tropical-feeling leisure center in Brandenburg without any subsidies. The center, which opened about a year ago, was to become a symbol of economic success in a region where unemployment still hovers around the 20 percent mark. But the leisure time park, which has already swallowed a little under 100 million euros ($120 million) in private investment, is now going to have to depend on public funding to avoid another economic fiasco in Brandenburg. State authorities in Brandenburg haven't been too successful in their public investment policy in the past 10 years, to put it mildly. A grand plan to build one of the world's most modern chip-producing factories there burst like a bubble in 2003. The much-talked about Brandenburg-Berlin International airport still seems light years away from being built. Line of failures looked to be ended by Au's vision Another beacon of economic hope disappeared in 2002 when a company planning to build gas-filled transport airships went bust despite considerable subsidies. But Au's vision for the abandoned dome which the airship company needed as a hangar offered Brandenburg another chance. In the middle of nowhere, he created what he named his "Tropical Islands" wonderland, sporting everything from sandy beaches, lakes and a Laguna to a Caribbean-style village. The economics ministry in Brandenburg was over the moon to see Au originally agreeing to build the facility without any state subsidies. And Au himself had no doubt at the time that he could well do without them. Overestimated visitor numbers tell sorry story But the center's first year in operation tells a different story. Colin Au, who has meanwhile left Brandenburg and transferred matters to a German management company, had expected some 1.5 million visitors to come to Tropical Islands within the first year, but only some 950,000 will have turned up by the end of 2005. It seems highly unlikely that visitor numbers will increase considerably in future, placing a question mark on the viability of the whole centre. But Brandenburg's economics ministry is certain that the park will be in the black as of 2008. To make the place more attractive, it has agreed to shell out 15 million euros in subsidies for yet another reconstruction and marketing effort. After all, the leisure time center has a workforce of about 500 and is thus the biggest employer in an otherwise depressed region marked by a high jobless rate. Tropical center down but not out...not yet "We hope the money will help make the Tropical Islands resort better known throughout Europe according to the new marketing concept hammered out the management," ministry spokesman Steffen Kammrath said. "This leisure time center is unique and has to be marketed as such. What you have there is a tropical and water world 12 months a year with a lot of attractive offers to spend a whale of a time there." Some commentators believe that state subsidies may prolong the center's life span, but will not be able to avoid its demise in the long run. But the idea of also making it more attractive for tourists from all over Europe seems unrealistic to them if the resort's management can't even get enough visitors from home to ensure a profitable operation.

},{"Generated text": " Munich to face Hoffenheim in Bundesliga final
A 3-3 draw at Hoffenhofen on Saturday has been confirmed as the Bundesliga's final match of the season. The visitors will travel to Leverkusen to take on the German side on Sunday.
After a 1-0 first half deficit, the hosts will be looking to extend their winning streak to four games. They have a three-game winless streak in all competitions, which has seen them top the league table for the first time since the end of last season, with a win over Bielefeld and a draw against Bayern Munich in the Champions League final last week. That's a step up from last year's second-place finish, when they lost 2-1 at home to Borussia Dortmund. But it's not enough to make up for that loss, and it will not be easy to overcome the disappointment of losing to Bayern. "We have to be better than that," said Uli Hoeness, who was named Bayern's new coach after the club's first-ever Bundesliga title in 2002-03. 'We are not going to let this happen again' "It is not the way we want to play," added the Bayern coach. He's been under pressure for a long time, but he's finally getting his act together and has managed to get his side back on track after a difficult first season in charge. Hoffengentle coach Ralf Rangnick has also been in fine form in his first two seasons at the helm of a club that has struggled to keep up with the pace of life in Germany's top division. In his second season as head coach, he has overseen a number of changes to the team's squad, including the introduction of young players and the addition of new faces. Ranging on from the bench is the idea of bringing in a young coach who has a lot of experience in front of him, as well as a reputation for being able to adapt quickly and effectively to a new system. It's an idea that is gaining traction in recent years. Last year, it took Bayern a total of seven games to reach the top flight. Now, they have three games in hand and they're hoping to find a way to do it again this year. h/t: dpa/dpa (AP, AFP, Reuters, AP, DPA, RFE/jd) Editor's Picks The Bundesliga is back in action again, this time with two matches to go. First up is a trip to Cologne, where they'll be playing the second leg of their first round tie against the Red Bull Salzburg. Second up, Cologne will play the third leg in their home city of Cologne next Saturday. After that, there's the chance of an early return to Bundesliga action. If they can get past the relegation zone, that would be a big step forward for their chances of making it back to Europe. However, if they don't, then it could be an even bigger step down in terms of goalscoring chances. As it stands, Bayern have already lost two games this season and have lost three of them. On the other hand, Hoffenerheim are unbeaten in three league matches, while they've won one of those three. Their only loss came against Cologne last weekend, in which they scored a goal. This time around, their goal came in an away game against Hoffa. A win would have been a huge boost to their hopes of getting back into the title race, although it would not have happened if the Germans had not been so determined to win the game. Instead, Munich will face a tough task of trying to avoid a repeat of that defeat in 2014. For now, though, things are looking up. There's still plenty of time to prepare for this weekend's Bundesliga finale in Cologne. One thing is for certain: the fans will have plenty to cheer about, even if it doesn't go their way. We'll see how it goes from here on out. You can't have too many fans rooting for your team. And that's why we've got so many good fans. "
,"Reference text": " Bayern's Klinsmann Praises, Hoeness Attacks Hoffenheim
The Bundesliga's two top teams don't play until Friday, but the mind games are already underway. Bayern's coach Juergen Klinsmann says Hoffenheim are legitimate contenders, but commercial manager Uli Hoeness disagrees.
When the Bundesliga scheduled Bayern's home match against Hoffenheim in the league's unloved Friday night slot, they probably didn't imagine that it would turn out to be the match of the first half of the season. Indeed, few experts or fans thought that Hoffenheim, a first-division debutante located in a southern German village with 3,000 inhabitants, would give mighty Munich a run for its money. But it's the first week of December, and Hoffenheim top the table by three points. They also have a much better goal difference than their second-placed rivals -- and that has drawn praise from Bayern's coach, Juergen Klinsmann. "I have the highest estimation of Hoffenheim because they've built the squad very ambitiously, rationally and with very good players," Klinsmann told DPA news agency. "They can be proud of that." Klinsmann said he thought that the club could establish itself among the top three or four sides in Germany in the years to come and qualify for international competition next season. He also had words of praise for Hoffenheim's software billionaire patron, Dietmar Hopp, whose money has funded the club's ascent. "There's nothing negative about it," Klinsmann said. "He used to play for the club, is a soccer man through and through and helped the team get on its feet." Some fans have criticized Hopp and Hoffenheim for paying inflating salaries and luring talent away from other clubs instead of developing homegrown players. In fact, Hoffenheim's official salary budget is about average for the Bundesliga. Hoeness sounds his horn But while Bayern's coach was praising his opponents to the skies, Munich's commercial manager Uli Hoeness has been trying to play with their heads. On the heels of Bayern's convincing win over Leverkusen last weekend, Hoeness is back to taunting rivals. "The performance we showed in the second half against Leverkusen will be enough against Hoffenheim," Hoeness told the German soccer magazine kicker. Hoeness also dropped a none-too-thinly-veiled hint that Hoffenheim's personnel expenditures were far higher than the officially released figures and scoffed at the idea that strategy would determine the outcome of Friday's match. "Games are decided by the better players, not by tactics," Hoeness said. "And of course, we've got better players than Hoffenheim." But that particular verbal attack may represent some wishful thinking of the manager's part. Hoffenheim coach Ralf Rangnick is one of only two current Bundesliga skippers with a winning record against Munich. Rangnick, whose team cruised past Bielefeld last weekend to keep Bayern three points back, reacted to Hoeness' remarks with a shrug. "We're preparing for Munich exactly the same way we did against Bielefeld," Rangnick said. In any case, soccer fans in Germany know what they'll be doing Friday evening -- finding a bar with cable sports television to watch a top match that no one, before the start of the season, would have considered possible.

The Zimbabwean president has resigned as head of the country's opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC-Z) amid allegations of corruption.
Zimbabwe's presidential election has been marred by allegations that he was involved in a corruption scandal. Senior opposition leader Nelson Chamisa has accused the president of trying to rig the vote. The allegations have sparked a political crisis in Zimbabwe, which has seen scores of people killed and hundreds of thousands displaced since the end of Robert Mugabe's rule in the 1980s. On Sunday, the opposition party announced that it had won the election, a move that was widely seen as a victory for the ruling ZANU-PF party. But the party has said it will not accept the results. "We are not going to allow this to happen again," party leader Tonderai Bosha told reporters after a meeting with supporters at the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission in Harare on Sunday. He said he would appeal to the people of Zimbabwe to vote for his party's candidate in next month's general election. Zimbabwe has a long list of candidates for president, but it has yet to decide who will run for re-election. Many Zimbabweans have been calling for a second round of polls, with the first round to be held on Monday. Some opposition supporters have called for an early election on Tuesday, saying they want to see a fair and transparent election that is free and fair. They have also called on the government to step down from the post of president and allow elections to take place in 2018. Zimbabwean President Emmerson Zvangwa resigned from his post as president on Saturday, citing corruption allegations against him. In a statement, Zanzibar's ruling party said the allegations were "baseless" and "unfounded." The party, led by former Vice President Tamerlane, has denied any involvement in any wrongdoing. It has also said that the electoral commission is not responsible for any irregularities, and that there is no evidence that any of its members are guilty of any crime. However, some opposition leaders have said they will appeal against the outcome of Sunday's vote, calling it a "disgrace for democracy." "I think it is a disgrace that we have to go through this again and again. I think we are going through a very difficult time," said one opposition politician. Another opposition candidate, former finance minister Tandarwa Sibanda, told a news conference Sunday that "we have a lot to learn from this election and we will continue to do our best to make sure that elections are held in accordance with our constitution and the laws of our country." He added that Zimbabwe would not be allowed to hold elections until after the 2018 general elections, in which elections would be decided by a majority of parliamentarians and a minority of voters. His comments came as the military launched a fresh campaign to oust the incumbent, who was ousted by the army last year. Mugabwa's supporters accuse him of attempting to influence the elections with a series of lies and intimidation tactics. A number of opposition parties, including the National Democratic Congress (NDC), have criticized the move, accusing it of politicizing the process. One of them has called it "a witch hunt," while the other is "an attack on democracy," according to a spokesman for opposition National Congress party (ANC). "It is an attack against democracy and democracy that must be stopped," the spokesman said, adding that his group was not aware of what was going on. According to opposition figures, there were at least 10,000 people who had voted for ZZN in Saturday's election but only a handful of those who voted against it. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for what happened, however, as some observers believe it was a result of a lack of coordination between the two main parties. Several opposition groups have accused ZNU and its supporters of using fake accounts to try to manipulate the polls. This has led to accusations that they have manipulated the system to favor one candidate over another. Opposition parties are also accusing the former army chief of being a fraudster and of playing a role in rigging elections. "

Zimbabwe's electoral commission has declared Emmerson Mnangagwa president with 50.8 percent of the vote. Calling the results "fake," opposition candidate Nelson Chamisa has vowed to launch a legal challenge.
The electoral commission announced the presidential election results province by province, declaring ZANU-PF candidate Emmerson Mnangagwa president by the closest of margins. The announcement came after clashes between opposition protesters and soldiers in Harare left at least six people dead on Thursday. The unrest marred what had been billed as an important milestone in Zimbabwe's efforts to return to democracy following 37 years of repression under longtime leader Robert Mugabe. In a press conference on Friday, Mnangagwa said there would be an independent investigation into the post-election violence. He also called on the opposition to help him bring about peace and unity, declaring that he would serve all Zimbabweans, including those who didn't vote for him. "Here was a celebration of Zimbabwean democracy, a festival of unfettered freedom. With the eyes of the world on us we delivered a free, fair and credible election," he said. Opposition challenges results Mnangagwa, 75, won 50.8 percent of the vote, ahead of Nelson Chamisa of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) party with 44.3 percent, the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) said. Chamisa, 40, has dismissed what he called "unverified fake results," and said the MDC planned to challenge the outcome of the "rigged" election. But the ZANU-PF youth spokesman, Tonderai Bosha, told DW on Friday that the opposition would not accept an election loss. "The opposition is saying we rigged the election. That has been the narrative during the campaigns, before the elections," Tonderai said in Harare. "What they only wanted was victory on their side. If it's victory on ZANU-PF side, it's not victory." After the first four of 10 provincial results, Chamisa's MDC had a lead of about 50,000 votes over the ruling ZANU-PF. But after the fifth province was announced, the lead had switched to Mnangagwa. He quickly took to Twitter to hail what he called "a new beginning." To become president, a candidate has to take more than 50 percent of the vote. Chamisa did well in urban areas, but Mnangagwa outperformed him among rural voters. Chamisa said police raided opposition headquarters in Harare and seized computers. The search warrant indicated they were looking for unlicensed firearms, grenades and stones. Police said 16 people in the offices were arrested. Riot police later briefly disrupted a press conference where Chamisa was scheduled to speak. The opposition indicated it would challenge the result in the courts. "What they have been trying to do of late is to play around," Chamisa told reporters hours before the final results. "That is rigging, that is manipulation, trying to bastardize the result, and that we will not allow." Other results announced by the electoral commission: The ruling ZANU-PF party won 144 of the 210 seats in parliament — a two-thirds majority which enables it to change the constitution. The opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) took at least 61 seats. Observers highlight flaws Elmar Brok, chief observer for the EU's election monitor mission in Zimbabwe, told DW that the vote was marred by a "lot of shortcomings in favor of the ruling party," including through "financing, state media, intimidation, especially in the countryside." Late Friday, the US said it was reviewing the election results. "The United States will continue to review the data collected by its own observation teams, by international observation missions and by local observers to make a complete assessment of the overall election," the State Department said in a statement. It urged all sides to act peacefully and called on the political parties "to show magnanimity in victory and graciousness in defeat."

},{"Generated text": " German - gpe0 - Germany | 中文版The German language is the most important language in the world. It's the language of the German people, and it's their language that is important to them. The word "German" means "language" in German. In German, the word is a verb, which means to speak in a foreign tongue. German is also a noun, meaning to be spoken in an English language. For example, German can be translated as "English" or "French." The German word for "foreign" is "European," meaning "indigenous." In other words, it means the same thing as in English, but with a different meaning. This is not to say that Germans don't understand the meaning of "Western" and "Eastern," but rather that they understand it as a way to express themselves in other languages and cultures. They understand that Western languages are very different from those of Eastern European languages. And that's why they have different meanings for different languages, such as Arabic, Greek, Latin, Chinese, Russian, French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Japanese, Korean, etc. These are the languages that are used in Germany, as well as by other countries in Europe and the Middle East. There's a lot to learn from the Germans, of course, since they are not native speakers. But there's also the fact that German has a very strong sense of language and that it is very easy to understand what is being said about Western culture and how it relates to German culture. That's something that I'm very proud of. I've always been fascinated by the idea of western culture, especially the way it treats people and their families. So I was very excited when I heard about this, because it was the first time I had ever heard of it. Now I can't wait to see what it will be like to live in this country for the rest of my life. What I want to do with my time is to write a book about it and to share it with people who are interested in learning more about the history of Western civilization. To do that, I have to make sure that the books I read are translated into German so that people can read them and understand how they relate to each other. As a result, they can learn a great deal from me. "I'm not going to lie to you and tell you how much I love you," I said, "but I think you'll find it hard to believe that you're actually reading this book." And so I'll try my best to keep up with the latest developments in western Europe. Read more: How to get started on the Western world, how to find the right language for your language, what to look for in your country, where you live and work and where to go to study abroad and all the things you need to know about Eastern Europe in order to become a better linguist and an expert on Western philosophy. You can find out what I mean by that in my book "The Western World," which was published in 2003. Here's how I got started: I started out by reading the book. Then I went to Germany and got to work on it, then I came to the United States and started studying Western literature. After a while I realized that there was a huge difference between Western and Eastern languages in terms of vocabulary, grammar, vocabulary and grammar. When I arrived in America, my first language was German and I learned that western languages were very similar to Western ones. However, in Western Europe, there were many differences between the two languages: English and German were more common than Western. Western German was more like Western European, with more of a Western vocabulary. Eastern German became more popular with Western Europeans, so Western English became less common in general, while Eastern Europeans became increasingly popular in particular because Western countries were becoming more and more westernized. European countries have become more liberal in their foreign policy and are more open to western European ideas and ideas. Even the US is becoming increasingly liberal with its foreign policies, including the European Union. "

UN Secretary-General Lakhdar Brahimi has called for a ceasefire in Syria after the country's civil war broke out.
Brahimi is due to meet Syrian President Bashar al-Assad at the Palais des Nations in Geneva on Tuesday. He is expected to hold talks with the Syrian government and opposition leaders at a meeting in Switzerland later in the day. The Syrian opposition has accused the United Nations (UN) of failing to reach a deal on the conflict. "There is no agreement on a cessation of hostilities," the UN secretary-general said in a statement, adding that he was "deeply concerned" by the lack of progress in resolving the crisis. However, he did not rule out the possibility of a cease-fire, which has been in place since the start of the war in eastern Syria in March 2011. UN envoy for Syria Faisal Mekdad told reporters that a truce would not be reached until at least the end of this month. But he also said that there was a "very real possibility" that the ceasefire could be extended to include the whole of Syria, including the capital, Damascus, as well as parts of Iraq, Lebanon, Jordan and Syria. A UN spokesman said there were "serious concerns" about the truce, but that it was unlikely to lead to an end to the fighting. It is not clear how many people have been killed or injured in clashes between government forces and rebels, according to Reuters news agency. There are also concerns about a possible escalation of fighting between pro- and anti-government forces. Last week, a UN peacekeeping mission was set up in Damascus to try to prevent the spread of Islamic State (IS) and other militant groups from reaching the besieged city of Aleppo. At the same time, there are concerns over the role of Russia, Iran and North Korea in fighting IS, and whether Russia will intervene militarily. Moscow has denied any involvement in any of these conflicts, while Washington has said it will continue to monitor the situation closely. In Geneva, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon met with representatives from Russia and Iran to discuss the latest developments. Lavrov said Moscow was ready to cooperate with Damascus in its fight against IS. dpa/dpa (AP, AFP, Reuters, AP, DPA) Editor-in-Chief: "We are very concerned about Russia's role in this conflict," he said, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin's visit to Syria earlier this week. Russia has also been accused of supporting IS in an attempt to destabilize Assad's regime. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, however, denied the accusations, saying Russia was not behind the violence. Peslev said Russia had "no role" in setting up the talks and that Moscow had no role to play in them. 'Russia has no interest in interfering in these negotiations,' he added, pointing out that "Russia is the only country that has the ability to influence the outcome of any negotiations." The UN chief also called on Russia to step up its support for the rebels and urged Moscow to do more to help them win back control of its own territory. Damascus has refused to sign a peace deal with Russia. Meanwhile, Moscow's foreign minister said on Wednesday that Russia would continue its efforts to exert pressure on Moscow. Putin has repeatedly said he would veto any deal that would allow the Kremlin to interfere with Syria's internal affairs. According to a Reuters report, the Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told Moscow on Thursday that his country was prepared to accept the terms of an arms embargo imposed by Moscow in return for Moscow agreeing to halt its nuclear weapons program. Russian officials have also accused Moscow of trying to use the sanctions as leverage to pressure Moscow into giving Moscow more time to negotiate a nuclear deal. Both Moscow and Moscow have rejected the idea of imposing sanctions on Iran, accusing Tehran of doing so in order to weaken Tehran's nuclear programme. Tehran has rejected such a move as "unacceptable" and says Moscow is "not interested in negotiating with Tehran." Moscow denies the allegations, though Moscow says it is willing to take part in negotiations with Iran. "
,"Reference text": " Inching towards direct talks on Syria
They came to hold talks, but started negotiations with mutual affronts. But if there is one person who might be able to mediate between the intransigent Syrian conflict parties, it's Lakhdar Brahimi.
Lakhdar Brahimi, the United Nations special envoy for Syria, seemed very tired on Friday (24.01.2014). He had had a long day, which was actually supposed to be the first real day of negotiations at the Syria Conference in Geneva. "Good afternoon," Brahimi told the assembled international press, before adding, "or good evening, I don't know." At the Palais des Nations in Geneva, he presented the most important result of his attempts to mediate between the Syrian government and the opposition to the more than 250 journalists who had managed to get a coveted place at the press conference: "Tomorrow we expect and we have agreed that we will meet in the same room." What Brahimi is declaring an achievement doesn't sound like much, but considering how irreconcilable the conflict parties have been, even that can be seen as a small success. Separate talks with Brahimi The two delegations were actually due to meet on the first day of negotiations in Geneva in order to agree on a timetable and on the subject and agenda of the talks. But emotions are running too high on both sides. Instead both delegations held separate talks with Lahkkdar Brahimi, both lasting just about an hour each In the morning. The Syrian government delegation had apparently been threatening to leave the conference. At least that is what the deputy foreign minister Faisal Mekdad had implied. "We are here to start the negotiations," he told waiting journalists, "but we found that the other party did not want to come." Before the conference, the opposition had explained that for its delegation, the formation of a transition government would be a central tenet of the negotiations. They emphasized that this topic should be discussed right at the beginning of talks and that the establishment of such a body should be initiated without delay. Social media and good old propaganda The representatives of the Syrian National Coalition that were present in Geneva neatly used all imaginable channels to make their views public. At #Geneva2, they tweeted: "Forming a transitional body is our major priority," leaving people in no doubt that the Syrian National Council would not want to include Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Assad's government, on the other hand, is relying on classic propaganda and loyal state media representatives in Geneva. An impressive entourage of dominant journalists from state-run media outlets is constantly at hand, accompanying the government delegation and making sure they get their point across at press conferences. Lakhdar Brahimi even had a small altercation with a journalist from a Syrian state news agency, who made a political statement under the pretense of asking the UN mediator a question. "Are there any signs that Saudi Arabia, Turkey and other countries would stop the support of terrorism in Syria?," she asked in somewhat shaky English, before Brahimi interrupted her. "Please, please, there is no point in asking such questions!" Such exchanges hint at the type of negotiating style the experienced diplomat and mediator Brahimi must have behind the scenes. 'Wish us luck' Lakhdar Brahimi described the preliminary talks that took place in Geneva as encouraging and asked for patience. He said that because the peace conference had come about at the last minute and the delegations had therefore only been appointed very recently, there hadn't been enough time to hold preliminary discussions - a task that the delegations were now catching up on. "We never expected it to be easy and I'm sure it's not going to be," he said. "But I think the two parties understand what is at stake. Their country is in very, very bad shape." He added: "The huge ambition of this process is to save Syria. Nothing less than that." After appealing to the willingness of both parties to negotiate, he simply added: "So wish us luck!" Fight for freedom As the official delegations held talks with UN mediator Brahimi in the Palais des Nations, the European headquarters of the United Nations, hundreds of Syrian expatriates who had come from all over Europe protested outside, forming a sea of red, white and black Syrian flags on the Place des Nations. With their presence outside the UN gates they wanted to show that despite all the government propaganda, the Syrian National coalition has a lot of support from the Syrian people. Thirty-two-year-old Ziad Malki came to Geneva from Zurich to show his solidarity. Ziad knows how it feels to be deprived of his freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. In 2005, he was arrested at a demonstration in Damascus and says he was tortured during his time in prison. Now he is fighting for a new Syria from outside the country's borders. Ziad is sure that with Bashar al-Assad and his family, there will be nothing new. "We don't want this man to "

The Italian government has asked the European Union to help it cope with the influx of asylum seekers from Libya. The EU's interior minister said on Thursday that Italy would seek asylum at the end of this month.
Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentilloni has been asked by the EU to assist the Libyan government in its efforts to reach an agreement on asylum for migrants in Europe. "We are very concerned about the situation in Italy and we are going to do everything we can to make sure that there is a solution to this problem," he said in a statement. Italy's Interior Minister Dimitris Avramopoulos said the country was "very concerned" about Libya's situation, adding that "it is very important that we have a plan in place to deal with this issue." The Italian prime minister also called on the international community to cooperate in the fight against illegal migration, which has led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people across Europe since the beginning of the year. In a letter to EU leaders, the Italian Foreign Ministry said it would "take all necessary steps" to ensure that the migrants who have fled Libya are brought to justice and that they will be allowed to return to their home countries. EU Asylum Support Office The European Commission said Thursday it was working with Italy to find a way to resolve the issue of migrants being sent to Europe illegally. It said Italy had made "significant progress" in resolving the problem, but added that it had not yet made a final decision on how to proceed. Italian officials said they were still waiting for a decision from the Commission on Friday on whether to grant asylum to Libyan nationals who had fled their country in recent months. A spokesman for the commission said Italian authorities had received a request for asylum from Libyan authorities, who were seeking to detain them for up to six months in an attempt to prevent them from returning to Italy. However, EU officials have said that this was not the case, saying the request was made in response to a "serious security threat." Italy is one of a handful of EU states that have refused to allow migrants to leave their homes in order to avoid deportation. Last year, Italy rejected an application from France, Germany, Austria and the United Kingdom to let them stay in their respective countries for at least three years. France rejected the application, while the UK rejected a similar request from Germany and Austria. Both countries have also rejected applications from other EU member states, including the US, Britain, France and Germany. Europe's asylum system has also been criticized for failing to provide adequate protection to migrants fleeing conflict-ravaged countries such as Syria, Iraq and Yemen. According to Italian President Filippo Grandi, this is the first time Italy has faced a crisis of its own when it comes to accepting asylum requests from countries like Libya, Syria and Iraq. He said he had no reason to believe that such a move would lead to an increase in deportations. But he also said there would be "a lot of pressure" on Italy if it didn't take action against Libya and other countries that are trying to deport people who are fleeing war-torn countries, particularly Syria. His comments came after a meeting with EU foreign ministers in Brussels on Wednesday in which the bloc's foreign policy chief, Federico Mogherini, called for an end to "illegal migration" and urged the government to take steps to protect its citizens from being denied asylum.

,"Reference text": " Italy's navy to patrol with Libyan ships to curb human trafficking
Italy wants to work more closely with Libya to limit the number of sea crossings by migrants and potential asylum seekers. But what are the consequences?
Italy's prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni, does not want to wait any longer for EU countries to show solidarity in distributing asylum seekers throughout the bloc. On Thursday he announced in Rome that the Italian navy would be patrolling with Libyan ships just off the Libyan coastline. The aim, Gentiloni says, is to curb human trafficking and bring migrants back from the smugglers' boats to Libya. According to the Italian government's figures, 93,000 migrants have arrived in Italy so far this year. At least 2,000 have drowned in the attempt to cross the Mediterranean - the true figure is unknown. Italy has already threatened to stop allowing boats carrying rescued migrants to dock in Italian ports, or that it may issue migrants with documents that would allow them to travel on to other European countries. Rome has not yet implemented either policy, but the government has made clear that Italy will soon run out of options. The EU Commissioner for Migration Dimitris Avramopoulos acknowledged, again, in Brussels on Thursday that "Europe continues to face high migratory pressures. And Italy more than (almost) any others." The European Commission issued a letter offering more aid and personnel to help manage migration better. Accommodation will soon be full The office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, wrote at the beginning of July that "Close to 200,000 accommodation places are available for refugees and migrants across [Italy], but are nearly all full." The High Commissioner referred particularly to the numbers of people dying when he warned, "What is happening in front of our eyes in Italy is an unfolding tragedy." The United Nations anticipates that another 100,000 migrants will come to Italy via Libya before the end of this year. The number of arrivals is already 20 percent higher than last year; and the number of dead, those who could not be saved, would rise accordingly. According to UN estimates, the Mediterranean remains the "deadliest" refugee route in the world. Italian government statistics say that around 600,000 people have arrived in Italian ports since the start of the crisis in 2014. It is unclear how many have since traveled on to Austria, France or Switzerland. Once migrants are registered in Italy and accommodated in camps, they are not held there. If, however, they leave the accommodation without giving notice, they forfeit their claim to subsistence and social services. Most of the migrants are from African countries, and many try to travel on to France, for example. 300 people are currently sleeping on the beach in Ventimiglia, on the French border, hoping to take a bus or train to France. However, the border is being policed by French officials. Migrants who are caught are sent back to Italy. Austria has announced that it too will close its border with Italy if the number of migrants starts to rise. Repatriation and distribution are difficult Last year 120,000 new asylum applications were made in Italy. Around 50 percent of these are rejected. The asylum seekers are then supposed to leave the country. However, the process of people either returning voluntarily or being deported is very slow. The interior ministry has therefore announced that it will reinforce repatriation programs. The redistribution of asylum seekers from Italy, as agreed by the European Union, is well behind target. Two years ago the aim was to resettle 120,000 people. So far, only 24,676 people have been redistributed, the EU Commission said on Thursday: 7,873 from Italy, and 16,803 from Greece. The numbers are low not just because of the reluctance of other EU countries to take the refugees in, but also because of Italian delays in the registration of possible candidates. Asylum seekers from Eritrea are the most likely to fulfill the criteria for redistribution. Around 25,000 are currently living in Italy, but only 10,000 have been registered with the EU Commission and the European Asylum Support Office as possible candidates. Migration Commissioner Avramopoulos has announced that Italy will be given more help and logistical support in this area. "

Germany's women's soccer team is set to compete in the first ever FIFA women’s tournament in Berlin on Saturday.
The first round of matches will take place at the Brandenburg Gate in central Berlin. The tournament kicks off on Friday and will be televised live on Germany's national television network, Deutsche Welle, from the city's central business district. There will also be a pre-tournament press conference to discuss the tournament, which is expected to be broadcast on German television. First up, the women will compete against each other for the right to wear the number one jersey. Second, they will have to overcome a number of obstacles to reach the final, including the fact that they are not allowed to dress in black and white. This is a very difficult task for any athlete, especially one who has never been to the finals of a major international competition. However, it is not impossible for a woman to play in one of the biggest sporting events in history. In the past, there has been a lot of talk about the importance of having a black jersey and a white shirt in order to stand out in front of crowds of fans. But this year, that has not been the case at all. It is the second time in as many years that Germany has competed in a women-only competition, and the third time since the start of World War II. That's not to say that there is no need for black jerseys or white shirts, but rather that the players should be wearing black, white, or black with white stripes. And that's the way it has always been for me. I don't think I've ever seen a female athlete wear black before, so I'm not sure I'll ever be able to do that again. What I can say is that I am very proud of my team. They have done a great job, I think they've done an amazing job. We're going to try to make sure that we have a good team and that our players are well-trained and ready to take on the challenge of competing in such a big event. So far, we've only had a few incidents where I have had to deal with black-and-white jerseys. These are the ones that have caused me the most pain. For me, this is just another example of how much work it takes to get to this point in time and how hard it can be to achieve that goal. You can see it in my eyes, my mind and my heart," she said, adding that she was very happy with the result. "I'm very pleased with our team's performance in this tournament and I hope we can do it again next year." The second round is scheduled for Sunday, when the teams will face off against France and Germany. Last year's semifinal match between Germany and France was won by Germany, with France winning by a score of 1-0. After that, Germany will play host to France, Italy and Spain. Both teams have been playing in their first World Cups since 1990. As a result, both teams are in good shape, although France has yet to win a single match in any of its three major tournaments this season. France is also playing its first tournament since 1998, while Germany is still in its second year of hosting the competition in 1999. Germany won the Eurovision Song Contest last year by 1,500 votes to 0,000. With the exception of France being the only country to host the event, France will only have two matches in which they can play. If France wins the title, then the rest of Europe will go to Russia, where they'll be playing their second game in three years. Meanwhile, Spain is hoping to avoid the same fate as it did in 1998. Spain has already been awarded the European Championship for its participation in soccer, as well as the Asian Cup in Russia. Italy has also been invited to participate in that tournament as a member of UEFA's governing body, UEFA. UEFA has said that it would like to see Spain play a part in qualifying for next summer's tournament. "

Haiti's capital has been hit by a deadly earthquake, killing at least 10 people and injuring more than 100.
The earthquake shook the country on Sunday, leaving thousands of people without power and sending shockwaves through the capital, Port-au-Prince, to the streets. The quake hit at the height of the morning rush hour, bringing with it the death toll from the earthquake. At least 11 people have been killed, including two police officers, as the quake rocked the city of Champ de Mars in the early hours of Sunday morning. Authorities have said they believe the disaster was caused by an earthquake that knocked out electricity and caused widespread damage to homes and businesses. There were no immediate reports of injuries or fatalities, but officials said the cause of death was still under investigation. Haiti's president Michel Martelly, who was inaugurated on Monday, said he was "deeply saddened" by the tragedy. "I am deeply saddened by what has happened," he said in a statement, adding that he had "no idea what was going on." The earthquake struck at a time when the government was struggling to cope with the aftermath of a devastating earthquake in 2010 that killed hundreds and injured thousands. It was the first major earthquake to hit Haiti in two decades, and the strongest since World War II, when Haiti suffered a series of devastating floods and mudslides that left thousands dead and left hundreds of thousands more displaced. Many of those affected are Haitians, many of whom had fled to neighboring countries in search of safety. In 2010, the Haitian government declared a state of emergency following a wave of natural disasters that swept through Haiti. Since then, Haiti has experienced a number of major earthquakes and floods, which have killed thousands and displaced millions. Last year, around 1.5 million people fled their homes in Haiti, according to a UN report. A total of 2.7 million Haitis fled the island in 2011, followed by another 2 million in 2012. Most of them have returned to their home countries, where they live in poverty, unemployment, education and health care, among other things. Several hundred people died and another 1 million were displaced in recent years. This year's earthquake is expected to be the worst since the 1990s.

The world's worst earthquake Since the beginning of this century, there has not been a single earthquake or tsunami that has killed as many people as there were in 2009. That is, until this year. However, a new earthquake and tsunami have caused a lot of damage, particularly to infrastructure and to roads, bridges and bridges. As a result, it is not clear how much damage this quake will cause. Experts say it will have a significant impact on the economy and tourism, especially in areas with high unemployment and high crime rates. But experts say there is still a chance that the damage will not be enough to cover the cost of rebuilding the damaged infrastructure. So far, no one has claimed responsibility for the catastrophe, although some have speculated that it could be linked to human rights abuses.

At least 18 people are reported to have been killed in an accident during Carnival festivities in Haiti. Many others were wounded when the float they were traveling on made contact with a power line.
Officials in Port-au-Prince said the accident occurred as thousands of revelers filled the streets of the city center of the Haitian capital in the early hours of Tuesday. The Associated Press quoted witnesses at the scene who reported seeing somebody on one of the floats used a stick or pole to move a power line so that the vehicle could pass under it. Reuters cited a witness who reported seeing the head of a singer from the hip-hop band Barikad Crew make contact with the power line. Some of the victims were electrocuted instantly, while others jumped off the float, causing panic among the revelers who lined the street. Many of the at least 18 deaths came as a result of the ensuing panic, while at more than 40 others were injured, according to local authorities. There was some confusion about the number of fatalities, with the Associated Press putting it at 20, and AFP later reported that only around 10 had died. Haitian President Michel Martelly used his Twitter account to express his condolences to the injured and bereaved.

},{"Generated text": " Jang Jong-nam: North Korea's Kim Jong Un is the most powerful man in the world
The North Korean leader has been accused by the United Nations and the International Monetary Fund of plotting to assassinate him.
North Korea has accused South Korean President Kim Kyok-sik of planning a nuclear attack on the country's capital Pyongyang. The North has denied the accusations, saying only that it was planning the attack. "We are not going to do that," Kim said in a statement on Saturday. He added that the North had "no plans whatsoever" to attack the South, adding that he had no intention of doing so. However, he said he was "very concerned" about the possibility of the assassination of Kim, who is believed to be the leader of a pro-North Korean faction within the ruling Workers' Party of Korea (WPK). "I am very concerned about what is going on in our country," said Jang, referring to Kim's father, Kim Il-sung. But he also said that "there is no reason why we should not do what we have been doing for a long time." "The only reason that we are doing this is because we know that Kim is a very strong leader," he added. 'We don't want to give up on him' The South's Foreign Trade Bank of Pyongyang (FTSB) has said it is willing to take a chance on Kim and his family, but it's not clear whether it will do so with the help of its own financial institutions. In the past, it has taken a lot of pressure from the US, the European Union, China, Japan and South Korea to impose sanctions on Pyongyang over its nuclear and missile programs. Last year, Seoul and Washington imposed sanctions against Pyongyang for failing to comply with UN resolutions on nuclear weapons and ballistic missile tests. Since then, however, Pyongyang has continued to threaten the West with sanctions, including the threat of economic sanctions if it fails to meet its commitments to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula. On the other hand, Washington and Beijing have said they will continue to work with Pyongyang to ensure that sanctions are meted out in accordance with international law. They have also called for the UN Security Council to hold a meeting in Pyongyang on Monday to discuss the issue. Pyongyang is also expected to announce a new round of nuclear tests in response to UN sanctions. It is thought that Pyongyang may be preparing to launch a missile attack against Seoul in retaliation for Seoul's decision to pull out of talks with Washington. That would be a major setback for Pyongyang, which has repeatedly threatened to withdraw its weapons if Washington does not act on its demands. China and Japan have both expressed concern about Pyongyang's nuclear program. Beijing has also expressed its concern over the potential for nuclear attacks, with Beijing threatening to cut off trade between the two countries if Pyongyang continues to violate its obligations to the international community. According to Japan's Toshimitsu Shigemura, a professor of international relations at Waseda University in Tokyo, Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to Pyongyang coincided with a visit by Kim to Beijing on Friday. Xi said the visit was a "great opportunity" for China to show its support for Kim in his efforts to end the nuclear standoff with his regime. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told DW: "It's a great opportunity for us to demonstrate that China is committed to a peaceful resolution of this conflict." The visit comes as the Chinese government has announced plans to increase the amount of money spent by Pyongyang in exchange for sanctions relief, according to Jun Okumura of Eurasia Group, an Asia-Pacific think tank in Beijing. Kim has already promised to step down from his post at the end of 2017, and he has pledged to stay in office until he is able to return to his current position as a leader. This is an important step forward for both North and China in dealing with their nuclear ambitions. As a result, both countries have agreed to reduce their military spending, as well as increase their economic and trade ties with each other. Both sides have expressed their willingness to cooperate on a range of issues, such as economic, trade and security issues. One thing that is clear is that both sides are very interested in resolving the dispute over nuclear issues and are eager to see what happens next. For the first time since Kim took power in 2011, Beijing and Pyongyang have begun to talk about a possible nuclear exchange between their respective countries. At the same time, though, they have not yet decided whether or not they would accept the terms of an arms embargo imposed by Washington in return for an end to sanctions imposed on them. So far, neither side seems to have taken any concrete steps to resolve the conflict. "
,"Reference text": " Is China seeking regime-change in North Korea?
The sudden reduction in aggressive rhetoric and actions by North Korea has led to suggestions that Pyongyang has realized it has pushed its only ally in the region to the brink of severing its friendship.
The announcement in Pyongyang on May 13 of the promotion of Jang Jong-nam to "minister of the People's Armed Forces" came out of the blue. Until recently, the little-known commander of an army corps in coastal Kangwon Province, Jang has replaced Kim Kyok-sik, a four-star general with a long track record of loyal service to the regime. The reasons for 70-year-old Kim's replacement are not clear - as with most of the political maneuvers in North Korea - but it may have been his loyalty that cost him his position in the politburo. Kim was widely seen as a hawk in the regime and is believed to have been in command of the operation to shell the South Korean island of Yeonpyeongdo in November 2010, an incident that killed four people, destroyed civilians' homes and infrastructure and dramatically worsened the already strained relationship between Pyongyang and Seoul. By sacrificing Kim, analysts believe, North Korea is signaling that it is backing away from the confrontational stance it adopted after the United Nations imposed new sanctions in the wake of the nation's third underground nuclear test in February. And there are other indicators that Pyongyang is seeking to return to the status quo. The North's troops have been permitted to step down from the highest state of preparedness for war that was initially ordered when South Korea and the US began a series of annual military exercises. Missiles withdrawn Similarly, two Musudan intermediate-range missiles that were identified as being on mobile launchers being operated in eastern areas of the country have apparently been ordered to return to base. In late April, there was concern that test-launches of the missiles would be a further escalation by Kim Jong-un's government and a message that it would not bow to international pressure to halt its nuclear and missile development programs. But the analysts believe the tokens of Pyongyang's goodwill have come too late. "For the North Korean leader, this is a very difficult time," Toshimitsu Shigemura, a professor at Tokyo's Waseda University and an authority on North Korean affairs, told DW. "Timing is very important here and it is possible that China is moving to abandon Kim Jong-un. The atmosphere between the two nations is changing. China may have decided that it is time for a regime-change in the North, they will not permit the collapse of the country because they do not want chaos on their own borders." Further evidence that Beijing is slowly tightening the screw on its erstwhile ally comes as more state-run financial institutions sever their links with banks in North Korea. The latest institution to adhere to the government's orders to halt transactions across the border is the Bank of China, one of the four major banks in the country, which announced on May 7 that it would cease dealings with the Foreign Trade Bank of North Korea, which has been identified as being involved in Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs. Contingency plan in place Intelligence sources have passed on to DW information that Beijing has a contingency plan in place for when Kim Jong-un's control over the country crumbles. The reports confirm that China is indeed quietly encouraging regime change and is grooming Kim's brother, Kim Jong-nam to take over his role. At 42, Kim Jong-nam is the oldest son of Kim Jong-il, the dictator who ruled North Korea with an iron fist for 17 years until his sudden death in December 2011. Kim Jong-nam had been expected to assume the leadership after his father's death, but fell from favor spectacularly in 2001 when he was detained with two women and a boy aged 4 at Tokyo's Narita International Airport travelling on a forged Dominican Republic passport. He later admitted that he had wanted to visit Disneyland. He subsequently lived in Macau and Beijing, under the close watch of the Chinese authorities. The reports suggest that after Kim Jong-nam is installed in Pyongyang, his brother will be permitted to go into exile, probably in China. The tactic is not without its pitfalls, however, in part due to the efficiency of the campaign to deify their young leader as the future of the nation. Kim Jong-nam as 'new king' "China may be dreaming of appointing Kim Jong-nam as the new king - and he is more preferable to the West than Kim Jong Un - but the problem is that he is not known in North Korea," said Ken Kato, director of Tokyo-based Human Rights in Asia. "Many people in Japan know much about the North Korean 'Royal Family,' but this information is hidden in North Korea," he said. "Even residents of Pyongyang know very little about Kim Jong-nam." Yet the reports are gaining credence among North Korea-watchers. Jun Okumura, a political analyst with the Eurasia Group, told DW that North "

The Mexican president is due to meet with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto in Las Varas on Friday. The US secretary of homeland security is expected to travel to Mexico City.
Mexico's interior minister said Friday that the US was sending a delegation to the country's southernmost state of Chihuahua to discuss the fate of the suspected drug trafficker. "The US has sent a team of US special agents to investigate the case," said Mexican Interior Minister Oscar Alberto Aparicio, according to a statement released by the Mexican government. US Secretary of State John Kerry said the mission would include a visit by US President Donald Trump and Mexican Prime Minister Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, as well as a meeting with US Attorney General Loretta Lynch. Kelly, who was sworn in as US Homeland Security Secretary earlier this month, said he was "deeply concerned" about the situation in the southern Mexican state, which borders Sinaloa, Mexico's largest province, and that he would not be able to attend the meeting. In a tweet, Trump said: "Thank you, John, for your time and your hard work. I will be back in Mexico in a few days." US officials said they were "very pleased" with the outcome of Friday's meeting, although they did not elaborate on the reasons for the visit. Mexican officials have not yet commented on whether they would be willing to hold a press conference with Trump. President Trump has called for a special meeting between the two leaders to be held at the White House in Washington, D.C. On Friday, the Trump administration said it would hold an emergency meeting in New York, where the president will hold his first meeting since taking office on Jan. 20. Mexico has been on high alert since the end of last year's drug war that killed more than 1,000 people. Last week, President Barack Obama visited the border with Mexico, saying he wanted to see the "new normal" of peace and stability in his country. He also called on Mexico to step up its fight against drug trafficking. Trump, however, has not said whether he wants to go to war with drug traffickers, but he has said that Mexico is prepared to do what it can to stop the flow of drugs into the United States. His visit comes just days after the death of a US national, Otto Warmbier, was declared a national hero by a Mexican judge. Read more: Mexico mourns the victims of drug cartel death in US presidential election The death toll from the drug-trafficking trial has risen to over 2,500, with nearly half of those killed being US citizens. It was the highest number of deaths in U.S. presidential elections since 2000, when President George W. Bush was inaugurated. A year ago, Mexican media reported that President Obama had ordered the release of hundreds of thousands of people from drug cartels, including MS-13 gang members and members of his own criminal organization, "Guzman Cartel." The president's visit came just a day after a series of deadly attacks on US troops in Afghanistan and Iraq that left at least 11 people dead and hundreds more wounded. At the same time, US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said in an interview with Fox News on Thursday that "the US is ready to act." "We have a lot of work ahead of us," he said, adding that it was important to him to "make sure that we do everything we can" in order to prevent a repeat of what happened in 2001. But he added that there was no need to rush to judgment, because "it's not our job to make sure we don't repeat the mistakes we made last time around." In the aftermath of that attack, a UN peacekeeping mission was set up to try to find a way to end the violence. However, it is not clear how long it will take to reach that goal. According to US intelligence officials, there is still a long road ahead for Trump to get the message out to Mexican authorities. "

A gunbattle between drug gangs in northern Mexico has left 14 people dead. It's the latest in a series of turf wars. Smuggling has prompted a visit to Mexico City by US Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly.
Prosecutors said the remote town of Las Varas in Chihuahua state was the scene of Wednesday's battle between affiliates of the Ciudad Juarez cartel and a gang from the state of Sinaloa. Police said fighting escalated when patrols arrived. Fourteen people were found dead; 12 others were hospitalized. Grenades, launchers and rifles were found. The mountainous region is used as a corridor for smuggling into the US. El Chapo effect Chihuahua security commissioner Oscar Alberto Aparicio said a Black Hawk helicopter was called in as police chased surviving gang members through the area known for marijuana and opium poppy production. Two police officers had been killed in a "cowardly" way in the area a week ago, he said. In a similar incident last Friday, 17 gunmen were killed during a shootout with police on a highway in Sinaloa, Mexico's northwestern state. Sinaloa was the home base of Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, whose extradition to the US in January apparently left gangsters in a struggle for control of criminal syndicates. Homicides have surged in recent months, with the number of persons killed in May put at 2,186, the highest since the collection of such statistics began 20 years ago.

"Shared responsibility" must become the focus of transnational efforts, Kelly said. Narcotics smuggling into the US has become a multibillion-dollar (multibillion-euro) business for Mexican drug cartels. Mexico in turn wants the US to throttle demand for narcotics and the supply of illegal weapons to Mexico cartels.

The Nigerian army has killed at a military base in the northeastern state, where the Islamist militant group has been battling for control of the country's northeast.
Femi Falana, the military spokesman for the 7th Division, told reporters in Maiduguri on Saturday that the group had killed more than 500 people. He said the attack was carried out by "armed and trained terrorists." The military said it was conducting a counter-insurgency operation against the militants, who are believed to be responsible for a number of attacks on security forces and civilian infrastructure. "We have been fighting the terrorists for over a year now, and we are still fighting them," he said, adding that he was not aware of any new attacks. The army spokesman, Ibrahim Idris, said there was no immediate claim of responsibility for any attacks, but that there had been a "significant increase in attacks" since the beginning of this year. According to a statement by the army, "we have received reports that some of our troops have returned to the area and are preparing to resume their operations." "This is the first time that we have seen the presence of armed terrorists in our country," said Femi Falanas, a police spokesman. Earlier this week, he told the news agency AFP that "the terrorists have taken over the entire northeast of Nigeria and that they are planning to return to their strongholds." He added that troops were still combing the region for weapons, ammunition and other weapons. Fala said he had not been able to identify the attackers, saying they were "terrorists" who were trying to take over government buildings and schools. Police said they had arrested several people, including a woman, suspected of being the leader of a terrorist organization, in connection with the kidnapping and murder of hundreds of people in northern Nigeria in recent weeks. In the past, police have arrested dozens of suspected terrorists, many of whom have links to al-Qaeda and the Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) in Nigeria. At least one of them was killed in a shootout with police on Friday, when a suicide bomber detonated his car bomb outside the base of an army base near the town of Maidu, killing over 100 people and injuring hundreds more, according to local media reports. It is not clear whether the bomber was carrying out the attacks or whether he is a member of al Qaeda, which is fighting alongside the Nigerian military. There is no official word yet on the whereabouts of those killed, however, as to whether they have fled to other countries or if they will be recaptured. On Saturday, local news agencies reported that a man was reported to have died after being shot and wounded by a roadside bomb on a school bus in northeastern Nigeria's capital city. Authorities have yet to confirm the death toll from the terrorist group, although they suspect it may be much higher. A statement issued on Sunday said that several suspects were being held in custody, with one being charged with attempted murder and two others being sought by police. However, it did not give any further details about the suspects, other than to say that their names have not yet been released. Foul words are being exchanged between the two sides in an apparent bid to calm the situation and prevent further escalation of violence. As the day wore on, more and more Nigerians began to flee to neighboring states, particularly the north-eastern states of Cameroon and Benin, to seek refuge in neighboring countries. Many of these people fled their homes to escape the violence that has gripped Nigeria for several months. Some have even called for an end to violence in their own country. But the government has refused to provide any details on how many people are killed or injured, while others have expressed concern that it could be many more.

A Nigerian court martial has sentenced 54 soldiers to death for mutiny and cowardice as they refused to fight against Boko Haram Islamists. The case has highlighted the army's problems with equipment and morale.
The men sentenced to death on Wednesday were part of the special forces division ordered in August to retake three towns in Borno state, which had been taken over by the Islamist Boko Haram insurgents. Their lawyer, Femi Falana, said the 54 men were sentenced to death by firing squad and five had been acquitted. They were accused of conspiring to commit mutiny against the authorities of the 7th Division of the Nigerian army, which is on the frontline. The trial began on October 15 and was conducted behind closed doors. It is subject to approval by top military officials, but there has so far been no indication that senior officers oppose the court martial. They were not available for comment afterwards. There was a similar case in Nigeria in September, when 12 soldiers were sentenced to death for mutiny after firing on their commanding officer in the northeast city of Maiduguri. The 7th Division, based in Maiduguri, leads the offensive but there are numerous reports of troops refusing to deploy. Soldiers have regularly complained that they lack weapons, food, and other basic supplies to fight the Islamists, who are reported to have tanks, rocket-propelled-grenade launchers, and other heavy weaponry. Boko Haram has taken a number of towns and declared an Islamic caliphate in the region near the border with Cameroon. The Nigerian military has in recent weeks claimed to have made progress in recapturing lost territory. Thousands of people have been killed since the Islamist uprising began five years ago. An estimated 1.3 million have been displaced, with tens of thousands seeking refuge in neighboring Cameroon, Chad, and Niger. rg/bk (AFP, AP, dpa) "

The head of Germany's largest bank has warned that the country's economy is facing a "great recession" as it struggles to cope with the financial crisis.
Martin Blessing, chief executive officer of the bank's German unit, said in a statement on Thursday that he was "deeply concerned" about the economic situation in Germany. "We are deeply concerned that we are going to face a great recession," he said, referring to the eurozone's worst economic crisis since the Great Depression in the 1930s and 1940s. He added that "we have to be very careful about what we do and how we react to it." The bank, which has been struggling to recover from the 2008-2009 economic downturn, has said that it will continue to invest in its core business, the banking sector, as well as its retail banking arm. It has also pledged to cut costs by up to 25 percent by the end of this year, according to its annual report released on Wednesday. The company also said it would cut its workforce by 1.5 million people by a total of 2.6 percent in 2017, down from 3.7 percent the year before. In addition, it plans to raise its capital by 2 billion euros ($3.4 billion) in 2018. Zilke said the company would also increase its investment in technology to meet the growing needs of its customers. However, he cautioned that this would not be enough to overcome the challenges facing the German bank.   "It will take a long time for us to get back to where we were before the crisis hit. We will need to do a lot of work to make sure that our customers are able to pay their bills and that they have a good return on their investment," said Martin Blessing. 'We will do everything in our power to ensure that customers have the means to repay their debts.'  The German lender's chief financial officer said he had no immediate comment on the matter, but said "it will be a matter of time before we know for sure what will happen next." "I am very concerned about our ability to respond to this crisis," Martin told reporters at a news conference in Berlin. dpa/jm (Reuters, AFP, AP, Reuters, DPA) Editor's note: This is not the first time that Martin has spoken out against the Bank of England's (BoE) decision to reduce its stake in Deutsche Bank (DBKG) by more than 50 percent. Earlier this month, BoE chief economist Hans-Joachim Müller told the Financial Times newspaper that Germany would be "very cautious" when it comes to reducing its share of German banks' foreign exchange reserves. Maurer, who is also a former chief investment officer at Deutsche Boerse, told Reuters: "The Bank is very cautious about taking any action that could be taken against us. I think it is important to take steps that will help reduce our exposure to foreign currency, especially if the economy continues to deteriorate." He also cautioned against underestimating the impact of a recession on German companies' earnings. mb/sms (dpa, bp, hb) (AFP, jm, cb, dp/Reuters)  For the past two years, Commerzank has seen its stock price fall by almost 30 percent from its pre-crisis levels. This has led to a sharp drop in investor confidence, and analysts say the stock is now down by around 10 percent compared with a year ago. That's a worrying sign for investors who have been betting on a recovery in Europe's second-largest economy. After all, Germany is the world's third-biggest economy, after China and the United States. What's next for Germany? The ECB is set to decide on its next steps in tackling the euro zone debt crisis next year. If the ECB does not take action, then Germany will likely be left with little to show for it. But if it does, there will still be plenty of room for growth in other European countries. "

Commerzbank has named Martin Zielke as its next chief executive officer, taking over from current CEO Martin Blessing on May 1. The 53-year-old will be leading Germany's second biggest lender.
After successfully weathering the Great Recession, Commerzbank's board of directors appears to want to signal a continuation in its growth trend with Martin Zielke's appointment as the new CEO as of May 1. Outgoing head Martin Blessing announced last year he would not renew his contract. Zielke had previously been put in charge of implementing reforms in the company's private banking sector following the recession. His restructuring measures attracted 800,000 new customers to the bank and changed the image of the 146-year-old financial institution. The 53-year-old has an illustrious career across several German financial institutions to look back on, having started at the teller of a local branch in 1983. Zielke's crowning achievement The beleaguered German financial institution recorded a profit of more than a billion euros (more than $1.1 billion) last year. It was the first time in five years that Commerzbank had made such profitable gains, which it said would translate into paid dividends for shareholders. A good portion of the yields were achieved by a restructuring and expansion drive of Commerzbank's private banking arm under Zielke's leadership. However, some of that money will go to the German government, as it had to step in and rescue the bank in 2009 to the tune of 18 billion euros ($25 billion at the time) by chiefly acquiring more than 15 percent of the shares, effectively nationalizing part of Commerzbank's operations. ss/jlw (dpa, Reuters) "

However, Ban did not rule out the possibility of a bilateral meeting between the two countries, according to Reuters news agency. In a statement, the United Nations secretary-general said: "It is a matter of time before the meeting is scheduled to take place and we will make sure that we are ready for that meeting." Ban also called on the Nepal government to step up its anti-terror efforts, saying it was committed to ensuring the safety of its citizens and the security of their homes and businesses. 'We have a responsibility to protect the lives of our citizens,' Ban added. Nepal is the only country in Africa that has not been hit by a major earthquake since the 1990s, when the world's third-largest economy was devastated by the devastating effects of World War II.

UN chief Ban, however, said there was no need to rush to make a decision on whether or not to impose a ban on all nuclear-armed countries. But he added that he was not ready to give up the fight against the "war on terror" just yet. According to a UN statement released on Wednesday, UN special rapporteur on international human rights issues, a group of UN experts had called for an end to UN sanctions against countries that do not comply with international norms on greenhouse gas emissions. A UN report released earlier this month found that a total of 1.5 million tonnes of greenhouse gases have been released from the atmosphere since 2005, compared with 1 million tons in 2005.

His visit was marked by an increase in public anger and frustration at what he described as a lack of cooperation between Nepal and its neighbors. It was also the third time he had visited a country that does not have access to nuclear power. This time around, there is no sign of an agreement on a deal to freeze the nuclear program. "

The UN Secretary General has voiced disappointment over the failure of divided parties to meet a deadline to draw up a constitution. Security forces are on high alert amid fears of unrest.
UN leader Ban Ki-moon expressed "deep regret" on Monday that political leaders had failed to make progress on a constitution in Nepal, expressing concern about instability within the country. Security forces were put on high alert, with riot police patrolling streets after calls by the opposition for the resignation of Maoist Prime Minister Baburam Bhattarai. "Nepal has entered an uncertain constitutional and political period," Ban warned in a statement read by his spokesman Martin Nesirky. "The government and the political leaders, as well as leaders of various communities, need to demonstrate the courage and wisdom to come together to address the challenges the nation faces," the statement added. Repeated deadlines expired Politicians were to have agreed upon a new framework for the country's political future by Sunday. However, the representation of ethnic minorities and castes within a federal structure has proved a major sticking point in efforts to draw up a secular constitution. Bhattarai on Sunday said that parliament, elected in 2008 after a decade of civil war, would be disbanded after repeated deadlines had been broken. New elections are due to be held in November, but the opposition has criticized the premier's unilateral decision to call the poll. The country's Hindu monarchy, which ruled for centuries, was abolished after Maoist rebels gave up arms and won elections in 2008.

},{"Generated text": " German - gpe0 - Germany | 中文版The German language is the most important language in the world. It's the language of the German people, and it's their language that is important to them. The word "German" means "language" in German. In German, the word is a verb, which means to speak in a foreign tongue. German is also a noun, meaning to be spoken in an English language. For example, German can be translated as "English" or "French." The German word for "foreign" is "European," meaning "indigenous." In other words, it means the same thing as in English, but with a different meaning. This is not to say that Germans don't understand the meaning of "Western" and "Eastern," but rather that they understand it as a way to express themselves in other languages and cultures. They understand that Western languages are very different from those of Eastern European languages. And that's why they have different meanings for different languages, such as Arabic, Greek, Latin, Chinese, Russian, French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Japanese, Korean, etc. These are the languages that are used in Germany, as well as by other countries in Europe and the Middle East. There's a lot to learn from the Germans, of course, since they are not native speakers. But there's also the fact that German has a very strong sense of language and that it is very easy to understand what is being said about Western culture and how it relates to German culture. That's something that I'm very proud of. I've always been fascinated by the idea of western culture, especially the way it treats people and their families. So I was very excited when I heard about this, because it was the first time I had ever heard of it. Now I can't wait to see what it will be like to live in this country for the rest of my life. What I want to do with my time is to write a book about it and to share it with people who are interested in learning more about the history of Western civilization. To do that, I have to make sure that the books I read are translated into German so that people can read them and understand how they relate to each other. As a result, they can learn a great deal from me. "I'm not going to lie to you and tell you how much I love you," I said, "but I think you'll find it hard to believe that you're actually reading this book." And so I'll try my best to keep up with the latest developments in western Europe. Read more: How to get started on the Western world, how to find the right language for your language, what to look for in your country, where you live and work and where to go to study abroad and all the things you need to know about Eastern Europe in order to become a better linguist and an expert on Western philosophy. You can find out what I mean by that in my book "The Western World," which was published in 2003. Here's how I got started: I started out by reading the book. Then I went to Germany and got to work on it, then I came to the United States and started studying Western literature. After a while I realized that there was a huge difference between Western and Eastern languages in terms of vocabulary, grammar, vocabulary and grammar. When I arrived in America, my first language was German and I learned that western languages were very similar to Western ones. However, in Western Europe, there were many differences between the two languages: English and German were more common than Western. Western German was more like Western European, with more of a Western vocabulary. Eastern German became more popular with Western Europeans, so Western English became less common in general, while Eastern Europeans became increasingly popular in particular because Western countries were becoming more and more westernized. European countries have become more liberal in their foreign policy and are more open to western European ideas and ideas. Even the US is becoming increasingly liberal with its foreign policies, including the European Union. "

A regular companion of the fall season's wines is a treat called Zwiebelkuchen, literally, onion cake. It is a one-crust pie, eaten in most German wine regions during the fall wine season.
Zwiebelkuchen is traditionally eaten with Federweisser, a young wine available in Germany in the fall. The link between the two is so strong that many Federweisser wines have a recipe for the onion cake on their labels. Here's a recipe for it: Ingredients: 1 packet yeast, active dry 1 teaspoon sugar 1 1/2 teaspoon salt 3 cups unbleached flour 1 tablespoon shortening 1 cup water (49 to 54 C / 120 to 130 F) 6 slices bacon -- diced 2 medium onions -- sliced 1/4 teaspoon cumin 1/2 teaspoon salt Pepper 1 egg yolk 1 cup sour cream Mix the yeast with the sugar, a teaspoon of salt and half a cup of flour. Blend in the shortening and warm water, then beat for two minutes. Add enough flour to make a soft dough, and then knead the dough until smooth and elastic, about five minutes. Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, then cover it and let it rise in a warm place for 30 minutes. Pat the dough into a lightly greased 12-inch pizza pan or onto a lightly greased baking sheet. Press up the edges to make a slight rim. Fry the bacon until crisp and drain it on absorbent paper. Add onions to the bacon grease, and cook slowly until tender, but not brown. Sprinkle the onions, bacon, cumin, half a teaspoon of salt and pepper over the dough. Bake the cake at 204 C (400 F) for 20 minutes. Blend the egg yolk and sour cream and pour the mixture over the Zwiebelkuchen. Bake it for another 10 to 15 minutes, until the cake is golden brown and the sour cream has set. Serve warm or at room temperature with white wine. " 

},{"Generated text": " Uighurs in Xinjiang: How to cope with the Cultural Revolution
The Han Chinese have long been persecuted in China. Now, they are being persecuted by the Communist Party. DW spoke to a group of researchers in the Chinese capital Xi'an.
Chinese authorities have been accused of discriminating against the Han community, particularly the Uighur community. They have also accused them of supporting the Kuomintang separatist movement, which they claim to be part of. This is not the first time that this has happened. In the 1970s and 1980s, Chinese authorities in Ningxia and Quinghai, where the ethnic Han population is concentrated, imposed a ban on Han people from entering the country. The ban was later lifted in 1989. Since then, it has been used as a propaganda tool. But in recent years, the ban has become more and more severe, with many Han communities being forced to leave their homes and businesses in search of a better life. It has also become a source of tension between Han and Muslim communities, especially in Yinchuan, a city on the western side of the city. Han-Muslims have traditionally been excluded from Chinese society because of their religious beliefs. However, this is no longer the case. There are now Han Muslims living in other parts of China, as well as other ethnic groups, who are not allowed to come to China for religious reasons. Ethnic minorities are also being discriminated against, according to the United Nations Human Rights Council (HRRC) in a report published in January. "The Chinese government has made it very clear that they do not want to discriminate against ethnic minorities," said Dru Gladney, an anthropologist at Pomona College in California. He added that it was "unacceptable" for the government to allow Han groups to enter China without being able to apply for a visa, and that the decision was made "in the interests of national security and the welfare of all Chinese citizens." In addition, he said, "It is unacceptable for Chinese people to live in countries where they have no legal right to travel abroad and to have their own culture and religion." The crackdown is also seen as an attempt by China's ruling Communist party to impose its own version of Sharia law on all Muslims, including Han, Muslims and Sikhs. According to DW, there are a number of cases of ethnic cleansing in Chinese cities, such as Shanghai, Guangdong, Jiangsu, Shadian and Zanzibar. Many of these cases are related to ethnic tensions between the two regions. One of them is the Dungan revolt, in which thousands of Han Han were killed. Another case is that of Shi'ite Muslims who were forced into exile in Shanghai after the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre. These are the same people who had been living there for many years and who have since fled to other cities. Some of those who fled from China have now returned to their home countries, while others have moved to neighboring countries and are seeking refuge in Europe or the Middle East. A third case, however, is a case of "ethnic cleansing." Ethnic cleansing is taking place in some areas, but not in others. For example, some ethnic Chinese are fleeing from the capital, Beijing, for fear of reprisals. That's why many people have come back from exile, even though they don't have the legal means to return. And it's not just the Muslim community that is suffering from this phenomenon. People from other regions have returned, too, because they feel that their culture is being suppressed. As a result of this, many Muslims have fled the region, leaving behind a lot of history behind them. At the end of last year, hundreds of thousands were displaced and thousands more were internally displaced. Today, thousands are still displaced from their homeland. China has a long history of discrimination against Muslims. On the other hand, China is still trying to find a way to deal with this problem. So far, so good, that's what we've seen. We're still waiting to see how it will all turn out. I'm not sure how long this will last. Maybe we'll have to wait and see what happens. "
,"Reference text": " The Hui - China's preferred Muslims?
While the Muslim Uighurs are increasingly being persecuted, the largest Chinese-Muslim minority, the Hui, are under less scrutiny and thriving as a religious community. DW examines the reasons behind this phenomenon.
Walking through the Muslim quarter of Xi'an is a fascinating venture into a hodge-podge of cultures. The smell of lamb skewers and hot spices wafts through the crowded streets. Chinese-looking women in headscarfs stretch noodles, while an old man with a white prayer hat stands in front of a mosque with a distinctly Chinese arched roof. This is the home of the Xi'an Hui Muslim people, where Islam was introduced to China for the first time in the 7th century. China's Muslim population now numbers 23 million, of which over 10 million are estimated to be Hui, and a little under 10 million Uighur. While their fellow Muslim Uighurs in the Xingjiang Uighur Autonomous Region are experiencing severe restrictions on their religious freedoms, the Hui mostly practice their faith openly, and in certain areas are enjoying a resurgence in their religious participation. The reason for their success has to do with centuries of remarkable assimilation, while also maintaining their identity. A history of assimilation Historically, the Hui people are descendants of Persian, Arab and Mongol merchants on the Silk Road, who came to China over 1,200 years ago. Since then, intermarriages with the Han Chinese have meant that the Hui became ethnically mixed and spread across the country. Over the centuries, the Han and Hui have lived relatively peacefully next to and with each other. The Hui took the path of assimilation, speak Mandarin and adapted their religious traditions to the local customs. One of the most visual examples of this is the great mosque of Xi'an, said to be one of the largest and oldest in China. The place of worship is built up of multiple courtyards and sports arches and tiled roofs that clearly show influences of traditional Chinese architecture. While some Hui now live a life culturally and religiously indistinguishable from Han Chinese in first-tier cities such as Shanghai or Beijing, many cities in China have a significant Hui Muslim minority population with close-knit communities, especially in the northern provinces of Ningxia, Gangsu or Quinghai. Traditionally traders, many Hui people are also economically successful today, and according to estimates, their religious participation is growing. Increasing religiosity Dru Gladney, professor at Pomona College in California and leading scholar on the Hui people, estimates that today there are twice as many mosques in China as there were in 1950, of which a majority were built by Hui Muslims. "The amount of practising Muslims among the Hui is rising," Gladney told DW. "For example, there is a dramatic increase in the number of Hui women wearing the Hijab." Gladley adds that "the numbers of Hui going on the Haj are going up constantly." One of the reasons for this is the increased communication with other Muslim groups and the ensuing influence of outside Islam – either through Hui scholars returning from the Haj or from increased business relationships with the Middle East. Trade between China and the Middle East is growing ever more important for the communist country. As a measure to attract Arab business, Yinchuan, the capital city of Ningxia and one of the Hui hubs, has gotten a makeover. Construction of a new $3.7 billion Islamic theme park called World Muslim City is underway, and Arabic lettering has been added to the city's street signs. Haiyun Ma, a Hui scholar at Frostberg University takes a critical position with regard to the Chinese government's perceived friendliness toward the Hui. She told DW that it is more of a sign of "business interest, not of religious tolerance." On the business side, Hui Muslims do play a role as middlemen in trade between the Middle East and China. Because of their knowledge of Arabic, numerous Hui people are working in Dubai, and for Middle Eastern businesses in China. Keeping out of politics Another reason for the Hui's relative freedom are the characteristics that distinguish them from the Uighurs. The second-largest Muslim minority is ethnically distinct, and does not speak Mandarin as a first language. Most importantly, they have a homeland that they wish to claim. The majority of Uighurs live in the far-western province of Xinjiang. Many of the ethno-religious group seek independence from China, and the Uighurs as such are oppressed for it. During this year's Ramadan, they were forced to break fast and parts of their community were not allowed to attend prayers or travel. Most recently, all citizens of Xinjiang were ordered to hand in their passports. But the Hui, partly also due to their diversity and geographic diaspora, and partly because of their cultural closeness to Han Chinese, have no political aspirations of independence, Gladney said.

},{"Generated text": " Bayern Munich vs. Hannover Preview: What to expect in the Bundesliga
Frankfurt will be looking to build on their 3-0 win over Nuremberg on Saturday. They have a chance to make it three wins in a row.
The first half of Saturday's Bundesliga match between Mainz and Wolfsburg has been dominated by Bayern Munich, who have won three of their last four matches. The German side have been on a tear since the end of the season, but they are still in contention for a spot in next year's Champions League. After a disappointing start to the campaign, they will now look to bounce back from a 2-1 defeat at home to host Cologne on Sunday. That's a step up from last season's 1-2 draw with Cologne, which saw the Bavarians take the lead for the first time in their history. But it's not enough to win the game. It's too early to tell whether Bayern are going to be able to get back into the top four, or whether they'll be forced into a draw at the weekend. If they do, it will only be a matter of time before they can make up ground on the likes of Cologne and Cologne. "I don't think we'll have to wait very long to see if we can get the result we want," said Bayern coach Klaus Allofs. He's been in charge of his side for more than a year and a half, and he's had a lot of success in his first two seasons in Germany. On Saturday, however, he was handed the reins to his former club, Wolfsrunden, for which he won the league title in 2014. In the second half he scored twice, the only goal he has scored this season. His first goal for his club came in an away win against Cologne in September, when he set up Klaas-Jan Huntelaar for an own goal. German coach Jürgen Klopp's side are on course for their third consecutive Bundesliga title, having already won their first three matches in all competitions. However, there's still a long way to go before Bayern can claim their fourth consecutive league crown. A win at Cologne would give them a three-game win streak, although they could still be in danger of losing the next three games if they fail to beat their opponents. Germany's second-placed team have already been eliminated from the competition after losing their opening two matches, with the loss to Cologne last week. For the visitors, that means they've lost three straight games and have now lost just one of those three. Their last two games have also been marred by injuries and suspensions. Last week's defeat in Cologne was a blow to their hopes of a return to Europe's top-flight competition, as they were unable to cope with an injury-plagued squad and were forced to play without injured star striker Dante. This time around, though, things are looking up for them. Bayern have the advantage in terms of possession and the number of chances they have in front of them, thanks to a strong defensive performance from their top two scorers. Frank Lampard's team-mates are also in fine form in recent weeks, scoring twice against the relegation-threatened Cologne side. There's also the fact that they haven't lost a single game in three years, despite a string of poor performances in that time. So far this year, Dortmund have only managed to hold on to three points in five matches - and that's good enough for third place. Meanwhile, Nürnberg, meanwhile, are struggling to find a way out of an early relegation zone, where they're currently tied with sixth-place Borussia Monchengladbach on goal difference with only one point separating them from sixth place and fourth place in Group B. And that has to do with a win away from home, against relegation to Group A. B has a tough task ahead of him as he tries to keep his head above water, while Dortmund's Marco Reus has struggled to stay on track with his fitness and fitness. With the exception of last weekend's draw away at Greuther Fürth, B will need to improve their fitness in order to avoid a repeat of that defeat. "

Bayern Munich stamped their authority over the Bundesliga on Saturday, with a ruthless 5-0 drubbing of Hannover at home. Meanwhile, second-placed Schalke and third-placed Frankfurt were forced to share the points.
With many critics saying Bayern might as well be given the giant Bundesliga dish already, perhaps the struggle for second is shaping up to be the more compelling battle. But Saturday afternoon's clash between second-placed Schalke and third-placed Frankfurt did not take a decisive turn, with the game ending in a 1-1 draw. Schalke drew first blood in the 11th minute, when Frankfurt's Stefan Aigner was dispossessed in midfield, and Lewis Holtby released Klaas-Jan Huntelaar in front of goal - the Dutchman's first in the Bundesliga since September. But the hapless Aigner waited just over 100 seconds to make amends for his error, when the Royal Blues allowed him a free header that left goalkeeper Lars Unnerstall with no chance. But neither side could make inroads in the second half, which allowed Dortmund to leap-frog both sides and claim second place. Bayern take command Meanwhile the imperious Bayern Munich dispelled any talk of winter form-dip - following last week's draw to Nuremberg - with a brutally efficient 5-0 win at home to Hannover. The Bavarians stormed to a 3-0 lead in just 37 minutes, celebrating a nifty overhead kick for star signing Javi Martinez in the fourth minute. Toni Kroos and Franck Ribery scored the next two against a Hannover side that were torn open at will. The overhead kick was the first for the 40-million-euro ($52-million) signing Martinez, and in the second half new defender Dante also opened his account with a straightforward header from a Kroos free-kick. The festival of football continued just four minutes later, when Mario Gomez - making first Bundesliga appearance of the season - slammed the ball into the net from a tight angle just 30 seconds after replacing Mario Mandzukic. Dortmund win The champions Dortmund, meanwhile, are still nine points behind Bayern after beating Mainz 2-1 away. It was a potentially tricky fixture in the town where Jürgen Klopp began his coaching career, and Mainz showed their brilliance in the fourth minute, when Elkin Soto knocked a dream ball into the path of Marco Caligiuri, whose volley fairly screamed into the top right corner. Dortmund's own star-Marco - national team player Marco Reus - leveled the scores just eight minutes later. Reus worked himself some room at the outer edge of the penalty area, and slotted a beautiful 17-meter effort into the far corner. And Dortmund's second goal, just before half-time, was equally aesthetic - a vertical ball bisected the Mainz defense perfectly down the middle, where Polish predator Robert Lewandowski got his eighth league goal of the season with a deft lob over the onrushing Christian Wetklo in goal. Allofs' homecoming Bremen's 1-1 draw at Wolfsburg had a special frisson of its own, as Wolfsburg's newly-minted sporting director Klaus Allofs faced the club he had served as general manager for over a decade. And there was some gesticulating from the Bremen bench in the general direction of the Wolfsburg management when the guests took the lead in the 35th minute. Just seconds after Wolfsburg missed several chances, Marko Arnautovic was left free in the box after Eljero Elia found space on the left and cut the ball back for the Austrian to finish. But Wolfsburg got their own back in the second half. In the 62th minute, Bremen were reduced to ten men when Lukas Schmitz was given second yellow card for a hard tackle on Adelino Vieirinha. Just two minutes later, Bas Dost took advantage of their guests' disorgnaization and smashed the ball into the goal after neat piece of play from Vieirinha. Dirty derby The Franconian derby between Greuther Fürth and Nuremberg was a cagey affair that ended in a frustrating 0-0 draw. The first half was marked mainly by a straight red card for Nuremberg's Markus Feulner after an ugly, flying lunge on Stephan Fürstner. But the home side's numerical advantage was short-lived - Sercan Sararer was also sent for an early ice bath after his high elbow on Javier Pinola was adjudged worthy of a second yellow card in the 61st minute. But the aggression in the tackles was not matched by ruthlessness in front of goal, and neither side could eke out any clear chances. "

About 100 Porsches are imported to Argentina each year. Now the country wants to keep a positive trade balance by having the value of the imported luxury cars matched by red wine exports.
Porsche is currently enjoying record profits after a two-year downturn, but the export-reliant company has hit a pothole in Argentina. Buenos Aires-based Porsche importer Grupo Pulenta has signed an agreement obligating it to export several hundred bottles of red wine for each car it imports, the Argentine government announced Wednesday. Grupo Pulenta declined to comment when contacted by Deutsche Welle. Job creation During the past year, Argentina has held thousands of high-end vehicles in customs until companies agreed to export goods valued at the same amount. Most of those vehicles came from Germany. According to a spokeswoman for the Argentine embassy in Berlin, the country has been trying to safeguard domestic employment with a positive trade balance. "Our government has negotiated with automakers to balance their imports of cars with an equivalent amount of exports," she told Deutsche Welle in a statement. "Since March 2010 we have been working with the automakers and importers in order to increase local integration and reduce the trade deficit in this sector." Small market A Porsche spokesman said the company sells just short of 100 vehicles into Argentina each year. That compares to more than 40,000 sold worldwide during five months in 2010. "For Porsche, Argentina is a rather small market," the spokesman told Deutsche Welle. "Our importer, the Pulenta Group, also deals in wine. They have their own vineyards and export that wine. It has nothing to do with Porsche - we just have an import contract with them, and it seems they've found an individual solution with the Argentine government." Domestic production Volkswagen, which has an Argentine subsidiary producing the new "Amarok" pickup truck and transmissions, has thus far avoided mandatory exports. The company had reported an export surplus of 384 million euros ($545 million) for this year. Porsche's holding company owns 32.2 percent of Volkswagen, and the Porsche brand is intended to become integrated into Volkswagen's lineup. Daimler and BMW also have subsidiaries in Argentina. While Daimler produces its "Sprinter" there, BMW only imports to the country.

Polish Prime Minister Konrad Szmanski has been accused by the European Parliament of plotting to overthrow the government of President Viktor Orban. He has denied the allegations.
On Thursday, the EU's top prosecutor, Frans Timmermans, accused the Polish prime minister of trying to spy on the country's government. "The Polish government has repeatedly denied any involvement in the alleged spying," he told reporters after a meeting of the commission's executive committee in Warsaw. The commission has said that the accusations are politically motivated, and that it is "deeply concerned" that Poland's intelligence services could be used to try to influence the outcome of a referendum on EU membership. However, Poland has rejected the charges, saying that they would be "unacceptable" if they were proven to be false. Poland, however, has refused to cooperate with the Commission's investigation, which is expected to continue until the end of this year. In a statement on Thursday evening, Polish foreign ministry spokesman Konrzysztof Kaczynski said his country had "no plans to interfere" in any way in its internal affairs. A spokesman for the Dutch Foreign Ministry said the ministry had not yet received a formal complaint from Poland about the spying, adding that Polish intelligence agencies had been unable to find any evidence of any wrongdoing. Hungary and Poland have also been at loggerheads over the issue, with Hungary accusing Poland of attempting to meddle with its domestic affairs and the Czech Republic accusing the other side of being behind the espionage. Both countries have accused each other of espionage, but both have denied accusations of involvement. On Wednesday, Hungary said it had no evidence to back up its accusations, while Poland said its government was "not aware" of such accusations. It also accused Hungary of planning to launch a coup against the president of Poland in a bid to oust him from office. At the same time, both countries said they did not want to give up their sovereignty over Poland. Hungarian Foreign Minister Fyodor Dostoyevsky has also denied allegations that he was involved in spying on Polish officials. According to the Netherlands' Foreign Office, Hungarian intelligence officials have been investigating the matter for several months. Last week, a court in Brussels ruled that Hungary had violated the terms of an extradition agreement with Poland over its handling of its nuclear weapons program. That ruling was upheld by a lower court last month, ruling that Hungarian prosecutors had failed to prove the case against Hungary. But the court also ruled in favor of Hungary's request to have Hungary extradited to Poland to face trial on espionage charges related to its use of weapons of mass destruction and other crimes against humanity. This ruling is the first step toward a possible extradition treaty between the two countries, although Hungary has yet to agree on a deal on extraditing its citizens. If the extradition deal is approved, it would give Hungary the right to extradite its nationals to Germany, where they could face up to 10 years in prison if extraditions are carried out against them. There is also a question of whether Hungary will agree to a plea deal with prosecutors in exchange for extradition of former Polish spy Konstantin Zygmuntz, who was sentenced to life imprisonment for espionage last year for his role in setting up a terrorist organization in Ukraine. As a result of that case, Germany has agreed to pay a fine of €1.5 million ($2.2 million) to Hungary for its involvement, according to German media reports. Germany's Justice Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said he would appeal the decision, arguing that "there is no basis for such an agreement." The Netherlands, meanwhile, said Hungary should be allowed to resume extradition proceedings against Poland if it wants to avoid a trial in Germany. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she would not rule out the possibility of extradition. She also said Germany would like to see a German extradition request from the United States. Berlin's foreign minister, Josef Schengen, told the German news agency dpa: "I think we will have to wait and see what happens in this case. I think it will be a long time before we can get a decision on whether or not to do that." "

The European Commission has launched an unprecedented procedure to review Poland's rule of law. The move has been questioned by officials, with some saying it places the EU at-risk of taking sides in an internal dispute.
The European Commission's decision to launch the rule of law procedure on Warsaw puts the EU's executive institution at-risk of taking sides, Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Konrad Szymanski told reporters in the European Parliament. "I have the impression that the [European] Commission risks taking a role as a side in a political dispute inside Poland," Szymanski noted. On Wednesday, European Commission Vice President Frans Timmermans - a former Dutch foreign minister - announced the move, marking the first time the EU has used the mechanism. Timmermans said that the move was aimed at entering "into a dialogue with the Polish authorities, to clarify the facts in an objective way and help find solutions if necessary." He added that the procedure is focused on seeking answers regarding the new right-wing Polish government's actions not to apply two judgments by the country's constitutional court, and the reasons behind the president and vice-president's terms were shortened. Preserving rule of law However, Poland's deputy foreign minister said that the European Commission was informed of the reasons behind the government's actions. "We would insist that the questions are phrased precisely because we have provided much information to the Commission in recent days and we are not entirely clear as to what the Commission is still not clear about," Szymanski noted to reporters at the European Parliament. New media laws, giving the government the power to hire and fire senior figures at state broadcasters, were also called into question by Timmermans. The controversial legislation prompted mass pro-democracy protesters in the European country. "The rule of law is one of the EU's fundamental values. Making sure the rule of law is preserved throughout the Union is a key part of the European Commission's responsibilities," Timmermans wrote on his official Facebook page. The Rule of Law Framework was created two years ago as a response to criticism that the 28-nation bloc had not adequately responded to possibly-authoritarian moves taken by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban during his tenure. ls/jil (Reuters, AFP, dpa) "

"We are going to continue working with Poland," he said in a statement, adding that the government was committed to a "strong and stable government." "The government will continue with its work, but we will also continue our efforts to build a strong, stable and strong government," said the president, who was sworn in by Polish President Law and Justice (PiS) party leader Jacek Rostowski on Wednesday. The president also said that Poland would work closely with other European countries in the future, including the United Kingdom, to ensure that its citizens are able to live in peace and prosperity in their own countries. Touts said he was "deeply concerned" about the situation in Poland, which has suffered from a series of economic and political crises since the end of the Cold War. He also called on the international community to help Poland recover from the effects of its nuclear weapons program. In the past, Poland has faced a number of crises, most of which have been caused by the collapse of international financial markets. At the same time, the European Union has been struggling to cope with an influx of migrants, many of whom have fled to the US and are seeking asylum in Europe. On Thursday, a group of opposition politicians called for a general election in which Poland will be the only EU country to vote in favor of a referendum on EU membership. Poland is currently embroiled in an international dispute over the EU's nuclear deal with Iran, with Russia accusing the West of meddling in its internal affairs.

Poland's center-right coalition has survived a vote of no confidence. The opposition had called for the government to resign after a tape was leaked in which the Polish foreign minister bashed US and British leaders.
The opposition Law and Justice party failed in its bid to oust Prime Minister Donald Tusk on Friday through a vote confidence, the second such vote since the publication of private conversations between high-ranking officials, referred to by some in Poland as "Waitergate." Tusk withstood the opposition challenge by a wide margin of 236-155. The prime minister's Civic Platform party governs Poland in a center-right coalition with the Polish People's party. Last month, recordings of a private conversation between Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski and then-Finance Minister Jacek Rostowski were published by the weekly magazine Wprost.

A bee researcher in Germany has been working for the first time on a project to study the biology of bees. The project is part of the university's bee research institute.
The project, which began in the summer of 2015, is now in its second year of operation. It aims to develop a new method of studying the ecology of bee populations in Europe and the Middle East. According to the project's head, the idea is to test the theory that the bees are more intelligent than humans, and that they can be more efficient and adapt to different environments. "We are trying to find a way to make sure that we have a better understanding of what is going on in our environment and how it is affecting our species," said Dr. Klaus Maresch, a professor of biology at the University of Bonns, in a statement to Deutsche Welle. In the past, researchers have tried to understand how the bee population has changed over the years, but the results have been inconclusive. They have not yet been able to determine whether or not they will continue to work on their project. However, they are hopeful that their work will yield results that will allow them to move on to other areas of their research. 'Bee research' The research team is currently working on an extension of its project and is hoping that it will be completed by the end of this year. If successful, it could lead to more bee species being introduced to Europe, where there are already more than 1.5 million bees, according to a study published in Nature in 2015. But the researchers are still waiting for results from a second study, due to be published next month. A new study is being conducted on the topic, with the aim of finding out whether the new technique will help to reduce the number of species that are threatened by bee-related diseases, such as cancer, heart disease, stroke and stroke. Experts say the technique could be used to help prevent the spread of diseases in other countries, as well as to prevent them from spreading to new regions. Studies have also been conducted to see if the method is effective in reducing the risk of disease outbreaks in developing countries. Researchers are also looking into the possibility of introducing new methods of controlling the growth of wild bees in countries where the disease has already spread.

As a result, there is a growing body of research on how to control the effects of these diseases. For example, studies have shown that certain types of cancer cells are less likely to spread than those that do not have cancer. This is because the cells that cause cancer are not as susceptible to infection as those found in humans. That's why the study was carried out by a team of researchers from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), which is based in Munich, Germany's largest city. There is no evidence of any link between the two studies, although the USGS has said that there may be a link. What is known about the studies is that some of them are very similar to those conducted by other researchers. Some researchers believe that these studies may have the potential to reveal more about how diseases are affecting the human body. Another study has found that one study showed that a large proportion of people who are allergic to certain kinds of bacteria are actually more likely than others to die from exposure to them. One study suggested that this could explain why some people have become more resistant to vaccines, while others may not be as willing to take part in such studies. "
,"Reference text": " Beekeepers battle mites with technology
Bees are useful, hard-working and vital for our ecosystem. Aside from making honey, bees pollinate most of our food crops. But summertime is also the season for one of the biggest threats to honey bees – the varroa mite.
Dete Papendieck puts on a white veiled protective hat and takes out a metal jug with a beak-shaped spout. He sets fire to the container's contents – formic acid – and starts directing the smoke that is wafting at the beehives lined up in front of him in his garden on the outskirts of Bonn. The acid doesn't harm the bees, but it does kill the varroa mites, he says. And July, after most of the honey has been harvested, is the best time to treat his hives. The one millimeter-large varroa mite is a parasite that infests beehives and lays its eggs in the honeycombs, alongside the bees' larvae. "It feeds on the bees' and the bee brood's blood, the so-called haemolymph," Papendieck explains. A third of bees killed in Germany Papendieck is an apiarist at the Bee Research Institute at the University of Bonn and he knows that the threat of mites is serious. If left untreated, varroa-infested colonies rarely survive a winter. In 2010, German beekeepers lost about 200,000 hives to the mite – one third of Germany's total bee population. And it is not just the honey and beeswax production that are affected by the mite. Many of our food crops depend on bees: Some 80 percent of all agricultural plants and 90 percent of fruit trees in Europe are pollinated by Apis mellifera, the European honeybee. Varroa introduced from Asia Had Dete Papendieck been a beekeeper forty years ago he would not have had to worry about mites. He says the varroa mite that was originally native to Asia, was introduced to Europe in the 1970s. "It happened during a research project in which it was attempted to crossbreed the European honeybee with the Asian honeybee. The researchers were exchanging bee colonies between Europe and India, and that is how the mites came to Germany," Papendieck said. Unlike Asian bee species, the European honeybee cannot fight off the varoa mite by itself. According to Papendieck, bees easily transmit the mite to other beekeepers' hives in what apiarists call robbery. "It happens when certain colonies are being robbed by other bees. Large numbers of bees from different colonies attack weak hives and steal their stocks. At the same time, parasites and diseases are exchanged", he says. Researchers have been trying to breed varroa-resistant mites, but so far they haven't had much success. High-tech tools help fight the mite Klaus Maresch is also worried about his bees. He is an organic beekeeper from Bonn and he has been passionate about bees since he was a little boy. "They are part of my family. When I open my hives and smell the honey and hear the buzzing of the bees it's like being in another world," he told Deutsche Welle. In addition to using formic acid to fight the mite, Klaus Maresch employs a high-tech tool – a special cylindrical scale that helps him determine when it is best to start the varroa treatment. "Every day this hive scale sends data about the colonies to our server. The data, such as the temperature in the hive and the amounts of nectar and pollen collected, help me to find a good day to treat varroa," Maresch says. Maresch also makes the data about the activities in his hives available to fellow beekeepers who can treat their colonies accordingly. A driver's license for beekeepers? But it is not the mite that angers Maresch most. "That's nature," he says, "I feel angry about beekeepers who don't fight varroa. If the bees of neighboring beekeepers are infested, I also have a problem." The existing German pest regulation obliges beekeepers to treat their bees against varroa, but there are no strict controls. The majority of Germany's more-than-80,000 beekeepers are amateurs who keep between one and 20 colonies. This makes it difficult to impose and survey certain quality standards. Maresch, who sees himself as a kind of 'bee activist', would like to see the government introduce stricter rules. "There should be a law that obliges every new beekeeper to learn about beekeeping before they are allowed to keep bees. They should get an education and there should be something like a driver's license for beekeepers," he says. In the mean time, Europe's bees are going "

The European Commission has called for the European Union to ban the sale of beer in the bloc. The move comes as the EU's consumer affairs commissioner, Markos Kyprianou, warned that the move could lead to a backlash from consumers.
EU Commissioner for Consumer Affairs Peter Hahn said on Thursday that he was "deeply concerned" by the decision. "I am deeply concerned about the situation in Germany," he said in an interview with the German newspaper "The Express." "We are very concerned that there will be an attack on the integrity of the beer industry in Europe." The EU Commission, which is responsible for regulating the trade in beer, has said that it will take steps to protect the interests of consumers, particularly those who buy beer online. In a statement, the Commission said it would "take appropriate action" in response to the growing number of complaints about beer being sold online and in stores. However, it did not rule out the possibility that a ban would be imposed on all beer sales, including those from the US, Canada, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand. It is not yet clear whether the ban will have any effect on consumers' purchasing decisions, but it is expected to come into force at the end of this month. German consumer protection commissioner Karl-Heinz Florenz told the paper that "there is a growing concern among consumers that beer is becoming increasingly expensive and that consumers are becoming more and more intolerant of it." In addition, he added, "we are not going to allow beer to become more expensive, especially when it comes to children and young people, and we will not allow it to be used as a substitute for traditional food products." Germany's anti-bailout movement has been growing in recent years, with more than 1.5 million children under the age of 18 being affected by beer-related illnesses, according to German news agency dpa. This has led to an increase in cases of child abuse and neglect, as well as cases where children are being treated as if they were in a foster care home. According to Deutsche Welle, this is the first time that Germany has banned beer from entering the country without parental consent. But it has also been criticized by consumer groups, who say it could have a negative impact on children's health and the environment. As a result, they are calling for an EU-wide ban of alcohol sales in all EU member states from January 1, 2019. Germany is also considering a move to limit the use of tobacco products in EU countries, such as Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Switzerland, in order to prevent the spread of such products into the rest of Europe. That move is seen as an attempt to curb the rise of "bio-phobia" among German consumers and to make it more difficult for them to get access to products they want to buy online, even though they don't have the means to do so. Author: Rolf Looz-Corswarem Editor: dla/jm (dpa, AFP, AP) Editor-in-Chief: Rodolphe de la Hiltrud Breyer: "It's not just a matter of whether or not the product is good or bad. There are a lot of products out there that can be bought online that are made available to people who are in need of protection. These are products that should not be sold in other countries. They should be available for sale online or in supermarkets, where there are no restrictions on what they can buy." German media outlets have reported that German supermarkets have been forced to close their doors to customers because of concerns over the safety of their products. A spokesman for German supermarket chain KFC said the company would not comment on a possible ban, saying it was not aware of any plans to sell its products outside Germany. He added that, however, there were "no indications that this would affect the quality of goods sold." He also said there was a "very good chance" that people would buy products from other European countries without their own country. "
,"Reference text": " EU Mulls Warning Labels to Curb Alcohol Abuse
While still targeting smoking, European Union's public health commissioner is considering adding alcohol to the list of vices the bloc should clamp down on.
In a report commissioned by the European Commission, the London Institute for Alcohol Studies recommended raising the legal age to buy alcohol to 18 (in some countries, such as Germany, 16-year-olds can buy beer), lowering the permitted blood alcohol level while driving to 0.5, banning alcohol advertising on TV and in movies as well as adding warning labels to bottles as ways of preventing alcohol abuse across the bloc. Which of the methods EU Health Commissioner Markos Kyprianou actually introduces will be announced "sometime in the autumn," according to a spokesperson. Other options include a 10 percent increase in the price of alcohol. Kyprianou has, however, hinted that he favors warning labels -- similar to those that appear on packs of cigarettes -- that make the dangers of alcohol clear. "Drinking harms your unborn baby" on bottles? Brewers and wine makers across Europe, however, have come out against placing "Drinking Kills" or other labels on bottles of beer. "Warning labels are the completely wrong way to go," Peter Hahn, head of the German Brewers Association told Germany's Express newspaper. "The do not deter people who have lost a sense of how much to drink and unsettle the people who enjoy a beer after work." Industry groups also opposed implementing EU-wide guidelines in countries with traditionally different ways of approaching drinking and drinking problems. "Policies that do not consider cultural and regional differences, will fail to deal with the social problems, while at the same time generate a rising level of political objections," said Rodolphe de Looz-Corswarem of Brewers of Europe. Keeping social vices separate Green party EU parliamentarian Hiltrud Breyer meanwhile called on the alcohol industry to stop "saber rattling" before it sees the a final version of the EU's strategy to prevent alcohol abuse. German Consumer Affairs Minister Horst Seehofer said he would wait to see what Kyprianou's actual suggestions are before commenting. Other German politicians, however, were more willing to voice the opposition to putting a sip of wine on the same footing with a puff of a cigarette. "People should not expect that a skull and crossbones end up on every bottle of beer and wine," German EU representative Karl-Heinz Florenz told Der Tagesspiegel newspaper, adding that when it comes to alcohol, each member state should be responsible for how it deals with alcohol abuse. The harm of "passive drinking" While cigarettes are a health risk from the first puff, moderate drinking can actually be healthy and there is no danger from "passive drinking," Peter Liese, a German EU representative, told the paper. The commission's report disagreed with Liese's conclusion, saying alcohol abuse had a major role in as many as 200,000 deaths in Europe due to car accidents and disease and played a role in some 60,000 underweight births. The report also estimated the effects of alcohol abuse of costing the EU 125 billion euros ($161 billion) in 2003. Some 25 percent of men and 10 percent of women in Europe drink what the EU considers to be more than healthy amounts of alcohol and between 3 percent and 5 percent are suffering from alcoholism, according to EU statistics.

India's relations with the US have improved markedly since President Barack Obama took office in January. However, tensions remain high between the two countries.
The US and India have been at loggerheads over the past few months. The US has accused India of meddling in the internal affairs of both countries, and has threatened to cut off trade and investment with India. But the Indian government has denied this accusation. "We are not going to allow India to meddle in our domestic affairs," said Vindu Mai Chotani, a member of the Observer Research Foundation (ORF), a think tank in New Delhi, referring to Modi's visit to Andhra Pradesh, where he met with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Indian Foreign Minister Benjamin L. Cardin. In a statement, India said it was "deeply concerned" by US President Obama's decision to travel to the disputed state of Gujarat to meet with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has been in India for more than a year. India has said that it will not allow US troops to enter the country without its consent, but it is also concerned about the impact of US sanctions on India, which it sees as a threat to its sovereignty and territorial integrity. US officials have said they have no reason to believe that India will be able to defend itself against US pressure to withdraw troops from its disputed border with Pakistan. A US State Department official told DW in an interview published on Thursday that Washington had "grave concerns" about India’s ties to Pakistan and China. According to a US official, "the US is deeply concerned that Pakistan will use India as an example of what it does not want to do in its own country." The official added that the United States has not yet decided whether or not to pull out of a bilateral trade deal between India and Pakistan, in which India is the main trading partner for Pakistan's oil and gas exports. It is not clear how much India would be willing to pay for such a deal, given the current political and economic situation in both the region and the wider world. Read more: How India could be the next superpower to emerge from the Middle East? The question is how long will it take to get rid of Pakistan? "It will take a long time," the official said, adding that there is "a lot of uncertainty" over what will happen if India decides to go to war in Afghanistan and Iraq. And the situation is complicated by the fact that many of these countries are in conflict with each other, as well as the ongoing conflict in Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. At the same time, the Pakistani government is trying to reassure the international community that Modi is committed to peace and stability in his country and that he will continue to push for a peaceful and prosperous future for the entire region. He has also promised to make India a "one-stop-shop" for all trade deals, including those with Iran and North Korea, according to an Indian official who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals from Washington and Beijing. 'India is a great country' The Indian foreign minister said in a speech to parliament on Wednesday that "it is important to us that we have a strong relationship with our neighbors and we are a part of that relationship." "India has a lot to learn from Pakistan," he said. Modi has made it clear that his foreign policy priorities are clear to him: He wants to build a stable, stable and stable India that can compete with all the other countries on the global stage. This is an important step for him to take, he added, because he believes India can be a world leader in terms of its security and prosperity. So far, however, this has proved to be difficult to achieve. Despite the challenges, Modi and his government have managed to convince the world that they can work together to improve the security situation of their respective states. They have also been working together for several years to develop a common strategy to combat the growing threat of terrorism and extremism in their country. That is why they are now working closely together on a new strategy for tackling the threat posed by terrorism. "

Modi is all set to start his fourth trip to the US after becoming Indian premier, in a sign of deepening Indo-US political and military engagement amid China's growing clout and assertiveness in the Asia-Pacific region.
Indian PM Narendra Modi will be in Washington on June 7-8 as part of a whirlwind five-nation tour, covering Afghanistan, Qatar, Switzerland, the US and Mexico. This is Modi's fourth trip to the US after taking office as prime minister, and the Indian leader's schedule in the US capital includes holding talks with President Barack Obama and other top administration officials as well as addressing a joint session of Congress. Modi's trip "reflects the significance that the two leaders place on the natural alliance between the two largest democratic countries of the world," a State Department spokesperson told news agency PTI. The discussions between the two sides are expected to focus on deepening bilateral defense partnership as well as ways to boost US investment into India, particularly in the energy sector. Trade and defense There is talk of a potential multibillion dollar deal with the US electric giant Westinghouse to build a nuclear power plant in the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. If struck, it would mark the first contract reached under the 2008 US-India civil nuclear accord and pave the way for closer cooperation between the two sides in this arena. PM Modi also wants to use the trip to push for increased trade between India and the US, targeting an almost five-fold rise in bilateral commerce from the currently estimated $120 billion to some $500 billion. Furthermore, both sides have expanded military-to-military exchanges, and the US has emerged as a major arms supplier to India in recent years - selling weapons worth about $14 billion over the past five years. There are also reports of both navies looking at ways to cooperate in the area of anti-submarine warfare, in a bid to help each other detect and track submarines in the Indian Ocean. China concerns The broadening and deepening of ties between the world's two biggest democracies comes amid China's assertive rise in the Asia-Pacific region, where Beijing's expansive territorial claims and aggressive stance in the South and East China Seas have alarmed many of its neighbors. India, too, has a long-simmering border dispute with China, and both nations fought a brief but bloody war in 1962. "In light of China's growing assertive behavior, the Modi government has not been reluctant to highlight its convergence with Washington on regional issues," Vindu Mai Chotani, a researcher at the New Delhi-based think-tank Observer Research Foundation, told DW. Indeed, in their recent high-level joint statements, both India and the US repeatedly declared their support for freedom of navigation in the South China Sea. Both nations also highlight their convergence based on democratic values, and respect for rule of law, Vindu Mai noted. In addition, India's engagements with US allies in the region like Japan, Australia and the Philippines have strengthened. At the same time, India and Vietnam have been cooperating on joint oil exploration as well as in the area of maritime security. China has expressed its concern over these developments as well as deepening Indo-US ties, especially on issues such as the inclusion of Japan as a regular member of the Malabar Exercise, a naval drill held annually by the US and India. "The most important takeaway here is that Beijing views Washington's actions, especially in the Asia-Pacific, as the US containment of China," underlined Vindu Mai, stressing that it's therefore difficult for China to see the US engagement with India in a different light. An array of challenges But observers say there are limitations to how far both India and the US are willing to go to forge closer defense ties, despite their mutual interest in ensuring China's peaceful rise. While the US has been pushing for pacts such as a military logistics sharing agreement - which will allow the two militaries to use each other's bases - India has expressed a raft of concerns over these deals, experts point out. "One issue being expressed by Indian policy makers is that the signing of these agreements would lock the country in an irreversible strategic partnership with the US," says Vindu Mai, adding that, "India does not wish to be seen as a strategic ally of the US against China." Furthermore, the US relationship with Pakistan continues to loom large over India-US ties, with New Delhi looking warily at Washington's supplies of aid and armaments - such as F-16 fighter jets - to Islamabad. In the US, meanwhile, there is growing criticism over rising religious intolerance in the South Asian nation and increased restrictions on civil society organizations such as the environmental NGO Greenpeace and the US-based Ford Foundation.

It is not clear how many Syrians are coming to Germany, but it seems to me that there are many who are trying to make their way back to Europe. There are also reports that some of them are seeking asylum in other European countries, such as the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. This is the first time in a long time that Germany has been able to cope with such a large influx. And it's not just the refugees who have come to Berlin. They have also come from other countries as well, including the US, Britain, France, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Spain. Many of these people are fleeing persecution and poverty in their own countries. These people, however, do not have the same rights as those who fled war or persecution. For example, they are not allowed to stay in countries where they have been persecuted or forced to flee their homes. That's why we have to deal with the fact that we don't have enough money to cover the costs of living in these places. We need to do something about it, and that's what we are doing now. I think we should be doing more, because we need more people to get out of our own country and to help our neighbors." In the past, it was easy to see why Germany was so reluctant to accept refugees, especially those from countries like Syria or Jordan. But now it has become harder and harder to take in people from outside of its borders. The situation is getting worse and worse every day. As a result, many of us are afraid to leave our homes, even if it means leaving our families behind. So, when we leave, we try to go to places where we can get a better life for ourselves and our loved ones. When we come back, our family and friends will be there for us and we will stay with them for many years to come. At the moment, this is very difficult. You can't leave your home country without your family or your friends. If you leave the country, you're going to have a difficult time getting a job and you'll never find a place to live again. What do you do when you come here? What are your plans for the future? Do you have any plans to move to another country? Is there a plan to bring in more refugees? The answer is yes, of course, I have no plans at all. My plan is to start a family here and stay here until I can find someone who will take care of my family, my friends and my children. Then I will move on to my new country of origin, where I am sure I'll find the right person to work for me. After all, if I'm not there, then I won't be here for a while, so why should I go back? I don’t know what will happen next. "
,"Reference text": " Refugees in Germany: 'I want to integrate, but how?'
Refugees are constantly told that they need to integrate. How are they dealing with that task? Impressions from a Berlin refugee home gathered by DW's Jaafar Abdul Karim.
"Do you know the word 'integration'?" I ask a young man that I meet in a Berlin refugee home. "No," he says. Then I use the Arabic word "indimaj." He immediately answers: "I want to integrate, to learn the language and become part of society." He continues that, unfortunately, he has no idea how he is supposed to go about doing so. Adham Ali is 21 and comes from Syria. He has been living in Germany for six months. Until a week ago he was living in a gymnasium in the Spandau district of Berlin with 700 other young men. "Now I am in the refugee home all day. I am trying to learn German via YouTube because I cannot find a spot in a language course." I ask if he has any German friends. He replies: "Where and how should I meet Germans?" More than a million refugees came to Germany last year. People like Adham. Many live in a bubble, in refugee housing, cut off from the outside world. They are, however, aware of the fact that Germany is talking about them and their integration. And many realize that it won't be easy. He knows the issue regarding German values, says Adham - about equal rights for men and women, respecting the constitution, accepting homosexuality. He comes from a small village outside Damascus. "The women there all wear niqab," he says, refering to the head-covering veil that only leaves the eyes visible. Apparently there is no one to help people like Adham Ali find a way to reconcile their old lives with their new ones. I had that impression often during my visit to the refugee home. Some, like Adham, are full of hope nevertheless. He says he wants to continue the law studies that he began in Syria. 'I feel lost' Others are frustrated. Like Raafat Hajir, a 24-year-old Palestinian from Syria. "What do you do all day?" I ask him in Arabic. "I get up, have breakfast, hang around, go to the gym," he says. "Can you speak German?" I ask him in German. "Yes," he says, and tells me that when he arrived he took a German class that he paid for himself, but now he doesn't have any more money. He tells me that as a stateless person he has no right to state-sponsored German courses. Obviously no one has informed him that the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF) has just changed that rule. He says, "I am a dentist and could work, but what am I supposed to do? I am not allowed to work here!" He even thought about working illegally, but decided against it. He is stuck in limbo. "What is the plan? What can I do to integrate myself into society?" he asks me. He doesn't have any German friends to help him get a start. "How should I meet Germans? Just approach them on the street?" He says he knows a lot of young men that are in the same situation. A few months ago I wrote about integration in my column, about how unproductive it is that many refugees are not allowed to work for months at a time. Back then I proposed a step-by-step plan for integration. Now, a half year later, I am plagued by the feeling that we are still loitering at the bottom of my proposed "integration pyramid." The refugees are here, but we are leaving them to deal with their future on their own. They are sitting around in refugee homes with nothing to do. We are producing frustration in exponential doses. I ask myself: Are those young men, who have no everyday perspective, not the perfect victims for radicals who promise to help them find a purpose in life? Many refugees in Germany have no idea what their rights and responsibilities are. No plan, no idea. Where are the authorities? Why are these young men being abandoned? Do we not want to integrate them, or are we unable to? Why are we constantly talking about them as people that do not want to integrate? If we do not want to make them part of society, then they will not want to make Germany part of their lives either. Demand rather than encourage Many politicians tell refugees: Integrate yourselves, accept our values! Some even threaten: Those who refuse to participate in integration courses should be punished and not be allowed to remain in Germany. The new integration law that the coalition has just passed is also supposed to contain that threat as well. That is why the refugee organization Pro Asyl has dubbed it the "disintegration law": There is no lack of will on the part of refugees, but rather of offers from the "

German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier met with Georgian President Eka Tkeshelashvili in Tbilisi on Tuesday. The two leaders spoke on the sidelines of the G20 summit in the Georgian capital.
The meeting was the first between the heads of state of Georgia and Russia since the fall of President Ilham Aliyev's regime in Abkhazia in February. Both sides have accused each other of crimes against humanity, including genocide, kidnapping, torture and murder. On Tuesday, the two sides agreed to hold talks in a bid to resolve the crisis in Georgia. "We will continue to work together to find a solution to this crisis and to ensure that Georgians are able to return to their homeland," said the German foreign minister, who spoke at a news conference with Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Sergei Lavrov. Georgia's president, Georgi Bagapsh, has denied any involvement in any crimes, but has said that he is "confident" that the talks will lead to an end to the conflict. Tensions between Russia and Georgia have been high since early February, when Russian President Vladimir Putin accused Georgia of supporting separatist rebels in South Ossetia, a region that has been ruled by the Soviet Union since 1991. Russia has accused the Georgia government of backing separatist groups in its fight against Russian-backed separatists. In a statement, Russia's foreign ministry said it was "deeply concerned" about the possibility that Georgia could be annexed by Russia, which has ruled the region for more than two decades. Moscow has repeatedly denied the accusations, saying it is not aware of any evidence of Russian involvement. It has also denied accusations that Moscow is trying to influence the outcome of a referendum on whether Georgia should accept Russia as its successor. Russian officials have said they do not believe Georgia will accept Moscow's offer to accept the terms of an arms deal. However, they have not ruled out the idea that Russia would accept Georgia as a successor to Russia. They have called for a peaceful transition of power and said Moscow would not accept any concessions from Georgia in return for its support for the rebels. But the Russian government has rejected such a move as "unacceptable" and says it would be a "disgrace" if Georgia were to recognize Moscow as the legitimate successor of its former Soviet ally. Read more: 'Russia is ready to help Georgia with its own internal affairs' Lavrov said he would meet with Georgia on Wednesday to discuss the situation. He also called on Georgia to cooperate with the United Nations and the International Criminal Court (ICC) in Geneva on its efforts to prevent a repeat of last year's failed coup attempt, in which Georgia was accused by Moscow of attempting to overthrow the democratically-elected president.

I don't think it's going to be easy for Russia to win back the trust of Russia," he said, adding that "it will take a lot of time to get used to it." "I think we will have to wait and see what happens. We will see how it all plays out." The Georgian government, however, is prepared to do what it takes to make sure Georgia does not fall into the trap of becoming a third-party state. According to Russian media reports, Georgia is preparing to give up its nuclear weapons program in exchange for concessions to Moscow. This is a step that is expected to take place within the next few months. If Georgia doesn't agree to a nuclear deal, it will be subject to sanctions from the international community. "
,"Reference text": " German Minister Urges Peace in Georgia's Separatist Regions
German Foreign Minister Steinmeier has called for an end to the "spiral of violence" between the Georgian government in Tbilisi and its Russian-backed rebel regions and presented a three-stage plan to break the deadlock.
Steinmeier issued the plea as he began a tour of the region to sponsor a new peace plan aimed at calming the simmering tensions over Georgia's separatist regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. "This is my appeal to break out of the spiral of violence. A lack of dialogue is not an option for the future," he said after meeting with his Georgian counterpart Eka Tkeshelashvili. Steinmeier, who chairs the so-called Group of Friends of the United Nations' Secretary on Georgia, is proposing a three-phase peace plan based on a mutual declaration of non-violence and repatriation of about 25,000 ethnic Georgians expelled from Abkhazia in the 1990s. Negotiations over the status of the two rebel regions, which have enjoyed de facto autonomy since the end of a civil war in 1994, was reserved for the final phase of negotiations. Tkeshelashvili said, "The plan has great potential for success," but added that the most difficult thing would be to convince Russia. Peace talks remain distant The threat of armed conflict in the region last month has given urgency to international pressure for renewed peace talks, but Tbilisi, Moscow and the Russian-backed regions remain far apart on the basic premises for restarting peace talks. Officials in Tbilisi oppose a treaty on the non-use of force without guarantees on the return of refugees and the withdrawal of Russian peacekeeping forces base in the region. Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was skeptical of peace efforts Thursday. "Signing of a treaty on the return of Georgian refugees to Abkhazia is unreal now, because such a return requires a calm situation," Lavrov was quoted as saying by news agency RIA-Novosti. "We think that signing a treaty on the non-use of force without any preconditions is an absolutely unavoidable first step," he added. Experts see little hope for Steinmeier's plan Analysts do not expect anything conclusive from Steinmeier's trip, pointing to intransigence on the part of the Abkhaz President Sergei Bagapsh, who said he would "not consider the plan." "We are not going to discuss Abkhazia's status with anyone. We are building an independent, democratic state," Bagapsh was quoted by Georgian news agencies as saying. Speaking to journalists ahead of the meetings Thursday, Steinmeier admitted: "We don't have any illusions about simple answers, but we cannot stand by without acting on this conflict. That would be irresponsible." From Tbilisi, the German minister is to travel to the Black Sea city of Batumi for talks with Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili and then to Abkhazia on Friday before ending his three-day tour in Moscow. Most citizens of the breakaway republics have been issued Russian passports and over 2,500 Russian peacekeeping troops patrol the region under a UN ceasefire agreement. In opposition to Georgia's bid to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Russia moved to strengthen diplomatic ties with the breakaway regions sharply aggravating tensions with the Georgian leadership in recent months.

The Maldivian president has been arrested on suspicion of plotting to overthrow the government. He was due to appear in court on Monday.
Yamamah Abdul Abdul-Gayoom was arrested by police in the southern Indian Ocean state of Haryana on Saturday, a day after he was set to be sworn in as the country's new president. Police said they had detained the suspect, Mohamed Nasheed, for questioning. "He is suspected of planning a coup," police said in a statement, adding that they were looking into the possibility of a military coup. The suspect was later released on bail pending trial on charges of conspiracy to commit murder and attempted murder. His trial is scheduled to begin on May 19. A court in Male has ordered the arrest of the man, identified as Mohamed Anil, who is accused of attempting to assassinate the president and his family members. Authorities have not said whether he has a criminal record, but they have said he may have been involved in planning the coup and that he could be charged with murder if he did not comply with the court's order. Maldavian opposition leader Ahmed Adeeb has denied the allegations, saying the accusations were politically motivated. In an interview with Reuters, he said the charges against him were "baseless." "I have never seen anything like this in my life," he told the news agency, referring to his role as a lawyer for the opposition party, the Maldiva Democratic Party (MDP). "This is not the first time that I have seen this kind of behavior. I was not aware of it at the time of my arrest. It was the second time I had seen it." The president's supporters have called for him to step down from his post as president, accusing him of being a "dictator" and of trying to undermine the democratic process in his country. They also accuse the former president of failing to act on his promises to reform the constitution and the rule of law, which has led to a series of corruption scandals over the past few years.

,"Reference text": " Maldives revokes state of emergency citing improved security situation
The president of the Maldives has lifted a state of emergency following an outcry from the international community. The government says the measures are no longer necessary because the security threat has subsided.
The government said Tuesday it had rescinded the emergency measures "with immediate effect" and that "all fundamental rights that were suspended have been restored." President Yameen Abdul Gayoom declared the state of emergency one week ago after the discovery of a homemade bomb and a stash of weapons near his official residence. The finding followed an explosion on Gayoom's speedboat in September - an incident the government labeled an assassination attempt. The president was not hurt in the blast, but his wife, an aide and a bodyguard were injured. The emergency regulations, intended to be in place for 30 days, gave security forces wide-ranging search and arrest powers, and suspended citizens' basic rights. They drew criticism from former colonial power Britain as well as the United States, the European Union and neighboring Sri Lanka. Reading out a presidential decree revoking the emergency, Attorney General Mohamed Anil said there was no longer a threat to the Indian Ocean atoll nation. He said investigations into the September blast and the recovery of weapons had made good progress. The foreign ministry said a number of people had been arrested. Lawmakers also used the security regulations to fast-track the impeachment of Vice President Ahmed Adeeb, who stands accused of plotting the alleged attempts on the president's life. Impact on tourism Attorney General Anil said pressure from the international community, as well as "the possible adverse impact on Maldives tourism and the economy," had also played a role in ending the state of emergency. Foreign tourists visiting the tropical nation, known for its luxury tourist resorts, palm-fringed beaches and coral reefs, contribute close to a third of the country's gross domestic product. The Maldives has had a rocky road to democracy since holding its first multiparty election in 2008. The country's first democratically elected leader, current opposition chief Mohamed Nasheed, was forced to step down in 2012 after a mutiny by security forces. In March, he was jailed for 13 years on terrorism charges in a trial the United Nations said was illegal. President Gayoom is under intense international pressure to release him. Nasheed's opposition Maldivian Democratic Party welcomed Tuesday's announcement. But said declaring the state of emergency in the first place was a political move designed to stop a rally planned for last week calling for Nasheed's freedom. "It appears that Yameen is willing to make up threats about the nation's security in order to settle political scores," the party said in a statement, referring to the president. nm/kms (AP, AF, Reuters, dpa) "

The United States is seeking answers from the Egyptian government over the crisis in the country's economy. The White House has asked the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to look into the situation in Egypt.
US President Barack Obama has called on the government of Egypt to act decisively in its quest to restore stability to its economy, which has been suffering from economic and political turmoil since the fall of President Hosni Mubarak in 2011. But the Obama administration has yet to respond to a series of reports suggesting that Egypt is in a state of crisis. In an interview with the New York Times on Tuesday, Obama said he was "deeply concerned" by the developments. "We are deeply concerned," Obama told the paper, adding that he had "no doubt" that there was a "serious problem" with Egypt's economic situation. Obama also called for an end to the economic crisis, he said, and urged the international community to work together to find a way out of it. He also said that the Arab world needed to be more open to dialogue, but that it would be better to have a dialogue between the two sides, rather than waiting for the outcome of a political crisis to come to an abrupt end. US officials have said they have not yet decided whether or not to seek an extension of Mubarak's six-year term in office. However, the State Department has said it will continue to cooperate with Egyptian authorities in their search for a new president. Read more: Obama calls for Egyptian president to step down from post-Mubarak role in US-Tunisian relations The US has long been a staunch supporter of democracy and the rule of law by former President Ben Ali, who was overthrown by a military coup in February 2011, according to former US intelligence chief Leon Panetta. During his time as president, President Obama was also a frequent critic of his predecessor, former Vice President Joe Biden, during his tenure as US Secretary of State. As a result of Obama's efforts to rein in Mubarak, his government has faced a number of crises, including the 2011 Arab Spring protests that killed more than 100,000 people and forced the resignation of hundreds of thousands of civil servants. At the same time, there have been reports that Obama and Clinton have discussed the possibility of re-instating the Mubarak regime, as well as possible sanctions against the Muslim Brotherhood, in an attempt to prevent the group from gaining a foothold in power. Last week, a report by The Washington Post and Deutsche Welle, citing unnamed sources close to Obama, said the US was considering a possible move to remove the president from office, although it was unclear whether the move would have an impact on economic or political stability. It was not immediately clear whether Obama would agree to such a move, however, or whether he would seek to do so. According to one of those sources, "the president is not going to make a decision until after the elections." The report said Obama had been "very clear" about his desire to bring back Mubarak to power, despite the fact that his term had already been extended by six months. This was the first time that a US president had visited Egypt since he took office in January 2011 and had met with a senior Egyptian official. Since then, it has not been clear if he will be able to return to his role as head of state. There have also been concerns about the role of Israel in Egyptian politics, particularly in relation to foreign policy. Israel's Tamir Sheafer, an expert on Middle East affairs at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace (MEPP), told DW that Israel is "not a party to any of these developments." "I think it is important that we have the right to know what is going on in our country," she said. She also pointed out that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has also expressed concern about what the Israeli government might be doing in order to try and reinstate Mubarak. Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman said on Monday that "it is very important for Israel to play a part in this process." Lieberman and Lieberman have both said Israel should not be involved in any way. Lieberman's comments come as a surprise to many observers, especially given that Lieberman is a close ally of Netanyahu and has a long track record of supporting the Islamist movement in his home country of Tunesia, where he served as prime minister from 2011 to 2013.

,"Reference text": " White House ignored multiple warnings about crisis in Egypt
There's a general consensus among policymakers and analysts that the uprisings in Egypt and elsewhere were unpredictable. That's untrue. There were plenty of experts who warned concretely about an impending crisis.
When hundreds of thousands took to the streets first in Tunis, then in Cairo, Western governments were caught off guard just as much as the dictatorial regimes that were the target of the protests. The US, arguably the country with the strongest interests and the most leverage in the region, was still scrambling to make sense of Tunisian President Ben Ali's swift exit when the next regime, this time in Egypt, crumbled. Without a clear crisis management plan at the ready, the Obama administration's reaction to the events in Cairo waffled between tenuous support for the protestors and continued allegiance with the Mubarak regime, a key US partner in the Middle East. Taken by surprise The remark by Vice President Joe Biden, probably the Obama administration's most experienced foreign policymaker, in the midst of Egypt's uprising that he wouldn't classify Hosni Mubarak as a dictator serves perhaps as the most telling sign that the US government was unprepared for the events that rocked the Middle East. But as it turned out the vast network of US intelligence services was apparently equally flabbergasted by the revolt in Egypt as their political counterparts. While the CIA director's statement before Congress that there was a "strong likelihood" that Hosni Mubarak would step down the same night proved wrong and made the most headlines, the more damaging remark actually came from Leon Panetta's boss. The director of national intelligence, James Clapper, testified before Congress that Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood was "largely secular" and "eschewed violence" only to have his statement later corrected by a spokesman. President Barack Obama, according to a February 4 article in the New York Times, was unhappy with the information and analysis he received on the uprising in the Middle East by his intelligence services. Internal White House study on Egypt However, instead of relying on the CIA and others to prognosticate events in Egypt and elsewhere the president could have simply turned to his own advisors. As reported by the New York Times, Obama himself commissioned a secret review of possible unrest in the Middle East back in August 2010. The so-called Presidential Study Directive concluded that numerous countries in the region were prone to mass unrest without serious political changes, wrote the paper. The 18-page report so far hasn't been officially submitted, but is apparently helping the US deal with the events. Still, the crucial question why the White House didn't act on its in-house information prior to the crisis in the Middle East remains unclear. While the Presidential Study Directive was conducted in secret, the Obama administration also was repeatedly alerted publicly to the dangerous situation in the Middle East, particularly in Egypt. A high-level Working Group on Egypt, consisting of a bipartisan cadre of former government officials, human rights activists and Middle East experts, sent numerous letters to US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in spring of last year repeatedly urging the administration to press for serious reforms in Egypt to avert a possible conflict. The heads of the Working Group on Egypt, Michele Dunne and Robert Kagan, then followed up with an op-ed in the Washington Post in June 2010, warning that "the Obama administration, in pursuit of an illusory stability, stands mute and passive as the predictable train wreck draws nearer." And according to the Washington Post, the group also had meetings with senior State Department officials. So why did the administration not heed the advice of the experts? "I think they didn't share the urgency that some of us on the outside felt about this," Michele Dunne, a co-chair of the Working Group on Egypt told Deutsche Welle. "That things in Egypt were deteriorating dangerously, that there could be an explosion at some point if Mubarak didn't undertake some reform measures." Conflicting positions Dunne, who is a Middle East expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington and editor of the online journal the Arab Reform Bulletin, thinks the US administration was in two minds about what to do in Egypt. While Washington saw the situation in Egypt deteriorating after the renewal of the state of emergency and the rigged election, it found it difficult to act upon it, adds Dunne. "The United States government has a lot of interests to work with Egypt and I think they weren't really sure how to press strongly for improvements for human rights and democracy while at the same time working with the Egyptian government on diplomacy, security, and counterterrorism." What's more, many experts, not just those inside the Obama administration, simply underestimated the potential for revolt in Egypt. "I think that most analysts didn't take seriously trends and developments that we saw in Egypt over the last few years," argues Dunne. To her the youth bulge in the country coupled with a high level of unemployment and increased political activism over the Internet was an alarm signal. Real revolution But others didn't think so.

Germany's top-flight soccer team is set to take on Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga on Saturday. The German club's captain has been named to the squad for the first time since the end of the 2015 season.
Max Meyer will take part in a pre-season training camp in Germany, where he will train with the team's coach Christian Heidel. Meyer is expected to make his first team debut against the Bavarians on Sunday. "I'm very excited about this opportunity," said Meyer, who will be joined by his former club, Bayern, on the bench. He will also have the opportunity to work with his new coach, Domenico Tedesco, after the German coach was fired by Bayern last week for failing to convince his players to stick to his plans. Schale have been in good form in recent weeks, with a win over Bayern and a draw at the Allianz Arena in Munich. They have also won three of their last four league matches, including a 3-2 win at home to Borussia Dortmund on Friday night. But they are still a long way from reaching the Champions League final, which they hope will see them qualify for next year's competition. In addition, they will have to wait until next season to decide whether they want to sign a new contract or not. That would be a difficult task, given that they have already made a number of changes to their squad this season, and that is unlikely to be easy for them to do so. It would also be an uphill task to get the club back into the top four in their division. And that would require a lot of work from the coaching staff and the players themselves. So far, it's been a mixed bag. There are a few things that stand out, but the most important is the fact that it is a very young team and one that has not yet been able to develop into a professional team. For example, the way they play is very different from that of Bayern's squad in terms of talent and experience. This is not to say that the Schalkes have not had a great year, as they've had their fair share of ups and downs. However, there is no doubt that this is one of those times when the best players are the ones who are most in demand. After all, this was a team that had the potential to win the league in 2015 and 2016, when they were the only team to reach the final. Now, that's not the case anymore. At the same time, Germany's national football team has had to deal with an influx of young players who have struggled to find their feet and are looking for a way out of a tough situation. As a result, many of them are now looking to move on to bigger and better things, such as the possibility of joining the national team next summer. On the other hand, some of these young talents are also looking forward to a chance to prove themselves in Europe, especially if they can find the right balance of playing for their national side and not just for Bayern. If they do, then they'll have a good chance of making it to Europe's premier club competition in 2017. A few players have expressed their desire to play for Germany. Some have even expressed an interest in moving up the playing field. Others, however, have said they don't see the need for such a move as an option at this point in time. One player has already said he doesn't think he wants to stay at Bayern for long. Another has said that he would rather stay in his current position, rather than go to another club. Still, he has no plans to leave his old club in order to pursue his dream of becoming a football coach. What's next for him? "We're going to try and find a solution," he said in an interview with German newspaper Kicker. 'We'll see what we can do about it,' he added, "but I'm not sure that we'll get anywhere near where we're at right now. I think we've got a really good team." "

Leon Goretzka is already on his way to Bayern Munich and now another Schalke star might be leaving for nothing in the off-season. Clubs officials say talks are ongoing in the hope Max Meyer will extend his contract.
Schalke might struggle to retain 22-year-old midfielder Max Meyer when his contract runs out at the end of the season, at least according to recent media interviews from the club's sporting director, Christian Heidel. Speaking to German news agency dpa, Heidel confirmed that Meyer turned down an offer of a contract extension earlier in February. "Max Meyer's agent received an extension offer on January 12 with a deadline of February 15, and informed us on February 15 via email that Max would not be accepting the offer because of the deadline imposed," Heidel told dpa. "We have acknowledged this. For now, we no longer feel beholden to the terms of that offer, but that doesn't mean an extension is impossible either."

"At the moment we're still ready to talk," Heidel told this week's edition of football magazine Kicker, albeit stressing that time was of the essence. "But we must and we will plan for the new season." In a separate newspaper interview Heidel was even more explicit, saying the club was not in a position to wait until summer for Meyer to make up his mind. Speaking to Sport Bild magazine, meanwhile, Heidel sought to focus on Meyer's more important role at Schalke, his regular game time, arguing it might be in the youngster's best interests to stay at a club that needs him every week. "[Coach] Domenico Tedesco has formed the team around him in such a way that there is now an ideal spot for Max. That was not always the case," Heidel said. "He needs to ask himself, putting the financial aspect to one side: 'Will I get such a position at a different club?' Because one thing's clear: Max wants to play, and he needs to play." Schalke are already preparing for the departure of one of German football's brightest young stars, midfield all-rounder Leon Goretzka will join Bayern Munich on a free transfer at the season's end.

In the wake of Hurricane Harvey, Puerto Rico is bracing for the worst of the storm's wrath. The island nation's governor, Ricardo Rossello, said on Thursday that he was "very concerned" about the damage caused by the Category 4 storm.
The government of Florida, which is in the midst of a massive rebuilding effort after Hurricane Maria devastated the Caribbean island of Dominica in September, has said it is prepared to deal with the aftermath of Irma. "We are very concerned," Gov. Rick Scott said in a statement, adding that the state of emergency was in "excellent condition." The governor said the government would continue to work with federal, state and local authorities to assess damage and assess the extent of damage to the island's infrastructure. He also called on the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to provide "all necessary assistance and resources" to help the islands recover from the effects of Harvey and Irma, as well as to ensure the safety of residents and businesses in affected areas. President Donald Trump has called for a "total and complete recovery" of all affected islands, including the British Virgin Islands, the Bahamas, Turks and Caicos Islands and St. Croix. In a tweet, Trump said: "I'm very worried about what will happen to our islands and our people if we don't get the help we need. I'm extremely concerned about our island," he said. 'We have a lot of work ahead of us, and we will do everything we can to make sure that we are able to get this island back on its feet.' The US Congress is expected to vote on a resolution on Wednesday, Sept. 12, to allow the federal government to begin the process of declaring a national emergency in response to Hurricane Jose, a Category 5 storm that killed at least 17 people and injured more than 1,500. US President Barack Obama has also said he is "deeply concerned that this is going to be a very difficult situation for our country," according to a White House statement. On Thursday, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said President Trump's administration had "serious concerns" over the hurricane's impact on Florida and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Speaking to reporters in Washington, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and New Mexico, President Obama said his administration would "take all necessary action" in responding to Irma and Maria, but he did not rule out the possibility of an emergency declaration in Florida or Georgia, or any other state. Both states have been hit hard by hurricanes in recent years. Last week, British Prime Minister David Cameron announced that Britain would be sending $1.5 billion in aid to aid the devastated islanders, while the United States would send $500 million to assist in rebuilding efforts. Meanwhile, French President Edouard Philippe said that France and Germany would also be contributing $200 million in disaster aid, with a total of $50 million set aside for disaster relief in each country. However, in an interview with CNN's "New York Times," French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said there were "no guarantees" that any aid will be available to those affected by Irma or Maria. France, Germany, Britain and France have all expressed concern about Harvey's effects on their economies and their ability to cope with it. But the European Union's foreign minister, Federica Mogherini, warned that "it will take time" for Harvey to pass through their territory and that it would take a while before it could reach the US mainland. Spain, Italy, Spain and Portugal are among those countries that have already sent aid. Portugal, Portugal and Spain have also sent humanitarian aid and have pledged to do the same in their own countries, although the EU has yet to decide whether they will send more aid or more money. Britain has already announced it will also send a $300 million aid package to Haiti and Saint Vincent and other Caribbean islands. It is unclear whether any of these countries will receive any assistance from Spain or Portugal. Spanish President Jose Manuel Barroso has promised to step up his efforts to restore order and order in Haiti. "

Hurricane Irma has continued to pack 300 kph winds as it moves across the Caribbean toward Florida. The record-breaking storm has battered the Bahamas and Cuba, while Hurricane Jose followed in its path.
As one of the Atlantic Ocean's largest storms plowed through the Caribbean, leaving destruction in its wake, residents of the US state of Florida prepared for what could be the worst storm to make landfall in over a century. At least 17 people have been killed and dozens more injured across several island nations in the Caribbean. Irma is expected to be there second major hurricane to make landfall in the United States in less than two weeks. Hurricane Harvey struck Texas last week, killing more than 60 people and displacing roughly 1 million others. In the US territory of Puerto Rico, 1 million people – nearly one-third of the population – lost electricity during the storm, said Puerto Rican Governor Ricardo Rossello. "It will be difficult to estimate how long the power outage will last," Rossello said. Later, officials confirmed that at least two people on the island had been killed by the storm's devastation. Two other major storms have developed in the Caribbean, namely Hurricane Jose and Hurricane Katia. Jose was east of the Lesser Antilles with maximum sustained winds of 120 miles per hour (195 kilometers per hour) as a hurricane watch was in effect for Antigua and Barbuda. Jose has followed the same path as Hurricane Irma, and was upgraded to a Category 4 on Friday by the US National Hurricane Center. Katia has remained relatively static, hovering off the coast of Mexico. Florida on edge Florida Governor Rick Scott said 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain were expected after Irma made landfall at the weekend as he urged evacuations during a press conference on Friday. Nearly 700,000 people have been asked to leave Miami and its surrounding areas. "Today is the day to do the right thing for your family and get inland for safety... Do not ignore evacuation orders. All Floridians should be prepared to evacuate soon," Scott said. Read more: How to reduce risks from mega-storms? "I know many of you are stuck in traffic, I’m sure it’s very frustrating. Evacuations are not convenient but they are absolutely meant to keep you safe," he added. On Friday, US President Donald Trump described Irma as a storm of "absolutely historic destructive potential." Trump also on Friday signed a $15 billion (13.5 billion euro) hurricane relief package passed by Congress, which also raises the debt ceiling and postpones the possibility of a shutdown of government funding until December. Downgraded to an "extremely dangerous" Category 4 but still packing winds of 185 mph (300 kph), Irma moved between the north coast of Cuba and the Bahamas as it neared the Florida Keys and the southern Florida Peninsula.

Amid widening criticism from residents in British territories that not enough was done to safeguard people from the storm, British Foreign Office Minister Alana Duncan said London has sent tents, vehicles and other relief equipment. "Anguilla received the hurricane's full blast. The initial assessment is that the damage has been severe and in places critical," Duncan told the British Parliament.

},{"Generated text": " Angela Merkel's 'Alternative for Germany' takes on Donald Trump
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has launched an anti-Donald Trump campaign. She is the face of a new political party. DW's Kay-Alexander Scholz takes a closer look.
Merkel and her conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) are set to launch a campaign in Berlin on Sunday. The CDU is expected to win a majority in the Bundestag, the lower house of parliament, as well as the European Parliament. In the first half of the campaign, Merkel promised to "make the world a better place" with the help of her party's Social Democrats and the Greens. However, she also promised that she would not allow the US president to enter the race. "I'm not going to let the United States win the election," Merkel told DW in an interview published on Monday. But she did say that the party would be able to make a strong case for itself in Europe, and that it would have to do so in a way that would allow it to compete with other political parties. That's a big step for Merkel, but it's not enough for her to just say "yes" and "no" when it comes to the issue of immigration and refugees. It's also a step that will have a huge impact on the political landscape in Germany, which has seen a number of high-profile cases of migrants fleeing war and persecution in recent years. And it will also have an impact in other European countries, such as Britain, France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece and even the Netherlands. Merkel is not the only one who has made a name for herself in politics. Her party has also made her a key figure in European politics, particularly in relation to foreign policy. As a member of Germany's parliamentary minority government, Chancellor Merkel can be seen as a role model for young people in her country. This is why she has been so vocal about the need for a fair and transparent immigration system, especially in countries where there are so many migrants. There is a lot of pressure on her from the left and right to speak out against the Trump administration. So far, however, it seems to be working. At the same time, there is an increasing amount of support for the Green Party, a party that has a long history of supporting the right-wing populists and who want to see Germany become a more open and democratic society. On the other hand, many of those who have supported Trump's candidacy are not convinced that he will be a good president. Many of them are skeptical of his policies. They don't believe that Trump will win elections in his first 100 days in office. Some of these people are even more skeptical than others. For example, they are more likely to vote for Hillary Clinton than for Trump. What do they think of Trump? What does Trump mean by that? Well, I think it means for them to say, "Well, that's just a question of whether or not they can win in this election." And what does that mean for their own party? Do you think that they should be allowed to run for president? Does it mean that their party won't have any chance of winning a presidential election? Is it possible that a candidate like Trump could win an election in November? The answer is no, because they have no chance. If they do win, then they will not have the chance to get elected to a federal parliament. Or, if they want a chance at the presidency, will they be forced to step down from their positions in government? That is something that is very difficult to predict. I'm sure that there will always be an element of doubt in many people's minds about what is going on in Washington, D.C.'s future. How do you know if Trump is serious about his plans for Europe? You can certainly tell by the way in which he is talking about Europe. He has already said that if he wins, he'll be the most popular president in history. We can only hope that this will lead to some kind of change in how the country is governed. After all, this is what he has done for so long. "
,"Reference text": " Opinion: Yet another crisis for Merkel
A summery turquoise blazer and fresh makeup could not hide the fact that Angela Merkel was "not amused." Now she is needed as a champion in the fight against populist forces, DW's Kay-Alexander Scholz writes.
Britain-EU divorce proceedings will probably last about two years. Until then, the status quo must be maintained, German Chancellor Angela Merkel emphasized in her press statement. If she is no longer chancellor after the upcoming parliamentary elections in 2017, then others will have to live with the consequences of Brexit. But that is not what she is actually thinking. It is not coincidental that foreign ministers and government leaders are visiting Berlin in the coming days. They want to discuss how things will continue. Berlin, under Merkel's chancellorship, has become a center of power outside of Brussels. Difficult international politics The Brexit decision has disrupted Europe's equilibrium. Germany has lost an important ally on European issues related to economic growth and budgetary discipline. Now, France presumably will be the next to raise its voice against Maastricht Treaty criteria. If the Netherlands and Denmark also decide to leave the EU, Germany will become isolated, as Eastern Europe is not as tight with Germany as it once was. Poland now plays a key role for the Balkan nations and the Visegrad Group (Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic and Slovakia). And Poland is still annoyed about Merkel's refugee policy. What about Germany's populists? They're giddy with glee as they feel that their anti-establishment policies have been validated. They are teaching potential AfD (Alternative for Germany) voters a lesson: "Here, have a look: it's possible. There is always an alternative. Vote for us!" Those are exactly the words that protest voters want to hear. Germany's AfD has forged ties with other right-wing parties in Vienna, Paris, The Hague and London. They are all pursuing a "European" plan to gain power. The recent Austrian presidential election was significant, as the populist candidate lost by a very narrow margin; in fact, the final election results are still undecided as they are being contested. The Brexit vote was also triggered by populist powers. Domestically difficult Many populists believe that the stronger populism becomes - no matter where - the more advantages there would be for individual parties of their persuasion. Many would also like to see Donald Trump as US president. That is how AfD may become even stronger in Germany, which also means that political majorities would fluctuate even more. Will there be enough seats after the next election for a Christian Democrat and Green coalition, or will yet another grand coalition made up of Christian Democrats and Social Democrats be formed? Can Angela Merkel change course? Can she counter the trend with a new political model in Europe and Germany? Or do we stand on the edge of a new era, a "political revolution," as the AfD calls it? Until now, Europe has survived attacks on its currency (euro crisis), the principle of peaceful coexistence (Crimea crisis) and its open borders policy (refugee crisis). Merkel deserves credit for defending these values, despite mistakes that have been made along the way. The outcome of the Brexit crisis is, however, still open. Have something to say? Add your comments below. "

German Chancellor Angela Merkel has called on the US president to step down from his post as head of the country's Christian Democrat Party.
Merkel has said she will continue to lead the conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) in the German parliament. The CDU leader, Helmut Kohl, said on Sunday that he would not resign. "I am not going to resign," Merkel said in a statement, adding that she would seek a second term in office. Merkel, who has been Germany's chancellor since 2005, has also called for an end to the "war on terror" in Germany, which has seen the death of millions of people in recent years. She also said that the EU should not be forced to accept the results of a referendum on whether or not the bloc should be allowed to form a new government. Chancellor Merkel is also expected to seek an extension of her coalition government in Berlin, a move that has already been criticized by some in her own party as a "disgrace to Germany." "We have to work together to make sure that Germany is a better place for the future of Europe," she said, referring to Berlin's reunification with Germany after the fall of Berlin Wall in 1989. But she also warned that it would be "difficult" for her to stay in power long enough to be able to get the job done. A number of German media outlets reported that Merkel was considering resigning from her post in order to focus on her new role as German Chancellor. In a report published Sunday, German daily Bild am Sonntag quoted Merkel as saying: "It is not possible for me to go back to my post." The paper cited unnamed sources who said Merkel had decided to leave the party because she did not want to risk losing her position as chancellor. It was not immediately clear whether the chancellor would stay on, however, as she had said earlier this month that her decision to quit was "unprecedented" and "not only unprecedented, but it is unprecedented for a chancellor to take such a decision." Merkel and her party's coalition partner, the Christian Democratic Union, have said they will not accept a change in leadership until the end of this year, when she is due to run for re-election as party leader in September. Read more: Merkel calls on US to end 'war against terror' in Europe Merkel says she has no plans to give up her job as Chancellor of Germany The German chancellor has faced criticism over her handling of foreign policy during the past two years, saying she was unable to find a way to deal with the crisis in Ukraine and Syria. However, she acknowledged that there was a need to do more to combat the threat posed by the Russian-backed "Islamic State" (IS), which she described as "a threat to our national security." In an interview with German news magazine "Die Welt" on Saturday, Merkel told the magazine that "it is very difficult" to win the election because "there are so many people who are afraid of losing their jobs and who don't know what their future holds." She added that many of those who have lost their job because of their political views are "very disillusioned" with what they see as the current state of affairs in their country. Her comments came after a meeting with US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Friday in which the two leaders discussed the possibility of an "end of war" between Germany and the United States. Clinton's visit to Washington comes just days after German President Barack Obama visited Washington, D.C. to visit the White House for talks on a possible US-German trade deal. Obama has promised to hold a summit with Merkel in Washington next week to discuss the issue of trade with China. Trump has repeatedly said he wants to see a deal struck with Beijing to ease tensions between Washington and Beijing on trade. He has not yet said whether he is willing to sign a trade pact with either China or Russia. What's next for Merkel? The chancellor is set to attend a NATO summit in Brussels later this week, according to her spokesman. "
,"Reference text": " Reports: Merkel to run for fourth term as German chancellor
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has confirmed that she will stand for the chancellery in the 2017 election, German media reports. The Christian Democrat Leader (CDU) first took office in 2005.
After months of speculation, German Chancellor Angela Merkel reportedly told her fellow Christian Democrats (CDU) in Berlin on Sunday that she is prepared to lead the party into next year's election. An official statement is expected from Merkel at 7 p.m. local time (1800 UTC) on Sunday. The 62-year-old has faced a number of difficulties in recent months, from criticism over her handling of the migration crisis to falling support amid a rise in right-wing populist sentiment. Since taking office in 2005, however, Merkel has also been praised for navigating Europe's largest economy through the financial and eurozone crises. According to an Emnid survey published in the German newspaper "Bild am Sonntag" 55 percent of Germans are in favor of Merkel remaining head of the German government for another four years. Thirty-nine percent said they were against her re-election. Sign of stability Should she be elected next September, another full four-year term would put Merkel on a par with her mentor Helmut Kohl who set the post-war record and presided over the Fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. In light of the UK's shock vote to leave the European Union in June and Donald Trump's election last week as US president, Merkel's re-election is likely to be welcomed in many capitals as a sign of stability. During his final visit to Berlin this week, US President Barack Obama said that if he were able to, he would vote for his longtime partner and friend. In an interview with German magazine "Spiegel" and broadcaster "ARD," Obama said: "She has great credibility, and she is willing to fight for those values in a way that is very, very important." "I'm glad that she's there and I think the German people should appreciate her. Certainly, I've appreciated her as a partner." Winning back votes With the less that a year until Germany heads to the polls, Merkel's CDU is now turning its efforts to wooing back disenchanted voters who have left the conservative camp to support the right-wing populists, Alternative for Germany (AfD). Formed as a Euro-sceptic party in 2013, the AfD won 4.7 percent of the popular vote in the last federal elections in 2013, just falling short of the 5 percent threshold required to enter the Bundestag - Germany's lower house of parliament. After benefiting from the rise in europsceptic, anti-immigration sentiment, seemingly sweeping across western Europe, the party now holds seats in nine of Germany's 16 states. "

The NFL announced on Monday that it will host the 2018 season opener at Wembley Stadium in London. It's the first time the league has hosted the event in more than a decade.
NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell announced that the NFL would host Sunday's game against the London-based Detriot Lions as part of its "Super Bowl weekend" festivities. The announcement came just hours before the start of the pre-game kick-off, which will be broadcast live on NBC's "Today" show on the network. "We're going to have a great time," Goodell said in a statement, adding that he was "deeply impressed" with the Ravens' performance. He also said the team would be "very excited" about the possibility of a return to the field in 2018. New England Patriots head coach Robert Kraft has been in attendance at the stadium for the past two years, but has yet to make a decision on whether or not to bring Colin Kaepernick back as a member of his 49ers team. Kraft, a former NFL executive, has said he will not bring back Kaepernick, who was fired by the New York Jets in protest of President Donald Trump's decision to fire him after the national anthem was played during the 2016 NFL season. Trump has also called for a boycott of NFL games in the US, saying he would not be able to afford the costs of such a move. In a tweet, Trump said: "I don't think we should be boycotting this game. I think it's a shame that we have to go through this again." The Ravens, meanwhile, said they would play the Atlanta Falcons in their home game on Sunday in order to avoid a potential boycott. However, they have already said that they won't take part in any such boycott, and they are not planning to do so until the season is over. Meanwhile, the White House has called on NFL owners to step down from their positions in light of reports that President Trump is considering firing the head of football's governing body, NFLPA, as well as the National Football League (NFLPA) and the NBA, in an attempt to prevent a repeat of last year's debacle. Golden State Warriors star Stephen Curry is expected to be back in action Sunday night in Las Vegas, where he is set to play in his first NFL game since joining the Warriors in 2016. According to multiple reports, Curry's return could be a key factor in determining the outcome of Sunday’s game between the two teams. If the Browns and Ravens are to win, it could mean the end of their two-year playoff drought, according to a report from the Washington Post. That would mean a loss of at least one NFL team, if not all of them, including the Cleveland Browns, would lose their playoff hopes. But the Baltimore Ravens would still have the opportunity to host a game in which their star running back is a free agent. They would also be in line to receive a contract extension if they want to stay in football for another year. And they could also get a chance to sign a long-term extension to their contract with a team that has struggled in recent years. After all, this is the same team they signed when they were in San Francisco, San Diego and Dallas, respectively, last season, before moving on to other teams in 2015. So far, that hasn't been the case. As far as NFL teams are concerned, there are no plans to move on from Kaepernick's contract, even if it means losing a few more games. On Sunday, however, one of those teams is still in contention to join the playoffs, although it is unclear whether that will happen at all. NFL Commissioner Rob Manfred has already made it clear that his team is not interested in playing in another league. Instead, he said, "It's up to us to decide if we want a new team or whether we're willing to give it a shot." That's not a bad thing, given the fact that a lot of teams have been talking about bringing in new players to fill the void left by Kaepernick. There are a number of reasons why that could happen. First of all: The NFL has not yet decided on a replacement for former general manager Steve Bisciotti, whose contract is up for renegotiation. Second: There's still the question of who will take over the role of team president. Third: How long will it take to get the job done? In the absence of an interim president, President-elect Trump will have no choice but to appoint a permanent replacement. "

Baltimore Ravens and Jacksonsville Jaguars players "took a knee" during the national anthem after Trump urged fans to boycott football matches. The kneeling protest, to highlight social injustice, has stepped up a gear.
Hundreds of National Football League (NFL) stars protested President Donald Trump's call for fans to boycott the league by refusing to stand for the US national anthem this weekend, starting Sunday's game between the Baltimore Ravens and Jacksonsville Jaguars. A number of other players locked arms in solidarity ahead of the game at Wembley Stadium in London. Jacksonville Jaguars' owner Shahid Khan, who last year donated one million dollars (840,000 euros) to the Trump campaign, locked his arms with players - a rare scene, as owners almost never take to the field. US media reported that about 200 players on Sunday sat, knelt or raised their fists in defiance of Trump's comments. In one of the most memorable moments, singer Rico LaVelle took a knee and held up a fist at the last line of the Star Spangled Banner ahead of the game between the Detriot Lions and Atlanta Falcons. The protest came in response to Trump's tweets on Sunday morning urging fans to boycott NFL games to pressure the league into firing or suspending players to kneel in protest during the national anthem. In an early morning tweet, Trump posted: "If NFL fans refuse to go to games until players stop disrespecting our Flag and Country, you will see change take place fast. Fire or suspend!" "NFL attendance and ratings are WAY DOWN. Boring games yes, but many stay away because they love our country. League should back US," he added. Later, the president said that his rant "has nothing to do with race," despite the fact that the origins of the protest are to do with police brutality against minorities, especially African Americans. Trump said his comments were instead about "respect for our country and respect for our flag." Trump's spat with US professional sports began at a Republican rally in Alabama on Friday, when the president attacked activist NFL players for kneeling or sitting during the national anthem, labelling them as "sons of bitches." "Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, 'Get that son of a bitch off the field right now... he is fired'?" Trump told a crowd of cheering supporters. That day, basketball star Stephen Curry, the top player for California's Golden State Warriors, announced that he would not be attending a traditional White House reception honoring the National Basketball Association champions. The kneeling protest was started by former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick who refused to stand for the anthem back in 2016. Kaepernick's gesture came amid a spate of deadly police shootings of black men and was aimed at drawing more attention to treatment of minorities in the US. However, Kaepernick has since become a free agent, after failing to be signed by a new team for the new NFL season. NFL executives decry Trump's calls Trump also drew the ire of senior NFL executives and team owners. Responding to Trump's tweets, Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti, said he "100 percent" supported his players' decision to kneel during the anthem. Robert Kraft, the owner of the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots, who is also a close friend of Trump, said in a statement on Sunday that he was deeply disappointed by the president's comments in Alabama. Kraft defended players' rights to "peacefully affect social change and raise awareness in a manner that they feel is most impactful," and said that sports were a unifying force in the US. "Our political leaders could learn a lot from the lessons of teamwork and working together toward a common goal," he said. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, who has taken much of the heat for Kaepernick's failure to find a new team, was also quick to condemn Trump's comments. Read more: NFL player's refusal to stand for national anthem ignites online controversy "The NFL and our players are at our best when we help create a sense of unity in our country and our culture," Goodell said.

Denouncing Trump's remarks, Goodell said: "Divisive comments like these demonstrate an unfortunate lack of respect for the NFL, our great game and all of our players, and a failure to understand the overwhelming force for good our clubs and players represent in our communities." But Trump hit back later on Sunday at a worsening furore, saying the row "has nothing to do with race." Instead, he said: "This has to do with respect for our country, and respect for our flag." At least seven NFL team owners donated at least $1 million each to Trump's presidential campaign last year. They include the owners of the New York Jets, New England Patriots, Dallas Cowboys, Washington Redskins, Jacksonville Jaguars, Houston Texans, Los Angeles Rams and Tampa "

A German military commander has died in a battle with the Soviet Union. He was 82 years old.
The battle between the Nazis and the Soviets took place at the Buchenswald concentration camp in southern Germany in the summer of 1945. It was the last battle of World War II, which ended with Germany's liberation from the Nazi regime. The battle was fought in front of thousands of German soldiers, who had been sent to the concentration camps as part of an anti-communist uprising. In the end, the Germans were victorious, but the Americans won the war. "It was a great victory for our country," Volker Knigsge said in an interview with German news agency Welt am Sonntag, adding that he was "very proud" of what he had achieved. However, he added that the battle would not be over until after the fall of Berlin in 1945, when he would no longer be able to carry out his duties as a commander in his own army. 'We're not going to give up' "We don't want to lose the fight," Knigl said, referring to his military career as one in which he served as an officer and later as chief of staff. But he also said that it was important for him to continue to fight for his country's interests, and that this was something he wanted to do as long as he could. So he decided to take up the challenge of fighting for the future of Germany and for himself and his family. At the time of his death, his wife and three children were living with him. They had just returned from a trip to Germany, where they were reunited with their father and mother. Now they have a son, a daughter and a grandchild. Their father is a doctor and their mother is an actress. His wife is also a nurse and he has two young daughters. Both of them have been married for more than a decade and have two sons. While the two have no children, they share a common interest in each other and are very close to one another. As a result, their relationship has developed over the past few years and they are now close friends and neighbors. This is something that has not been lost on them for a long time. When they first met, there was no one to talk to about what was going on in their lives. There was only one problem: they didn't have enough money to buy a house. That's why they couldn't afford to pay the rent. And that's because they had no money at all, so they just had to sell their house and move on to something else. What's next for them? They have to find a way to make ends meet. If they can't find the money they want, then they will be forced to leave the country and go back to their families. For them, it's not worth it to live on the streets and work on their own. Not only do they not have money but they also have very little time to think about their future. Since the beginning of WWII, Germany has had a lot of problems with poverty and unemployment. Many of these problems are exacerbated by the fact that there are so many young people who are unable to afford a decent education or a good job. These problems can only be solved by working hard and doing the right thing. One of those problems is the lack of money. You can see that in our society, we have so much money that we cannot do anything about it. We need more money and we need to spend it on education and health care, not just on our own." This has led to an increase in unemployment in Germany. Unemployment has also increased in recent years, as the number of unemployed people has fallen to a record low of 3.5 percent. According to statistics compiled by The Economist, unemployment has risen to 4.6 percent, compared to 1.7 percent in 1990. With this in mind, this is still a big problem for many Germans. Even though the unemployment rate is low, people are still struggling to get by. "
,"Reference text": " Buchenwald: Lessons from past and present
75 years ago in July, 1937, the concentration camp Buchenwald was built near the city of Weimar. The memorial there today draws people from around the world, and its program has seen some shifts in recent years.
Once a favorite area for hiking and vacationing, Buchenwald was transformed in 1937 into a site designed to annihilate people. Beyond clusters of trees, a valley opens up, dotted today by one or two villages. Back then, the cold and windy north side of the valley was set aside for Buchenwald's prisoners, and the more comfortable climate on the southern side was reserved for the guards and camp directors. An open secret "The camp was no secret," noted historian Ronald Hirte during a visit to the grounds. Everyone could have seen Buchenwald from below, he said, because the surrounding forest was not as thick as it is today. Buchenwald was situated about five kilometers (3 miles) from the city of Weimar. Among local residents, its existence was an uncomfortable fact. The concentration camp was a place of horrors that people in the cultural and political focal point of Weimar wanted to know nothing about. "But many local companies did very well thanks to the work of the prisoners," Hirte said. Thousands of people from throughout Europe were deported to the camp beginning in 1937, and they were forced to march from Weimar to Buchenwald. Later the city was connected with the camp by a railway built by the prisoners, who also built a service road still called today by its original name: Blutstraße - literally, Blood Street.On a now barren and empty spot on the hill, prisoners had to gather each morning and night for a role call that could last hours. A gateway bearing the words "Jedem das Seine" (Translated literally: "To each his own," but figuratively: "Everyone will get what he deserves.") still stands, along with bunkers and the dark and musty rooms in which Nazi guards tortured and murdered the prisoners. Bringing the present into focus It is not uncommon for 20 groups of young people to visit the memorial on a given day. "Interest continues to grow, and so does the number of visitors," said Hirte. It is now Germany's third and fourth post-war generations that can come to ask questions here and learn what happened. The memorial offers a wide-ranging educational program. But the point is not to moralize and point fingers into the past, said the director of the memorial, Volkhard Knigge: "We want to direct questions of contemporary society toward the past." More concretely, that means that issues including human rights violations, persecution, right-wing extremism and nationalism are taken up as contemporary topics against the historical background of the Holocaust. "Today, that is our central historical, political, and ethical educational task," Knigge said. During a recent visit, two 14-year-old boys sat in front of a plaque listing the home countries of former prisoners. "We are here with our school, and our teacher just showed us around. Now we have a couple of assignments to do - for example, finding out where the prisoners were from and how many lived here," one boy explained. Watching them, it is apparent that this is not just a routine field trip. There is a bit of horsing around when the school groups first arrive, but silence and solemnity are the norm once students pass by the execution chambers and furnaces used to incinerate bodies. There are also groups from Poland, Russia and the USA in attendance. One American student relates that her grandfather was among those who helped liberate Buchenwald but that he never spoke about the experience. No "trite effects" Addressing questions about what should be shown today, how the site should be commentated, what is authentic and credible - and what isn't - forms the core of the work done by the memorial's team. The administration has generally tried to avoid reconstructing what Buchenwald might have been like. "We don't want to create any trite effects," said Ronald Hirte. "The noisiness and narrowness of this place, how terrible the smell was - we could never convey that to visitors today anyway." The memorial's head said that Buchenwald has become a model for other countries around the world - in a partnership sense rather than in a presumptuous way. "Everywhere in the world, in South America, Rwanda, South Africa, Hungary, in the former Yugoslavia, there are people examining and dealing with their history. We support and encourage them in their search for ways to honor and respect victims without concealing the horrors of what happened," he said. Asking why In recent years, other less visible groups have been added to the list of those memorialized. Alongside Jewish victims, politically persecuted individuals of various nationalities, Soviet prisoners of war and Roma and Sinti people, the grounds now also house "

The head of the EU's border agency has warned that Turkey could face "serious consequences" for its actions in Syria.
German Interior Minister Ahmet Davutolgu warned on Thursday that the bloc was "deeply concerned" by Turkey's actions. "We are deeply concerned," he told reporters after a meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Brussels. The German interior minister said Turkey had "gravely worried" about the country's security situation, adding that it would be "extremely dangerous" if Turkey continued to use its military force against Syrian rebels. He also warned Turkey against using chemical weapons against its own citizens, warning that such attacks could lead to the death of thousands of civilians in the region. Turkey has denied the allegations, saying it was only acting in self-defense. Erdogan, however, said he was not aware of any imminent threat to Germany's national security, which he called "a very serious threat." "Turkey is very concerned about its security," Erdogan said at a news conference after the meeting, according to a statement released by the Turkish foreign ministry. Ankara has said it will not allow the use of chemical agents against the Syrian opposition. Turkish officials have also said they would not be able to carry out airstrikes on Syrian targets. However, Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said on Wednesday that Ankara would cooperate with the European Union in its fight against Islamic State (IS, formerly known as ISIS) and other terrorist groups. Germany, Turkey and the United States have agreed to cooperate in fighting IS, but Turkey is not a signatory to any of these agreements. In the past, the two countries have been at odds over how to deal with IS attacks, with Turkey accusing the US of being a "terrorist state" and Russia accusing Ankara of supporting IS. Last week, Ankara accused Turkey of violating the terms of an arms embargo on Syria, a charge Ankara denies. But Turkey denies the accusations and says it has no reason to believe that IS is responsible for the attacks. Read more: Turkey threatens to fire up Syria's air defense system in retaliation for US air strikes on its border with Syria The Turkish government has accused Germany of using excessive force in response to attacks by IS militants. It has also accused Berlin of not doing enough to stop the flow of weapons into Syria and has threatened to impose sanctions on Ankara if it fails to do so. At the same time, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has called on Turkey to step up its anti-IS campaign against IS and warned Ankara to "use all available tools to defeat IS." In a speech delivered at the end of Thursday's meeting in Berlin, Merkel said she hoped Turkey would take steps to prevent IS from using its deadly chemical weapon against Kurdish fighters. She also called for an end to its "war on terror," which has killed at least 1,000 people since the beginning of this year.

,"Reference text": " Turkey, Greece seek NATO mission in Aegean, says German official
Germany, Greece and Turkey will ask NATO to approve a maritime surveillance mission in the Aegean to combat illegal people smugglers. Greece had previously voiced reservations about the proposal.
The proposed mission to be discussed at a NATO defense ministers meeting in Brussels on Thursday comes days after German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutolgu said they would raise the issue of refugees with the Alliance. According to a Reuters report citing a senior German official, initially reticent Greece has now given the green light for the operation, which could see NATO assets deployed in the Aegean in a mostly intelligence and reconnaissance role. Under the proposal, which would need to be approved by Alliance members, NATO maritime assets would provide information to national coastguards and the EU border agency Frontex to combat illegal smugglers using rickety boats to bring migrants to Europe. Turkey would then take back the refugees, as envisioned as part of a 3 billion-euro ($3.2 billion) EU-Turkey deal agreed to last year. According to German sources, the mission would not be similar to the NATO mission in the Mediterranean intercepting migrant boats making the dangerous run from Libya to Italy. However, NATO ships could intervene in emergency situations to save passengers. "It is not NATO's remit to push back or stop refugee boats," the official told Reuters. The mission would use assets from the Alliance's standing naval group, a permanent reaction force deployed in the Mediterranean. The naval group's current flagship is the German combat support ship "Bonn." Denmark has already said it would provide additional ships to the mission, according to the official. However, it is unclear whether NATO members will approve the mission which may fall outside the bounds of the Alliance's mandate. Complicating matters is a long-running maritime dispute between Greece and Turkey over sovereignty in the Aegean, where the two NATO members' jets regularly engage in dogfights. Turkey has taken in more than 2.5 million Syrian refugees, and is a major transit point for migrants from Asia and Africa. More than a million migrants and refugees reached Europe last year, many making the dangerous boat journey from Turkey to Greece by boat. So far this year, more than 340 have perished in the cold waters trying to reach Europe. cw/msh (AFP, dpa, Reuters) "

The US State Department is to meet with Israeli Foreign Minister Ron Prosor on Tuesday to discuss the situation in the Gaza Strip. Kerry will attend the meeting, which is scheduled to take place at the United Nations in New York on Wednesday.
US State Secretary for Foreign Affairs and Middle East Affairs, Kerry, will hold a two-day meeting with Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Cairo on Thursday. The meeting is expected to be attended by Israeli and Palestinian leaders, as well as the heads of state of Israel and the Palestinian Authority (PA). The two leaders will also hold talks on the future of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, according to a statement released by the White House. "The United States will continue to work closely with the international community on this issue," Kerry said, adding that he was "deeply encouraged" by Netanyahu's willingness to cooperate with international efforts to broker a peace deal in Gaza. US President Barack Obama is set to visit Israel next week for the first time since taking office in January. Obama's trip to Israel comes just a few days after the US announced that it would not be sending troops to Gaza in a bid to stop the flow of Palestinian refugees to the West Bank. Israel has said it will not send troops, but it has not ruled out the possibility of doing so. Last week, Obama said he would be "very interested" in holding talks with Netanyahu on a Palestinian-Israeli peace plan. However, US officials said they were not optimistic about the chances of such a deal being reached, and that the two sides would have to reach an agreement before the end of this year. Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman, who has been leading the negotiations, said in an interview with Reuters that Israel was not ready to give up its sovereignty over the territory. Lieberman said Israel had "no choice" but to accept the terms of an interim peace accord with Hamas, a group that has ruled Gaza since the 1967 Six-Day War, in which the Palestinians won the right to self-determination, was a "non-starter" for Israel. Netanyahu, Lieberman and other Israeli officials have called for an end to Israeli military occupation of Gaza, saying it is an "illegal occupation." The Israeli government has refused to recognize Hamas as a legitimate state, while the Hamas leadership has insisted that Hamas must be allowed to live in its territory without Israeli approval. In an apparent attempt to avoid a military confrontation, Netanyahu has called on Israel to withdraw its troops from Gaza and to allow Hamas to continue its military operations. He has also said that Israeli forces should be able to carry out attacks on civilian targets, such as hospitals, schools, hospitals and schools. But Kerry's visit to Cairo comes at a time of heightened tensions between Washington and Tel Aviv over a possible escalation of violence between Israelis and Palestinians. On Tuesday, Israeli President Ashraf Ghani said his country was ready for a new round of peace talks, although he did not elaborate on what that would entail. jm/msh (AP, AFP, dpa, Reuters, AP) pfd/dpa (AFP, DPA) Editor: David Zalubowski, The Associated Press, pjd (Reuters, EFE, RIA Novosti, EPA, wire services) contributed to this report. It is not clear whether Kerry is referring to an imminent Israeli attack on Gaza or whether he's referring specifically to military action against Hamas. If he is, however, referring directly to what he sees as an Israeli provocation, he could not comment on whether or not Israel is prepared to respond to such an attack. According to US intelligence officials, the threat posed by Hamas is "unprecedented." "We are not going to tolerate any kind of provocation from Hamas," Netanyahu said. Hamas has repeatedly denied any involvement in any such attack and said the group has no plans to attack Israel, despite the fact that its forces have been engaged in several attacks in recent months. Meanwhile, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has vowed to "fight back" against Israel if it continues to use its nuclear weapons against Gaza's Hamas-led government. "

US Secretary of State John Kerry is due in Cairo to push for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas as the death toll in Gaza surpasses 500. Israel's army said several militants were killed after tunneling into Israel.
Secretary of State John Kerry is due to arrive in Cairo on Monday where he is expected to urge Hamas to accept a cease-fire agreement offered by Egypt that would halt nearly two weeks of fighting with Israel. Meanwhile, the death toll in Gaza continues to rise. Medics on Monday said the number of Palestinian deaths in Gaza has risen to more than 501 since fighting intensified on Jul 8. Most of the dead are civilians. On the Israeli side, 13 soldiers were killed inside Gaza on Sunday, raising the number of soldiers killed since a ground operation began late on Thursday to 18. Two Israeli civilians also died in mortar and rocket attacks. The Israeli army said that more than 10 militants from Gaza were shot dead on Monday after infiltrating southern Israel. According to army spokespeople, two squads of militants were killed after tunneling into Israel. Israel's UN ambassador Ron Prosor, meanwhile, denied a claim by Hamas that an Israeli soldier had been kidnapped by the Islamist group, saying: "Those rumurs are untrue." US President Barack Obama expressed concern about the rising death toll of civilians in a telephone call Sunday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, according to a White House statement. The US State Department confirmed late Sunday that two US citizens were killed in Gaza violence and released their names, but did not immediately disclose their occupations. US media reported, however, that the two were American members of the Israeli Defense Force, citing relatives and friends. "We can confirm the deaths of US citizens Max Steinberg and Sean Carmeli in Gaza," spokesperson Jen Psaki said in a two-sentence statement. Late Sunday, the United Nations Security Council in New York held urgent talks on the conflict, and expressed "serious concern about the growing numbers of casualties."

Syrian President Bashar Assad has been accused of using chemical weapons against his own people. The Turkish government has denied the accusations. But experts say that's not the case at all.
The Syrian president has repeatedly denied allegations that he used chemical agents to attack civilians in the country's civil war. However, a German expert on Syria says that the allegations are not true. "The accusations are completely false," Volker Perthes, director of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs in Berlin, told DW in an interview. In fact, he said, the claims are "completely false." "There is no evidence whatsoever that Assad is responsible for the deaths of civilians," he added, referring to the fact that many of those killed were civilians. He also said that there was "no evidence" of a chemical weapon being used against the Syrian people, adding that it was only a matter of time before Assad's regime was overthrown by the Turkish military, which had been in control of Syria since the fall of its capital, Aleppo, in March 2011. This is not a new development, but it is the latest development in a series of events that have taken place over the past few months. There have been a number of developments in recent weeks, including the emergence of new allegations of chemical attacks on civilians and the rise of pro-government militias in northern Syria. At the same time, there have also been reports of an increase in anti-Islamic State (IS) attacks in eastern Syria, as well as a rise in suicide bombings in southern Syria and northern Iraq, according to a report from the International Crisis Group (ICG). In addition to these developments, Turkey has also accused Syria's government of being a "terrorist state" and of supporting the Assad regime in its fight against IS. These accusations, however, have not been proven to be true, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has rejected them as "absurd." The latest accusations come as Turkey's foreign minister, Guido Westerwelle, has called for an end to Syrian government forces' involvement in fighting the rebels, saying that they have no legal basis to do so. Meanwhile, Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu has warned that Turkey will not be able to intervene militarily if it wants to protect its own citizens. On the other hand, German Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, who is also a member of Germany's cabinet of foreign ministers, called on Turkey to step up its support for Syrian President Assad. According to DW, "Turkey is a terrorist state and should not interfere with the rule of law." In a statement issued on Thursday, Erdogan said he would "not interfere" with any negotiations between the two sides. His comments came after a meeting with German foreign ministry officials in Ankara, where Turkish officials said they would not discuss the issue. Erdogan's comments come at a time of heightened tensions between Ankara and Washington over a possible US-led military intervention in Syrian territory. Ankara has accused Washington of playing a role in supporting Assad, while Washington has said it has no intention of doing so at this time.

,"Reference text": " A borderline war
The crisis in Syria is in danger of drawing in neighboring countries. Despite the Syrian government's immediate apology, the shelling on the Turkish border has led to concerns about possible escalation.
These weren't the first incidents on the Syrian-Turkish border, but the fact that several people on the Turkish side were killed by Syrian shells on Wednesday (03.10.2012) has brought the conflict between the two countries to a new level. It has led the Turkish military to retaliate for the first time. Several people were killed when Turkey shelled Syrian territory. But neither Turkey, which is a member of NATO, nor Syria would benefit from a broader conflict. An adviser to the Turkish president tweeted, "Turkey has no interest in a war with Syria." Volker Perthes, director of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs in Berlin, agrees: "Assad has no interest in an escalation," he told DW. "That can be seen from the fact that the Syrian information minister apologized and expressed his regret over the victims immediately after the attack on Turkish territory." Perthes doesn't think it's likely that the Syrian President, Bashar Assad, wants to provoke Turkey to intervene in Syria. "That would only accelerate the fall of his regime," he said. It's not yet clear who was responsible for the shelling. According to Syria's ally, Russia, it was a "tragic accident." Relationship damaged The armed incidents on the Syrian-Turkish border have been going on for months. According to Amnesty International, some 300,000 Syrians have left their country since the start of the uprising against Assad, and many of them have fled to Turkey. The relationship between the two countries, which used to be close, has deteriorated dramatically, and the Turkish government is now openly supporting the Syrian opposition. "Turkey is itself a player in the Syrian conflict," said Perthes. "It provides shelter for many refugees and it's through Turkey that supplies come for the opposition." NATO has lined up behind Turkey and told Syria to end its "flagrant violations of international law." Call for 'great discretion' The German chancellor, Angel Merkel, has also positioned herself alongside Turkey. "We call on all parties to show great discretion," she said in Berlin. The foreign minister, Guido Westerwelle, declared that everything must be done to deescalate the situation, so that the Syrian conflict did not turn into a conflagration in the region. Indeed, the Syrian crisis is not only spreading to Turkey, but also to Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon. According to Perthes, "The neighboring countries are partly victims and partly instigators. Jordan too has taken in refugees and supplies the rebels. On the other hand, Iraq has tended to support the government of Bashar Assad." Even so, he said, all the neighboring countries had an interest in ensuring the conflict was confined to Syria. Appeal to the international community But the number of Syrian refugees is rising by the day. Ruth Jüttner, a Middle East expert with Amnesty International, believes this will continue in future months. "It's important that the countries bordering on Syria are supported by the international community in providing accommodation, medical and psychological care and schooling for children," she told DW. It's an appeal she directs especially to European countries. The shelling on the Syrian-Turkish border has made it more likely that there will be armed conflict between Syria and its neighbors. According to Perthes, "It's probably the case that political resistance in Turkey to intervention in Syria is decreasing right now." "

The Libyan government has declared a state of emergency in the eastern city of Fajr, killing at least 82 people and wounding more than 100.
Libyan President Abdullah al-Thinni has died at the age of 82. He was the youngest person to die in Libya's civil war since the end of the war in 2011. His death came less than a year after he was overthrown by pro-Western forces loyal to the former dictator Moammar Gaddafi. At the time of his death, the GNC, which controls the country's capital, Tripoli, was still in power. The UN has said that the death toll could reach as many as 1,000. It is not yet clear how many more people have been killed, but it is believed to be much higher than the official figure of around 2,500. There is also speculation that some of those killed have died in clashes with security forces. In a statement released by the UN on Thursday, Libya said it had killed over 100 people. "We are still trying to determine the exact number of people who died," the statement said, adding that it was not possible to confirm the figure. Libyan officials have said they had no information on the deaths. They have also denied that there were any reports of civilian casualties. However, they said there was no evidence of any deaths or injuries during the fighting. Gaddafi's regime has denied any responsibility for the killings, saying that he had ordered the killing of civilians and that his regime was in "total control." "The regime is in complete control," Gaddafi said at a news conference in Tripoli on Wednesday, referring to his government as the "GNC." Gaddafi was killed in a shootout with anti-aircraft firemen in February 2011, according to a UN report. Libya has been in turmoil since then, with the army and the armed forces fighting each other for years. Last year, Gaddafi died of a heart attack in Tobruk, a city in eastern Libya that was hit by a series of rocket attacks. NATO said the attack was carried out by "terrorists" and "armed and trained by armed groups." The United Nations has called for an end to all attacks on civilians, including those who are suspected of being behind the attacks, as well as an investigation into possible links between the Libyan regime and al Qaeda. UN envoy for Libya, Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, told reporters in Geneva last week that "it is impossible to predict what will happen when the regime returns to power." He also said he would not rule out the possibility of an armed uprising against the government, although he did not say whether that would be the case. But he also warned that a military coup could take place in Benghazi, where Gaddafi had been based for many years, and urged the international community to prepare for a possible military intervention. 'We will not allow this to happen,' he said. Read more: Libya: What is the next step for Gaddafi? The Libyan revolution is a long way from being over and Gaddafi is still alive and well. As a result, there is no doubt that Gaddafi will be able to continue to rule Libya as long as he is alive, even if he has to step down from his post as prime minister. That is, until the new government is sworn in as president of Libya. And that is exactly what Libya is going to have to do in order to achieve its goal of becoming a democratic state. After all, it has never been a country that has ever had a president who was democratically elected. Since the fall of Gaddafi, no one has seen a leader who could be trusted to carry out his duties as head of state without fear of reprisals from the outside world. So far, that hasn't happened. What has happened to Gaddafi has not been the same since he took over. Now, however, things are looking up for his successor, who will have a chance to take over the reins of power once he leaves office next year. Author: David K. Kuebler Editor: Michael Siegel "

After two days of peace talks in Geneva, a tentative ceasefire has been called in the restive North African country. Although they sent no representatives to Switzerland, Islamists have agreed to halt the fighting.
The Islamist-backed militia alliance that took over Tripoli and installed its own government announced a ceasefire on Friday, following a breakthrough in Geneva-based peace talks. Despite not attending the UN-brokered meeting, the militias have agreed to "a ceasefire on all fronts," according to a statement issued by Islamist group Fajr Libya (Libya Dawn). The only condition is that "the other parties respect the truce." The announcement came hours after the United Nations declared that Libya's warring factions had agreed to a roadmap for forming a unity government. Nearly four years after a NATO-backed revolt saw Moammar Gadhafi removed from power, two rival governments each backed by different groups of militias have plunged the country back into chaos and threatened all-out civil war. After the elected government of Prime Minister Abdullah al-Thinni was forced out of Tripoli by Libya Dawn, it was forced to move to the far eastern city of Tobruk while Libya Dawn reinstated the old parliament known as the GNC. The fighting and violence has displaced hundreds of thousands of civilians, left hundreds killed and thousands wounded. Most foreign diplomats fled the country and shut their embassies last year. The Tobruk government, as well as a few other factions who favor a peaceful resolution, came to Geneva to work on "confidence-building measures," which includes the release of detainees from both sides, opening closed ports and securing safe freedom of movement around the country. es/bw (AP, AFP, Reuters) "

France's presidential election is set to be decided on Sunday, with the first round of voting set for the weekend.
Fillon is expected to face off against Marine Le Pen, the far-right leader of the French Republican Party (RPS), in a runoff election on Saturday. The French presidential hopeful faces a tough challenge from the right-wing National Front (FN) candidate Marion Marechal, who is seeking a second term in the upper house of parliament. "I'm not going to give up on the FN," said Henrik Uterwedde, a professor of political science at the German-French Institute for Policy Studies in Berlin. Failing to win the runoff, he said, would mean losing the popular vote and the chance for a third term as France's president. He said he was "very disappointed" by the outcome of Sunday's vote, adding that he had "no confidence" in his chances of winning the general election, which is due to take place in France in May. In the run-up to the polls, polls have shown that the conservative candidate would win by a margin of more than 10 percentage points. However, it is not clear how close the contest will be between the two candidates. Both candidates have pledged to run for re-election next year, but they have been unable to secure a majority of votes in their respective parliamentary districts. They have also said that they will not run again until after the election in June, when they would be able to form a coalition government with their own party. But they are unlikely to do so without the support of their party's national executive committee, whose chairman, Andreas Jung, is also a former French Interior Minister, and whose party is currently in opposition to President Francois Hollande's government. On the other hand, both candidates are likely to have a good chance of securing a fourth term, according to a poll conducted by rbb-Inforadio, an independent think tank in Germany. If they do not win, they could face a long and difficult road to defeat, said the pollster. 'I don't know what I would do if I lost the vote,' he told the newspaper. A close second, however, could be expected from a candidate who has already won a number of elections in recent years, such as the 2015 presidential elections and last year's European elections. It would also be possible to get a first-round runoff in which the winner would have to settle for third place. That is, if he wins the second round, then he would face an uphill battle to become the next president of France. So far, so good. And that is the only thing that has been said about him so far: "He's the most popular candidate of all the candidates in this election. I'm sure he'll win a lot of people's hearts and minds." But it's not just voters who want to see a repeat of what happened in 2015. There are also those who are not convinced that this time around, or who have doubts about the candidate's ability to deliver on his campaign promises. For example, there are people who think he's a "bad candidate" who doesn't have the charisma or charisma to stand up for what he believes in. Some of these people believe he is a bad candidate, while others say he has "a lot to lose." "If he loses, I'll lose," one of them told a local newspaper, "The Parisian," referring to an article published in French magazine "Le Monde." The article was written in response to comments made by French Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle, in an interview with AFP news agency on Friday, saying that "it's very difficult to predict what will happen in November." He added that it would take a while before he could make a decision on whether or not he wants to stay in office. His comments come as a surprise to many, especially given the fact that his party has not yet announced a new leader for its presidential campaign. After all, his first term was only a few weeks ago.

A staunch conservative is joining the race for the French presidency. Republican candidate Francois Fillon could turn into a big problem for right-wing extremist Marine Le Pen's National Front.
France's Republicans are moving to the right: by choosing Francois Fillon, voters nominated a presidential candidate who has a reputation as a staunch conservative. The former prime minister has already announced that he intends to refocus politics with the traditional family in mind. Fillon takes a dim view of homosexual couples adopting children. He wants to introduce a cap on the number of refugees allowed into France, he intends to make it harder for foreign nationals to access the social welfare system, and he wants to put Muslim communities and mosques under government control. In addition, Fillon advocates a renationalization of school curricula. Fillon makes gains in FN territory Fillon's agenda could turn out to be a problem for the "National Front" (FN). The 62-year-old appeals to similar sentiments as the right-wing party's base: concern about foreign domination and loss of identity, fear of terrorism and crime. "For a long time, FN was the only political force that addressed those fears," said Henrik Uterwedde of the German-French Institute (dfi) in Ludwigsburg. "Now a politician has arrived on the scene who addresses those fears using a different language and makes them a political offer." In rural, Catholic France especially, where traditions still matter a great deal, the avowed Catholic Fillon strikes a chord with his proposals pertaining to family and society policies. He receives support from traditional Catholic groups who, for years, have been able to mobilize crowds for demonstrations against gay marriage. During the intraparty election campaign, Fillon predominantly traveled to France's villages and small towns - regions which FN leader Marine Le Pen had labeled the "forgotten France," regarding herself as their foremost lobbyist. "Fillon has made gains in an environment that is also canvassed by Le Pen," Andreas Jung, Chairman of the Bundestag's German-French parliamentary group, told German broadcaster rbb-Inforadio. "He does not represent the lofty levels of Parisian politics, but rather provincial entrenchment. Fillon is committed to traditional values, like the family. Therefore, he may not only be capable of defeating Le Pen, but also of taking the lead during the first ballot." 'Most dangerous candidate for FN' Consequently, the FN camp is less than enthusiastic about the conservative's candidacy. "Because of Fillon, we now have a strategy problem," Marion Marechal Le Pen, the FN leader's niece, recently told journalists. "He is the most dangerous candidate for the National Front." Pollsters' findings appear to support that statement. Recent surveys establish Fillon as the current favorite in the French presidential election scheduled for next May. However, Fillon's election is not a foregone conclusion. By denouncing the conservative candidate as a member of the establishment, FN tries to win over those who are frustrated with politics and politicians in general. There is persistent opposition against his economic-liberal plans in particular. Fillon wants to abolish the 35-hour working week and raise the retirement age to 65 years. In addition, he wants to cut 500,000 jobs in the public sector and reform industrial law. Fillon is known as an admirer of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. "Issues pertaining to liberal economic policy have always been heavily contested in France," said Uterwedde. "Fillon's adversaries have already taken up their positions, criticizing what, in France, is called 'ultra-liberalism.'" That was one of the nastiest words in French politics, he added. An offer for the left Fillon wants to raise VAT by 2 percent. This would predominantly hurt low-income households. Exactly that clientele, however, is wooed by FN with a program that is regarded as rather left-wing. The right-wing extremists are on a clear anti-globalization course, intending to seal off the French economy against foreign countries and exit from the European Union. The party is already trying to present Fillon as a symbol of anarchic, ultra-liberal capitalism. "Francois Fillon will even go beyond EU demands for austerity and liberalism," David Rachline, Marine Le Pen's election campaign manager, wrote on Twitter. According to current polls, it is very likely that Fillon will have to face Marine Le Pen in a runoff election in May. The main hazard for the Republican candidate: his economic-liberal course could deter left-wing voters from choosing the conservative in order to avert Le Pen. "Francois Fillon will have to start making offers, also to those voters who are closer to the center and more moderate," said France expert Uterwedde. "And he will, prior to the runoff election at the latest, have to make offers to left-wing voters - without changing his original course." "

The Vienna-based Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IASA) has launched a new system for analyzing computer systems. The system is designed to detect threats to the security of the network.
It's called the "Internet of Things" and it's a system that can be used to analyze data from multiple sources. According to Mia Landauer, a researcher at the institute in Vienna, the system will be able to identify threats that could be posed by cyber attacks. "We have to be very careful with this system," she said, adding that it would be difficult to predict the impact of a cyber attack on a network of networks. In the past, such attacks have occurred in the form of attacks on networks and networks, which can lead to a loss of information about network security. However, in this case, it appears that the attack was not aimed at a single network, but rather at an individual network that has been targeted by hackers. It is the first time that a computer system has ever been used as a surveillance system, and the second time in a long time, when it was used in an attack against networks or networks that had been attacked by attackers. This is not to say that there is no threat to security at all. There are a number of systems that have been identified as being vulnerable to attacks from cyber threats. One of them, for example, was the computer network used by the NSA to spy on networked networks in Afghanistan and Iraq. That network is also known as the internet of things (ISA), which means it can eavesdrop on the communications of other networks as well as on each other. ISA is an acronym for "information security," which stands for information security, privacy, security and privacy. Information security is a key part of this process, according to experts, who have studied the technology for years. They say it is important to understand what is going on in these systems and how they are being used. For instance, they say, "The NSA is trying to find a way to make sure that we don't have a problem with our network." The NSA, meanwhile, says it will continue to investigate the use of artificial intelligence in its surveillance and surveillance programs. But it has yet to come up with a solution that would allow it to do so. So far, however, there has not been any evidence of such an approach. Instead, researchers have focused on how the software is being deployed in order to assess the threat of cyber-attacks. And they have found that many of these attacks are not being carried out in real-time, so they cannot be prevented from doing so, as long as they do not interfere with the networks themselves. As a result, some researchers are concerned that they will see a significant increase in attacks against the Internet. These attacks could have serious consequences for the safety of network systems, especially if they can't be detected by security experts.

Austria is one of only a handful of countries in Europe to receive this kind of request, with only one exception: Germany, where the government has refused to accept the request. Since then, Austria has received a total of 2.4 million applications. Most of those applications are for security reasons. Some of which are related to cyber security: cyber espionage, cyber crime, terrorism and terrorism. Other problems include the fact that cyber criminals have access to high-value information and that hackers can easily access the information they need to hack into networks to steal it.

,"Reference text": " Keeping cool on Europe's urban heat islands
Due to the drought in Europe, Austria experienced a particularly hot summer this year. Urban areas run warmer due to the heat island effect - and as the climate heats up, cities like Vienna are tackling this problem.
Europe was hit by drought this summer, with parts of the continent experiencing the longest and hottest heat waves on record. In the Austrian capital of Vienna, temperatures were well above the summer average - and stayed there for weeks on end. This summer, the city recorded the most days over 35 degrees Celsius - including its hottest-ever night temperature - and medical calls rose by 20 percent. Environmental health specialist Hans-Peter Hutter says that on particularly calm, hot days, recommended public health limits for ozone were are significantly exceeded. And it's not just people with allergies and other conditions who suffer. "We know that in these acute periods, unfortunately, people will die," he says. The heat is becoming such an issue that the government has resolved to tackle what is known as the urban heat island effect. Like most cities, Vienna is hotter than its surrounding areas as a result of humans having altered the landscape, covering the earth with heat-absorbing asphalt and concrete. The phenomenon was first described more than two centuries ago - but global warming and industrialization are pushing it to new extremes. "The densely built-up parts of the city can be 4, 5, up to 10 degrees [Celsius] warmer than the surroundings," says Christian Härtel, an expert in building and planning who is researching this effect and its causes for Vienna's environmental protection department. More green roofs, less air-con There are many reasons for the dramatic temperature differentials between city and countryside. Fresh air and wind don't circulate as freely through cities. Colors and materials play a role too, with dark surfaces absorbing more heat than lighter ones. And due to the sealing over of soils, urban landscapes retain less moisture than natural ones. Up on the roof terrace of the city block where he works, Härtel points to two different roof types. "One is a pebble roof - when the sun shines it gets very hot," Härtel says. "On the other there is a colorful garden with a variety of herbs - I can see mint and over there, sage, chives, we have a water surface and a terraced area. It's a garden in the city," he points out. Vienna's city administration wants many more green roofs on buildings and residential blocks. As global temperatures rise, says Härtel, the need for natural methods to keep cities cool is becoming more urgent. Otherwise, artificial methods result in a negative feedback effect. "It's getting hotter, and so we cool our living spaces by consuming fossil fuels - and so we are then making this hothouse effect even worse," Härtel explains. Pocket parks Vienna's imperial past has left a legacy of grand parks and open spaces. Once, only royalty could kick up their heels in these pleasant grounds. But now, they provide a welcome haven for all the city's residents to literally chill out when temperatures rise. "Vienna has had luck with the empire times, because these places became protected," says Mia Landauer as she strolls through one such grand park beside her office at the Institute for Applied Systems Analysis to the south of Vienna, where she works as a research scholar on climate governance. The city is also fringed by the Vienna Woods on its northern side. Landauer sees this as an asset that mitigates the urban heat island effect. “We might have lost the Vienna Woods many times - but because of this history of Vienna, they realized that it is important to have this much green space in a city." Like in most cities, Vienna's population is growing rapidly, driven partly by immigration and partly by lack of jobs in rural areas. So does that mean the urban island will become even hotter as the city grows? Landauer says this need not be the case - but "the pressure is on" because of climate change. That pressure comes from the conflict between the need for green spaces, and the need to cut greenhouse gas emissions by reducing commuting distances through more dense urban living. Landauer believes "pocket parks" could provide a solution. "That means parks like any park, but of a very small size," she says. It's been demonstrated that in dense urban environments, even small parks can reduce the urban heat island effect. Landauer says these tiny green spaces also reduce flooding by absorbing water, and preventing the overflow of drains and sewers. Not to mention added benefits in terms of quality of life and enjoyment for residents with access to these parks. Cool cities make the most of rainwater While new buildings can be designed with green walls and roofs, it's more difficult to reduce heat in older areas of the city. In Vienna's 5th district most buildings are at least 100 years old, and there are few parks. But a new system could use rainwater to cool this dense " 

},{"Generated text": " Jalal Gazouhas: Syrian refugees fleeing war in Lebanon
Syrian refugee Jean Kawak has returned to his home country of Ma'loula, where he has been living for more than a year. DW spoke to him about his experiences in Syria.
Jean, a Syrian refugee from Lebanon, was among the first Syrians to return to Syria after fleeing the country's civil war. He was one of the few Syrians who managed to make it to the Syrian capital, Damascus. "It was a very difficult time for me," he told DW, adding that he had no idea how difficult it was to find a place to live in a country where so many people were fleeing their homes and where there was no one to help them. In the end, he was able to stay in his own home for a couple of days, and then go back to work in the morning. His wife and two young children, who had just returned from the war-ravaged country, were also among those returning to their home countries, according to a report by the International Society for Human Rights (ISHR) in Beirut. They had been staying in their own homes for the past two years, but now they were back in Aleppo. The Syrian government has made it clear that it will not allow them to leave Aleppo, which is now under the control of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. However, it is not clear how long this will last. According to ISHR's Jochen Langer, there is a long list of people who have fled Aleppo and are now living in other parts of Syria, such as the town of Rakka in northern Aleppo province. There are also reports that some of them have been forced to flee the city of Aleppo in order to escape the regime's crackdown on the opposition. Some of these people have even fled to Lebanon. Others have stayed behind to try and find their way back home. On the other hand, many of those fleeing Aleppo have returned home to seek refuge in refugee camps in neighboring Lebanon and Syria - a situation that has become increasingly tense in recent months. Many of their relatives have also fled Syria for Lebanon or Syria to avoid the violence that continues to rage there. A number of Syrians have come back from Syria in search of a better life, while others have sought refuge elsewhere in Europe and the Middle East. For many Syrians, Aleppo is the only place where they can find safety and security. It is also the last place they want to go to for their loved ones. This is especially true for those who are fleeing a war which has killed thousands of civilians and displaced hundreds of thousands. But it's also true that there are many other places where people are seeking refuge, including in towns, villages and cities, as well as in cities and towns. These places have become a haven for refugees and asylum seekers. Most refugees are in desperate need of humanitarian aid, especially in areas where the government is struggling to cope with the influx of refugees. At the same time, they are desperate to get their families and friends to come to them, because they don't have the means to pay for basic necessities like food, shelter and medical care. As a result, most Syrians are unable to afford to travel to Europe or even to visit the United States, so they have to rely on smugglers and smugglers who smuggle them into Europe for food and medicine. That's why many refugees come from other countries. And this is why, in many cases, the smugglers are not allowed to cross the border to reach Europe, even though they know that Europe is willing to give them a chance to do so. So, when it comes to refugees, Europe has a lot of options. One option is to send the refugees to Turkey. Another option would be to bring them in from Jordan or Lebanon - but that would require a certain amount of time and money. If that doesn't work, then the Syrians would have had to wait until they could get there, or at least try to convince Turkey to let them stay. Finally, if they do decide to move to Jordan, that could be another option. What about Lebanon? Is it possible that Lebanon could also be a possible destination for these refugees? "I think it depends on whether or not Lebanon can provide them with some kind of aid," said Sadiq Al-Mousslie, an analyst at the German-based Syrian National Council (SNC). "But I think that's not going to happen." "
,"Reference text": " Syria's Christians flee rebel crosshairs
Groups of Jihadists are increasingly targeting Christian communities, lumping them together as "pro Assad." More than a third of Christians have fled. Some worry about the future of Christianity in the country.
In the days after a sharpshooter put his brother in the crosshairs and pulled the trigger, Jalal Gazouha lived as if in a cloud. "I almost went crazy with grief," the Syrian explained on the telephone. The connection crackles. The 29-year-old's brother was killed by al Qaeda fighters in the western Syrian city of al-Qusayr, close to the Lebanese border. Gazouha is convinced that his brother was killed because he was Christian. "They want to drive us out of Syria," he told DW. By "they," he's referring to Jihadists from countries neighboring Syria - with a few hundred from Germany mixed in - who have joined in the Syrian civil war to fight against the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. According to Gazouha, they're also targeting Christians. Twenty of his family members have been murdered, he says. When Gazouha received death threats, he fled the country. "I saw my name on a list on the Internet. That list contained names of Christians who were supposed to be killed, he says, written by "the terrorists of al Qaeda." Jean Kawak, a Syriac bishop from Damascus, chose his words carefully when he spoke about the subject with DW. "We Christians have recently felt threatened by particular radical Islamist groups," he said. Kawak's own sister was forced to flee Ma'loula, a small, largely Christian village just an hour's drive north of Damascus. Islamist rebel groups attacked that village, carried out fire attacks on two churches in Rakka in north central Syria and also kidnapped two Syrian bishops in April; the culprits behind the latter attack, eyewitnesses said, were foreign Jihadists. All of these things, the Aramaic bishop says, "affect our Christian presence within Syria." One-third of Christians have fled the country in the last two years due to the civil war - with numbers increasing. These radicalized groups are not only targeting Christians though, Kawak says. "Moderate Muslims are also being threatened." Fears of displacement Kawak fears that Christian refugees may not be able to return at war's end - something comparable, he says, to what happened in southern Turkey. "Christianity has been there for 2,000 years. And we hope that Christianity is not going to leave that area." To prevent that, Kawak traveled from Damascus to Europe for a short trip. He met with Swedish politicians, German aid organization employees as well as members of Germany's Foreign Office, showing statistics related to refugees and handing out so many business cards that he had none left by the time of the interview with DW. His goal? More humanitarian aid for people in Syria - but also a political solution to the conflict. The West must do more, he says, to bring both sides to the negotiating table. "Reconciliation is possible," says Kawak - of that he is convinced. But what kind of reconciliation could be possible between Bashar al-Assad and the rebels, the latter of whom have rejected any form of political solution that leaves Assad in power? The bishop shakes his head. "You can't make demands before you begin negotiations. A real dialogue has to take place without preconditions," he said. Otherwise, the bishop worries, murders and tit-for-tat attacks will continue for years - perhaps decades - with an unforeseeable end for Syria's Christians. Praying for peace Jochen Langer, Middle East expert at the International Society for Human Rights, shares the bishop's concerns. "The Syrian army is trying, as well as they can, to protect Syria's Christians," he told DW. "But that's only possible to a limited extent." Lately, the regime has been hard-pressed to secure any single area within Syria. Daily, sometimes hourly, the fronts between rebel forces and the Syrian army change. Christians are in particular danger, Langer says, "when they, wherever they live, end up between the fighting." In other words, Christians, like all Syrians, die from the bombs and grenades that land in their villages and cities. In some regions, Langer says, Christians have already been singled out, often by the Islamist al-Nusra Front, a group moderate opposition forces have no control over. But the expert also added that "those could also be very personal acts of rage." Sadiq Al-Mousslie, a member of the Syrian National Council in Germany that forms part of the Syrian National Coalition, acknowledges that there were cases of "sporadic attacks by sick individuals." But were they targeted attacks? "No," he says firmly. "That's part of the Assad regime's propaganda that's been taken up by the West." Behind it, he says, "

The Berlin State Supreme Court has ruled in favor of the search giant Google in a case that could lead to a nationwide ban on the company's search engine.
Google said on Thursday that it would appeal the ruling to the lower house of parliament, which is due to take place in the coming days. The ruling could pave the way for Google to be banned from the country's most populous city, Berlin. Google said the decision was based on a "technical decision" made by the state's top court. "The decision will be made in accordance with the law," said Google's Peter Fleischer, a spokesman for the court, adding that Google is "committed to upholding the rule of law in Germany." The court's decision is the latest step in an ongoing legal battle between the German government and Google over its search-engine platform. It is also the first time Google has faced legal challenges over the use of search engines. In the case of Google, the appeals court ruled that there was "no reasonable basis for a ban" and that the firm would not be able to comply with a court order. However, Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment. On Thursday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel's office said that a decision would be taken to ban Google from using the service. According to German news agency dpa, "Google is committed to protecting the interests of all German citizens." Google declined to comment further, citing the pending appeal. Germany's high court has already ruled against Google for violating the terms of its license to search for and sell search results on its website. A decision on whether Google should be allowed to continue to use the platform is expected to come as early as next week, when the Berlin state parliament is scheduled to hold a special meeting to discuss the matter. If Google does not comply, it could face a fine of up to 10,000 euros ($13,500). The decision could also be appealed to other European countries, including the United States, Canada and the Netherlands, where Google already has a stake in Google. Alphabet's Eric Schmidt, who heads the Google division, told Reuters that his company would seek to avoid legal action if it was found to have violated German law. Schmidt said he was not aware of any legal precedent in which Google could be barred from doing so, but added that he had no reason to believe that such a move would violate German laws. He also pointed out that, as a result of his firm's efforts to improve the quality of searches, there is no legal basis to enforce the ban. His company has also been criticized for not doing enough to protect the rights of people who search on their own, and for failing to do so in order to preserve the privacy of those who do not have access to Google services. That's a problem, he said, because Google doesn't have the resources to defend itself against such attacks. But he also said it is not the only company that has been accused of violating German privacy laws, such as the right to free speech, freedom of expression and free association. And he added: "I don't think there are any other companies that would do the same thing. I think it's important that we have a clear legal framework in place that will allow us to fight against these attacks." In a statement to Reuters, Alphabet said its board of directors had agreed to consider the issue "in light of recent developments in Europe and in particular the situation in China." "We are not going to allow the government to interfere in our domestic affairs," Schmidt added, referring to China's ongoing crackdown on internet companies and other countries that are trying to impose restrictions on Internet access in their countries. This has led to an increase in online searches in some countries where the internet has become increasingly difficult to access. For example, China has banned the Chinese Internet from entering its territory, while the US has blocked the Internet in its own country. Meanwhile, Germany has imposed a new law on online shopping, saying it will not allow Internet companies to sell their products without the consent of their users. "
,"Reference text": " Berlin court rules Google Street View is legal in Germany
A Berlin court has ruled that Google Street View is legal. But that doesn't mean the lawsuits will end, legal scholars say.
A Berlin court has ruled that Google Street View is, in fact, legal in Germany. Last Tuesday, the Berlin State Supreme Court (Kammergericht) announced its decision in a court case from late last year, in which a woman had sued Google, fearing that photos of her, her family and the front of her house would be posted on Google Street View and would thus violate her property and privacy rights. The court ruled that it is legal to take photographs from street level, rejecting her argument that Google was trying to take unauthorized pictures. Part of her argument rested on the fact that Google used cameras mounted at three meters (9.84 feet) high, which could see over her two-meter-high hedge. However, the court did not find this argument convincing, given that the photographs were taken from the street, and not the sidewalk. Furthermore, because Google automatically blurs faces and license plates and did allow Germans to opt-out of the service to have their house obfuscated as well, the court did not find any potential violations. This is the first high-level court ruling, which cannot be appealed any further, regarding Street View since the service debuted in Germany at the end of last year. An ongoing debate Since Google announced plans to launch Street View in Germany last summer, debate around the service has become heated, with some politicians trying to stop it at every turn, while German Chancellor Angela Merkel famously said that she would not remove her house from Street View. In November 2010, the company announced that 244,000 German residents in the 20 cities had chosen to opt out of Street View - less than three percent of residents. However, in Germany and everywhere else, the company also allows people to report abuse, inaccuracies or request that something be blurred using an online tool. "Our job is to develop services that respect these cultural differences," Peter Fleischer, Google's global privacy counsel told Deutsche Welle in November 2010. "We try to anticipate them. We're all internationally-minded people ourselves. We try to guess how people will react to them. But a lot of these services are new and have never been on the market before, so we learn and we adapt as we go along." A 'landmark decision' European legal experts called the Berlin ruling a "landmark decision," saying that this would now become part of German case law regarding property rights. "Yes, other people are now warned: Don't sue Google simply claiming that Google Street View violates personality [or] property rights," wrote Thomas Hören, a professor of media and communications law at the University of Münster, in an e-mail sent to Deutsche Welle. But, he also warned that this decision was very narrow, focusing on the issue of property rights, and not on the larger issues of data protection from Google. "The problem of Google Street View - to be honest - has never been a problem of personality rights or property rights, but the enormous risk of personal data compilations in cases where people use Google Street View for compiling personal profiles (such as building insurance companies; future employees, et cetera)," he added. "And this risk has not been considered by the Berlin courts." Similarly, Viktor Mayer-Schönberger, a professor at the Oxford Internet Institute, agreed that this case was "limited in scope," adding in an e-mail, "The plaintiff never alleged an actual invasion of privacy, just a potential one."

The British government has called for a review of the country's banking standards, following a report by the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards (PCB).
British banks have said they will not be able to comply with the new rules set out in a parliamentary report released on Thursday. The commission, which is chaired by Conservative MP Andrew Tyrie, said it would look into the issue. "We will be looking at a number of factors, including whether there is a lack of transparency in the banking industry," the commission's report said, adding that it was "deeply concerned" about the bank's ability to meet its obligations under the rules. It added that the regulator would also look at how the banks are supposed to conduct their business, and whether they are required to adhere to the standards set forth in their regulations. A spokesman for the UK government said the government would not comment on the report until it had received the necessary information from the PCB. In a statement, the Commission said that there had been "no indication that any of these measures were in place at the time of this report." The Commission also said there was a "very high level of uncertainty" over the future of UK banks, with some banks saying they would be unable to compete with other financial institutions, such as HSBC, Standard Chartered and Lloyds Banking Group (STB), which has been the subject of a series of scandals over its handling of customer deposits. Royal Bank has denied the allegations, saying it did not have the legal authority to do so.

Earlier this year, it announced a new round of investigations into allegations of misconduct at its British bank, RBS, in an apparent attempt to undermine its reputation as a lender of last resort. Regulators are also looking into whether the company has breached its terms of service, or whether it should be allowed to continue to issue loans to customers without the approval of an independent board of directors. As part of its review, PCBs are expected to be subject to a raft of new regulations that could lead to fines of up to 1 billion pounds ($2.6 billion) if they fail to fulfill their obligations, according to an industry source.   The report, published on Wednesday, also called on banks to make changes to their lending standards in order to protect consumers' financial security, as well as to ensure that they do not overspend on risky loans.

A British parliamentary commission has completed its work on the overhaul of the domestic banking sector. Among other things, it proposed jail terms for bankers displaying grave malpractice and causing huge damage.
Members of the UK's Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards agreed Wednesday that Britain needed a radical overhaul of its scandal-hit lenders. The panel, which was mostly composed of lawmakers, concluded in its final report that senior bankers must be made personally responsible for malpractice through the introduction of a new criminal offence of reckless misconduct. It would carry a prison sentence. The reputation of the country's banking sector had been damaged in recent years by a string of scandals, including Libor rate-rigging, credit insurance mis-selling and a controversy over staff behavior and bonuses in the run-up to the 2008 global financial crisis. The level of malpractice had been "shocking and widespread," said the commission's chairman, Conservative party lawmaker Andrew Tyrie. RBS cut in two? "Taxpayers and customers have lost out, and the economy has suffered," the 500-page report said. "Under our recommendations, senior bankers who seriously damage their banks or put taxpayers' money at risk can expect to be fined, banned from the industry or in the worst cases go to jail." The commission called for bankers to sign up to a new code of conduct under which all key responsibilities within a bank would be assigned to specific senior officials who would be held responsible. The panel also proposed that more remuneration for bankers should be deferred for longer periods of up to ten years in order to "reflect the longer run balance between business risks and rewards." The commission recommended that the government consider splitting the state-rescued Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) into a good bank and a bad one mopping up toxic assets. The report was published ahead of a key speech by Finance Minister George Osborne on his bank reform plans. hg/ipj (AFP, Reuters) "

German Chancellor Angela Merkel has been hit by a series of economic problems that have forced her to step down as the country's top economic policymaker.
Merkel and her conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party have been at loggerheads for months over the handling of the eurozone crisis. The chancellor's coalition government, which includes the FDP and the center-left Social Democrats (SPD), is struggling to cope with the fallout from the crisis in Europe's largest economy. In a speech to the German Institute for Economic Research in Berlin on Thursday, the CDU's leader, Guido Westerwelle, said he was "deeply concerned" about the economic situation in the euro zone. "I am deeply concerned," he said, referring to Germany's debt crisis, in which the bloc has lost more than 1.5 trillion euros ($2.6 trillion) since the financial crisis began in 2009. He also said that the EU should be able to find a way to reduce its debt burden by at least 10 percent by the end of this year. But he added that Germany should not be forced to rely solely on external sources of funding, such as foreign direct investment (FDI) or the European Central Bank (ECB). "We have to make sure that we have the right policies to deal with these problems," said Klaus Zimmermann, a senior economist at the think tank's German institute for economic research. 'We are not going to give up' The German government has also been accused of failing to act on a number of its own economic concerns, including the rise in unemployment and rising costs of living in low-wage countries. This has led to a sharp drop in economic growth in recent months, according to government figures released on Wednesday. However, it is not the first time the chancellor has faced criticism for not taking action on economic issues. Last year, Chancellor Merkel was criticized by some economists for calling for an end to austerity measures that would have made Germany more dependent on foreign aid. Merkel, however, has defended the measures, saying they were necessary to "protect the interests of our own people" and that they would not lead to an "unprecedented" increase in public spending. On the other hand, she has called on the government to do more to tackle the problem of high unemployment, especially among young people. She also called for a "radical" reduction in government spending in order to help the economy recover from its worst economic crisis since World War II, when it reached its lowest level since 1945. And she said she would continue to push for the elimination of welfare benefits for working-class families in a bid to combat the effects of poverty and unemployment. Her comments come as Germany prepares to host the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, next week, where it will host a summit of world leaders to discuss the global economic challenges facing the world's second-largest economy after the United States and China. It is the second time in less than a year that Merkel will be hosting the summit, and she is expected to attend the gathering.

Chancellor Angela Merkel and other top officials have called for upticks in Germany's economy to trickle down to workers in the form of higher pay. But a leading think tank has warned against giving raises too soon.
Germany's foreign minister and deputy chancellor, Guido Westerwelle, has added his support to comments made by Economics Minster Rainer Bruederle about increased wages for German workers. "When the economy grows and this growth is substantial and sustainable, then the benefits of this upswing should be felt by the people who worked so hard for it," Westerwelle told the Hamburger Abendblatt newspaper in an interview. Westerwelle heads the free-market liberal FDP, which shares power with Chancellor Merkel's Christian coalition. Earlier this week, Bruederle, also an FDP member, said in light of Germany's currently growing economy, those economic gains should trickle down to employees in the form of higher wages. Merkel, who is also the head of the Christian Democratic Union, supported Bruederle's idea. "That is something the chancellor sees the same way, letter for letter," said Merkel's spokesman, Steffen Seibert. Not so fast Earlier this week, analysts predicted growth of 3.5 percent this year and 2 percent in 2011. Germany's five leading economic think tanks also predicted that the number of unemployed would fall below 3 million next year, the lowest level since 1992. Despite the current rosy outlook for the German economy, not everyone is convinced that a growing economy should inevitably lead to higher wages. The president of the German Institute for Economic Research, Klaus Zimmermann, warned against reacting too quickly. "I can't support the idea of a general wage increase, I think it is too dangerous," Zimmermann said in an interview with the Handelsblatt newspaper. Zimmermann wasn't opposed to the idea of raising wages, but said he was against across-the-board increases for all sectors and pointed out that not every industry is benefitting the same from the growing economy. "We can't forget that the German economy did not resort to mass lay-offs when it wasn't going so well last year," Zimmermann said. Raising wages in some branches could be a good idea, Zimmermann said, as that would make those branches more attractive option to potential workers from outside of Germany.

The Belarusian president has been charged with genocide and sentenced to life in prison. His trial is set to begin on Monday.
A court in Minsk, Belarus, has ordered the trial of a former KGB agent accused of murdering his wife and two children. The trial, which began on Tuesday, is scheduled to last for three days. Belarus has accused the German government of orchestrating the murder of the wife, who was killed in a shootout with police in the capital. A trial date has yet to be set for the alleged murder. On Monday, the court said that the accused had confessed to the crime and that he had been tortured and tortured by the authorities. "I have no doubt that this is a very serious crime," said prosecutor Guido Westerwelle. He added that there was no evidence to support the charges. Luka has denied the accusations and said he was innocent of any crime. In a statement released by Belarus' state news agency MTS, it said the allegations were "baseless" and "unfounded." The court also said it had not yet decided whether the case against the ex-Balkan president would be brought to trial. Earlier this month, a court had ruled that Belarus had violated the terms of its extradition treaty with Russia, accusing the former Soviet republics of "aggravated crimes against humanity and genocide." A spokesman for Belarus's foreign minister, Mikhail Myasnikovich, told reporters the country had "no intention" of extraditing the convicted man to Germany. However, he did not rule out the possibility that a trial could take place in Germany, where he is currently serving a life sentence for a crime he committed against his family. According to a Reuters report, prosecutors said they would seek to extradite the man, whose name has not been publicly released, to stand trial in absentia. They have also called on the Belarus government to cooperate with the prosecution of those who have been convicted of crimes, such as murder, attempted murder and attempted rape. mz/msh (AP, AFP, dpa, Reuters, AP, DPA, EFE-EFE) Editor: Michael Kuehring (AFP, REUTERS, wire services, iuwendytse/dpa) p.m. (Reuters) Author: Andreas Kühling: "This is not the first time this has happened.

His comments come as Belarus prepares to hold a referendum on Sunday on whether or not it will accept the results of an election held in November. It is unclear if the referendum will be held, but it is widely expected to go ahead as planned. After the election, there is an expected referendum in early 2018, with a majority of voters casting their ballots in favor of pro-Kremlin candidates. There is also a chance that some of them will run for re-election in 2018. Author's note: This article was originally published by The Associated Press on June 12, 2017.

Before being sworn in for a fourth term, the reclusive leader of Belarus fired a warning salvo at the European Union, accusing Germany and Poland of plotting a coup and threatening action against sanctions.
Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko was sworn into office on Friday in a lavish ceremony boycotted by Western diplomats. The previous day, the 56-year-old leader openly accused Germany and neighboring Poland of planning a coup against him. "There were [in Germany and Poland] plans worked out for an overthrow of the constitutional order," Lukashenko said in the Belarusian capital, Minsk, on Thursday. "This is not an invention of our intelligence agencies." Lukashenko, who came to power in 1994, was re-elected last month with 80 percent of the vote in what the opposition and international monitors said was a rigged election. Relations between the reclusive Belarusian government and the West have been strained ever since. 'Belarus question must be answered' German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said in a statement that the accusations were "baseless" and an attempt by Lukashenko to draw attention away from his own wrongdoing. "The EU needs to find a clear political answer to events surrounding the presidential election and the continued incarceration of opposition politicians and their supporters," Westerwelle said. A wide-reaching crackdown against the regime's opponents followed Lukashenko's re-election. Hundreds of his critics were arrested and dozens threatened with long-term jail sentences. Poland also dismissed the accusations as absurd and said that relations with Minsk would not be normalized unless all political prisoners were released. Sanctions threat The situation in Belarus pushed the European Union to adopt a resolution on Thursday in support of economic sanctions against the country. The threats earned a sharp rebuke from Lukashenko, who promised the "hardest possible reaction" should the bloc impose sanctions against his country. At the same time, the Belarusian prime minister, Mikhail Myasnikovich, travelled to Moscow in a effort to shore up Russian support for Minsk during its standoff with the EU. That meeting ended with a Russian promise not to impose its own set of sanctions on Belarus over an unrelated spat over oil exports and a commitment to resume a nuclear power plant project shelved after the 1986 Chernobyl disaster.

India has banned the entry of Rohingya Muslims into the country. However, the government has said it will continue to do so.
The government of India has decided to allow the Rohingya to enter its territory. The move comes after a court in Jammu and Kashmir ruled that the Muslim community in the state of Rakhine should not be allowed to cross into India. According to a statement released by the interior ministry on Thursday, India will not allow any entry to the area. "We are not going to let anyone enter our territory without our permission," said Colin Gonsalves, a spokesman for the ministry of interior and external affairs. He added that India would not tolerate any form of discrimination against Muslims, adding that "it is our duty as a country to protect its citizens." The government also said that it would stop all attempts to impose any kind of restrictions on the movement of Muslims in India, which it considers to be part of the "Islamic State" (IS) terrorist organization. India's interior minister, Prashant Bhushan, said the move was "inappropriate" and "not in line with international humanitarian law." "It is against international law," he said. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has been in power for more than a decade, has called for a ban on all Muslims entering India until the end of this year. In the past few months, however, Indian authorities have stepped up their efforts to stop the flow of people into Myanmar. Last week, Modi announced that he would ban all Muslim-majority Myanmar nationals who enter India through the Indian-administered territory of Rajasthan. This is a step in a long process that has taken many years to take place, according to Indian officials. It is the first time that a Muslim country has allowed a majority of its nationals to come to India without fear of persecution or persecution. But the situation in Myanmar has changed dramatically since Modi took over as prime minister in 2014. There are now thousands of refugees living in this country, many of whom have fled their homes to escape persecution and persecution in their home countries. At the same time, there have been a number of incidents of violence against Buddhists, including attacks on Buddhist temples, mosques, schools and other places of worship. Many of these incidents have taken place during the last few years, and the violence has continued unabated, with the most recent being the killing of a Buddhist monk and a Hindu priest by a Rohingya man. On Wednesday, an Indian police officer was killed when he was shot and wounded in an encounter with a group of militants near the border with Bangladesh. His body was taken into custody and taken to hospital, where he is being treated for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and is expected to undergo further medical treatment. During the course of his visit to Myanmar, he told DW that there had been an increase in cases of rape and murder of women and children, as well as the deaths of children and young people. As a result, it has become increasingly difficult for Indian security forces to deal with these cases. DW spoke to senior officials from the Ministry of Home Affairs and External Affairs about the latest developments. They said there was a "clear lack of coordination" between the police and security agencies and that they were not able to provide any sort of information about what was going on. A UN report has also been released, but it is not yet clear if there is any coordination between India and Myanmar authorities on how to tackle the issue.

After an appeal from two Rohingya, India's top court is considering PM Narendra Modi's plan to deport some 40,000 Rohingya in India. The government said intelligence data showed links between some Rohingya and terrorism.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government told the Supreme Court of India on Monday that the Rohingya were "illegal" immigrants. The hearing is taking place as Rohingya face severe violence in their native Myanmar. More than 400,000 Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh in the past few weeks to escape military and civilian reprisals that the United Nations has described as "ethnic cleansing." Later on Monday, Myanmar's national security advisor said that his government was willing to welcome the refugees who had fled to Bangladesh back to their native Rakhine state, but that the details of the process still had to be worked out. "We will make sure that everybody who left their home can return to their home but this is a process we have to discuss," Thaung Tun told Reuters news agency after a meeting with British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. It was unclear how this would affect the estimated 40,000 Rohingya believed to have settled in India, including 16,000 of whom are registered with the UN's refugee agency. Read more: Myanmar's Rohingya - A history of forced exoduses The Indian government told the court that it had intelligence data that showed links between some Rohingya Muslims and Pakistan-based terror groups and other international terror organizations. It argued that such links made them a "serious threat to national security." The government also said there was a "serious possibility of eruption of violence against Buddhists in India by radicalized Rohingya." Lawyer Colin Gonsalves, who in a separate case is representing about 7,000 Rohingya living in the northern Indian city of Jammu, countered the government's assertions. "We just want to know: 40,000 people have been here, many of them for the last five years. Have you [the government] filed a single charge sheet, is anyone being prosecuted in the criminal court for being a terrorist? The answer is: no," he told DW. The court has adjourned the hearing in the matter to October 3. Lack of evidence India says it is not bound by the UN convention on refugees as it is not a signatory to the accord, but human rights activists disagree. "The principle of non return of a person to a place where he will be executed or tortured has become a principle of customary international law which India follows," Gonsalves told DW. "And it has attained the status of 'jus cogens,' which is a principle of law that no country can say is not applicable to it, such as torture and genocide." In a communication sent to all states in August, the Home Ministry [interior ministry] said the illegal migrants were more susceptible to terrorist recruitment efforts. But an investigation by Indian broadcaster NDTV found "little evidence of the government claim." The investigation that was carried out at major Rohingya settlements in the country showed little involvement in criminal wrongdoing by the refugees. Lack of any evidence to support the government claim has led to speculations that the Rohingya were being targeted for their religion by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu-nationalist government. "It is really unfortunate that the government is going back on its commitment to refugees which it has reiterated several times in the past merely because these Rohingyas are Muslims," said lawyer Prashant Bhushan, who filed the plea on behalf of two Rohingya men. "I mean this is clearly a case of religious discrimination and an attempt to arouse a sort of feeling of... an anti-Muslim feeling or try and communalise the situation," he told reporters outside the courthouse. The UN's human rights chief last week deplored Indian government's move to deport Rohingya refugees. "India cannot carry out collective expulsions, or return people to a place where they risk torture or other serious violations," Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein said. The Rohingya are an Indo-Aryan people, the vast majority of whom are Muslims. They usually migrate to India through a rather porous border to escape persecution in their native Rakhine state in Myanmar, where they have been denied citizenship rights. They are viewed by the local authorities as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. Myanmar's Buddhist majority is often accused of subjecting them to discrimination and violence.

Myanmar's government maintains the crackdown is part of a counter-terrorism drive, while the UN's al-Hussein has said that it "seems a textbook example of ethnic cleansing." "

Albion cyclist Lance Armstrong has been banned from cycling for life for doping, according to the International Cycling Union (IUCU). Armstrong, who won the Tour of France in 2004, is set to return to cycling next year.
Armstrong, the world's most decorated cyclist, has returned to racing after a doping ban was lifted by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA). The decision to ban him from the sport comes after he was found guilty of using banned substances during the 2004 Tour. Armstrong was sentenced to three years in prison and a fine of $10,000. He will be eligible to compete again in 2006, when he is due to turn 30. "I'm not going to give up," Armstrong said in an interview with the Associated Press on Tuesday, adding that he had "no regrets" about his decision not to run for re-election. The USADA said it was "not aware" of the doping allegations against Armstrong and that it would not comment on the matter at the time of publication. However, Armstrong did not deny the allegations, saying in a statement that the decision was made "in good faith." Armstrong also said he has no plans to quit cycling, which he said was a "very important part of his life." He said the ban would be lifted in the event of another doping scandal, in which Armstrong tested positive for amphetamines and other substances, including those found to be linked to cancer and heart disease, as well as to a number of other medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes and high cholesterol, among other conditions. In addition, he added, "We will not allow doping in our sport, and we will continue to do so as long as we have a positive test for the disease," he told the AP. 'It is not something that we want to see in cycling.' Armstrong is expected to make a comeback in 2014, after being banned for one year in 2005 for using a banned substance in his first year of racing. But he's not sure if he'll be able to continue racing for a long time, or whether he will have to step down as a professional cyclist in order to pursue his dream of becoming a racing cyclist again. It's unclear how long Armstrong will stay on track, but it's possible he could retire before the end of this year, if not sooner, than the start of next season. That would make him the first cyclist to win a world title since Armstrong won it in 2002. His career has spanned more than two decades, with a total of seven Tour victories and two World Tour titles. At least two of those have been won by Armstrong since he became an Olympian in 2003. While he hasn't won a World Championship since then, there's been a lot of speculation about whether or not he would return for another Tour in 2013. After all, it is still a race, not a sprint, that's for sure. There's also the possibility that Armstrong could be back for his third Tour title in as many years. If he does return, his chances of winning a fourth title would likely be higher. And that would give him a chance to get back into cycling again, should he decide to take a break from racing and focus on his cycling career. What's next for Armstrong? Armstrong says he wants to focus more on cycling and not just on "the sport of cycling." "It's a sport that I'm passionate about and I've always wanted to play in, so I think I can do that," said Armstrong on Monday, referring to his quest to become a cycling champion. Read more: Armstrong: I have no regrets about doping at all But Armstrong isn't the only cyclist who has had a bad year so far. For him, cycling is the most important sport for him and his team. Even if Armstrong doesn't win another race in four years, at least Armstrong can still be considered a great athlete. So far, though, things have not been going well with Armstrong. As Armstrong prepares to start his comeback tour in France on Sunday, some observers believe he may be the last man standing. "

"Lance Armstrong has no place in cycling," said McQuaid. Addressing his remarks to cyclists, McQuaid said the fight against doping was his priority. "UCI is listening and is on your side. We’ve come too far in the fight against doping to return to our past. Cycling has a future and something like this must not happen again." The scathing USADA report included testimony from 11 former teammates, accusing Armstrong of running the "most sophisticated" doping program in the sport's history. The USADA said it had collected evidence to prove the seven-time Tour de France winner had engaged in the biggest doping conspiracy to date. Effect on cycling and sponsorship Monday's decision comes as the sport of cycling reels from Armstrong's well-documented fall from grace. Organizers of the Tour de France will be trying to move on from the scandal as the race prepares to celebrate its centenary next year. Sponsors have been deserting Armstrong and the sport in general. Last week, Nike - one of Armstrong's main corporate sponsors - said it was terminating its relationship with the cyclist and accused him of deception. Trek, the company that made the bicycles Armstrong rode to seven titles, announced on the same day it would terminate its sponsorship contract - as did the beer maker Anheuser-Busch. The Dutch institution Rabobank ended its association with professional cycling after the doping allegations came to light, leaving 17 riders in need of a sponsor. Last week Armstrong also announced he would step down from his own charity, the Lance Armstrong Foundation, also known as Livestrong, a move believed to have been intended to limit the damage to the organization from the USADA report.

US President Barack Obama has died at the age of 85. He was one of the most influential voices in the Republican Party. His death was the latest in a series of legal challenges to the US Constitution.
The death of conservative US jurist Scalia, who died in February of a heart attack in his sleep, has been the subject of intense debate among Republicans and Democrats alike. In a statement released on Tuesday, Obama said he was "deeply saddened" by the loss of Scalia's life. "I am deeply saddened by this loss," he said, adding that he had "no doubt" that his death would have been a "great loss for the American people." "It is a very sad day for our country," said Obama, referring to his wife, Michelle, and their two children. The president's death came as a surprise to many Republicans who had expected him to be the last sitting justice on the court, but instead were shocked to learn that the late Justice Scalia had died a few days earlier. Scalia was a staunch supporter of President Obama's efforts to overturn the death penalty, which was upheld by a federal appeals court in Washington in 2000. But he also had a strong personal relationship with the president and his family, according to conservative commentator Greg Abbott of Texas. Both men were staunch supporters of Obama during the presidential campaign, when they were both in their early 20s. They had been close friends for years. Now, however, they are no longer close to each other. Their relationship has become strained, Abbott says, because of their close ties to Obama and the White House. At the same time, the two men have a long history of working together, he says: "We have always been friends, we have never been enemies of one another. We are very proud of our relationship." Scalia died on February 22, 2013, at age 85, after a battle with cancer that left him unable to stand for re-election. During his final days in office, Scalia served as the chief justice of both houses of Congress. Since then, his political career has spanned more than 40 years, with a total of 22 years in public service. And he is the only person who has ever served in any capacity on a US federal court. That's a remarkable achievement for a man who was once considered the father of modern American politics. It's also the first time in US history that a sitting president has won a majority of votes in an election. Obama is expected to win the presidency in November. However, it's not clear whether he will be able to do so on November 6, 2012, or in January 2012. If he does win, then Obama will have to rely on his party's support from the conservative Christian base in Texas and New Mexico, where he won the popular vote in 2010. On the other hand, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney is running for president in 2012 and is seeking a third term in 2013. While the party has traditionally supported conservative candidates, Romney and Obama have often been seen as more moderate than their Republican counterparts. Romney, meanwhile, is an unabashed defender of traditional conservative values, while Abbott and Romney have both been staunchly anti-Obama. As a result, both of them have voted in favor of Romney's presidential bid. Despite the fact that Romney has never won an outright majority in Congress, many of his supporters are still skeptical about the GOP's chances of winning the general election next year. Many of those who voted for Romney last year said they would vote for Obama this year because they believe he would be a better president than the current president. So far, so good. Some Republicans have even said that they will vote against Romney. Others say they're not sure whether Romney will win a second term because he's too old to run for another term. Other Republicans are more skeptical. One Republican strategist told me that "Romney has a lot to say about Romney." Another said Romney "wouldn't be surprised if he wins the election" if Romney wins. Another suggested Romney could win in 2014. A third Republican candidate, Texas' Greg Abbot, said the former governor of South Carolina, was more likely to lose his seat. "

Justice Antonin Scalia, an outspoken conservative and the longest-serving member of the US' top court, has passed away in Texas. President Obama vowed to nominate a successor 'in due time,' despite political opposition.
The 79-year old justice died in his sleep, presumably of natural causes, local media reported on Saturday. Scalia was visiting Texas for a hunting trip, and his body was discovered after he failed to appear for breakfast in the resort where he was staying. US President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama extended "their deepest condolences to Justice Scalia's family," White House deputy spokesman Eric Schultz said. Texas Governor Greg Abbott described the conservative justice as a "man of God, a patriot and an unwavering defender of the written Constitution and the rule of law." "He was the solid rock who turned away so many attempts to depart from and distort the Constitution. His fierce loyalty to the Constitution set an unmatched example, not just for judges and lawyers, but for all Americans," Abbot said. Battle for the empty seat His passing is likely to open a new political front between President Barack Obama and the Republican Party, as Scalia's replacement could shift the composition of the court towards a more liberal persuasion. Several Republican lawmakers have already urged Obama to leave the decision to the next president who will be voted in later this year. "The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court justice," Senate Republican majority leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement, referring to the upcoming November general election. "Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president," McConnell concluded. President Obama, however, said he would fulfill his constitutional duty and nominate Scalia's successor "in due time." "These are responsibilities I take seriously, and so should everyone. They are bigger than any one party," he said. Decades of controversy Scalia joined the Supreme Court in 1986, becoming the first Italian-American to serve in the top judicial body. He was nominated by US President Ronald Reagan. Throughout his long carrier, Scalia voted in favor of privacy and protecting defendants' rights, but also against legalizing abortion, same-sex marriage and gun control. He also drew public attention for his theatrical flair and sharpness of tongue, as well as his alleged unwillingness to compromise.

A Mexican Nobel Prize winner has died in a car crash in Germany. His body was found in the wreckage of a bus that crashed into a building in Mexico City.
The Nobel Peace Prize laureate died on Sunday, Dec. 3, at the age of 88. He was one of the first Nobel laureates to receive a medal for his work. The Nobel prize in literature was awarded to the winner of an international competition for the best German literature prize. "I was honored to have received this award for my work, which I have been working on for many years," he said in an interview with the German news agency dpa.  "It was a great honor for me to be recognized as a Nobel laureate, and I am very grateful that I was able to contribute so much to my country's development." The award was presented by the Goethe Institute, the world's oldest and most prestigious institute of literature. It is the only one in Europe that has ever been awarded the Nobel Prizes for literature, literature and art. In the United States, it is awarded a prize of $1,000.00 (1.5 million euros). In Germany, this prize is given to a person who has made a significant contribution to society through his or her work and whose work has been translated into more than 100 languages. I will be honored for this achievement in my home state of Baden-Württemberg, where I live with my wife and two children. My wife is from Mexico and my children are from Brazil. We have a very close relationship with our parents. They have always been close to each other, but we have never had a chance to spend time together. Our relationship is very strong and we are very proud of our relationship."   In a statement, I said: "Our relationship was strong because we were both born and raised in this country and because of that, we feel very strongly about the relationship between our families and our work." I added that his family was "very close" to his parents and that they had "a lot of respect" for him. However, he also said that he had no idea how important it would be to him to make a living in his native Mexico. That is, until he met his wife, who was married and had three children with his first wife. Since then, their relationship has only grown stronger and they have become close friends. Now, they are engaged in their own lives and have two sons. One of them is a lawyer, while the other is an attorney. Both of us are interested in pursuing a career in law and politics. While I don't have any formal qualifications, my family has always wanted to pursue a professional career. But I'm not sure what kind of career path I should pursue. After all, there are so many things I want to do in life. And I can't imagine a life without my husband and children, so I'll just have to wait and see what happens. When I get back to Mexico, all I know is that my parents are going to take care of me for a while and then they will move on to other things. So I've decided to try to find a way to get my own career and pursue my dream of becoming a doctor. At the moment, however, that is not possible, because I do not have the money to go to university. What I really want is to work in medicine and to become a professor of medicine. To do this I need a degree in philosophy and philosophy. This is why I chose to study medicine as part of my doctoral program. There is no doubt that medicine will help me get a better understanding of how medicine works. For me, medicine is something that can be applied in many different fields. Physically it's important to me that the medical profession be respected and treated as such. Medicine is important because medicine can only be used in certain fields, such as medicine, nutrition and education. Medico-Medicine is also important, since medicine has a long history of being involved in medical research and treatment. "

The pontiff has met with the Russian Patriarch of Constantinople and the head of the Roman Catholic Church in Mexico. The two leaders are expected to discuss the pope's visit to the Holy See.
Francis is set to meet with Pope Francis in Rome on Sunday.  
On Sunday, Francis will hold a press conference at the Vatican, where he will address the Pope. Francis has already made his first public appearance since taking office in January. He will also be accompanied by Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is due to visit Mexico later this month. In his speech, the pontifical leader said: "I want to thank you very much for your warm welcome and for the warm reception we have received over the past few days." The pope also addressed the heads of state of Mexico and Latin America, saying that he was "deeply concerned" about the situation in the two countries. "We are deeply concerned about what is going on in these countries," Francis said, adding that "the situation is very serious." He also said that the church would be "very careful" in dealing with any situation that could lead to a "serious crisis." "The pope has made it clear that we are not going to tolerate any kind of political interference in our country," he said. However, he added, "we will not allow any form of interference from outside the country." Francis' visit comes at a time of heightened tensions between the US and Mexico, which has seen a surge in anti-immigrant sentiment in recent years. On the one hand, President Barack Obama has called for an end to violence against Muslims, while on the other he has been calling for a ceasefire between Muslims and Christians. At the same time, however, there is a growing sense of unease among the Catholic faithful about a possible conflict between Islam and Christianity. This is especially true in a country where the majority of Muslims live in poverty, and where there are a lot of people who don't have the means to fight the Islamic State (IS). In this context, it is important to note that this is not an isolated incident. It is the first time that a leader of a religious denomination has visited a foreign country. And it's not just a matter of whether or not they are willing to go to war with each other. There is also the issue of how to deal with a situation like this. Is there a way to prevent the spread of radical Islam? Is it possible to do that without the support of other religious groups? The Vatican has a long list of religious organizations, including the Legion of Christ, an organization that works to combat radicalization and promote tolerance and tolerance in society. But it also has to be careful not to overstep the boundaries of what the Church can and cannot tolerate. For example, if a pope visits a Muslim country, then he may not be able to convince them that Islam is an acceptable religion for them to follow. That is why he is visiting Mexico in order to make sure that they do not become radicalized and radicalize themselves in their own way. His visit also comes after a visit by Pope Benedict XVI to Rome last week, in which he expressed his desire to see the Muslim world as a whole. Astrid Prange, a Catholic priest from Rome, told DW that it was an important visit for Francis to come to Mexico to "meet with him and talk to him about this issue." It was also important for him to know that there was a need for dialogue between Muslim and Christian leaders in this region, especially in light of recent events in Egypt and Syria that have led to an increase in violent attacks on Muslims. As a result of this visit, many Muslim leaders have come forward to express their support for President Obama. They have also expressed their concern that Francis may be forced to step down from his post as pope. Many of them have already said they would like to return to their traditional role as bishops, but they have not yet decided whether they will do so. So far, so good. I think that's the most important thing that has happened. "
,"Reference text": " Opinion: The pope's impossible mission in Mexico
Pope Francis's trip to Mexico is a dangerous mission - a diplomatic as well as political balancing act, one that brings with it enormous expectations. Francis won't be able to meet them, says DW's Astrid Prange.
Dead prisoners, disappearing students, refugees shot dead and murdered priests. Mexico has lived through one violent episode after the other. The mood in the nation is explosive. And now this: just a day before the pope is set to arrive, more than 50 people died in the largest prison revolt in the country's history. What meaning does the pope's presence hold on such an occasion? Only one thing is certain: Francis won't be able to resolve the problems of the world's second largest Catholic nation in just a five-day trip. The unrealistic demands placed on him are not something he can fill. Yet the pope carries with him an important message: you don't have to love your enemies but you do need to speak with them. And he's living the example himself by meeting with the Russian Orthodox Patriarch Kirill on a stopover in Cuba on his way to Mexico. Cuba all over again It's sensational! Bannings and mutual ex-communications are ancient history. Nearly a millennium after the split, the head of the Roman Catholic Church and the head of the Russian Orthodox Church are speaking to each other. It's not as if the two will become friends - their positions are far too different. Yet their centuries-old enmity feels out of place and in view of the massive worldwide persecution of Christians, almost unchristian. And both of these church leaders know this. In Mexico, efforts to stem the polarizing forces at play in society have not been successful. The extreme differences between rich and poor are dividing Mexican society. President Enrique Peña Nieto has prioritized economic growth over dialogue with his critics - a group which includes students as well as teachers and union members who regularly protest against government policies. They demand an end to lawlessness and corruption. The presumed murder of 43 teaching students in Iguala in September 2014, a crime which remains unsolved, stands as a symbol of the lawlessness sweeping Mexico. The recent mutiny in a Monterrey jail serves as further proof of the country's shortcomings in regard to human rights and the rule of law. With a visit to Ciudad Juarez and the largest prison in Mexico, Francis will only make that deficiency more transparent. Even the pope of peace has enemies. The route he's chosen to take on his travels through the country has displeased the staunchly Catholic president. A meeting with the relatives of the Iguala victims is therefore hush-hush and participation in a holy mass remains secret. Considering the tense situation in the country, it's still possible that the pope's route will change once again. The church in the pillory Even within his own church, Francis has met with opposition. A meeting he requested with victims from the church's abuse scandal will not take place - a bitter disappointment for many former seminarians who were abused by Marcial Maciel, the founder of the Legion of Christ, and members of his order. It's just one example of how impunity continues even within the church itself. None of the perpetrators have yet to answer for their crimes in court. It appears as though the pope has accomplished more on the world stage than he has brought on reforms to the Vatican. Despite the revolutionary coming together of Cuba and the US and the revolutionary meeting with Patriarch Kirill, the revolution in Rome has yet to materialize. Do you have something to say?

},{"Generated text": " 'Torture' in Europe?
The Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPCT) has published a report on torture in the United States. The report, published on Tuesday, is part of the Council of Europe's efforts to tackle the issue.
It is the first report from the committee, which was commissioned by the US government to examine the CIA's use of torture as a weapon of war against the European Union (EU). It is based in Washington, D.C. and has been working for more than a decade. In the past few years, the Committee has worked closely with US President George W. Bush and his administration to prevent torture. Now, however, it has come to the conclusion that torture is not only a form of punishment, but also a means of repressing dissent. "The CIA has used torture to silence dissent," Carla Ferstman, head of Redress, told DW in an interview. She added that it was "not a crime" to use torture, and that "it is a violation of international law." The committee's report was published in November, a month before the end of Bush's term as US president. It was written in response to a request for information on the torture of US citizens in Iraq and Afghanistan. According to US intelligence officials, torture has become a common practice in many countries, including the UK, where it is illegal to torture children under the age of 18. But the report also found that there was no evidence to support the claim that CIA torture victims were being held in secret prisons. That is, until a US court ruled that they were not guilty of any crime under US law. However, this was not the case in this case. There was evidence that US authorities had been using torture against detainees in Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as in Libya and Libya. This was the second time in as many years that this had happened. At the same time, US officials have been accused of torturing and killing children in their home countries. These accusations are not supported by evidence. They are being investigated by US prosecutors, who have said they are looking into whether or not there were any violations of human rights in those countries or whether the detainees were tortured. DW's Judy Dempsey and Letif Hüseynov spoke to DW about the findings of a separate report published last year. What is important to note is that these allegations have not been proven to be true in any other country. For example, there is no proof that any of these cases were carried out at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, or anywhere else. Instead, they have all been found to have occurred in other countries where torture took place, such as Afghanistan, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Yemen, Lebanon, among other places. All of this has led to an increase in torture cases across the world, according to Amnesty International (Amnesty International) and the International Organization for Human Rights (IOSHR). The US has also accused the EU of not doing enough to protect the rights of its citizens, particularly those who are under threat of death or serious physical or psychological harm. Author: Michael G. Kuebler Editor: Martin Schulz Editor-in-Chief, DW, Newswire, London, 8/10/2017 Editor's Picks: Judith Dempsey, Carnegie Europe Editor, "It's a shame that we don't have the resources to do this, because we have a lot of work ahead of us," she said, adding: "We have to make sure we are doing it in a way that is fair and proportionate to our country's needs." DW: Is it possible that the new report will be published soon? Judy: Yes, I think it's possible. We have already seen the results of an investigation into the allegations made by former CIA Director John Brennan. I'm sure there are a number of people who would like to see this report made public. And I am sure that many of them would be very interested in seeing what happens next, if not more, in order to get a better understanding of what is going on. "
,"Reference text": " Report: Torture is a European problem too
A day after Amnesty International published a report on Europe's collusion with the CIA's torture program, the Council of Europe published its own shocking survey of abuse in detention centers across the continent.
Prison guards in several European countries carried out reprisals against detainees who talked to the Council of Europe's Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT), the new CPT report has revealed. The council considers this a violation of the spirit of cooperation between the CPT and the Council of Europe's member states. According to the CPT's 24th General Report, released on Wednesday, reprisals were carried out against prisoners in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Greece, Hungary, Moldova, Russia, Spain, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and Ukraine. "Intimidation or retaliation against persons the CPT has interviewed may not only violate their human rights but also strikes a blow to the preventive mechanism established by the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture," CPT President Letif Hüseynov said in a statement. "I urge national authorities to respect their obligation to prevent, investigate and punish such actions." The report also highlighted several problems with the detention of juveniles around Europe, and proposed a series of practical measures to protect young people's rights when detained. Ad hoc visits The little-known CPT, now 25 years old, represents a unique approach to international torture prevention. A team of specialists make roughly 180 visits a year to all kinds of detention centers (including prisons, police stations, holding centers for immigration detainees, psychiatric hospitals, and even social care homes) all across the 47-member Council of Europe - one of the few international blocs that offer platforms for dialogue with Eastern European regimes considered to have poor human rights records, such as Russia, Azerbaijan, and Ukraine. The method combines the carrot of talks with government officials and the stick of ad hoc visits, which all members are committed to allowing into their prisons. Once inside, the CPT also has the right to interview any detainees it chooses - in private, though of course the detainees have the right to refuse. "The first thing to say is how important the CPT is," said Carla Ferstman, director of Redress, a UK-based organization that helps torture survivors. "As a result of their boot work over a very long period of time, the UN has set up a global system which in many ways mirrors the approach of the CPT." But given that the committee has no powers to enforce its proposals to governments, there are question marks over its effectiveness. "In the report, they complain about how some of the recommendations they've made have not been implemented," said Ferstman. "It's a sign that they're a little bit frustrated." But in the long run, she maintains, the CPT has more than proved its value. "The dialogue that they are able to have is really important," she said. "Looking long-term, they have been very effective." CIA collusion, asylum seekers The CPT's report comes a day after Amnesty International released its own report on European collusion with the CIA's torture program. While the CPT's report examines more prosaic day-to-day mistreatment, rather than mass rendition of terrorist suspects at the behest of the US, there are obvious links between the two, since some countries - such as Poland, Macedonia, and the UK - are highlighted in both reports. "What is finally coming out in all of this is that the Europeans, despite all the criticism of the Bush and Obama administrations on the use of torture - so many of them connived," said Judy Dempsey, senior associate at Carnegie Europe. "It's really a double standard. This report is quite damning and quite shameful, and it follows the Amnesty International one as well." The CPT's work also mentions the mistreatment of asylum seekers, a problem increasingly afflicting European countries that take in the largest number of asylum seekers - particularly Spain, Italy, and Greece. "With Greece there are two things to remember," Dempsey told DW. "A - the appalling situation of the prison system, and B - the lack of training among police of how to deal with asylum seekers. Awful things have happened. Parallel to this is the illegal detention centers. There have been lots of cases of terrible mistreatment over the last several years." "Immigration detention is a growing issue," added Ferstman. "In the UK, there was a whole parliamentary inquiry into one immigration detention center, where some of the women alleged that guards propositioned them in order to get quick treatment on their claims. Each country has its own history of torture." "

The German city of Dresden has become a symbol of resistance to the Nazi regime. The city's mayor is a staunch supporter of anti-Islamism.
In Dresden, the city council has been meeting for the first time since the end of World War II to discuss the situation in the country. "We are very concerned about the future of our city," said the mayor, Yadegar Asisi, in an interview with DW. She added that she was "deeply concerned" by the recent events in Dresden and that there was a "growing sense of unease" among the residents about what was happening in their city. In particular, she said, "There is an increasing sense that we are in a state of disaffection with Islam." "I am very worried about our future," she added, adding that "we are not going to be able to cope with the consequences of what has happened in our country." The mayor's comments come as a surprise to many people who have come to Dresden to express their solidarity with Germany. Many of them, however, are from the Soviet Red Army, which was responsible for Germany's rise to power during the Cold War. They have also expressed concern that the German government is not doing enough to stop the rise of radical Islamism in Germany, especially among young people. This has led to a rise in tensions between the government and the Muslim community. DW's Naomi Conrad spoke to one of these people, who said that it was important for him to stand up for himself and his family. He also pointed out that he was not the only one who felt the need to speak out against radicalism, as he had been a member of a group called Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization (PEP) for many years. It is also important to remember that Germany was founded on the principles of tolerance and tolerance, not against it, but rather because of it. And this is something that has not always been the case with other German cities. For example, when the Nazis were in power, there were a number of German towns and cities that were under the influence of Islam. That is why it is so important that people are willing to take part in this kind of action, and not just because they want to live in harmony with one another. But also because there are a lot of Germans who don't agree with this. There are also many who do not like the way Germany is being governed and feel that they are being treated unfairly. I think it's a shame that so many of us have become so disillusioned with our own country and society. We have to learn to accept the fact that, despite all of this, we still have a long way to go.

,"Reference text": " Dresden marks 70 years since massive Allied bombing
Seventy years ago, Allied bombers attacked Dresden, killing tens of thousands of people, the majority of them civilians and refugees. Every year, the East German city remembers its dead. DW's Naomi Conrad was on hand.
As the tram trundled through Dresden's drab suburbs on Friday morning, a prim, elderly woman suddenly turned to her friend sitting on the seat beside her: "You know, my mother never told me about the bombings." She shrugged, then, after a moment's pause, continued. "It must have been such unspeakable hell that she just couldn't talk about it," the woman said. She was referring to February 13, 1945 - the morning, exactly 70 years ago, when Allied bombers swooped down on an unsuspecting city famous for its baroque architecture and that, until that point, had survived the war mostly unscathed. That was to change in the course of three dreadful days: As the bombs rained down on the city, its churches and palaces were turned to rubble. Up to 25,000 people - many of them refugees fleeing the advancing Soviet Red Army - died in the inferno that raged in the city for days. "There was nothing left, nothing," a frail, bent man with a checkered cap recalled, "just rubble and death." He was leaning on the balustrade of a viewing platform in Dresden's old gasometer, staring down at the 360-degree painting by the Iranian-German artist Yadegar Asisi; sirens howled from hidden speakers and strobe lighting illuminated the ruined churches and black smoke billowing from the burnt skeletons that were once buildings. The man swallowed, his voice hoarse, barely audible: "It's so hard being here." The soundtrack and images, he said, "bring back too many memories." 'So, so many dead' He was 15, he recalled, working on a school essay when the sirens began to wail. He never finished the essay. Instead, he ran for shelter with his family. When they returned home three days later, the roof had been blown off, the windows smashed. "But we were lucky: We survived," he said. "There were so, so many dead." His voice broke and, muttering an apology, he shuffled off. The bombings were intended to break the German population's morale - a decision that to many was incomprehensible, given that the war had long been decided and Dresden's economic and strategic importance was relatively minimal. Consequently, the death and destruction wreaked by the Allied bombers quickly became a tool, first for the Nazi propagandists in the last months of the war, then by the East German regime for its anti-West propaganda, and then later by neo-Nazi groups, who traditionally congregate on February 13. Even today, "the debate continues about guilt and innocence, even about the exact number of victims," Dresden Mayor Helma Orosz told a packed audience, including delegations from abroad, gathered for a memorial service in the city's Frauenkirche, which in 2005 was rebuilt with the help of private donations after Germany's reunification, many of them from the United States and Great Britain. Call for peace "War, hatred and violence begin in people's minds," Orosz said. "We must resist any attempt at once again categorizing people based on their origin and skin color," she added, referring to what has often been described as a right-wing catchall movement called PEGIDA, generally translated as Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West, which has taken to the streets in Dresden since October. Later, on a platform overlooking thousands of people, many of them wearing white roses as a sign of peace while bracing the icy cold outside the church, Orosz called on Dresden to remember every victim of the Nazi terror - a plea that was reiterated by German President Joachim Gauck when he took to the microphone: “We don't want the pain that people suffered here to be misused by others.” Behind him, the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, who, back in the Frauenkirche, had talked of the “miracle that peace in Europe represents,” leaned in closer to his interpreter. Then, as evening fell over Dresden and church bells tolled, thousands - possibly as many as 10,000, according to the city's press office - lined up along Dresden's riverfront, holding hands to commemorate the dead and call for peace as police men dressed in black riot gear looked on. "I can remember it all," Siegfriede Leonhard, a vivacious woman in her late 70s said. She was 7 when the bombs fell, she said, and had been coming to the commemorations in Dresden "for at least 60 years." Sometimes, she said, stomping her feet to keep warm, she wondered whether she shouldn't remember at home, "

The Afghan analysts network has published a report on the Taliban in Afghanistan, calling it a "threat" to the country's stability. The report, published in the Konrad Adenauer Institute in Kabul, is the latest in a series of reports that have been published by the Afghan government in recent weeks.
In the report released on Monday, the Kabul-based Afghan analyst network (AfD) said it had received more than 1,000 reports of Taliban attacks since the beginning of the year. "We have received a total of 2,500 reports," the group said, adding that the number of attacks on Afghan security forces was "increasing." "This is a very worrying development," said Nils Wörmer, an analyst with the Institute for Afghanistan Studies (KONARS), a think tank based in London. Afghan officials have said they have not received any information about the attacks, and that they are not aware of any new attacks. They have also said that there is no evidence that any attacks have taken place at the Qargha Lake resort in Parwan Province, which is one of Afghanistan's most popular tourist destinations. However, there has been speculation that some of these attacks may be linked to an increase in Taliban activity in neighboring Afghanistan. In the past, Afghan intelligence agencies have warned of a rise in militant activity, but the government has refused to confirm this. Last year, a Taliban-led insurgency claimed responsibility for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Afghan civilians, many of whom had fled their homes to escape the war-ravaged country. Since the fall of President Hamid Karzai in 2009, Afghanistan has seen a surge in insurgent activity. But this year's Taliban insurgency has not only increased, it has also spread to other provinces, as well as the capital, Kabul. According to a new report published last week, Taliban insurgents have increased their presence in Afghan cities and towns, including the city of Ghazni and the provincial capital of Kandahar. This has led to fears that more attacks could be imminent. Read more: Afghanistan: What is happening to its stability? The Taliban have seized control of large swathes of territory and are planning to use it as a base for their insurgency. It is not clear how long the insurgents will hold on to power and whether they will be able to hold onto power for long periods of time. There is also a growing concern over the security situation in Pakistan, where there are fears of an imminent collapse of democracy and a possible rise of militant groups. A recent report from the Afghanistan Institute of Political Economy (AIPE) found that Pakistan's military and intelligence services have stepped up their efforts to combat the insurgency, saying that it is "a threat to our security and stability." In a statement issued on Tuesday, Pakistani Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said his government had made "significant progress" in its fight against the "Islamic State" (IS, formerly known as "ISIL"). "It is very important to us that we have the capacity to fight the ISIL," Abadi told AFP news agency. He added that "we have to be prepared to face the consequences of our actions if we are going to continue to act in this way." The study also pointed out that, despite the fact that Afghanistan is still a relatively small country, its population is growing at a rate of about 1.5 million people per square kilometer (1.6 million square miles) per year - a figure that could rise to 2.7 million by 2050, according to Kabul government figures. Afghanistan also has a long way to go before it can become a major power-hungry state.

,"Reference text": " Experts: Taliban have not changed strategy with Kabul restaurant attack
The weekend attack on a Kabul restaurant frequented by foreigners came as no surprise to international organizations on the ground. Experts don't believe the Taliban have changed their strategy to target more civilians.
Dramatic scenes must have played out in the restaurant: Guests sought cover under tables as a group of terrorists shot wildly into the dining rooms. News agencies report the restaurant owner tried in vain to fend off the attackers. He was among the more than 20 people who perished, most of whom were employees at international organizations. The attackers were also among the dead. During the evening dinner rush, at 7:00 p.m. Friday (17.01.2014), one of three Taliban members detonated his explosives-laden vest and blew a breach in the highly secured restaurant. Neither the man-high blast walls, nor the secured access points with armed guards could stop the attackers. The two remaining terrorists were killed later in a firefight with security forces at the scene. No change in Taliban strategy The suicide bombing on the popular Lebanese restaurant, Taverna Du Liban, in the high-end Kabul neighborhood of Wazir Akbar Khan was the worst attack so far in 2014. Afghanistan votes for a new president in April; and the international troops are scheduled to withdraw from the country by the end of the year. Although there are plans for a small contingent to remain in Afghanistan, President Hamid Karzai first has to sign a bilateral security agreement with the United States. But he continues to play for time. In this context, the Taliban may be targeting civilians more in order to drive out not just the military coalition, but the entire international community. Yet "as horrible as this incident is, I don't see a change in strategy," said Thomas Ruttig, the co-director of the Afghan Analysts Network. Similar attacks have also been launched before, "at least 12 to 15 times in the past eight years," Ruttig said. The worst attack was in 2012 at Qargha Lake, a popular weekend destination near Kabul. More than 20 people were killed, all of them Afghans. Extensive security precautions The Taliban, which normally doesn't miss an opportunity for fiery rhetoric, hasn't declared a change in strategy. A spokesman for the Islamist militant group said the attack was retaliation for a NATO airstrike in Parwan Province, a few kilometers north of Kabul. According to an assistant of the Afghan president, seven children and one woman died in the coalition strike. "You have to carefully monitor the security situation," Nils Wörmer, head of the Konrad Adenauer Institute in Kabul, told DW. "But I think it's a bit early to talk about a change in [Taliban] strategy." Wörmer's office lies just a few hundred meters from the site of Friday's attack. He could clearly hear the explosion, which shook the window panes in his office. "It was immediately clear to me that something had happened," Wörmer recounted. But the Konrad Adenauer Institute was prepared. "We had a relatively concrete warning in the last week related to our neighborhood, and we were very cautious," Wörmer said. He met with colleagues in his secured office. Like most of the international organizations, the Konrad Adenauer Institute is also integrated into the security networks. "The security precautions are high," Wörmer said. "But that doesn't exclude the possibility that something similar could happen again." But the Afghan security forces have succeeded in preventing many attacks in the past few months, he said. Kabul residents criticize Taliban An informal, impromptu poll by DW's Kabul correspondent, Hussein Sirat, suggested the Taliban are not winning Afghan hearts and minds with such attacks. "Wherever the Taliban have killed civilians, they have not achieved their goal," said Mirwais, a pedestrian in the Kabul city center. Idris, another Kabul resident, seconded Mirwais' sentiment. "The Taliban intimidate the people so that the security agreement won't be signed," he said. "But the people won't bend to this intimidation." How the international organizations adapt to the tense security situation in Kabul will come after many conversations, analyses, and briefings in the following days. But Wörmer is not thinking about giving up. "We have a clear agenda and long-term projects, which I considered to be very sensible," Wörmer said. "I am of the opinion, as I was before, that what I'm doing here with the Konrad Adenauer Institute is worth the risks." "

The University of Stellenbosch in South Africa has launched an investigation into allegations that the country's water supply is being manipulated.
Marelize Botes, a water expert at the South African Bureau of Standards (SBS), told Deutsche Welle that it is "highly likely" that corruption in the water industry is the main reason for the current scandal. "We have a lot of doubts about the integrity of the system," she said, adding that there is no evidence to support the allegations. However, she added, the investigation will be conducted by the SBS, which is part of Maplecroft, an international law firm that specializes in environmental law. The investigation is expected to be completed by mid-2018. According to the report, it could take up to two years before the results are published. Bote, who has been working with Cloete for more than a year, said it was "very difficult" to determine whether the scandal was the result of a deliberate attempt to influence the outcome of an internal investigation. She said the probe was being conducted "in the interest of transparency and accountability." "It is very difficult to say for certain whether corruption is a factor in this scandal," said her husband, Eugen, in an interview with the German news agency dpa. It is also not clear whether there are any other allegations against the government, or whether it's just a matter of time before it comes to a conclusion. In the past, there have been accusations of bribery, corruption and abuse of power. But in recent years, this has not been the case, with allegations levelled against a number of government officials, including the former finance minister, Finance Minister Jacob Zuma, and the minister of state for water and sanitation. Last year's investigation found that bribery and corruption were the primary reasons for corruption, according to an official report released last year. This was followed by a series of investigations into the corruption of public officials and public servants. At the same time, several corruption allegations were brought to light, leading to charges that were later dropped. One of those charges was for failing to report a crime. Another charge was levied against an individual who was found to have violated the terms of his contract. Both charges were dismissed on the grounds that he was not guilty of any crime, but the charges against him were dropped after he pleaded guilty to one count of making false statements to investigators. He was also charged with perjury and obstruction of justice in connection with his role in a corruption scandal involving the awarding of bribes to politicians and other officials. bp/msh (dpa, Reuters, AP, DPA, AFP, hw/smsd/AP) Editor's note: This is not the first time that a researcher has come under fire for his work on water quality. There have also been allegations made against other researchers who have worked with water companies, as well as the Ministry of Water and Power, that they were involved in fraudulent activities. These allegations are being investigated by an independent panel of experts who are investigating the matter. They are also being brought before a court in Pretoria, where the trial is scheduled to take place next month. Author: Michael Kuebler Editor: David M. Mascarenhas Editor-in-Chief: The Washington Post, June 12, 2017 Editor Editor, Peter R. Rieger: "This is an interesting case in itself. We are not talking about corruption here at all. I don't think there's anything wrong with corruption. What I am saying is that we are dealing with a very serious problem. That is something that is going on in our country and we have to do something about it," he said. mrc/jm (AFP, dp, DW, EFE, pd) (Reuters, jm, ewpa), pfd/kms (jd, bw, sf, rd), who is based in Johannesburg, told DW he believes corruption was a major factor behind the recent scandal and that "there's no doubt in my mind that this is happening."

,"Reference text": " Teabag filter cleans water with nanotechnology
A new water filter developed in South Africa could provide millions of people with clean drinking water. The filter, about the size and shape of a teabag, would be inexpensive, easy to distribute and simple to use.
Marelize Botes is conducting a final set of tests on a new type of diminutive water filter before industrial production can begin. The microbiologist pours water from a plastic bottle though a high-tech, teabag-sized filter before analyzing it in her in her laboratory at the University of Stellenbosch in South Africa. "The filter is much cheaper than bottled water as well as any other filter on the market," she told Deutsche Welle. Instead of being filled with black or green tea, the bag contains active carbon granules and is made from nanofibers treated with biocide, which kills bacteria rather than simply filtering them from the water. Nanotech for pennies "This project takes nanotechnology to the poorest of the poor people who live in this world, and it will make a difference in their lives," said Eugen Cloete, who in addition to inventing the filter is dean of the faculty of science at Stellenbosch University and chair of Stellenbosch University's Water Institute. With some 300 million people in Africa - and over a billion worldwide - living without access to clean drinking water, the need for such a filter is huge. When in mass production, the developers said they expect the teabag to cost just a few South African cents (under half a US cent and under a third of a euro cent). In addition to being inexpensive, Botes said, the filter is also easy to distribute to rural area and simple to use as it can be place in an adapter that fits on nearly any regular-sized plastic bottle. Each filter can clean one liter (one quart) of the most polluted water to the point where it is completely safe to drink. Once used, the filter can be disposed of and is biodegradable. African countries, led by Somalia, Mauritania and Sudan, were ranked to have the most vulnerable water supplies, according to a June report by UK-based risk consultancy firm Maplecroft. Decentralized use The filter's small size and light weight make it ideal for rural areas where other means of filtration do not exist, Cloete said. "It is simply impossible to build purification infrastructure at every polluted stream," Cloete said. "So we have to take the solution to the people. The water is cleaned right then and there when you drink from the bottle." The filter is now undergoing testing by the South African Bureau of Standards, after which Cloete and his team hope it can be rolled out to the United Nations and non-governmental organizations that have expressed interest in it by the end of the year. The project grew out of research into larger filters, according to Cloete. "We were busy developing filters for larger applications, but when you do the tests in the labatory you do the tests on a much smaller scale," he said. "The results we were getting on a smaller amount of water promoted me to think about a smaller application." Author: Joerg Poppendieck, Sean Sinico Editor: Anke Rasper "

I can't remember the last time I was in one of those bad situations where I had to go to the emergency room and get something to eat. It's not that bad, it's just that the situation is so bad that you have to get out of the house and go somewhere else. But that doesn't make it any easier to deal with. And that's exactly what we're doing here. We're going to try and figure out a way to make sure that we have everything we need in order to be successful in the future. So we'll see how it goes. Let's start with the basics. First of all, let's look at the basic basics of life: food, water, shelter, clothing, shoes, etc. The basic basic necessities are what you need to live a normal life. Everything else is a waste of time and effort. This is where the problem lies. There's a lot of work to do, and it all depends on how you do it. For example, if you want to learn how to cook, you can do that by reading the instructions. Then you'll be able to find out what the rules are for cooking. You'll also learn about the benefits of cooking for a living, which is why I've always wanted to write a cookbook for my family. Also, I have always been a fan of cookbooks, especially when it comes to cooking, because I love cooking and I like to read recipes that are good for me. They're easy to come by on the internet and they're great for the kids, too! And they have a great recipe for pizza, so they can have pizza all day long! But the real challenge is finding a recipe that works for them, not just for you, but for all of us. If we can find one that is good enough for us, then we've got to have it for our kids. Otherwise, we won't have any problems at all. In fact, the recipe is pretty good. Just about everything in life is made up of recipes and ingredients. All the ingredients are just as good as the ones in your recipe, except for one ingredient: salt. Salt is the key ingredient in making sure your food is safe and that it contains enough salt to last you through the day. salt is also a good ingredient for people who are allergic to salt and are intolerant of salt, as well as for those who have allergies.Salt is not a substitute for salt but salt can be used to treat salt in certain foods, such as meat and vegetables. However, salt does not make salt taste good and salt tastes good, even if it tastes like salt water. Therefore salt has a negative effect on your taste buds and the taste is bad for your health. What's the best thing about salt? Salt and pepper can make you feel better and more like a human being, at least in terms of health and well-being, is that salt will help you stay hydrated and your body will adapt to your diet and reduce the salt content. With salt there is no salt or pepper to taste better than salt - and this is especially true for men and women, who need salt for their bodies. "Salt salt" is salt that has been used for centuries and is very important for many people's health, including children and young people, to keep them healthy and to prevent them from developing diseases like cancer. Salmonella is another important ingredient that helps prevent salt from entering the body. Sodium is an important component in salt-soluble compounds. These compounds have been shown to work in many different ways to help reduce salt levels in food and make them more effective in reducing salt production. Vitamin D can also be a powerful antioxidant. iodine is essential for calcium absorption and helps to reduce cholesterol levels. Add calcium levels are also important in helping to combat salt deficiencies. "
,"Reference text": " How to wrap a present without using paper or tape
Next time you get invited to a birthday party, you could try wrapping the present using a piece of fabric and ribbon. It's very easy and the best bit is, it can be reused. Maybe it will come back to you on your birthday.
1. All you need is a piece of fabric big enough to wrap your gift, a ribbon long enough to go right around it, and if you want to make a gift tag, you will also need a piece of old cardboard, a hole punch and another small piece of ribbon. Ready? 2. No, wait, we forgot the present. Get that, and you have everything you need. Spread the fabric on the ground and put your gift on top 3. Fold the fabric around the gift you are wrapping 4. With the last little bit, you don't tuck it under, but create a little flap on top 5. Fold that flap over like this 6. Take one end of the parcel and tuck the fabric inside, BEHIND the gift inside 7. You can take your time to wiggle it all inside. Make it as flat as you can 8. Once it is all inside, turn to the other end and do the same thing again 9. When you have done both ends, it should look like this. Your present is all tucked up inside and you don't need any tape to keep it closed 10. Now for the ribbon. Place the gift on top of it 11. Tie the bow 12. So it looks like this. Finished? If you want a gift tag, that comes now. If you don't you're done! 13. Cut a piece out of an old cardboard box and make a hole in it using a hole punch. Watch your fingers though ;) 14. Put a piece of short ribbon through your hole 15. Tie the tag to your gift 16. And you are finished! P.S. You can either ask your friend to reuse the fabric, and show them how to wrap with it, or if they don't like that idea, you can take it home with you to use again the next time. And remember, you don't have to buy the fabric. You can use an old pillow case, an old t-shirt or skirt, or whatever you want. You can even make your ribbon from an old t-shirt if you don't have any. Happy wrapping. "

A European court of justice is set to hear the case of a German university professor accused of plagiarism. The case is being investigated by the European Commission.
The court will decide whether the professor violated the constitution by plagiarizing the works of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, which was published in the German edition of "Die Welt." The court is expected to rule on Monday on whether or not the professors plagiarized the work. "The professor is not a professor of law," the court said in a statement, adding that it was "not appropriate for him to be involved in such a case." "He is an expert on the subject, and he has a very good understanding of the legal system," it added. But it is unclear whether he will be able to prove his innocence, or if he'll be allowed to appeal the ruling. In the past, the university has been criticized by critics for its treatment of students, particularly those who have been studying in Germany. It has also faced criticism over its handling of student protests in recent years, including one in which a student was arrested and charged with sedition. However, it has since been cleared of all charges and is now free to return to Germany, according to a court filing.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel has rejected a Turkish request to extradite him from Turkey to face trial over the alleged plagiarization of his works. Merkel, however, has said that she will not allow the Turkish courts to interfere in her case. She also rejected the request for extradition, saying it would be "unacceptable" for her to do so. Germany is the only country in Europe that has not been extradited to the United States for questioning the content of its books, she said. German Chancellor Merkel also said she would not accept extradition to Turkey, where she is currently living with her husband and their two children. Both Merkel and Merkel have said they would like to see an extradition hearing before the end of this year. h/msh (AP, AFP, dpa, Reuters)
Germany's Bundesbank said on Friday it had decided not to pursue extradition proceedings against the accused professor, who was found guilty in absentia last year of violating the terms of an EU-Turkey extradition agreement. Ankara has denied the charges, arguing that they were politically motivated and that the judge's decision was based on a "misinterpretation of German law." Germany and the EU have long been at odds over how to deal with the issue, with both sides saying they want to make sure that Turkey is treated fairly and with respect to its legal obligations under the Vienna Convention on Human Rights. They have also argued that Germany should not have to pay the costs of extraditing the student, but rather that Ankara should be given a chance to explain why it should have the right to free speech and freedom of expression in its own country. As a result, Germany has agreed to cooperate with Turkish authorities in their search for a new university president, as well as with other EU member states, in order to ensure that Turkish students receive the same level of academic freedom as they do in other European countries. This is in line with Germany's position as a European Union member state. After all, this is a country with a high degree of authoritarianism and a long history of anti-Semitism. There is no reason to believe that a university should refuse to accept students from other countries, even if the students themselves are not qualified to take part in this process. That is why Germany wants to work with Ankara to find a solution to this problem, rather than with Brussels and Brussels. According to an official statement from the Federal Office for Justice and Development (FEDD), "Germany is committed to working with Turkey on this issue and will continue to support Turkey's efforts to achieve a fair and just outcome for the citizens of Europe." In other words: "We have a duty to protect the rights of European citizens and to uphold the values and principles of freedom and equality." "
,"Reference text": " European court overturns law requiring German-language skills for spouse visas
The European Court of Justice has overturned a German law requiring foreign spouses from certain non-EU countries to take a language test before receiving a visa. The ruling primarily affects Germany's Turkish minority.
The European Union's highest court on Thursday ruled in favor of a Turkish citizen, who was denied a visa to live in Germany with her husband, because she was illiterate and therefore unable to demonstrate basic German-language skills. According to the court, a lack of language skills shouldn't automatically lead to the rejection of an entry visa application. Instead, Germany must consider the unique circumstances of each individual case. The court went on to say that quickly granting visas for spouses improves the quality of life and promotes the integration of foreign residents. Specifically addressing the case of the Turkish plaintiff, the court ruled that the rejection of her visa had violated a bilateral treaty between Turkey and the EU. In 1970, Brussels and Ankara agreed not to tighten their residency laws for each other's citizens. Law only applies to some In 2007, Germany introduced the requirement that spouses from certain non-EU countries must demonstrate a basic grasp of German before being granted a visa to live in Germany with their husbands or wives. Spouses affected by the law are required to obtain a basic language certificate from recognized centers, such as Germany's Goethe Institute, proving that they have an A1 level, or "Beginning German" language ability. The German government claims that the goal of the language requirement is to prevent forced marriages as well as marriages made simply for the sake of obtaining a visa. Citizens of European Free Trade Association (EFTA) member states are exempt from the language requirement. That includes Iceland, Lichtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. In addition, citizens of Australia, Canada, Israel, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea and the United States also don't have to demonstrate German-language skills. slk/xx (AFP, AP, dpa, KNA) "

A 3-2 win over Freiburg on Saturday has boosted Bayern's hopes of a repeat of last season's Bundesliga title triumph.
The Bavarian side have won three of their last four games in the Bundesliga, including a 1-0 win at home to Hoffenheim on Sunday. It was the first time Bayern had beaten a top-flight side in four years. The win was a resounding success for the Bavarians, who have been on a tear since the end of the 2015-16 season. Bayern, however, will have to settle for a draw in their first Bundesliga match since taking over the top spot in 2014-15, when they lost 2-1 to Cologne. They will be hoping to get back into the Champions League next season, but they have a tough task in front of them. "We are in a very difficult position right now," Bayern midfielder Mario Gomez said after the match, referring to the fact that his side had lost their previous three matches. He added that he was "very happy" with the result, saying that it was an "extraordinary feeling" to be able to play against a team that has been struggling for so long to find a way to win the league. But it's not just Bayern who are struggling. There are also a number of other teams that have struggled in recent weeks, such as Cologne, Cologne and Schalke, as well as the likes of Dortmund and Bayern Munich. In addition, there is also the question of whether the German side can keep up with their recent form, which has seen them win just one of its last three league games. That's a big question mark for Bayern. How long will it be before they can make a run at the title again? The German club has a lot of work to do to make sure that they don't fall into a trap, and that's why they've been so successful so far in this campaign. On Saturday, they'll be looking to build on last year's record of four consecutive Bundesliga titles, while they will also be trying to improve on the form of recent seasons. For the second time in as many years, Bayern have had to rely on their star players to step up their game. Last year, the club's star player, Papiss Demba Cisse, scored his first league goal for his club, a goal that earned him a place in Germany's top flight. Since then, he's made a name for himself as a player and has played a key role in helping the team to reach the European Cup final in Russia. His goal against Cologne was just the latest example of how Bayern can improve their chances of reaching the final. After a difficult first season in Europe, Germany is now in its third year in which it has struggled to maintain a positive image of itself as an important European club. At the same time, though, it is still difficult to see Bayern as anything other than a club with a reputation for being a great football team. So far, that hasn't been the case. Even if they do get a chance to qualify for Europe's elite club competition, this year they're not going to have the luxury of doing so. And that is a problem for them, because they haven't had the opportunity to prove themselves as much as they would like to. If they want to, then they need to show they are a good team, not a bad team with good players and a solid squad. However, if that doesn't happen, you can't expect them to stick around for long. As a result of all the problems Bayern has had in getting past the relegation zone, their opponents have become more and more defensive and defensive-minded. This is especially true when it comes to defending their title, especially against relegation-threatened teams like Cologne or Bayern and Borussia Monchengladbach. You can see why Bayern are so desperate to avoid relegation, even if it means conceding a few more goals than they did last time out. What's more important is that Bayern continue to work hard to keep the pressure on them in order to stay on top of things. To do that, one has to take care of business and make the most out of it. "

The head of Slovakia's Communist Party has died in a prison camp in Iran. His son was among those who died.
On Monday, Slovakia announced the death of its communist leader, who was sentenced to life in prison for the murder of his son in the Iranian city of Isfahan in 2006. The sentence was handed down by a court in Bratislava on Monday. Slovakia is one of the world's poorest countries, according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), which monitors the country's political and economic affairs. In a statement, the government said it was "deeply saddened" by the deaths. "We are deeply saddened by this tragic event," the statement said. It also said that the Slovaks were "shocked and shocked" at the loss of their son's life and that they had no idea what had happened to him. But it did not say how many people were killed or injured, or how long the prison term would last. A number of people have died since the end of communism in Slovakia, including the president and prime minister, and hundreds of thousands of others have been imprisoned. Slovakia's president has been in exile for more than a decade, but he has not yet been formally charged with any crime. He has said he will appeal the decision to a lower court, which will decide whether he should be allowed to stay in office or be forced to resign. On Tuesday, he announced that he would step down from his post as president, effective immediately, in order to focus on his work as a political leader and as an ambassador to Iran, where he hopes to build a better relationship with the United States and the European Union. At the same time, his wife and two young children will be able to return to their home countries and live with their parents and step-fathers. They will also have the opportunity to travel to Tehran to meet with Iranian President Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and his family. There is no word yet on when the funeral will take place.   The death toll could rise to as many as 1,000, if not more, depending on the time of year. Last year, a total of 2,500 people died when a bomb went off near the border between Iran and Slovakia. Most of those killed were Iranian nationals and their families, while the rest were American citizens. Some of them had been living in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Italy, Spain, France, Britain, Japan, Germany and Switzerland. Many of these deaths were caused by an explosion at a gas station in Tehran in November 2006 that killed at least 10 people and injured dozens more. One man died of a heart attack when he fell from a burning car while trying to flee the scene. Another man was shot and killed in an attempt to stop the fire. Two others were seriously injured when they tried to escape the burning vehicle. Both men are believed to be in their 30s or 40s and are in critical condition.

Eight people in total were arrested in May after taking photographs of restricted areas. A Slovakian news website said the group was detained near the central city of Isfahan, where Iran has nuclear facilities.

"We had information that there was a ban on taking photographs below the height of 2,300 metres. We were taking pictures from higher (altitudes)," said Frigo. He added that the detainees were well treated, had access to television, a refrigerator and could cook for themselves as well as getting regular meals.

French President Emmanuel Macron faces an uphill battle to win a second term in office. He faces a tough challenge from the far-right candidate Marine Le Pen.
France's president-elect, François Fillon, faces the challenge of winning the presidential election on Sunday. "I'm not going to give up," he told DW's Kevser Taspinar in the Elysee neighborhood of Paris on Saturday. The candidate, who is running for the right-wing National Front (FN) party's presidential nomination, is expected to lose the first round of voting in Sunday's runoff election, which will be decided by a vote of no confidence in his or her supporters. If he wins, he will face a tougher challenge than his main rival, Socialist candidate Jean-Luc Melenchon. In the second round, the FN candidate will have to fend off a strong field of candidates from both the center-left and the left-leaning Les Republicains parties. It will also be up to the voters to decide whether or not to vote for him or if they want him to run for president again. There is already a lot of debate about who should be the next president of France, and it is not clear who will win the election. But it's clear that there is a clear majority of voters who want to see a change in France's political landscape. Many of those who have voted for Macron have been disillusioned with the current government and its policies. Some of them are not even aware of the fact that Macron has been elected. Others, such as former French Prime Minister Nicolas Sarkozy, are convinced that he is the only candidate who can win an election in a country where the polls are so close. They don't know what to make of Macron's victory, but they are sure that the French president will not be able to do anything about it. So far, it seems to be a mixed bag. On the other hand, there are a number of people who are still undecided about the outcome of this election and are hoping that it will lead to a new wave of presidential candidates. One of these people is François Hamon, a French journalist who has worked in politics for more than 30 years and has spent his entire career in journalism and politics as a journalist and political commentator. His political career has seen him become the face of French politics in recent years. And he's not just talking about Macron - he has also been the leader of a political party for a long time. As far back as the 1970s, his party was known for its anti-communist rhetoric. Now, however, that rhetoric has become more and more extreme. At the beginning of last year, French President François Hollande announced he would be stepping down from his post as head of state in order to focus on his own party. This was a bold move by Hollande, whose party is now in third place in opinion polls. However, Hollande has not yet announced his intention to step down as president. Instead, Macron will stay in power until the end of next year's election campaign, when he hopes to form a coalition government with his conservative party, Les Républicains (Le Pen), which is currently in its second phase of its presidential campaign. Hollande's campaign has already been criticized by some quarters for being too soft on migrants and refugees, while Macron is seen as too hard on the poor, especially in rural areas. Macron, meanwhile, has said he wants to build a "new generation" of young people to take part in this new generation of politics. That's a good thing, because it means that more people are coming to France and that's something that is important for them to have in their own country. For many of us, this is an important step in our country's history. We've seen it happen in other parts of Europe, as well as in countries like Germany, Austria, Switzerland and France. What's more important is that French voters have a chance to elect a president who they can trust to lead their country to victory. These are the things that make France a better country, not only in terms of economic and social development but also for people's lives. "

This year's French presidential race is perhaps the most closely watched election in recent history. Many voters are still undecided, including those in the Paris café where DW's Jake Cigainero saw the latest TV debate.
Just over two weeks ahead of the first round of voting in France's presidential election, all 11 candidates met for the second televised debate of the campaign. It was the first time in the history of French elections that the entire official ballot shared a television stage. This race for the Elysee is perhaps the most closely watched election in the history of the Fifth Republic in view of conservative candidate Francois Fillon's embezzlement charges, the deterioration of the left, political amateur Emmanuel Macron's surprise surge to the top, and the rise of Marine Le Pen's National Front. With so much media attention on the five main candidates, Tuesday's debate felt almost like a consolation for the six other candidates rarely in the spotlight. For French voters watching the televised debate at Cafe des Phares on Place de la Bastille, the saturated stage kept the candidates from detailed discussion of pressing issues. For those who are still undecided, the debate did little to bring them closer to choosing their pick for president. Vincent Couronne, a researcher, said it was good to see candidates who don't get as much media attention. However, 11 candidates at once for the political spectator was overkill. "It wasn't very interesting. It's just one position after another. There's no real debate. It's not like when it was just five candidates." Boredom all round Charlotte Theuvenin and her friends, all students in their early 20s, tuned out early on from boredom and exasperation. "It was too flat and too hypocritical. Fillon and Le Pen play with our money, then say they did nothing and that they are good for our country," she said. As though addressing the candidates in front of her on the TV screen, she added, "How dare you talk about being president when you use our money for your own interests." Le Pen had come under fire over accusations that she misused public funds to pay bodyguards as parliamentary assistants. Francois Fillon of Les Republicains, meanwhile, is under investigation for allegedly paying family members more than 1 million euros ($1.1 million) for government work they never carried out. Frequently casting a blank stare at his opponents, Fillon also seemed bored, or at least more subdued compared to the first debate. Couronne said, "Fillon seems to be not there. Probably because he knows all the small candidates can attack him on the criminal offenses he's accused of." Debate watchers cited Europe as the most important issue of this election, with many fearing Le Pen's promise to tear France out of the European Union in a so-called Frexit. Though no one at the cafe vocally supported Le Pen's plan, several acknowledged the EU is a pressure point for France. "France's place in Europe in relation to Germany is a very important issue," said student Thibault Cirier. "The general problem is France has lost its influence at the European level over the years, and that needs to be remedied, because France is one of the founders of Europe and should have a strong place in the union. The EU is also important for cohesion and to have a strong position internationally." Café viewers say no to Le Pen Cirier was initially excited by Macron when he launched his campaign, but ultimately decided there was no substance. Now he says he will probably vote for far-left candidate Jean-Luc Melenchon. Kevser Taspinar also said she liked Melenchon for his fighting spirit and that "he throws barbs." As a practicing Muslim who wears a headscarf, she said the most important issue for her is laicite, France's state institution of secularism. "For me Hamon has the best interpretation of this. Maybe Hamon," Taspinar said hesitating. "I'm still undecided, because there's Melenchon." Another viewer, Marie Dubois, said that although she really liked Melenchon, she had definitively decided on Macron. "Melenchon has a way of putting humanity in politics and giving hope," she said. "But Macron is the only possible candidate." With polls putting Le Pen and Macron in the second round on May 7, the undecided voters at this Paris cafe said they were certain which candidate they would not for vote for in that scenario. "Definitely Macron. There is no way I am going to vote for Le Pen," Theuvenin said. "I will never vote for that woman or Front National, no matter who is running against them in the second round." Tuesday was the final debate for Macron and Melenchon, two of the crowd-pleasers among the candidates. Both have pulled out of the third debate on grounds that it cuts too close to the first vote just two days later on April 23. "

Frankfurt am Main, Germany (AP) - The German Interior Ministry has issued a statement calling for the immediate end of terror attacks in Germany.
The statement came hours after the German interior minister said the threat posed by terrorism was "a crime."
"Terrorists are a criminal organization," the statement said, referring to the terrorist organization known as the "Islamic State." The statement also said that "terrorists" were responsible for a number of attacks, including attacks on police officers and civilians. "Terrorist organizations are not allowed to carry out attacks without the approval of the authorities," it said. The statements came after German Chancellor Angela Merkel called on the international community to cooperate in the fight against terrorism. German media reported that the attack was carried out in response to a request by the Islamic State (IS) to launch an investigation into the group's activities. Germany's interior ministry said it was not aware of any such request and that it had not received a response from the IS. However, a spokesman for Berlin's state security agency, the Federal Office for Security and Cooperation in Europe (FOSCE), told Reuters news agency that there was no immediate threat to national security. Berlin has been criticized for its handling of terrorism in recent years, with the Berlin government accusing Berlin of failing to act on its own security concerns. Last year, Berlin was accused of providing a "hostile environment" for terrorist attacks. In the aftermath of World War II, German authorities said they had launched a counter-terrorism operation. They also warned that they would not be able to prevent the spread of radical Islamist ideology, which they called "Islamist terrorism." Berlin, however, denied the allegations, saying it would cooperate with international law enforcement agencies in their investigation. It was the first time that a German government official had been charged with terrorism since the September 11, 2001, attacks that killed more than 1,000 people in a single day. At the time, there were no reports of a terrorist attack on German soil, but the government had warned the public that such attacks were likely to occur. Security forces have been deployed across the country since September, when a bomb was discovered near the city of Frankfurt. According to German officials, it is not yet known whether the bomb had detonated. There have also been reports that German police are searching for suspects in connection with a series of bombings that have killed at least 10 people. Police have said there are no indications that any of those suspects are being held in custody, although they are believed to have fled the area in an attempt to avoid detection by German security forces. On Friday, police in Frankfurt, where the attacks took place, said a police spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was under investigation for his role in setting up the blast site. He said he had no information about the incident, adding that he did not know what was going on. A police spokeswoman said police were still searching the site for any possible suspects. Earlier this week, authorities in Berlin announced they were looking into a possible connection between the bombing and the Sept. 11 attacks by a suicide bomber and a group of suspected members of al Qaeda.

Berlin: Terrorist attacks continue to escalate The Berlin-based terror organization has launched an operation to try and disrupt the world's most dangerous terrorist networks, according to media reports, and has so far been successful in doing so. But there is still a long way to go before it will be possible to reach a conclusion on whether or not this operation will succeed in its goal of eliminating the terror threat. After all, this is just one of many terrorist organizations that operate within Germany, as well as in other European countries, such as Syria, Iraq, Iran and North Africa.

,"Reference text": " German Interior Ministry Claims Progress on Crime
Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble released his department's official statistics concerning crime in 2006 in Berlin on Tuesday. And the news was good -- most of the numbers were down compared to the preceding year.
Germany's streets were never particularly dangerous, but according to the Interior Ministry, they are now safer than at any time since statistics have been collected. Reported criminal offenses on the whole dropped by 1.4 percent over 2005 -- to a total of just over 6.3 million. "The statistics show reductions in crime among children, adolescents and teenagers, as well as adults," said Schäuble. He added that criminality among foreigners living in Germany also fell, saying that this development reflected Germany's efforts to integrate non-Germans. Drugs offenses were down 7.8 percent, followed by theft and street crime, which both declined by four percent or more. Youth violence Vandalism, on the other hand, was up 5.9 percent. Fraud rose slightly, as did violent crime -- among young people by an alarming 4.5 percent. Berlin Interior Minister Erhart Körting said that was part of a decade-long trend in Germany. "As many experts have pointed out," Körting said, "the potential for violence in society is increasing." The head of the German Police Officers' Union Konrad Freiberg also said those figures showed that German society was not truly getting safer. Frankfurt tops most-dangerous list Crime was down in Frankfurt am Main, but it's still the German city with the greatest number of criminal offenses per 100,000 people. Hanover was a close second, followed by Düsseldorf, Bremen and Berlin. The total percentage of criminal cases solved by German police also improved slightly from 55 to 55.4 percent. According to the study, Germany's safest place was Bergisch Gladbach, a city of 100,000 inhabitants in the west of the country -- coincidentally, model Heidi Klum's home town. " 

},{"Generated text": " Bundesliga: Petr Cech takes on Bayern Munich in Champions League final
The 21-year-old goalkeeper has been named man of the match in the German Cup final against Borussia Dortmund on Sunday.
Cech is the man to lead the Blues into the final of Sunday's competition in Munich, where they will take on Barcelona at the Allianz Arena. The Blues, who have won three of their last four league matches, will be hoping to avoid a repeat of last year's disappointment when they lost to Real Madrid. "I'm very happy to be a part of this team and I'm looking forward to the next challenge," said the Chelsea goalkeeper, whose side have already qualified for the knockout stage. He will face a tough task in his first match back in charge of a club that has struggled to keep up with the pace of life in Europe's top flight. A win over Barcelona would be the first time in seven years that a team from the Premier League has won the competition. It would also mark a return to European football's most prestigious competition, the UEFA Cup, which began in 2006 and runs until the end of 2017. In the Bundesliga, Bayern are the only side to have ever won a league title, and they have a chance to do so again this season. They will have to wait until next season to see if they can make it back to Europe, but they are already in a position to make a run at it. That's the goal that will determine the fate of Bayern's next opponent, Barcelona, in their quest for a third consecutive European Cup title. For Chelsea, it's a dream come true, as they beat Barcelona 2-1 in extra time on Saturday. But it won't be easy to get past them, especially in this competition where Bayern have the upper hand in terms of possession and possession. And that's not to say that they don't have an advantage in possession, either. At the very least, they've got a lot to play for and a good chance of winning the trophy. However, there's also the question of whether they'll be able to hold on to their lead in Group B. Cep's goal against Barcelona was the most important of his career so far. His goal came on the stroke of half-time, when he took the ball away from Franck Ribery and put it into his own net to give the visitors the lead for good. After the break, he made it 3-0 to Bayern, with Raul Meireles and Gary Cahill also getting the better of him. Merely a few minutes later, Mertesacker put the game out of reach for his side, scoring the winner with a header off the crossbar off a cross from Marcos Alonso's cross. This was a crucial moment for Chelsea's defence, although they were unable to find a way past Barcelona's Andrej Kramaric. As a result, their chances of reaching the last 16 have been reduced to just one goal. Although they had to settle for second place, that was enough to secure a spot in next week's Europa League quarter-final against Sevilla. On the other hand, Chelsea will need to win their remaining three games in order to qualify for next month's final in Germany. With a win at home to Barcelona on Friday night, a draw against Bayern could see them reach their first European final since 1996. If they do not qualify, then they could be relegated to Group C. Chelsea are in danger of missing out on a place in Russia next year, having already lost their opening two games to eventual European champions Barcelona in 2014 and 2015. Meanwhile, Manchester City are on course to reach the quarterfinals in Moscow. Manchester United, meanwhile, are still in contention for their second straight European Championship title after beating Barcelona 4-2 on aggregate on Tuesday. Manager Jose Manuel Neuer has said that the club will not be satisfied with their performance against the Red Devils. Ahead of Saturday's match against Dortmund, Mourinho will look to improve his squad's defensive record and improve on last season's record of 10 wins in 12 games. "
,"Reference text": " All or nothing for Bayern in Champions final
Bayern Munich have one last chance to salvage a season that has otherwise been marked by their inability to beat Borussia Dortmund: a win against Chelsea in the Champions League final at their home stadium.
All season long, Bayern Munich have been consumed with achieving one goal: reaching the final of the Champions League, held at their own Allianz Arena in Munich, and raising the trophy in front of their home fans. After finishing a distant second place to Dortmund in the Bundesliga and dismally losing to them 5-2 in the German Cup final, Bayern Munich are in a must-win situation Saturday against Chelsea. A loss would be the final straw in a disappointing season for a team that can't stand second place. A win for Bayern would mean redemption, to some extent, for their shortcomings in the league. Key players were rested down the stretch in the Bundesliga, especially before the two legs of Bayern's European semifinal against Real Madrid. That was an indication that Bayern had given up on the league and put all their eggs in one basket, hoping for a big payoff with the Champions League title. The same can be said for the German Cup final against Dortmund: true, Bayern essentially beat themselves by making mistake after mistake, but Bayern could, if they win Saturday, wipe the slate clean. Saving the season Win this match, and all will be forgiven in Munich. Lose, and it will be Bayern's second straight season without a piece of hardware, not to mention the heartbreak of losing the biggest match at Allianz Arena since it opened in 2005. "We must not even think about [losing]," said Bayern's Franck Ribery on Thursday. "If we win the Champions League, then we can forget about not winning the league or the cup, nobody will care about that." Bayern are a team that thrives under pressure, and the high stakes of this match will be good for them. Chelsea are a team that showed in their semifinal upset of Barcelona that they can rise to a challenge, even if that challenge is simply holding on against a superior opponent. "We are not the favorites of the game, we are playing away," Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech said on Thursday. "It is very rare when you have the home team playing in the home stadium, using the home dressing room, so I think the advantage goes to Bayern Munich because of that. But we know we have a chance and we will fight for it." But this match will come down to the team that can better take advantage of holes that have been blown in each team's defense due to injuries and suspensions. Filling the gaps Between the two sides, seven starting players will miss out on the final. Chelsea saw Raul Meireles, Ramires, and Branislav Ivanovic each get their third yellow card in the second leg against Barcelona, and captain John Terry was given a straight red. Terry and Ivanovic are fixtures on Chelsea's backline, which was already at half-strength due to hamstring injuries suffered by Gary Cahill and David Luiz. Chelsea coach Roberto di Matteo hopes those two are fit enough for the final, since Chelsea will need all the help they can get in the back. For Bayern, David Alaba and Holger Badstuber - both defenders - and Luiz Gustavo, a defensive midfielder, are also suspended for picking up three yellow cards. The impact of the suspensions will hit Chelsea the most. In addition to a weakened back line, Meireles and Ramires are mainstays on offense, supporting strikers Didier Drogba or Fernando Torres. With Ramires out, Drogba could start as striker, with Torres moving to the wing. At any rate, there is more uncertainty in The Blues' lineup than there is in Bayern's, who will be able to rely on striker Mario Gomez and the dynamic-duo of Arjen Robben and Ribery on the wings as they have all season. Most of the question marks will still be defensive for both teams, but to think that this is an indication of a high-scoring affair on Saturday would be a discredit to both team's last lines of defense. Between the posts Neither side would be competing in the final if it wasn't for the heroics of the teams' keepers. Cech defended against wave after wave of attacks from Barcelona in the semifinal for Chelsea, and Manuel Neuer showed nerves of steel in Bayern's penalty shootout in the final leg against Real Madrid, blocking penalties from Madrid stars Cristiano Ronaldo and Kaka. Chelsea's best shot will be to come out of the gate at a sprint and gain an early advantage against Bayern, who will be doing everything they can to keep their long-cultivated dream-final in their control. Otherwise, Bayern's determination to salvage their season may be enough to carry them through to the trophy ceremony - at home, just like they planned it.

The Vatican is set to meet with Chilean Cardinal Carlo Alberto Capella on Monday to discuss the Vatican's investigation into allegations of sexual abuse.
Francis is expected to travel to Chile next week, where he will meet Cardinal George Pell, who has been accused of sexually abusing minors in Chile. The Vatican has said it will hold talks with the Chilean government, which has denied any wrongdoing. Pope Francis is scheduled to hold a news conference in Washington later in the day. Francis has already met with Chile's Catholic bishops, Cardinal Fernando Karadima, Archbishop of Buenos Aires, and Cardinal Pell. In a statement, Francis said he was "deeply troubled" by the allegations. "I am deeply troubled by what I have seen and heard," Francis told the pope, adding that he had "no doubt" that the accusations against Pell were "basically false." Francis also said that Francis had asked Chilean bishops to attend a Vatican conference on the issue of abuse of minors under the age of 18. He also called for an end to the papacy's "abuse of power" against minors, saying that it was a "disgrace" to have to deal with such a sensitive issue in a country where the Catholic Church has a long tradition of punishing minors for sexual misconduct. Last year, Pope Benedict XVI visited Chile for the first time since the end of World War II. But Francis did not attend the meeting, according to Vatican spokesman George Papadopoulos, referring to Francis as "the pope." The pope's visit came amid growing criticism of the church's handling of sex abuse allegations in recent years, including allegations that Pell sexually abused minors at the hands of his wife and two young children. On Monday, the Pope said Francis should "make sure that no child is abused in any way, shape, form or form" during his visit to Argentina, Chile, Canada, Mexico and the United States. His visit comes as Francis prepares to make his first trip to Washington since Francis took office in January. Read more: Francis: 'I want to see the truth of what happened' Francis' visit 'to Chile' comes after a series of Vatican meetings in which Francis and Francis have been in close touch over the past two weeks. 'The pope is going to do everything he can to ensure that Chile does not become a victim of child abuse,' Francis says. At the same time, he is also calling on Chile to step up its anti-child abuse campaign, accusing the US government of failing to protect children from abuse and neglect. It is not clear whether Francis will be able to stop the abuse, or whether the Church will continue to prosecute Pell and his family members, as it has done for many years. After all, Pell was accused by Francis of abusing children and abusing them in his own home country of being a child molester and a pedophile. Pell has also been charged with child pornography, a charge he denies. However, Vatican officials have said they have not yet ruled out the possibility of Pell being charged in connection with Pell's alleged crimes, although the charges have yet to be formally filed. Cardinal Francis, however, has called on Pell to resign from his post as Vatican secretary of state. According to reports in The New York Times on Sunday, "The Pope has made it clear that there is no intention of changing the way he treats children in Argentina or any other country that has children under 18 years of age who are abused or neglected by their parents or their grandparents." "He is a man of God, but he has not done anything to change the situation," the cardinal said in an interview with The Associated Press on Friday. Earlier this month, US President Barack Obama said Pell should be suspended from the ministry until he completes his term in office. Obama also announced he would step down as ambassador for Chile in May, following the resignation of former US Secretary of State Alberto Fujisori. Washington's move comes amid a growing number of complaints from Chileans who have criticized the president's decision to remove Pell from government posts. Some of those complaints stem from a letter sent by a Chilean lawmaker to a US congressman. "

A high-ranking Vatican diplomat will face trial in the Holy See on charges of possessing child pornography in the US and Canada. Catholic priest Carlo Alberto Capella was indicted on Saturday after a Vatican investigation found he had allegedly possessed and exchanged "a large quantity" of child pornography during his diplomatic posting. His trial will start on June 22 in front of a Vatican magistrate. If convicted, he could be sentenced to between one and five years in prison and fined between €2,500 and €50,000 ($2,100 to $42,000).

The Capella case has hampered the Catholic Church's attempts to move on from its myriad of pedophile priest scandals.

The head of Russia's State Pension Fund has resigned over a scandal involving the state pension fund. The minister said on Thursday that he would step down from his post at the end of the year.
Former finance minister and Russia’s deputy prime minister Anton Antonov resigned on Wednesday over the scandal, which has rocked the country's financial markets. He was replaced by a deputy minister of state for economic affairs. "I am resigning from my post in order to focus on my work," Anton said in a statement on the social media site RIA news agency, citing unnamed sources close to the matter. Anton, who was appointed by President Vladimir Putin in February, said he was stepping down as a minister because of "serious personal and financial problems." He did not elaborate on his reasons for leaving the post, but said his resignation was the result of an "internal and external conflict." The ministry said it had been unable to reach an agreement with the Russian government on a compensation package for the victims. It was not immediately clear whether the government would accept the payment. Rosnepropetrovsk, a state-owned oil company, has denied the allegations, saying it would not accept any compensation from the company. A statement by the SPSF said that it was "deeply concerned" about the situation in Russia, adding that "it is not possible for us to make any kind of progress in this regard." "We are deeply concerned," the statement said, referring to an investigation into allegations of corruption in the oil and gas industry. However, it added that there was no evidence of any wrongdoing and that the investigation was being conducted in accordance with Russian law. In the past, the ministry of finance has been accused of failing to act on its obligations to protect the interests of Russian citizens, including the right to self-determination and the rights of citizens to vote. Last year, Russia announced a new round of sanctions against Russia over its handling of a corruption scandal that has damaged the reputation of its oil industry and its reputation as the world's largest oil producer. Moscow has repeatedly denied any involvement in any such scandal and has refused to say whether it will continue to do so. Russian media reported that Anton had resigned in protest over what he said was a "senseless" decision to fire his deputy. According to Russian state media, Anton was fired after a series of phone calls and text messages were exchanged between the two men. His resignation came a day after the Kremlin accused him of trying to cover up the affair with a fake phone call from a man who claimed to be a Russian journalist. Russia denies the accusations and says it has no intention of doing anything to influence the outcome of this investigation.

There is a lot of pressure on him, and I'm sure he has a great deal of respect for his family, friends and colleagues. This is something that I would like to see him do. After all, he is the minister for financial affairs, not a politician. And he's not the only one who has done this for a long time.

Moscow is planning to set up an emergency fund to help companies hit by sanctions imposed on Russian firms over the country's role in the Ukraine crisis. The money is to come from the Russian pensions system.
Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov unveiled a plan Monday aimed at creating a "multi-billion-dollar" funding vehicle for companies hit by Western sanctions. Moscow-based news agency RIA quoted Siluanov as saying that the emergency fund would be set up next year with money originally earmarked for the State Pension Fund and leftover funds from this year's budget. According to RIA, Moscow was planning to devote "at least 100 billion roubles" (2 billion euros) to the fund, which will mainly be aimed at helping cash-starved Russian banks and key oil companies. "These 100 billion roubles will be added to the reserve next year, which will allow us to help companies," RIA quoted Siluanov as saying. "We are planning to create a reserve of significant size." Just last week, the European Union and the United States imposed a third round of sanctions on Moscow for Russia's involvement in the Ukraine conflict. The latest sanctions target the Russian banking sector as well as key energy firms and arms manufacturers. As one of several companies that have asked for government help, Russia's oil giant Rosneft said it would need 1.5 trillion roubles ($39.70 billion) in aid to keep exploring for oil. Siluanov also told RIA news agency that the decision to stop transferring money to the Pension Fund would hand the budget an extra 309 billion roubles.

The Swiss Alps are the setting for a new film, Heidi, which is set in a Swiss ski resort. The film is based on a novel by Johanna Spyri, a German-Swiss actress and director.
It's the first film in the Heidi series, and it's set to be shown in Zürich, Switzerland, in February. It will be the world's first "heidi" film. "I'm Heidi" is the name given to a series of short films by the Swiss-German actress, who has been working on the project for more than a year now. She's also the director of the German film Vega, based in Graubuenden, where she lives with her husband and two young children. Her first project was to create a "sheidi house" that would house a group of young women who have been living in Switzerland for the past five years. In the beginning, the idea of Heidi was a dream come true, but then it became a reality. After all, it was only a few years ago that the film was made. Now, she's a filmmaker and she wants to tell the story of how she came to Switzerland and how it all came together. Heidi is a film about a young woman who was born in Germany but grew up in Austria and then moved to the United States in order to pursue her dream of becoming a successful actress in film and television. At the end of her career as a journalist and editor at the "Vega" newspaper, her passion for film became the subject of a documentary about her life and her family's life in Europe. As a result of this film she has become a leading voice in her own film industry, making it one of Germany's most sought-after films. But she also has a lot of work to do: She has to find a way to make her way back to her home country of Switzerland. That's why she decided to write a book about it, called Heidi House.

There are so many things to learn about the human condition. One of them is that you have to have a very strong sense of self-reliance." He also said that he hopes that Heidi will help people understand that they are not alone in their quest for happiness and that it is possible for them to achieve it. He said he's not sure if Heidi would be a good film for his family, or if it would just be an experiment for other people who are interested in being a part of his life. So far, he hasn't made any big decisions about whether or not he'll be able to continue working as an actor. His latest project is "Sheidi House" - a short film that has already been released in German cinemas and on YouTube. This is his first feature film since he left Germany. "

Heidi, the world famous girl from the Swiss Alps who first appeared in a novel 121 years ago, has hit the big screen in a fresh look.
A century after the death of Heidi inventor Johanna Spyri, the lovable Alpine heroine is being portrayed in a new film which replaces grassy slopes and mountainous range with city skyscrapers and city streets. The $ 3.5 million "Heidi", funded by the Zürich-based film company Vega and directed by German film maker Markus Imboden, is to be launched in Germany on Thursday. The making of the film was one of the highlights of a past year of events including exhibitions, lectures and fireworks celebrating the July 7 2001 centenary of the death of Spyri, whose novel "Heidi" sold 20 million copies and has been translated in 50 languages worldwide. It is thought to be one of the most successful books of all times. The book has inspired 17 films, including Shirley Temple’s Oscar winning portrayal of Heidi in 1937 and a Japanese cartoon series. Imboden’s remake is the 18th "Heidi" film. Blue hair in Berlin According to Vega, "the film was transmitted to today’s world without losing sight of the original novel". But Imboden’s new movie is far from the charming original, with its rosy-cheeked, curly-headed Heidi, delicate Clara and goat-tending shepherd Peter’s frail old grandmother. In the first film, Heidi, who lives happily with her grandfather in a tiny hut in the Swiss Alps is plucked from her contented life by her Aunt Dete to live in a stiff, rich family in the bustling metropolis, Frankfurt. Heidi becomes so home-sick, she starts to sleepwalk and is eventually sent home. But not before she causes confusion in the otherwise prim household and brings laughter in the life of the disabled and homely, Clara. The Heidi in the latest film has blue hair, surfs the net and roams the streets of Berlin. Friend and shepherd Peter sheds his rustic pastimes and whizzes down streets on his mountainbike. Clara is not the weak, lame young girl of the Spyri novel, but a moody Britney Spears wannabe. Aunt Dete is a modern-day stylist living fashionably in the German capital. The new surroundings are a far cry from the tranquil days of cow milking, goat- tending and flower-plucking in the verdant meadows of the Swiss Alps. Transforming the Heidi myth According to a Berlin daily, the remake is a "refreshing Heidi", adding that the script writers had managed to transform the Heidi "myth" into an independent, self-assured girl and not into a "transfigured mountain heroine". However, it is just this portrait of a naive and charming alpine heroine that has made Heidi so popular all over the world. Heidi has become a well-known Swiss brand worldwide. Some 60,000 tourists – half from Japan – are said to visit the picturesque wine-growing village in Graubuenden, which boasts the original Heidi House and other Heidi related attractions such as winding mountain trails and pastures. Imboden’s film, which is to be launched in Germany on Thursday, will also open elsewhere in Europe, and may reach fans in Japan and South Korea too. Whether Imboden’s blue-haired, computer savvy Heidi will charm her Asian viewers, however, remains to be seen. "

A British journalist has died in an airplane crash in Pakistan. His body has been found in the wreckage of a plane that crashed into a tree.
British journalist Samia Shahid died on Tuesday, the day after the crash. Shehnaz Khan of Daily Life reported that the plane had been hit by a stray bullet. "The plane hit the tree and killed the pilot," she said, adding that she feared for her life. The pilot had suffered a heart attack and was taken to the hospital, where he was treated for minor injuries. Her body was later found to be in a stable condition, with no apparent signs of trauma, according to a report by the BBC's Juanita Phillips. Pakistani journalist Ruby Hamad, who was also on the flight, said she was "very worried" about her own safety and that of her family. According to her, she and her husband were not aware of the accident, which occurred on a flight from Islamabad to Karachi, Pakistan, at the end of July. They had flown to London from Pakistan to attend a funeral for a friend of their father, but were unable to return to their home country of Pakistan due to an illness that had forced them to flee the country. In a statement, Khan said he had "no idea what was going on" but that he and his family had planned to travel to Pakistan as soon as they could. He said they had no idea where they were going to go, that they would not be able to find a place to stay for the next few days. Pakistan's government has denied the allegations, saying they are "baseless" and "not credible." "We have no reason to believe that this is a case of mistaken identity," Khan told the ABC's "Good Morning Britain" program. However, he added, "we have a lot to learn from this accident and we will continue to do our best to make sure that it doesn't happen again."

'It's a very sad story' The incident occurred just a few weeks after Pakistan announced it would ban the use of drones in its air traffic control system. It was the first time the government had allowed drones to fly over a populated area, and it was only a matter of time before drones started flying over populated areas. But Pakistan has long been accused of using drones as a means to spy on its citizens. As a result, it has become increasingly difficult to track down and deport people suspected of being involved in terrorist attacks, including those who have been killed by drones. There is also a growing concern that drones could be used to carry out attacks on civilians, particularly in remote areas, such as schools, hospitals, schools and hospitals. This has led to fears that drone attacks could spread to other countries, as well as the possibility of terrorism being carried out by people who are not citizens of those countries. So far, however, no one has claimed responsibility for this incident, although the Pakistani government says it is investigating the incident. Author: J.J. Phillips Editor: jj.j/rc (AP, AFP, dpa, Reuters) Editor-in-Chief: Simon Wiesbaden (AFP, AP, DPA), Editor, The Associated Press, pd (dpa): "It seems to me that Pakistan is not the only country where drones are being used as weapons of mass destruction. That's not a good thing, because it means that there are more drones flying around the world than there ever were before. And that's something that we should be concerned about." Editor's note: "In the UK, there is an ongoing debate about whether drones can be deployed as part of an attack on innocent civilians. We are also concerned that a drone attack could lead to people being killed in Afghanistan or Iraq, or even worse, in Syria. These are the kinds of things that have happened to innocent people in recent years." "
,"Reference text": " Rethinking the term 'honor killing'
The murder of 28-year-old Samia Shahid comes less than two weeks after Qandeel Baloch was killed by her brother. The media was quick to report them as "honor killings." We have to rethink that term, writes Gouri Sharma.
When news broke that Samia Shahid, a British-Pakistani woman, had been found dead while visiting relatives in Pakistan at the end of July, mainstream media outlets were quick to report it as an honor killing. It was the second time in two weeks that the media had reported a killing of a woman this way - the first being the murder of Pakistani social media star Qandeel Baloch. There are strong similarities between the cases. Both were murdered in places where they would have felt they were at their safest - in their family homes. It's likely they knew their killers - in Baloch's case, her brother has admitted to strangling her, and Shahid's father and cousin have already been questioned. And as more reports emerge about Shahid's death, it's clear that both were killed because they didn't behave in a way deemed acceptable in a conservative, patriarchal society. 'Deeply offensive' term The debate around terminology in "honor killings" isn't new, and after Baloch's murder there were members of the media - such as ABC Australia journalist Juanita Phillips - who decided against using the term, calling it "deeply offensive" and referring to it as a "family killing" instead. And there are outlets, like the Guardian, that already use inverted commas with the word honor. But some commentators argue that more needs to happen if media consumers are to gain a better understanding of the problem. "I think an important step for the media would be to refuse to give weight to the term 'honor crimes,'" said UK-based freelance journalist Shehnaz Khan. "While it is imperative to highlight that these crimes and murders stem from the roots of misogyny and therefore a false sense of 'honor,' there is absolutely nothing but'shame' within them, as murder is nothing but dishonorable." "The word 'honor' can sometimes carry an almost positive connotation that we are inclined to automatically accept just because it's not happening to us, when the reality is, this a huge problem affecting thousands of girls and women across the world," she added. Naming the issue But this isn't a view shared by all journalists. Ruby Hamad, a writer at Australia's Daily Life newspaper, said that the first step in dealing with the issue is naming it. "There are some deeply patriarchal societies that still limit women's freedom according to old tribal concepts of honor, where, unfairly, the behavior of women reflect on their entire family," Hamad said. "By naming these 'honor killings,' we are acknowledging the role that this misogynistic concept of honor plays, not only in the murders themselves but in these entire societies, and how it entraps both men and women." Through the eyes of the perpetrator? There are other issues with the term though. Some have argued that by framing it as such, media outlets are showing the crime through the eyes of the perpetrator - and not through the victim - as they should. And with such cases regularly hitting the headlines, framing is important. The United Nations estimates that around 5,000 women - predominantly from Asia and the Middle East - are killed annually in honor-related crimes, a figure that women's advocacy groups say is closer to 20,000 worldwide. This raises an important cultural element for the media to consider - how far does the term play into cultural stereotypes? "When honor is considered the most important thing in life, then all family members become expendable," Hamad said. "The collective outweighs the rights of the individual. Does this feed into cultural stereotypes? Perhaps. But that doesn't mean we should pretend that this cultural context isn't there." Looking for answers - and alternatives There have been many alternatives put forward by women's advocacy groups, including hate crime, misogynistic murder, femicide and shame killings. But which one should we pick? Al Jazeera for one has decided which one they won't use. "We are always updating our style guidelines to convey a deeper and more authentic understanding of world affairs. Recent events in Pakistan ignited a healthy debate in Al Jazeera on the term 'honor killings' in particular. Our editors are currently studying alternatives to the term, but'misogynistic murder' is not one of them," said an Al Jazeera spokesperson. Terminology in the media matters, and for murders as complex as these, it's the media's responsibility to find a name that better fits the crime. Only then will it become easier to work towards a solution. "

The trial of Myanmar's former military leader has been called off amid allegations of widespread corruption. The trial is set to begin on Monday.
A court in Yangon has ruled that the trial should be postponed until the end of the year to allow for the prosecution of former army general Zaw Win, who was convicted of bribery and other charges in the 2014 military coup. A trial date has yet to be set, but the case is expected to take place on Tuesday. Insein is the capital of northern Myanmar, which is home to the largest concentration of Rohingya Muslims. It is also the site of a trial by the International Criminal Court (ICC) on charges of corruption and money laundering. There are also allegations that a bribe was paid to win the election. "The court has decided that there was no bribe," said Harn Yawnghwe, a professor of international relations at the London School of Economics (LSE). "There is no evidence of any bribe being paid," he said, adding that he was "very disappointed" with the court's decision. He said that it was not clear whether there had been any bribes paid, and that "the trial will be delayed until after the appeal is heard." "It is not the first time that I have been accused of making false statements," Yew said. But he added that Myanmar has a long way to go in terms of prosecuting those who have committed crimes against humanity, such as human rights violations, torture and murder, as well as other crimes committed against the Rohingya people. Myanmar is currently embroiled in a bloody civil war between the military and the civilian population that has killed more than 1,000 people since the start of this year, according to a UN report released last week.

In a statement released on Thursday, the UN said it would hold a hearing on Friday to determine whether the charges against U Nu were politically motivated and whether he had committed any crimes. However, it did not say whether they would be brought to trial in absentia or if he would face trial. According to Reuters news agency, "it is highly unlikely that this trial would result in an acquittal of all charges." The prosecution is likely to last for at least two years, if not longer. Experts say it could take several more years to reach a verdict. They also say that if the verdict is upheld, Myanmar could face the prospect of another round of political violence. hw/rc (AFP, AP, dpa) pkg/jm (AP, Reuters, RFE/hk (Reuters, DPA), pd, kms, bp, hb, rf, pj, jd) dp/dg/AFP/Reuters Editor's Picks Myanmar: A new era of democracy In the past few months, democracy has become more and more important than ever, with a number of reforms being implemented and a new constitution in place. That has led to an increase in political freedoms, including the right to self-determination, freedom of expression and access to health care, among other things. This has made the country's democracy more attractive to foreign investors, analysts say, especially as the government of President Rakhine Win has shown a willingness to cooperate with international organizations in its fight against terrorism. As a result, many investors are optimistic about the prospects for a return to democracy, particularly given the current political situation in Burma.

,"Reference text": " Myanmar Junta Announces Amnesty
The junta in Myanmar, also known as Burma, announced an amnesty for more than 7,000 prisoners on Friday, including a few political detainees. The amnesty came on the 21st anniversary of the brutal crackdown of a student-led pro-democracy movement in 1988 and the subsequent seizure of power by the current junta.
Journalists were invited to Yangon’s notorious Insein prison on Friday as the authorities released the first batch of prisoners. At least 600 inmates were freed as part of an amnesty for over 7,000 inmates nationwide. Among those released in Yangon were two journalists and 25 political prisoners -- rights groups say this is only 1 percent of the total number of political prisoners held by the military regime. Maung Zarni, a research fellow at the London School of Economics, was “happy for the prisoners who were part of the release”. “This is a very positive personal development and I am happy they have been released but we need to understand that the junta is using the prisoners’ release as a public relations exercise. It is the 21st anniversary of the military coup so they are using this as a way to pacify political discontent in the country.” Amnesty comes ahead of next year’s polls Myanmar's director general of prisons, Zaw Win, said that the prisoners had been freed so they could take part in next year's polls. In recent months, rights activists, pro-democracy activists and Western countries have cast doubt on the credibility of the planned elections as many key political activists are still in detention. This includes pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who recently began a new 18-month period of house arrest after being found guilty of violating her house arrest order in a widely condemned trial. “The whole Suu kyi trial is rather unlawful,” said Zarni. “Because the country does not have an independent judiciary, the judges are just puppets who dance to the tune of the top leadership.” Junta is holding on tightly In 1990, Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy won Myanmar’s last general election by a landslide. But the junta never recognised the results and has since tightened its control over the country. The 2008 constitution, which was drafted and approved by the military generals, which guarantees the army 25 percent of parliamentary seats, is yet another sign of its desire to consolidate power. “The military is going to be in power for a long time,” warns Zarni, “because they have got control of all the political and economic institutions in the country as well as the entire state of Burma. So with or without elections, this is likely to remain the same.” New Democratic Party formed Meanwhile, a new political party has been formed in Myanmar. The Democratic Party is headed by Mya Than Than Nu, who is the daughter of the country’s first democratically-elected prime minister, U Nu. The party has proposed a power-sharing deal with the military, which would give 40 percent of power to politicians and 60 percent to the military rulers. Harn Yawnghwe, the director of the Brussels-based Euro-Burma Office, doubts the new party stands a chance: “It is possible that they they would be able to get some votes. But it is not likely, even if they were able to contest the elections freely, that they will be able to form a new government because the military is not prepared to let any party rule.” Democrats should exploit elections He thinks the only way out for the democratic forces in Myanmar is to use the upcoming elections wisely and “to take part in them even if they are against them. I think we have to look at the elections as a process which will lead to democracy -- maybe in few more years.” The National League for Democracy has indicated that it will not take part in the polls unless all Myanmar’s political prisoners, including Suu Kyi, are released. Suu Kyi’s lawyers have filed an appeal against the extension of her house arrest and the court is expected to give a ruling on October 2. But few are hopeful that the junta will amnesty her anytime soon. Author: Disha Uppal Editor: Anne Thomas "

The United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) has warned that the effects of global warming on the environment could be catastrophic. The UNEP said on Thursday that it was warning the world about the dangers posed by the warming climate.
In Bonn, Germany, the head of the UN environment program, Achim Steiner, told a news conference that global temperatures were expected to rise in the next few days. "The world is going to have to deal with the consequences of a warming planet," he said, adding that there was a "very high risk" of extreme weather events. Climate change is a major threat to the global economy, which is already suffering from high levels of greenhouse gas emissions, according to a UN report released on Wednesday. In addition, global temperature rises are forecast to increase by 1.5 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) in January, compared with a year earlier. Global temperatures are predicted to reach a record high of 2.7 degrees C in February, a level that would put the entire world at risk of severe heatwaves, said the report, citing a report from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). "This is the first time in a long time that we have seen such a dramatic increase in temperatures," the WMO report said. However, it added that "there is still a lot of uncertainty about how the climate will change." The report also said that a number of countries, including the United States, Canada and the European Union, have already begun to consider whether they should take action to protect the planet from warming. Some countries are also considering taking action, such as the Netherlands, Belgium and France, where temperatures have risen by more than 1 degree Celsius in recent months. Other countries have also taken action. Germany is one of those countries that has taken steps to reduce its carbon footprint, while France and Italy have taken measures to limit the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere. But the WHO said it is not yet ready to make a decision on whether or not they will continue to do so.   "We are still waiting for the results of this study to be made public, but we are very much looking forward to seeing how it will play out. We are hopeful that this report will lead to an end to greenhouse gases, and we will be able to move on to other important issues," said a statement from Germany's environment ministry. Environment Minister Ursula von der Leyen told the news agency dpa that she was "deeply concerned" about what would happen if the "global warming effect" were to take place. She said: "I am very concerned that if we don't do something about it, we could have a very big impact on our environment. I think that is something that will happen very soon, because we need to see a change in how we treat our planet."

A new United Nations report warns that pollution and global warming are causing millions more deaths than conflicts. The UN's environment agency has called for an urgent roll-back on harmful substances and fossil fuels.
In its report "Healthy Environment, Health People," the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), the World Health Organization and several other environment organizations said that, in 2012, an estimated 12.6 million deaths were attributable to deteriorating environment conditions. The largest numbers of deaths took place in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific regions, followed by sub-Saharan Africa, where around a quarter of deaths were likely caused byair pollution, chemicals, climate change and a lack of access to sanitation. "By depleting the ecological infrastructure of our planet and increasing our pollution footprint, we incur an ever-growing cost in terms of human health and well-being," said UNEP Executive Director Achim Steiner. He added that humanity's life support systems had been compromised by globalization and powerful economic interests. The report was released during UN climate talks in the German city of Bonn which are drawing up rules pertaining to the Paris agreement, which seeks to lower carbon emissions. The document suggested that several drivers were responsible for the threat to human health, including ecosystem disruption, climate change, inequality, unhealthy and wasteful lifestyles, along with unsustainable consumption and production. Worsening effects UNEP estimated that an extra 250,000 deaths could occur each year between 2030 and 2050 as a result of climate change, leading to malnutrition, malaria, diarrhea and heat stress. Between them air pollution and a lack of access to clean water and sanitation cause almost 8 million premature deaths each year. Environmental impacts are responsible for the deaths of more than one quarter of all children under the age of five, the report states. UNEP called for governments to act to remove harmful substances from working environments, reduce the use of carbon fuels and rely instead on renewable energy, and change lifestyles to allow a more sustainable use of the world's resources. The report also called for a bigger investment to protect the planet's natural ecosystem. UNEP predicted a further increase in emerging zoonotic diseases (spread between animals and humans), and called on developing countries, in particular, to prioritize prevention methods. "Never before have so many animals been kept by so many people - and never before have so many opportunities existed for pathogens to pass through the biophysical environment and wild animals to livestock and people," the report warned.

German Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt has warned of "dangerously dangerous consequences" for the country's agricultural sector. He also warned that farmers would be forced to cut back on their food production.
Christian Schmidt, the minister of agriculture in the German state of Lower Saxony, said on Thursday that he was "deeply concerned" about the situation in his country. "I am deeply concerned about this situation," Schmidt said in an interview with German newspaper Bild, which quoted him as saying. Schmidt's comments come as the government is set to hold a special meeting of its agriculture committee on Friday to discuss the issue. The meeting is expected to be attended by farmers' representatives from the agriculture ministry and the Bundestag, as well as government ministers from other countries. According to the Bild report, Schmidt will also hold talks with the heads of several German farmers associations, including the head of the state's German Butchers Association (DPA), which represents farmers. In a statement, DPA said that Schmidt had "serious concerns" over the impact of his ministry's policies on the environment and agriculture, adding that the ministry would "take steps to address this issue." The German Farmers Association, a trade union representing farmers, has called on Schmidt to step down from his post in light of a growing number of farmer suicides in recent years. It also called for an end to farm subsidies, saying that it was time for farmers to pay back their debts. Farmers' associations have been calling for a halt to subsidies since last year, when the federal government announced that they would no longer be able to provide subsidies to farmers and would instead rely on private companies to produce their own products. However, it is not clear whether Schmidt is willing to give up his position as minister, or whether he will continue to work with farmers despite the fact that his government has promised to do away with subsidies. Germany's Agriculture Ministry has also said it will stop subsidizing farmers who are unable to afford to buy their produce. But the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs (DFZ) has said the subsidies will only be made available to those who can afford it. dpa/dpa (AP, AFP, Reuters, AP) Editor: Andreas Schöneberg (AFP/Reuters, pfd/kmshk, hw, bp, sf, kd/smsd, shf)) Editor-in-chief: "It is very difficult to find a solution to this problem. There is a lot of uncertainty about what will happen if farmers are not allowed to sell their products," he told the daily Bild in a letter sent to members of parliament on Wednesday. For the first time since Schmidt took office in January, farmers have said they will not accept subsidies for their crops unless they can be paid back in full. They have also expressed concern that government subsidies may not be enough to cover the costs of their production, and they are also concerned that subsidies could be used to subsidize the cost of producing the products they need to meet their growing needs. This has led to a rise in farm suicides among farmers in Germany, where the unemployment rate has reached a record low of 7.5 percent. Last year the number was down to 1.6 percent, according to government figures.

Terms like "vegan sausage" and "vegetarian schnitzel" confuse consumers and need to be replaced, according to German Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt. He wants new names for plant-based dishes.
Germans shouldn't be biting into a "vegan sausage" or cutting a slice of "vegetarian schnitzel," German Minister for Food and Agriculture Christian Schmidt told the daily "Bild" newspaper on Wednesday, adding that names traditionally used for meat-based dishes should not be applied to plant-based foods. "I don't want anyone to pretend that these pseudo-meat dishes are actual meat dishes," Schmidt said. The minister said manufacturers should come up with distinct names for plant-based meat-substitutes. Schmidt also said meat was part of a healthy and balanced diet and belonged on the menu in schools and kindergartens. Soy? Steak? Soy-steak? Schmidt's statements echo demands from the German Farmers Association and German Butchers Association. Both lobbying groups have asked for a ban on terms such as "vegetarian ham" or "soy steak." Schmidt's call for plant-based foods to have their own name was also made in October in the state of Lower Saxony, a state with many large livestock farms. The German Vegetarian Association, however, argued against the proposal. A spokesperson for the organization said that "names that are used for animal-based products should without a doubt also be legal to use for vegetarian substitute products."

Justin Trudeau, the leader of the Conservative Party, is set to be sworn in as Canada's next prime minister on Saturday. The announcement comes a day after Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced that he would not seek re-election in 2019. Harper, who has been in office since 2011, will run for a second term in 2021. "I'm very confident that we will win this election," Trudeau said at a news conference in Ottawa, adding that his party would be "very proud" of his accomplishments. Trudeau's victory comes as Harper's government faces a series of challenges, including how to deal with the fallout from the global financial crisis and the possible loss of jobs and economic growth to the United States and China. In a statement, Harper said he was "deeply disappointed" by the results of last year's election, which left him without a majority in Parliament and with no chance of winning the general election. But he also said his government would continue to fight for the rights of all Canadians, regardless of their political affiliation, and that the Liberals would remain committed to a "strong and stable" federal government. Canada has a long way to go in order to achieve its long-term goal of a stable, stable and prosperous Canada, he said. 'We have a lot of work to do,' Trudeau told reporters at the end of an interview with CBC's "Good Morning Canada."

However, Trudeau has promised to keep the government open to foreign investment, as well as to make Canada a more attractive destination for investment and job creation. His campaign promises to build on the momentum generated by his election win are a welcome development for Canadians who have long been skeptical about his ability to deliver on his promise to reform the tax code. After all, Canada is the only industrialized country to have the highest tax rates in Europe. Despite the fact that it has the lowest per capita income of any other developed country, there are still a number of countries that have high rates of tax evasion and high levels of corruption. One of those countries is Germany, where taxes are the main source of income for many of its citizens. Germany is also a member of Germany's EU-member Schengen zone. It is not the first time the EU has imposed taxes on EU citizens, but it is only the second time. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy have both said that they would like to see Canada become a European Union country. Merkel has said she will not accept any tax increases for EU nationals, even though she has no intention of doing so. She has also called for an end to tax breaks for European nationals who are not citizens of EU countries. That's a big step for those who want to stay in their EU country and have no desire to return to their home countries, Merkel said in her speech to parliament on Friday.

Justin Trudeau of the Liberal Party has been elected Canada's new prime minister. Stephen Harper has stepped down as leader of the Conservatives after nine years in the top job.
Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper resigned as Conservative Party leader on Tuesday after the Liberals, led by Justin Trudeau, emerged victorious in legislative elections. "I have spoken to Prime Minister Stephen Harper, and he has instructed me to reach out to the newly elected parliamentary caucus to appoint an interim leader," Conservative Party president John Walsh said in a statement. "The people are never wrong," Harper said of his defeat. "The disappointment is my responsibility and mine alone," Harper said, adding that he had called Trudeau to congratulate him. Trudeau calls for hopeful, diverse future In electing Trudeau, the charismatic son of a former popular prime minister, Canadian voters illustrated the growing discontent with nine years of Conservative rule that saw lowering of corporate taxes, avoidance of climate change legislation and disagreement with the Obama administration over the controversial Keystone XL pipeline. "Canadians have spoken," Trudeau said, adding that he would be the man to lead the "hopeful, positive" country "with a vision" that they had asked for. In his victory speech, Trudeau said his government "believed deeply in the diversity of our country," striking a contrast with the strain of nativism that had become apparent under Conservative rule. "We beat fear with hope," said Trudeau, a 43-year-old former teacher. Liberals blow past projected results Projections ahead of the elections had Harper and Trudeau in a dead heat, but as polls closed on Monday night it became clear that the Liberals had won an outright majority, with a projected 175 of parliament's 338 seats. This represented a huge leap from four years ago when Liberals were handed their most crushing defeat in history with a mere 34 seats. Harper will stay on as a member of Parliament for his constituency, public broadcaster CBC reported, as he was re-elected to his seat. The left-leaning New Democratic Party had hoped to capitalize on its second-place finish in 2011, but only managed to come in third with CBC estimating that the party had garnered 32 seats. es/cmk (AP, Reuters) Have something to say?

The Saudi foreign minister said on Friday that he was "deeply concerned" about the situation in Yemen. "I am deeply concerned about what is happening in the country," he told reporters in Riyadh.
He said the Saudi government was working closely with the Houthis in Saada, the capital of Yemen, to try to resolve the crisis. He said Saudi Arabia and the United States would continue to work closely together to find a solution to the conflict. The Saudi-led coalition, which has been fighting Yemen's Shiite Houthi rebels for more than a year, has called for an end to fighting and a ceasefire between the two sides. Riyadh has said it will continue its efforts to reach an agreement with Iran on the future of the war-ravaged country. However, it is not clear how long the ceasefire will last. Saudi officials have said they expect the coalition to continue fighting until the end of this month. They have also said that they are ready to resume talks with Iranian-backed rebels in Sanaa, a city in southern Yemen that has seen an increase in fighting in recent months. On Friday, Riyadh announced that it would suspend all military cooperation with Tehran until a deal is reached between Tehran and Riyadh on how to end the fighting. Tehran has accused Riyadh of trying to undermine the peace process, saying it wants to prevent a new round of peace talks between Riyadh and Tehran. Iran has denied any involvement in any of these talks, but the Saudis have accused Tehran of meddling in their internal affairs. A Saudi Foreign Ministry spokesman said Riyadh had no immediate plans to impose sanctions on Iran, adding that Tehran had "no intention" of doing so. US Secretary of State John Kerry said in a statement that the US believed Iran was behind the Yemeni conflict and urged Riyadh to "use all available tools" to help resolve it. Kerry also called on Riyadh "to act decisively and decisively" in its fight against the rebels, calling for a "total and complete cessation of hostilities." The US and Saudi governments have been at loggerheads over the Yemen conflict since the fall of President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi's government in January 2015. Washington has criticized Riyadh's decision to pull out of a coalition of Arab states, accusing it of supporting Iran's proxy war in neighboring Yemen and of failing to stop the flow of Iranian weapons into the Arabian Peninsula. In an apparent reference to US President Barack Obama's visit to Riyadh last week, Kerry expressed concern that Riyadh would not be able to act quickly enough to halt the advance of Iran and its allies in Syria and Iraq. jm/msh (AP, AFP, dpa, Reuters, AP), AFP Editor: Andrew Harnik, DPA, The Associated Press, pfd/dpa (AFP, EFE, KNA, hw, euw), AP, RIA Novosti and Reuters contributed to this report. It was not immediately clear whether Riyadh was aware of Kerry's comments, however, and whether it had taken any action against Iran or its proxies in response to his visit. Last month, US officials said Iran had threatened to launch a missile attack against Riyadh if Riyadh did not step up its support for the Shiite rebels fighting against President Abd-Rabbu Mansoura, who is believed to be in exile in Tehran at the time of his ouster from power in 2011. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has also warned that Iran could use its influence to destabilize the Middle East region. Rouhani's trip to Paris on Thursday was an attempt to reassure the world that Washington is willing to stand by its ally Iran in an effort to pressure Riyadh into stepping up pressure on Tehran to abandon its nuclear weapons program. But the Iranian president has refused to step down from his post as defense minister, despite repeated calls from Riyadh for him to do so, according to a US official.

Saudi Arabia has announced a five-day humanitarian cease-fire in Yemen starting from next Tuesday. Meanwhile, US Secretary of State John Kerry has urged all parties to find a political solution to the conflict.
"We have made a decision that the cease-fire will begin this Tuesday, May 12, at 11.00 pm and will last for five days subject to renewal if it works out," Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir told a meeting of Gulf ministers in Paris on Friday alongside US Secretary of State John Kerry. The minister added that the cease-fire could be extended depending on the response from Yemen's Shiite Houthi rebels. Al-Jubeir said he hoped the Iran-backed rebels would "come to their senses" and agree to the truce. He urged them to stop fighting. "We hope the Houthis will come to their senses and realize the interests of Yemen and the Yemeni people should be the top priority for everyone," he said. It is unclear whether the Houthis would reciprocate the Saudi gesture. "The cease-fire will end should Houthis or their allies not live up to the agreement - this is a chance for the Houthis to show that they care about their people and they care about the Yemen people," the Saudi foreign minister emphasized. At this point, US Secretary of State John Kerry said anyone who cared about Yemeni people "should take clear notice of the fact that a human catastrophe is building," adding that a cease-fire was "not peace" and that all parties must find a political solution to end the conflict. Kerry urged all sides to hold talks immediately. Saudi ultimatum Hours before the cease-fire announcement, Saudi Arabia declared a Houthi stronghold along its southern border a "military target," giving an ultimatum to the residents to leave the area, Saudi state-run TV reported. Lately, the northern Yemeni province of Saada has become a battleground for the Shiite rebels and the Saud-led coalition forces as the Houthis carried out border attacks on nearby Saudi cities. More than 50 airstrikes hit Saada overnight and in the early hours of Friday morning, Yemeni officials said. A Saudi-led coalition of Arab states launched an air campaign against the Houthis on March 26. Riyadh accuses Tehran of backing the rebels, who have made significant territorial gains in the impoverished Middle Eastern country, capturing the capital Sanaa and ousting internationally recognized President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, who fled Yemen back in March. The Sunni Gulf states are wary of Iran's increasing influence in the region, and they see the Houthis' advance in Yemen as a move that threatens their regional and geopolitical interests. Over 1,200 people have been killed in Yemen since the start of the Saudi campaign, according to the United Nations. shs/bw (AFP, dpa, Reuters, AP) "

Ukraine's president has announced that he will step down from his post at the end of the month. He will be replaced by Yulia Tymoshenko.
The president of Ukraine's parliament has said he is going to resign from the post of prime minister. However, it is not clear how long this will last. The president, who has been in power since February 2014, is expected to stay in office until early next year. "I don't want to go anywhere," he told DW in an interview published on Tuesday. But he also said that the president would not be able to step aside until he had a chance to speak to the country's people. In the meantime, he said, the government will continue to work with the opposition to ensure that all political parties in Kyiv have a voice in the political process. DW's Kitty Logan: "This is the first time that I've seen a leader of a political party that has a strong voice," she said. She added that it would be "very difficult" for the new president to take over without a clear vision of what the future holds for Ukraine. It's not just about the economy, but also the social and political situation in Ukraine, as well. There are a number of problems, such as corruption, poverty, unemployment and the lack of political stability. These are all problems that have to be dealt with in order to make the transition to democracy possible. And, of course, there are many problems. One of them is that there is a lot of corruption in politics. This is something that can only be solved through the implementation of reforms. That is, if the reforms are implemented in a way that will make it easier for people to get jobs and pay their bills. So far, however, this has not been the case. For example, when it comes to social issues, many people are not aware that they are being asked to leave their homes. They are also not allowed to return to their families, which is why they have been unable to find a place to live in their own homes for a long time. At the same time, they can no longer afford to rent a house or buy a car, because they cannot afford it. What's the point of having a home? What are the chances of that happening again? The question is whether the authorities will take action against those who are trying to undermine the democratic process, or if they will simply give up on the idea that democracy and democracy are incompatible with each other. If they do, then the situation will only get worse and worse. I think that's what's going on in this country right now, and I hope that people will start to understand that this is an important issue for all of us." DW: What do you think about this? Kitty: I would like to see a government that is more open and transparent about its policies and policies. Do you agree with me on this point? I am not sure if it's a good idea to have an open government or a transparent one. You can't just say, "We want a democratic government," but you can also say that you are open to all kinds of things, even if you have no idea what you're doing. Does this mean that we should all be happy with what we have in our own country? It doesn't seem that way at all. Even if we were to agree to a new constitution, we wouldn't have the freedom to decide what kind of government we want for our country. We would rather have more freedom and freedom of expression than a system where the state is controlled by a few people who have nothing to do with politics and who do not have any say in what is happening in society. How do we get to that point, you ask? And what should we do about it? In my opinion, I believe the answer is quite simple: We will not allow the Ukrainian government to interfere with our democratic processes and we will do everything we can to protect the interests of our citizens and our national interests.

Early results from Ukraine's presidential poll indicate that Petro Poroshenko has won the absolute majority of the votes. He said that his victory meant voters had chosed the path of "European Integration."
Exit polls gave Petro Poroshenko, a 48-year-old billionaire and owner of a chocolate factory, between 55.9 and 57.3 percent of the vote. This put him well ahead of former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, who was reported to have come in second, at 12.9 percent. Andrij Shevchenko, one of Tymoshenko's political allies, said on Twitter that she had conceded defeat. DW's reporter Kitty Logan in Kyiv said voter turnout was extremely high in the capital. Most polling stations in the east of the country remained closed on Sunday. If the figures are confirmed, there will not be a need for a runoff on June 15. Poroshenko, who has promised closer economic and political ties with the West, has also vowed to mend relations with Russia, but insisted that Ukraine's territorial integrity was of top importance to him.

Nigerian soldiers have killed more than 1,000 people since the start of the year in the northern state of Borno. The attack on a military base in Yola killed at least 100 people.
More than 2,500 people have been killed in Nigeria's conflict with the Islamist insurgency. On Sunday, a group of soldiers from the Nigerian army and police raided the base, killing around 100 civilians and injuring hundreds more. Police said the attack was carried out by a suicide bomber who was carrying out a series of attacks on security forces and civilians. At the time, the military said it was conducting a "targeted campaign" against the militants. "We are going to do everything we can to stop the attacks," said Lawal Emos, husband of Hauwa, wife of Comfort, who had been shot and killed by the terrorists. He said he had no idea what was going on until he heard the news from his wife. In the end, he was able to flee the area and return to his family. According to the army, his father was killed and his mother was seriously injured in a shootout with police. It is not clear how many people were killed, but it is believed that some of them were injured. Many of those killed were civilians, including soldiers, police and soldiers. They are believed to have fled to neighboring countries in search of safety and security. There were also reports of a number of suicide bombings in other parts of Nigeria in recent years. Some of these attacks were linked to a failed military coup in 1999, when the then president, Muhammadu Buhari, was overthrown by troops loyal to him. Since then, there has been a lot of speculation about who might be responsible for the deaths. But it seems to me that the most worrying thing about the situation is that there is no evidence that any of this has happened. What is the likelihood that this will happen again? I don't think so. I think it will be a very long time before we know for sure who is responsible. We will have to wait and see what happens. That's why we are so worried about what the future holds for our country. Is there any chance that we will see the return of our beloved country? We are not sure yet. If we do, it would be very difficult for us to find out for certain, because we have so many things to worry about. For example, if the government does not act on its own, what will it do? What will the consequences be for Nigerians? The military has said that they will take action against those who have committed crimes against humanity. This is why they are calling for an end to all forms of violence. And it's not just the killings of innocent civilians that are being perpetrated by terrorists and their sympathizers. These are the people who are committing acts of terrorism, not the perpetrators of crimes committed by these terrorist organizations. How can we prevent this from happening? How do we ensure that our people are safe and secure? It's a question that is being asked of us by our government and the international community. Do you have any idea how long it might take for this situation to be resolved? Do we want to see this kind of thing happen? If not, then we need to know what is happening in our own country, and how will we react to it? Is it possible that Nigeria will not have a solution to this problem? There is a long list of things that can be done to solve the problem. One thing that I would like to discuss with you is how to make sure that you are doing the right thing, which is to provide security for your family and friends. You can't do that if you're not doing your job, you cannot do it on your own. So let's talk about security and what you can do about it. Let's see if there are any solutions that will make Nigeria a better place to live and a safer place for people to work. Then we'll see how Nigeria handles the issue of human rights. "
,"Reference text": " #BringBackOurGirls still hopeful one year on
One year ago, more than 200 schoolgirls from Chibok were kidnapped by Boko Haram militants. Parents of the missing girls told DW's correspondent in Nigeria, Adrian Kriesch, that they remain optimistic.
Lawal Emos clenches his fist and kneads his fingers. He had firmly resolved not to cry when he talks about Comfort. She is a lovely girl, Emos says, always helpful and determined. Comfort is his 17-year-old daughter. A year ago she was abducted by Boko Haram from their school in the village of Chibok, northeastern Nigeria. Like other tens of thousands, Emos, his wife and their five remaining children fled to Yola, a city located 270 kilometers (167 miles) from Chibok. He has gotten thinner in recent months as his family survives on irregular donations from friends and the Red Cross. Formerly a farmer in his home town, Emos has been unable to get land in Yola. "Do you have a photo of Comfort?" I ask. And immediately the father of six breaks down in tears. Emos admits that he can't control his emotions whenever he sees his daughter's picture. He left all of them in Chibok. Opening wounds This is the third time I am in Yola since the kidnapping of the Chibok girls on the night of April 14 -15, 2014. It is also the third time while covering for DW the plight of the girls still in Boko Haram captivity. As emotional wounds of the parents are ripped open once again, tears flow, I film, and I get this bad feeling. Lawal Emos says he knows of twelve fellow parents who have died following the kidnapping. "The constant crying and thinking of their daughters killed them." Emos and his wife Hauwa sometimes find themselves thinking that it would be easier for them if they knew their daughter was dead. "I have lost my hope in politicians because they are not doing anything," Hauwa says. "Only God can still help us to find them - dead or alive. But our government, forget it." Three weeks after the abduction, the Islamist terrorist group Boko Haram claimed responsibility. For six years, the Islamic sect has carried out a deadly insurgency especially in northeastern Nigeria. Initially, Boko Haram said it was fighting against the corrupt Nigerian government, but with time its objectives have become increasingly unclear. Thousands of Christians and Muslims have been killed in raids and attacks by the militants. As for the kidnapped girls, Boko Haram's leader Abubakar Shekau said in one of his bizarre speeches, they had been sold off as slaves. Government's inconsistency An international outcry for the Chibok girls became a phenomenon with the hashtag #bringbackourgirls on Twitter. Nigeria's neighbors declared war on Boko Haram and the US sent military advisers to help locate and free the girls. On May 26, 2014, Alex Badeh, Nigeria's supreme commander of the armed forces, proclaimed that they knew the whereabouts of the girls but a rescue operation would be too dangerous. In mid-October last year, army chief Badeh went before the press again saying an armistice had been signed and that the girls will be freed. It turned out to be another lie. It took outgoing President Goodluck Jonathan and his wife three months before meeting with the parents of the girls for the first time. "He said, 'Within three weeks, you will all have your daughters back, and within three weeks, we will renovate all destroyed schools in the region,'" recalls Lawal Emos. "Three weeks passed, then several months and nothing happened." Meanwhile Boko Haram continued their attacks on villagers unabated. Will Chibok girls ever be found? Shortly before Nigerians went to the polls on March 28, the Nigerian military together with neighboring countries of Chad, Cameroon and Niger began an offensive to drive out Boko Haram from occupied territories. Many Nigerians believe the timing of the offensive in the middle of the election campaign is not entirely coincidental. "The confidence in the military is at its lowest ebb," says journalist Umar Faruq Baba Inna from Yola. The outcry on the internet for the release of the Chibok girls has gotten quieter, only a few activists are now seen protesting on Nigerian streets. Many observers believe that senior military officials have no interest in ending the insurgency because of the benefits from the massive security budget. "The incoming administration of Muhammadu Buhari has a lot to do to reassure the citizenry that we can trust government and the armed forces," Baba Inna says. Buhari's opposition APC party won a resounding victory in the northeast, where the conflict rages. Even Lawal Emos voted for the former general, who has promised to crush Boko Haram in just six months. However, Nigerian political analyst Edgar Amos doubts if Buhari will ever find the Chibok girls. "A whole year has passed and they are in the hands of heartless, "

The European Olympic Committee (EOC) has launched an investigation into allegations of bribery at the Rio Olympics. The probe is being led by Juliana Leal de Melo, a Brazilian woman who has been charged with bribery.
Following the investigation, the EOC said it had found no evidence of any wrongdoing by the Brazilian women's gymnastics team. "We have no information at this time," said the head of the IOC's executive committee. However, it added that it was "highly unlikely" that the case would be brought to trial in the coming days. It was not immediately clear whether the woman, who was charged in connection with the bribery scheme, had any links to any other Brazilian athletes. A court in Rio has already ruled that she is guilty of money laundering, which is punishable by up to 10 years in prison if convicted in absentia. In a statement released on Thursday, EOS said that "the investigation is ongoing and we are confident that there will be no further involvement in this matter." "The investigation will continue until the end of this year," the statement said.

Germany's ambassador to Libya, Said Abdulaati, has said that the German embassy in the Libyan capital, Tripoli, is not planning to leave the country.
Bernd Westphal, a spokesman for German Foreign Minister Gerhard Schröder, told reporters on Thursday that Germany would not be leaving Libya until the end of the month. "We will not go anywhere," he said, referring to the current situation in Libya. According to a German Federal Statistics Office report, the number of German citizens who have left Libya since the fall of dictator Moammar Gadhafi in 2011 has risen by more than 50 percent since then, according to figures compiled by the Public Works Ministry of Libya (LFP). "It is a very sad day for Germany, which has been in a state of mourning for many years. We have been here for a long time, and we will continue to do so until we are able to return to our country," said Bernd Wasser, an official with the LFP. He added that there was a "very strong sense of solidarity" between the two countries, adding that "we have a lot of respect for the people of Tripoli." The German Embassy said it would be willing to travel to Tripoli to meet with Libyan officials, but that it was "not going to be easy" to get there. German officials said they had not yet decided whether to send a message to Libyan authorities, who had refused to provide any information on the whereabouts of their citizens. Germany's Foreign Ministry said the embassy would remain open until a decision was made on whether or not to close its embassy. In the meantime, Germany will remain in contact with Libya's government and the government of Prime Minister Haider al-Abidine Ben Ali, as well as with other European Union member states, including the United States, Britain, France, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Spain. Berlin is also expected to stay in touch with its Libyan counterpart, Maatuk Maatsuk, in an effort to reassure the international community that its citizens are safe and secure in their home countries. The Germans, however, have expressed concern about the possibility of a return of some of its own citizens, saying that they have not been given a chance to make their own decisions about their future. They have also expressed their concern over the lack of cooperation between Libya and its NATO allies, particularly the US and Britain. On Thursday, Berlin's foreign ministry released a statement saying it had been unable to reach a consensus on how to resolve the crisis between Tripoli and Washington. It also stressed the need for an end to "war crimes" committed by both sides, such as torture and murder. However, it also pointed out that Libya was not the only country in Europe that was suffering from the effects of war crimes. There were also fears that a new wave of anti-Islamic State (IS) attacks would sweep across the continent, leading to an increase in attacks on German-speaking countries and a possible rise in terrorist attacks. Last year, there were reports that at least 10,000 people were killed in clashes between Libyan security forces and US-backed militias in Benghazi. This was the first time in three years that such attacks had taken place in Germany. A German government spokesman told Reuters news agency on Friday that Berlin had received a total of 1.5 million euros ($1.1 million) in compensation for its role in fighting the IS. Speaking to reporters in Berlin, German Interior Minister Erich Müller said: "This is the second time that we have received this kind of compensation in less than a year." "I think it will be very difficult for us to recover from this, because there are so many things that have happened in this country that are very important to us. I don't think we can go back to where we were when we first came here. That's because we didn't have the resources to deal with these things." In addition, he added, "it's not like we had the opportunity to go to war with our own country, so we'll have to wait and see what happens." Libya has suffered from a series of economic and political crises in recent years, with many of these crises affecting its economy and foreign policy. As a result, many people have fled to neighboring countries to seek refuge in other parts of Europe. Many of those fleeing the war have returned to Europe, where they are now living in fear of returning to their homeland. But Germany has also suffered a setback in its ability to cope with such crises. "

The La Belle disco bombing in Berlin on April 5, 1986 was ruled to be Libya's doing. Twenty years later, relations between Libya and Europe have done an about-face.
The Berlin disco "La Belle" was packed as usual on the night of April 5, 1986. Among its guests were many US soldiers, who were certainly not thinking of politics, the Middle East or strained relations between the United States and Libya. But reality caught up with them: a bomb detonated near the dance floor that night, killing two Americans and a Turkish woman. Over 200 people were injured. A Berlin court ruled that Libya and its intelligence services were responsible for the bombing. In 2001, following a nearly four-year long trial, the judges convicted a Libyan diplomat and three others to prison sentences between 12 and 14 years. The big oil-exporting country in the meantime was busy working on its reputation. Already in the 1990s, Tripoli began striving to improve its relations to the European Union. Financial reparation opened the door to Europe In 2004, the Gaddafi International Foundation for Charity Associations and the legal representatives of the German La Belle victims settled on $35 million in compensation. This opened the door to Europe. Just a few weeks later, Germany's chancellor at the time, Gerhard Schröder, visited Moammar Gadhafi in a traditional Bedouin tent outside of Tripoli. Britain's Prime Minister Tony Blair also paid Gadhafi a visit. A few months earlier, in April 2004, the European Union had welcomed the Libyan leader to Brussels. It was Gadhafi's first official visit to Europe in 15 years. Bernd Westphal, the German ambassador to Libya, said bilateral relations had been through difficult times. "The German Embassy in Tripoli today is working for a quick return to the liveliness of close relations between Germany and Libya," Westphal said. "We want to build on our traditional friendship with Libya and we want to strengthen the political, economic and cultural cooperation between our two countries and peoples." Business interests booming in Libya In the past few years, Libya has moved from being the supporter of international terrorism to an attractive economic partner for the West. European business representatives have been increasingly knocking on Libya's door. Even the United States is showing increased interest in the northern African nation. Washington is pleased that Libya announced at the end of 2003 that it would discontinue its efforts to develop and produce weapons of mass destruction. Libya's ambassador to Germany, Said Abdulaati, said political and economic relations between Libya and Germany were "excellent." Libya is one of Germany's strongest trading partners in northern Africa. Last year, Germany exported goods to Libya worth 657.7 million euros ($805.7 million), according to the German Federal Statistics Office. "The economy is the driving power in German-Libyan relations," said Abdulaati in an interview with the Arab-German association for trade and industry. But Germany isn't the only European country making deals in Libya. France last month signed an accord with Libya on peaceful nuclear research. "This accord represents a qualitative leap in relations between the two countries and proves that Libya has transformed its weapons of mass destruction into constructive weapons," Public Works Minister Maatuk Maatuk said at the signing ceremony in March. "We are telling the world that we are moving towards the development of Libyan nuclear technology for peaceful purposes." This week, the Netherlands' Economics Minister Laurens Jan Brinkhorst will visit Libya to negotiate gas and oil agreements. It will be the first high-level visit by a Dutch official since Gadhafi took power in 1969. "

The conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) have rallied around Chancellor Angela Merkel ahead of a parliamentary election in the southern German state of Bavaria on Sunday.
A coalition of the two main opposition parties, the Greens and the Left Party, has called for a general election to be held next year. The Greens have called on Merkel to step down from her post as chancellor and instead form a coalition government with the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD). The SPD, which has been in power since 2005, is expected to form the government of Chancellor Merkel's conservative party. Merkel has said she will not seek re-election until after the election. However, she has not ruled out the possibility that she could run for chancellor again. "I don't see any reason why I shouldn't be able to run," Merkel said in an interview with German news agency dpa. She also said that the SPD would not be allowed to take part in a "grand coalition" that would see the CDU and SPD together as the governing coalition. But she did not rule out a possible run-off for the federal elections in 2018. Her party has also been criticized by the media for failing to provide a clear picture of what is going on in Germany's political landscape. In the first round of parliamentary elections Sunday, Merkel and her party's coalition partners will hold a referendum on whether or not to seek a second term in parliament. It is not yet clear whether the vote will be enough to secure a third term, or whether Merkel will seek another term. Both parties have said they are willing to accept the results of Sunday's vote, but they have yet to say whether they will accept it or reject it outright. They have also promised to hold an election within the next two years. Read more: Merkel calls for snap election for Merkel, SPD and Greens to unite behind her "Merkel-Bundesrat" stance on the issue of refugees and asylum seekers in Europe's most populous country, Germany, as well as a new constitution that will allow refugees to return to their home countries if they want to stay in their countries for longer periods of time. Germany has a long way to go in terms of immigration policy, and it will take a lot longer to do so than it did before Merkel came to power in 2005. As a result, there is a growing sense of unease among the German public about the influx of migrants and refugees into the country. There is also growing concern that some of these migrants could be turned away from their own countries. This is particularly worrying given the high number of people who have fled their homes in recent months due to high unemployment and high crime rates. Many of them have been living in poverty or have lost their jobs in order to escape the harsh economic conditions that have forced them to move to the United States, where they now live in fear of deportation. These fears have led to a surge in migrant arrivals and a rise in violent crime in many parts of Europe. A recent survey by a German think tank found that more than 80 percent of asylum-seekers have returned to Germany since the end of World War II. More than half a million people have left their country since then, according to an analysis by Deutsche Welle (DWD), a research institute in Berlin. That number has risen to over 100,000 since September, with a total of 1.5 million migrants returning to Europe in 2015. According to DWD, this is the highest level of migration since records began in 1990. Since the beginning of this year, migrants have made up a majority of those who leave Germany for other European countries, including the US, Canada and Mexico. While the numbers are still high, it is still unclear how many migrants are leaving Germany and whether migration will continue to increase. For many people, migration has become a major issue, especially among young people. And while migration is an important part of German society, many are worried about migration and that it could lead to higher levels of crime and crime. So far, so good, in fact, that is what has led many to believe that migration from the EU to other EU countries is doing. "

It might be Germany's smallest state with a population of less than 700,000, but the make-up of Bremen's new government could curb the ability of Angela Merkel's coalition to continue with planned reforms.
The Social Democrats (SPD) and Christian Democrats (CDU) have ruled the small northern city-state of Bremen in a coalition for the past 12 years. But after winning state elections on Sunday with 36.8 percent, the SPD is now flirting with the idea of ditching their previous coalition partners to rule together with the Greens, who made their best-ever showing in a German state poll with 16.4 percent. Bremen's state SPD leadership is to hold talks later on Wednesday with the CDU, which polled 25.7 percent. After an SPD meeting in Bremen, Mayor Jens Böhrnsen made the first signal he could be favoring the Greens. He said that during the campaign he had deliberately abstained from mentioning the possibility of a renewed CDU coalition because "after 12 years it shouldn't automatically be continued." Bremen's acting head of government and CDU member Thomas Röwekamp, however, warned against an SPD-Green coalition. "The majority of people don't want a red-green experiment, but a continuation of the grand coalition," he said. Both the SPD and CDU conceded heavy losses in the election, which showed a swing towards the Greens and the Left Party, which scored an unexpected 8.4 percent to win representation in a western German state legislature for the first time in its brief history. Block reforms? If Bremen's SPD decide in favor of the Greens, this would affect the ability of Chancellor Angela Merkel's grand coalition of CDU and SPD to push ahead with reforms requiring constitutional changes, such as stage two of Germany's urgently needed federalism reform. The federal Bundesrat, which is made up of state cabinet members, has to approve the majority of legislative bills passed by the lower chamber, the Bundestag, before they become law. Also, any proposed constitutional changes require two-thirds of all votes in order to be passed by the Bundesrat. The CDU and SPD currently hold 47 of the Bundesrat's 69 seats, which is one seat more than the necessary two-thirds majority. But without Bremen, the number held by the grand coalition would fall to 44 seats, meaning they would need the cooperation of one of the small opposition parties for any constitutional changes. Internal strife Earlier in the week, Chancellor Merkel called for unity within her ruling left-right coalition after the losses in Bremen set the stage for more infighting between the two parties. Merkel also warned the SPD against moving to the left after it lost some five percent points. The chancellor said the outcome showed the SPD had made a mistake by attacking the coalition and campaigning on promises of a minimum wage, which she believes will hamper efforts to fight unemployment of just under 10 percent. "The result showed that this strategy did not pay off," Merkel told a press conference. "

A Russian agent has been arrested on suspicion of spying for the US in the eastern Ukrainian city of Minsk. The charges stem from an incident in Vilnius, Lithuania, in February.
The US special agent in charge of Russia's anti-missile mission in eastern Ukraine has reportedly been handed over to the Belarusian government in connection with an alleged plot to assassinate US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Officials said on Thursday that the case was being investigated as a possible assassination attempt by the Russian government. "It is a very serious case and we are very concerned about the safety and security of our citizens," said US Special Agent in Charge of the Russia-Ukraine Counter-Terrorism Task Force (CTF) Philip "Philip," in an interview with the Associated Press. He said he had been in contact with Clinton's campaign team and that they had discussed the possibility of an extradition to Belarus. In a statement, the CTF said: "We have received a request from the State Security Service (SSP) to extradite Philip from Lithuania to face charges related to an attempted assassination of Clinton." The CSP also said it had received information that a Russian intelligence agent had attempted to contact Clinton in a bid to influence the outcome of a US-led investigation into the alleged assassination plot.

However, he added, "I am not concerned at all about whether or not we will be able to carry out this mission. I am concerned for our country's security and our people's well-being," he said, adding that "it is our responsibility to ensure that we do everything we can to prevent this from happening again." He added that it was important to "make sure we have a clear picture of what is happening in this country and how it is affecting the lives of people around the world." "This is not an isolated incident, it's something that has happened many times over the past few years, and it has not happened in any other country.

The Kremlin is looking for a way to stop the spread of Russian propaganda and disinformation on the internet, but the Kremlin has yet to come up with a plan to do so. It's not clear what it will do. If it does, then Russia will have to make sure it doesn't do it again. There is no way of knowing for sure, however, if it wants to continue to use propaganda against the United States and its allies. So far, so good. But we don't know what will happen when it comes to Russia and Ukraine. What we know is that there are a lot of different things that are happening right now. For example, there's the situation in Donetsk, where the Russians have been using the Internet to spread disinformation and propaganda. And there is also the issue of human rights violations, such as the use of weapons of mass destruction, as well as human trafficking. These are all issues that Russia has to deal with in order to keep its citizens safe and secure. This is something which is very concerning to many people, especially those who live in areas where they have no access to information, like Donetsk or Luhansk. That's why we're calling for an end to this propaganda campaign, because it seems to be working very hard to get rid of all the propaganda that is being peddled by Russia. At the same time, we need to find out what kind of propaganda is coming out of this campaign. Is it propaganda, or is it just propaganda? Do you think that's a good idea?

NATO's top military commander has called the truce between Ukraine's military and pro-Russia separatists a 'ceasefire in name only.' US General Philip Breedlove said Russian forces were still operating inside Ukraine.
Speaking to reporters after a meeting with NATO military chiefs in Lithuania's capital Vilnius on Saturday, US General Philip Breedlove expressed "sincere hope" about a renewed peace plan, agreed to earlier in the day in the Belarusian capital Minsk, by separatists and representatives from Ukraine's and Russia's governments. The new pact, including an artillery buffer zone, was a move to strengthen a peace plan signed earlier this month, also in Minsk. However, Breedlove said violence levels in Ukraine in recent days were as high as prior to the earlier ceasefire. "The ceasefire is still there in name, but what is happening on the ground is quite a different story," Breedlove said, adding that Russian forces were still operating in Ukraine, although he could not pinpoint how many. "The fluidity of movement of Russian forces and Russian-backed forces back and forth across that border makes it almost impossible to understand the numbers," he said. A convoy from Russia consisting of about 170 trucks arrived in Ukraine on Saturday, with a reported cargo of humanitarian aid. Previous aid convoys sent from Russia were met with outrage in Kyiv, as it was suspected they may have been used to provide support to the pro-Moscow separatists in eastern Ukraine. Russia has repeatedly denied such accusations. The separatists have said they want to break from Kyiv and have already declared "people's republics'" in Donetsk and Luhansk. This week Ukraine's parliament passed a bill which paves the way for more autonomy for those areas. While neither Russia nor Ukraine are members of NATO, both share borders with NATO countries. se/ksb (AP, AFP) "

The German football association has announced that it will be playing in the Bundesliga for the first time this season. The move is part of an effort to strengthen ties with China.
Germany's Bundesliga is set to be played in Germany's Regionalliga Südwest next season, but it's unclear whether the move will have a positive impact on the country's domestic football scene. According to a statement released by the German Football Federation (DFB) on Thursday, the league will play its first match in a Bundesliga competition in September. "We are looking forward to the competition," said FSV Frankfurt sporting director Michael Görner, adding that the club would be "very happy" with the result. However, he added that there was "a lot of uncertainty" about the outcome of the match, which was being played at the Stuttgarter Nachrichten stadium in Wormatia Worms. Germany is expected to host the game on Sept. 15, with a total of 16 teams in attendance, including four Bundesliga teams. There is also the possibility that Germany could host a World Cup qualifier, as well as an exhibition match between the two sides. In the event of a tie between Germany and China, Germany would have to decide whether or not to send its national team to Russia, or whether it would play a friendly match with Russia. It is not clear whether Germany will take part in such a match. If it does, it is likely to face stiff opposition from Russia and the United States, according to German media reports. Faced with an uncertain future The Bundesliga has been in turmoil since the end of last year, when it was forced to cancel a series of matches due to financial problems. This has led to criticism from the Chinese government, who has accused Germany of failing to do enough to protect the interests of its domestic soccer fans. Last week, China's foreign ministry said it had "serious concerns" over a possible conflict of interest between China and Russia over the transfer of football talent to Germany. But the Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday that China would not interfere in any way in its decision-making, and that "it is a matter of time before we are able to fully understand the situation." "The situation is very serious," Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi told reporters at a news conference in Beijing on Tuesday. He said he was not aware of any such concerns, saying that he had no idea what was going on in his country at that time. His comments came after a meeting with FIFA officials in Berlin, where the FIFA executive committee met with German soccer officials to discuss the issue. A spokesman for FIFA, however, said the organization had not yet received any formal response from FIFA. Meanwhile, FIFA has said that FIFA is "committed to working closely with Germany to ensure that we have the best possible situation in which we can compete in Europe." The association's president, Ronny Zimmerman, told the news agency AFP that his organization would continue to work to improve ties between German and Chinese football, particularly with regard to football's international associations, such as the International Federation of Football Associations (IFFA). "It is important for us to make sure that our players are well-integrated into the international football system," he said, referring to FIFA's decision to suspend football operations in China for a year in order to focus on domestic competitions, rather than on international ones. 'We will not allow any kind of interference in our domestic affairs' The FFA said in an official statement that they were "deeply concerned" by what had happened in recent weeks. They said they had received no information about any potential conflict between FIFA and Germany, although they did not have any specific plans to change the rules of how the games are played. Football is an international sport, so they are not allowed to interfere with international competitions. As a result, there is no way of knowing what is going to happen when the matches are scheduled to take place on September 15 and 16. At the same time, a number of media outlets have reported that German officials have expressed concern about a potential clash between football and football in general. "
,"Reference text": " German FA calls off matches with China under-20 team after protests
Germany's football association has called off several friendly matches between China's under-20 team and German lower league sides. The move follows a political protest at the first such match.
In a statement released on Friday, the German football association (DFB) announced that the games would be rescheduled for 2018 and that talks would take place between them and their Chinese counterparts in order explore how to move forward. "To the regret of all parties involved, the project has not received the broad approval that had been expected," the DFB said. "In fact, the project was used by a handful of spectators to send messages that were considered hurtful by the Chinese team, officials, the Chinese Football Association's support staff and Chinese spectators." Protests in opening match The first of the arranged matches, against TSV Schott Mainz of the fourth-tier Regionalliga Südwest was interrupted midway through the first half when the Chinese players left the field because a small group of activists had unfurled Tibetan flags. The team later returned to the field after the flags had been taken down, before succumbing to a 3-0 defeat. On Monday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry strongly criticized the protest. Initially, it had been thought that the Chinese side would play in the Regionalliga Südwest - a regional division of Germany's fourth tier which has only 19 teams but the plan was revised so the matches would just be friendlies. This followed an agreement signed in 2016 between the German FA and the Chinese government to help boost the sport in the Asian country, where the Bundesliga is increasingly popular. Financial boost not enough to soothe concerns Despite the financial boost for the clubs – TSV Schott Mainz were reportedly paid a fee of €15,000 ($17.800) for last weekend's game – the move hasn't proved entirely popular with German fans, many of whom see it as just another example of commercial interests trumping sporting concerns. But the protests, and potential for further disruption, seem to be behind the cancellations - the DFB said both federations were aware of "substantial evidence of further escalation," FSV Frankfurt, who were due to host the Chinese side on Saturday, said earlier this week that they would not ban protests despite an angry response to last week's incident from Beijing. "We will not back a single centimeter off the basic rights our our democracy, including those relating to freedom of speech," FSV Frankfurt President Michael Görner said in an interview with the Stuttgarter Nachrichten and Stuttgarter Zeitung newspapers. His words echoed those of DFB vice-president Ronny Zimmerman, who said that the games should be played "within the framework of freedom of expression." The fixtures that have been abandoned include games against Wormatia Worms and Bundesliga club Hoffenheim's reserves. mp/pfd (dpa, SID) "

What do you want to see from this merger? What can you expect from a company that has a long history of merging with other carmakers? I don't think so. I think we can all agree that this is a very big step for us to take together as a business. We have a lot to learn from each other and we will continue to work together to improve our products and make sure that our customers are happy with what we have in store for them. In the meantime, I would like to share some of my thoughts with you. Let's get to the details of our merger. First of all, let's talk about the integration process. This is something that is very important to us, because it will help us understand how important it is to have an integrated market for our cars. Secondly, it's important that you understand the importance of integrating the two companies together, so that they can be integrated into a single product. And thirdly, there's the issue of how to integrate these two businesses together. There's a big difference between the companies that make up the car market and those that do not. For example, if you're a car manufacturer, you might be interested in integrating them into your product line. But that's not the case here. You can't do that with a large company like Volkswagen, for example. That's why I'm not sure what to say to you about this. Do you have any idea what kind of deal this will be? Is this a good deal for you? Or is it just a matter of time before you decide whether or not you'll be happy about it? If so, what will you do with your car? And if not, how will that affect your business? We'll see what happens when you get there. Then we'll discuss what's going on in terms of integration and how you integrate them in your products. Is there a way to solve this problem? The answer is yes, of course there are many things that are important. One of them is integration. If you combine all three of these things, then you've got a whole new product that can help you solve the problems that have been plaguing you for so long. So, we're talking about integrating these three companies into one product and then integrating it into the same product," Merkel said in an interview with Deutsche Welle. Both companies have said they are looking at integrating their products into their existing business models. They are also looking for ways to reduce costs and improve the efficiency of their operations. As a result, both companies are investing heavily in their respective businesses. "

Owning and operating a car in Germany has never been cheap, but it's never been more expensive than in 2010. German auto club ADAC says costs associated with owning a car have risen more than 40 percent since 1995.
In 2010, German car owners had to pay a high price for their mobility, according to ADAC, which cited record-high fuel prices as the major cost factor. "For drivers, 2010 will go down in history as the most costly year ever," ADAC said in a statement. High taxes The cost of acquiring and operating a car has risen 42 percent since 1995, compared to a 24 percent increase in the general cost of living. Due to tax increases and higher production costs, fuel prices soared 86 percent over the 15-year period. In 2010 alone, the average price for a liter of super gasoline was more than 1.40 euros ($1.84) - the highest the average price ever. According to ADAC, urban singles spent an average of 3,340 euros on their cars in 2000. Five years later, that figure had jumped to 3,900 euros. By the end of 2010, their expenses reached 4,380 euros, or 1,000 euros more than a decade earlier. Driving is also pricey for four-person families with two cars. According to the automobile club, their annual costs have risen 30 percent over the past 10 years from 5,940 euros to 7,740 euros. Taxes account for the lion's share of gasoline and diesel prices. The German government's mineral oil and value added taxes account for nearly 88 cents of the 1.35-euro price of a liter of fuel. Low toll revenue While the German government reaps more revenue year for year from vehicle-related taxes, income generated by its highway toll for trucks is expected to fall this year for the first time since the haulage charges were introduced in 2005. The government predicts this year's toll revenues will amount to 4.2 billion euros, down from 4.3 billion euros in 2009. Author: John Blau Editor: Sam Edmonds "

A German company has opened a new factory in New Delhi. The factory is the latest in a long line of German-made products to be exported to India.
The factory, which is based in Bad Oeynhausen, is one of Germany's largest in the country. It's the first factory to open in India in more than a century, and it's a huge success story for the company. In the past few years, the factory has become a hub for German and Indian companies to sell their products. Now, it has a reputation for being the world's biggest manufacturer of high-quality, low-cost products, with a growing presence in Germany and the United Kingdom. "We have a lot of experience in this field," says Rohail Aslam, who works as a sales representative for a German firm, Handel Kontor. She has been working for several years with the firm since the beginning of the 20th century. Her first job was as an office manager in Delhi's Fachhochschule für Technik und Wirtschaft, where she worked for over a decade. After that, she moved to the city of Bhadohi in Uttar-Pradesh, a suburb of Delhi, to work for her father's firm. There, as well as other German companies, her company was able to make a profit from her work. At the time of her move, Rohails was working at a textile company in Berlin, but she was unable to find a job because of a lack of money. So she decided to take up her new job at the Friedrichshafen-Schule (FSK), a Berlin-based company that specializes in making high quality products for Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Japan, China, India, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. While she had no immediate plans to return to Germany until the end of this year, DW-WORLD spoke to her about her experience working in such a small factory and how she felt it was important to continue working with her family and friends in her home state of Uttar Pradesh. As a result, "I am very happy to say that I have found a great deal of success in my career," she said, adding that she and her husband were very proud of what they had done for their family. But she also said that they were not happy about the fact that their daughter had to go back to school, because she didn't want to miss out on a chance to get a better education. And that's not the only reason why she wanted to come back. For her, there are many other reasons. One of them is that her parents are from India and she is from the Middle East. Another reason is because they don't have the money to travel to other countries. That's why they can't afford to fly to Europe. They have to stay in their own country and travel abroad. This is a very expensive and expensive business, especially if you're a businessperson who wants to do business with foreign companies. What's more, they're not willing to give up their jobs in order to live in an Indian country where they have no money and where there is no job security. These companies are not going to let their employees go to a foreign country, even if they are paid by the Indian government. Even if the government does decide to allow them to move abroad, that doesn't mean they won't stay here and work with Indian firms. India is not a country that has ever had a successful business model in its history. Its economy is highly dependent on foreign firms, so it is only natural that India needs to diversify its economy. To make up for this, Indian businesses need to invest in new technologies, such as robotics, artificial intelligence and robotics. If India's economy continues to grow, then India will be the next big market for these products - and that will make it even more attractive to foreign investors. However, this will not be enough to compete with German firms that are already exporting products from Europe and other emerging markets, like China and Russia. Moreover, Germany is also interested in developing its own technology. Germany has already begun to look into the possibility of selling its products in other European countries, including the Netherlands, Turkey and China. "

After finishing his Bachelors of Business Administration in the United Kingdom, Rohail Aslam went back to his home country, India. But he was eager to spend more time abroad and this time he chose Germany.
His host country has thrown many challenges at him but he's been here for over five years. Small-built, smiling and very gentle, Rohail explains why he stayed. DW-WORLD: Why did you choose Germany in the first place? Rohail Aslam: I already knew a little bit of German, and I joined the Goethe Institute (Max Mueller Bhavan) in New Delhi to fine-tune it. After almost a year in Delhi, I finally landed in Germany to do an MBA at the ‘Fachhochschule für Technik und Wirtschaft’ in Berlin. What made you stay for so long? It was pretty much understood that after I had graduated, I would stay back for a while to gather some knowledge of the country, the country’s business structure and the working culture. I also had the intention of doing an internship here and getting a job to gain some experience here. My family has a carpet manufacturing company back in India. My parents wanted to expand it and start exporting abroad. So, while I was studying, they set up a company in Bad Oeynhausen in north-west Germany. We've been actively exporting rugs to Germany, Western Europe and the US for four years. What could be better than giving my knowledge and expertise to my parents and to their company instead of offering those services to someone else? Does the manufacturing process also take place in Germany? No, everything happens in India -- in Bhadohi in Uttar-Pradesh, which is a renowned carpet-belt -- and the services are much cheaper there. Once the product is completed, it's exported to Germany in huge quantities. Who designs the rugs? Designing is a two-way process. Either we pick our own designs and work on them -- we have two specialised designers who work for us. But if clients come to us with certain designs, colours and patterns then we make the rugs according to their requirements. Where is your company based? We have two companies which are both owned by my mother. The parent company is the manufacturing unit based in India -- called ‘Rohail Teppich Export’ - and the daughter company exports from Germany and is called ‘Handel Kontor’. So we sit here in Germany communicating with our clients, showing them our new products, introducing new colours and designs, inviting them to visit our showroom in Germany in case they cannot visit India. Do your carpets have a lot of Indian colours or designs? Well, I would not exactly classify them as Indian designs or colours. It's more about the trend of the market -- this could be anything. If it's called ‘Indian’, then it is. But the only justification for calling our carpets Indian is that they are manufactured in India. Unless, of course, somebody wants a carpet which has an Indian palace in its design. Otherwise, we mostly have modern and abstract designs -- for example, a bunch of boxes and dices. What is the market in Germany like compared to that of other European countries or the United States? The market is, of course, better in the comparatively colder countries. Having said that, conditions in Spain and in Portugal have actually been booming in the last decade or so. But overall the market is slow at the moment because the entire purchasing and selling pattern has changed. For example, 15 or 20 years ago a carpet or rug was almost a status symbol -- it was valuable. Now rugs are available everywhere. Not only that, earlier a rug meant handmade work and precision work by hand. But now you have machines, even robots, making rugs. Are your carpets also machine-made? The rugs we have are entirely hand-made. We have no machine work anywhere in our enterprise -- we don't have a production plant as such. The entire work process, from ‘start’ to ‘finish’, of a rug is entirely hand-made. Was it very difficult to start up a company in Germany? In fact no. Some might say it was as easy as child-play -- there were very little bureaucracy or paper-work. The whole company had been set up within a couple of hours. So, the set-up procedure is simple. But how easy is it to keep the business going? Well, that's the challenge. Because here there are not only other Indians who have stalls, shops or companies, there are also Persians, Turks, Moroccans, Germans, and English people. So there is a lot of competition. And the guarantee for success is dependent on the amount of effort and, more importantly, on market support. How do you cope "

US President Barack Obama will visit Cuba next week to meet with Cuban officials. Obama is expected to hold talks with Cuba's foreign minister, Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba.
The US president will hold a two-day visit to Cuba on Tuesday to discuss the situation in the Caribbean island nation. The visit will be the first by US President-elect Obama since he took office in January. "I'm very pleased to see that the Cuban government has decided to open the doors for Cuba," Obama said at a news conference in Madrid, adding that he was "very optimistic" about the prospects for the country's relations with the Arab world. In a statement released by the US embassy in Havana, the Spanish Foreign Minister said the visit was a "positive step forward in our efforts to strengthen relations between the United States and Cuba." "We are very hopeful that Cuba will open its doors to the world," he said, referring to Obama's decision to close the Guantanamo detention center, which has been the subject of intense international criticism since the end of the Cold War. US officials have also said that they are "deeply concerned" over the possibility of a US-led invasion of Cuba, and that it could lead to an arms embargo on the Middle East. Spain is one of several countries that has already imposed sanctions on Cuba over its treatment of Palestinian prisoners, including torture, rape, murder and torture. President Obama has also called for an end to US involvement in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and the Gaza Strip. Madrid has said it will continue to cooperate with Washington in its effort to secure the release of Guantanamo detainees. However, Spain's Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday it would not be able to provide any details on how it plans to do so, citing the "ongoing legal challenges" facing the detainees and their families. It is not clear how long the talks will last, however, as the White House has yet to decide on a final decision on whether or not to allow the transfer of detainees from Guantanamo to other US prisons. A US official told the Associated Press news agency that Obama would hold discussions with Spanish officials about a possible return of some detainees to Guantanamo, but that no decision would be made until the negotiations had been made. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Pablo Kuczynski said in an interview with Reuters that his country would "continue to work closely" with US authorities to ensure that all detainees are returned to their countries of origin. He added that there was no chance of an extradition treaty between Spain and Israel, although the two countries would have to agree to a deal if the prisoners were to be transferred to another country. But he did not rule out a return to Spain, saying that Spain was willing to take part in negotiations with Israel if it wanted to keep its citizens in a safe and secure environment. According to Spanish media reports, Obama had also expressed "serious concern" at the prospect of returning some of those detained in Guantanamo. mj/msh (AP, AFP, dpa, Reuters, AP, EFE) Editor's Picks on Guantanamo: Obama, Bush, Moratinos: 'It's time for a change' The Obama administration has made it clear it wants to make Cuba a more open and transparent place for US citizens to live and work in. On Tuesday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he would visit the island of Guayaquil in order to "discuss the issues that are important to us as a whole." The US is currently seeking a new round of sanctions against Cuba for its handling of its nuclear weapons program, in addition to sanctions imposed on Iran and North Korea. Bush's administration is also seeking to ease tensions with Iran over Tehran's nuclear program. Trump's visit comes as Obama prepares to travel to Europe next month to attend the NATO summit in Brussels. His visit is set to kick off a week-long tour of Europe's NATO allies in Europe and Asia.

The first of five Guantanamo inmates slated to be taken in by Spain has arrived there. The move shows Madrid's support of US efforts to close the controversial prison.
Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said the first inmate from the US prison at Guantanamo Bay had arrived in his country. Madrid has agreed to host five prisoners, the largest commitment yet from a European country. Citing privacy concerns, Rubalcaba refused to give the prisoner's name or any identifying information, except to say he was a Palestinian. The new arrival will be able to work and move around Spain as he wishes, but will not be able to leave the country. "He is a Palestinian, he has already arrived in our country. We do not want to give out further details because we want everyone who comes to live in our country to be able to live their lives normally," he told a news conference. Spain urges others to 'do the utmost' Spain's decision to take five Guantanamo detainees is part of an effort to help US President Barack Obama with his plans to shut down the jail. The prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, was set up at a US navy base by former President George W. Bush in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos has urged other European countries "to do their utmost" to take in former Guantanamo detainees as well. Third countries are being asked to take in detainees who are cleared of any charges, but who can't be sent back to their homelands for fear of persecution. Obama had said he would close the prison by January 22, 2010, yet the deadline passed unmet. Some 200 detainees remain there, but finding places to take in the prisoners - even the dozens already cleared for release - has proved controversial. jen/AFP/AP Editor: Andreas Illmer "

Theresa May has warned of grave consequences for the UK as she prepares to leave the European Union. The Prime Minister said on Thursday that she was "gravely concerned" about the consequences of Brexit.
Prime Minister May said she is "deeply worried" over the impact of the Brexit vote. "I am deeply concerned," she told the House of Commons after the vote, which was called by the opposition Labour Party (UKIP) and the British government, in a joint statement. May also warned that Britain would not be able to cope with the fallout from the EU referendum result if it did not take place in the coming days. She also said that there would be "serious consequences" for Britain if the referendum results were to be confirmed. 'Brexit is a grave consequence' May, who was elected in May's first year in office, was the first British prime minister to hold the post since the end of World War II in 1945. In her first term, May was due to take over from David Cameron in 2005, but she has since been replaced by a new leader, Donald Trump.

However, the government is expected to vote on a number of key issues, including immigration, trade and security. It is also expected that May will seek to reduce the size of Britain's budget deficit by at least 10 percent by 2020. Brexit is likely to have a negative impact on the country's economy, said May in her statement, adding that "the UK has a lot to learn from this vote." "We are very concerned about Brexit, and we are going to do everything in our power to make sure that we have the best possible outcome for our country," May told lawmakers. But she also cautioned that the election result would have "no bearing on our ability to achieve our objectives." The government's foreign minister, Boris Johnson, told parliament that Brexit was a "very grave outcome" and that it would "not only affect our economy but also our national security." May added that her government would continue to work closely with EU member states to ensure that they are prepared to cooperate with each other on issues such as migration, security and climate change. Her comments come as the US and EU prepare to host a summit in Brussels later this month, where the two countries are set to discuss the fate of their respective economies. jm/msh (AP, AFP, dpa, Reuters, AP) Editor's Picks Brexit: What do you think will happen in Britain after Brexit? May: 'I'm very worried' The British parliament voted in favor of an EU-wide referendum to replace the current government with a government-led one, called the "One Britain, One Vote" initiative. This is the second time in less than a year that a UK parliament has voted to abolish the single-member parliament. That's because the new government will have to decide whether or not to introduce a single member state, or whether it wants to continue with its current system of checks and balances, as it has been doing for many years now.

,"Reference text": " Opinion: A decision against heart and mind
The House of Commons has passed the Brexit bill - despite most parliamentarians being against it. But now they should take care that Great Britain does not move further away from Europe, writes Birgit Maass.
If only they had done it out of full conviction. If they at least believed that they could really benefit their country by withdrawing from the EU. But many of the parliamentarians whose vote will finally set Brexit on its wayhave voted against their hearts, as well as their minds. It was a vote against their minds, because the withdrawal from the EU will almost certainly, at least on a short to medium term basis, have negative repercussions for the British economy. And it was a vote against their hearts, because for many, a view of the future, divorced from Brussels and increasingly reliant on an unpredictable US President Donald Trump, is somewhat alarming. In recent days, many members of parliament have described it as "a catastrophe." No vote "against the will of the people." Of course there are "Brexiteers" who believe that a Britain independent of Brussels will be able to return to its former greatness, once it is no longer held back by the "Little Europeans." But they are in the minority - the majority of parliamentarians already declared their support for remaining in the EU during the referendum campaign. Yet despite this, Theresa May's government was able to push its legislative proposal through the House of Commons without any great difficulty. The predominant view, also amongst members of the two leading parties, is that to hinder Brexit and to fail to support the government in its endeavors to do so, would be to go "against the will of the people." Anti-EU newspapers have targeted Brexit opponents. And those who have publically come out in support of the EU have had to reckon with death threats. The at times passionate debate in the lower house, that went on over several days, was a temporary highlight in this European tragedy, which in the worst case could contribute to the continent disintegrating into individual sovereign states. Don't be intimidated The British public supports the hard-line position taken by Prime Minister May in withdrawing from the common market. Polls are showing that her strategy is gaining increased support. There is no turning back now. The British are now looking for clarity on the repercussions of their withdrawal from the EU. They want the negotiations with the EU to start as soon as possible. It was an historical misjudgement by David Cameron that he could win the referendum. Most of the members of the lower house believed the then-prime minister and voted to hold a referendum. But now they can no longer stop Brexit. But they should not let themselves be intimidated by party discipline, nor the leading Brexiteers, nor by voter impatience. Over the next two years they should use every chance they can to influence the withdrawal process. May announced that although they are leaving the European Union, they will not be moving away from Europe. The parliamentarians must now hold her to her word. Have something to say?

I can't remember the last time I was in one of those bad situations where I had to go to the emergency room and get something to eat. It's not that bad, it's just that the situation is so bad that you have to get out of the house and go somewhere else. But that doesn't make it any easier to deal with. And that's exactly what we're doing here. We're going to try and figure out a way to make sure that we have everything we need in order to be successful in the future. So we'll see how it goes. Let's start with the basics. First of all, let's look at the basic basics of life: food, water, shelter, clothing, shoes, etc. The basic basic necessities are what you need to live a normal life. Everything else is a waste of time and effort. This is where the problem lies. There's a lot of work to do, and it all depends on how you do it. For example, if you want to learn how to cook, you can do that by reading the instructions. Then you'll be able to find out what the rules are for cooking. You'll also learn about the benefits of cooking for a living, which is why I've always wanted to write a cookbook for my family. Also, I have always been a fan of cookbooks, especially when it comes to cooking, because I love cooking and I like to read recipes that are good for me. They're easy to come by on the internet and they're great for the kids, too! And they have a great recipe for pizza, so they can have pizza all day long! But the real challenge is finding a recipe that works for them, not just for you, but for all of us. If we can find one that is good enough for us, then we've got to have it for our kids. Otherwise, we won't have any problems at all. In fact, the recipe is pretty good. Just about everything in life is made up of recipes and ingredients. All the ingredients are just as good as the ones in your recipe, except for one ingredient: salt. Salt is the key ingredient in making sure your food is safe and that it contains enough salt to last you through the day. salt is also a good ingredient for people who are allergic to salt and are intolerant of salt, as well as for those who have allergies.Salt is not a substitute for salt but salt can be used to treat salt in certain foods, such as meat and vegetables. However, salt does not make salt taste good and salt tastes good, even if it tastes like salt water. Therefore salt has a negative effect on your taste buds and the taste is bad for your health. What's the best thing about salt? Salt and pepper can make you feel better and more like a human being, at least in terms of health and well-being, is that salt will help you stay hydrated and your body will adapt to your diet and reduce the salt content. With salt there is no salt or pepper to taste better than salt - and this is especially true for men and women, who need salt for their bodies. "Salt salt" is salt that has been used for centuries and is very important for many people's health, including children and young people, to keep them healthy and to prevent them from developing diseases like cancer. Salmonella is another important ingredient that helps prevent salt from entering the body. Sodium is an important component in salt-soluble compounds. These compounds have been shown to work in many different ways to help reduce salt levels in food and make them more effective in reducing salt production. Vitamin D can also be a powerful antioxidant. iodine is essential for calcium absorption and helps to reduce cholesterol levels. Add calcium levels are also important in helping to combat salt deficiencies. "

A Lebanese journalist has spoken to the German news magazine about the situation in Lebanon.
The journalist said he was shocked to learn that the Lebanese government had opened an investigation into the alleged involvement of the Muslim Brotherhood in the country's civil war. 
He said the investigation had revealed that a number of people had been arrested in connection with the war in Syria. "The investigation is ongoing," he said, adding that it was "clear that there was no evidence of any involvement by the terrorist organization." "We are shocked that this is the first time that we have seen this kind of investigation," the journalist added. He also said that he had no idea what was going on at the time. The investigation has been ongoing for some time, but it is not clear whether there were any links between the Brotherhood and the Syrian government or whether the two sides were involved in any way at all. In the past, the government has tried to frame the case as an act of terrorism. However, it has not been able to do so. It is still unclear how many people were arrested and how long they would be held in custody. There is also the possibility that they could be charged with crimes against humanity, such as murder, rape, torture, and even murder. But it seems unlikely that any of these charges will be brought to light. According to a report published in German newspaper Deutsche Zeitung, a court in Alexandria has ordered the prosecution of two men accused of supporting the Islamist group Hamas. A court has also ordered a trial on the charges of attempted murder and attempted rape of a woman. Both men have denied the allegations, saying they were innocent bystanders. They have also denied involvement with Hamas and said they have no knowledge of what happened to them. This is a first for Lebanon, which has a long history of violence against women and children, according to its constitution. At least one of them, Khalid Said, was killed in a car bomb attack in Beirut in 2011. mj/msh (AFP, dpa, Reuters, AP, AFP, DPA) Editor-in-Chief of The Associated Press and Reuters contributed to this report. Editor's note: This article was originally published on The Conversation. Read the original article.Majed, who is from Alexandria, told the newspaper: "I am shocked. I have never seen anything like this in my life." He added that "it is very difficult for me to understand what is happening in this country and why people are so angry." The journalist also pointed out that many Lebanese have been living in exile for many years and that some of those who have returned to Lebanon have left their homes in order to return to their countries of origin. That's not to say they don't want to go back and live in their own country. Many people do, however, because they are afraid of losing their jobs and their families. Some have even gone on to claim that Lebanon has become a haven for terrorists. Others say it's a place of refuge for people who are fleeing war and persecution. Author: Michael G.

In a previous interview, he told DW that his family had moved to Beirut from Egypt, where they had lived for several years. His family has since moved back to Egypt and he says he has no plans to leave Lebanon until he returns to his home country of Lebanon to pursue his dream of becoming a Christian. "
,"Reference text": " 'The term Islamist doesn't mean anything anymore'
Not since 1989 has a whole region undergone democratic revolution, but what are the common denominators in the Arab Spring? DW asked Lebanese lecturer and activist Ziad Majed, and he gave some surprising answers.
Ziad Majed is a lecturer in political science at the American University in Paris. In 2004, he co-founded the Democratic Left Movement and participated in the Lebanese uprising of 2005 against the Syrian occupation of Lebanon. In 2009 he joined the Beirut Spring Forum. Deutsche Welle: We hear a lot about the relatively young age of populations in the countries that have overthrown rulers this year. But your take on that is somewhat different, isn't it? Ziad Majed: The demographic boom that we had in the past was over a few years ago, but the product of this boom is there, and it was young people taking to the streets now. However, the birth rate of this generation is much lower than that of its parents. That means at the age of 25 or 26, when their parents had two or three or four children, they don't have any kids. That makes them more capable of being mobilized. In addition, the fact that the age of marriage, whether for economic reasons or changing values, is becoming higher allowed them to take to the streets. This explains why the revolutions happened now and not five or 10 years ago. But youth still plays a role. You have to realize that people were simply extremely tired of seeing the same old faces in power who ruled when their parents were young. What I could also add is urbanization. That means territorial and social continuity. Young people are no longer isolated in small villages or small towns. The role of global media feeds into that trend, doesn't it? The first thing is satellite media. Anywhere you go in the Arab world, you'll see small dishes or even illegal satellite TV receptors. So direct governmental censorship and control of the media is no longer an issue. Everyone goes to al-Jazeera or al-Arabiya or even Arabophone European stations. Then, Internet penetration is becoming much higher. People can meet in cyber-cafés and discuss what they read. In Egypt, for instance. Khalid Said was a young guy in Alexandria who owned a cyber-café. The police were trying to force him to pay bribes and he refused. He even took pictures with his mobile phone of policemen beating someone. So they kidnapped him, and he was beaten and killed. The anger following his death led to the creation of a facebook page, which was one of the most important sites at the beginning of the revolution. In Syria, what was most important was that every citizen became a reporter. Independent, international media aren't allowed. So the only way for people to cover what's happening is by making mobile-phone images and uploading them to Youtube so the world can witness what's going on. A moderate Islamist party just took the most votes in elections in Tunisia, and the Muslim Brotherhood may emerge as the strongest party in next month's vote in Egypt. How does that square with democracy? The term "Islamist" doesn't mean anything anymore. The word arose in the 1980s and 90s to describe the rise of political Islam. Today, there's a whole sprectrum of groups that can be described as Islamist from the Wahabis to the Salafis, the Muslim Brotherhood to Hezbollah and Hamas. All these groups are different and don't agree on a single version of the sharia. The West should understand that under repressive regimes mosques were places of refuge, and that there's a tendency after the fall of a regime to vote for groups representing the victims of that regime. So it's logical that there should be some Islamist parties doing well. But that doesn't mean the same thing it did in the 1980s and 90s, when the movements concentrated on changing regimes by violence or force. For the first time, Islamist movements have achieved power through elections, and that will change them, making them part of the political game. They may win now. But if they don't deliver on problems like unemployment, why would anyone vote for them again? But won't they try to turn back the clock in a lot of ways? They might be very conservative in their mindset, but they cannot impose what they consider to be an Islamization of society. They are not the strongest part of the democratic movement, only the most organized. I'm not scared because I think the Arab Spring is irreversible. People have discovered the power of the street and of mobilization. So if the "Islamists" try to impose something on society, what's stopping people from going back out on the street and saying "We're not happy with this?" And what can Europe and the West in general do to help ensure that the democratic promise of the Arab Spring becomes a reality? Four things. We need investment that's decentralized so as to bring prosperity to neglected regions and that's guided by a principle of corporate responsibility. We need observers who "

A museum in the German city of Göttingen has opened its doors to the public for the first time since the discovery of the Chalk Cliffs on Rügen in 1945.
The museum, which has been open since 1945, is the largest in Germany, with more than 1,000 exhibits. It's the only one of its kind in Europe, and it's a place where visitors can take a look around and see what they're looking for. The museum is located in a small town in northern England, just a few miles (kilometers) from the city's main train station. There are also a number of other exhibits, including a collection of paintings by German sculptor Caspar David Friedrich, as well as an exhibition on the history of German art and culture. "It's been a long time coming since I've been here," says Manfred, who was born in Cuxhaven, the capital of Germany. He was a student of Friedrich Wilhelm Hufeland at the University of Bremen, where he studied German literature and history. In the early 20th century, he became interested in art history and became fascinated by the idea of art as a means of learning about the world around him. His interest in history led him to take up the art of painting, especially in his hometown of Heiligendamm, near the town of Cologne. During his time there, there were many exhibitions on German history, such as the exhibition "The History of Art and Culture," which was opened in 1946. At the time, it was called the "Bade Museum" and was named after a German poet who wrote a book about German culture and literature. After the war, Germany was divided into two parts: Germany and the United Kingdom. Germany's capital, Berlin, was split between the two countries, while the UK and Britain were divided over the issue of war and peace. Both countries are still divided on how to deal with the aftermath of World War II. German historians have long argued that war was the most important issue facing the country at that time. However, in recent years Germany has seen a resurgence of nationalism and a rise in anti-semitic sentiment among young people. This year, however, a new generation of young Germans have come to Germany to seek a better understanding of what it means to be German. According to one historian, "Germany is a country that has never been able to fully understand the meaning of freedom." In his book "On the Road to Freedom" (1948), Bürgermeister states that Germany is "the only country in which the freedom of speech has not been fully realized." He also points out that there are many other European countries that have not yet been recognized as being part of a free society. For example, some of these countries have been designated as "free zones" by UNESCO, but this is not the case in Britain. Some of them are not. Others, for instance, are known to have taken part in Nazi-era propaganda and propaganda campaigns. They have also been criticized for being too liberal in their use of language and for not respecting the rule of law. But the Bütte museum has also seen an increase in German-speakers' rights to speak out against the Nazi regime. A new exhibition is scheduled to open later this month in Berlin.

,"Reference text": " A Brief History of the Seaside Holiday
These days, millions take seaside holidays for granted as one of life's pleasures. But 200 years ago, a dip in the sea was more a test of courage. Hardly anyone could swim.
As late as the 18th century, many Europeans still thought of the sea as the realm of Satan: storm-tossed and inhabited by terrifying monsters. "Unlike the mountains, the coasts were terra incognita as a holiday spot," says Manfred Bätje, director of the Bade-Museum on the North Sea island of Norderney. Anyone who set foot in the water was "stepping into the unknown". Brighton showed the way That only began to change after the British aristocracy discovered the healing power of salt water. As early as 1780, Brighton, England's biggest and oldest seaside resort, was a bustling spa. Philosopher and physicist Georg Christoph Lichtenberg (1742-1799) of Göttingen gave Germans the starting signal with his 1793 essay "Why doesn't Germany have any large public seaside resorts?" In it, he called for the creation of a resort in Cuxhaven on the North Sea. He received support from the most notable German physician of the time, the Prussian king's court physician, Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland. But things turned out somewhat differently. Germany's first seaside resort was indeed built in September, 1793, but in Heiligendamm on the Baltic Sea. Four years later, permission was granted for construction of Germany's first resort on the North Sea, on Norderney. "For the first bathing season on July and August of 1800, only around 250 guests turned up. Now, the nearly 6000 residents host a good 530,000 bathers annually, plus around 230,000 day-trippers," Bätje reels off the figures. Romanticist inspiration In the 19th century, the landscapes of Caspar David Friedrich, such as his famous Chalk Cliffs on Rügen (1818), gave seaside holidays added impetus. From then on, the sea was no longer a voracious beast. From the shore, the cultivated, modern European contemplated the vast melancholy of the deep. "The calm sea became an embodiment of unspecified yearning, the waves an expression of vitality and dynamism," soliloquizes museum director Bätje. But the journey to the sea long remained an arduous, time-consuming one. It took the mail coach a good thirty hours to cover the distance from Hamburg to the North Frisian town of Aurich over bumpy, muddy roads. The express cab from Bremen only took about 16 hours to reach the East Frisian town of Norden - including six changes of horses along the way. "It wasn't comfortable," explains Bätje. Not until the introduction of seaside tourist steamers out of Hamburg and Bremen to the islands and the expansion of the railways did the journey become easier. Strict bathing rules At first, it was primarily the well-to-do bourgeois and nobility who were able to afford a seaside holiday. Victorian-era society is known for its extreme prudishness, and the beach was not exempt. Bathing machines were essentially changing cabins on wheels that could be rolled into the surf. The sexes were kept strictly separated. Wet swimsuits could not be allowed to cling, thus revealing the body's contours.

},{"Generated text": " Spiegel Affair: German journalist Nikolas Brender faces trial
A German newspaper has filed a defamation lawsuit against the head of the Bundeswehr over the publication of a controversial Spiegel magazine.
The case has been referred to the Federal Court of Justice in Hesse, where it is alleged that the magazine published an article critical of former German President Franz Josef Strauss. The case was brought by the German Federation of Journalists (DFJ), which has said it will appeal the decision. It is the first time that a German media outlet has faced legal challenges in the wake of an alleged leak of classified information. In the case, which was first reported by Deutsche Welle, the newspaper said that it had received a letter of complaint from a member of its board of directors. According to a statement from the FJ, "the Spiegel article was published without the express express written consent of our board." The Spiegel story is one of several that have come to light in Germany in recent years, including the one published by ZDF on Friday. "The Spiegel paper is a very important piece of journalism," said Michael Konken, a spokesman for the DFB, referring to Strauss' tenure as Germany's defense minister. He added that he was "very happy" with the way the paper was handled, adding that "it was a good thing that we were able to get the information we needed." "We are very happy with what we got," he said. However, he added, there is still "a lot of work to be done" to make sure the Spiegel case is heard in a court of law. 'We have a lot to learn from this case' Bodo Hombach, president of WAZ newspaper, told the news agency that there was no evidence to back up the allegations against Strauss, who was sacked in September after a series of corruption scandals. But he also said there were "no indications" that Strauss had been involved in any wrongdoing, and that prosecutors were looking into whether or not he had violated the terms of his employment agreement. A German court has also heard a case in which a journalist was arrested and charged with making false statements to police, but the prosecution has not yet decided whether to file charges against him or whether he should be tried in absentia. On Friday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel announced that she would step down from her post at the end of this year. She said she had no intention of resigning as chancellor, although she did not rule out the possibility of doing so. Her spokesman, Roland Koch, said in an interview with German public broadcaster Welt am Sonntag that her office had not received any formal complaints about Strauss's conduct. Earlier this month, however, she said the government had made a "serious error" in handling the matter, saying it was not clear whether Strauss was under investigation for his role in publishing the article. That's because the investigation is ongoing, Koch said, in light of recent developments in West Germany and in other parts of Germany. h/t: AFP, dpa, Reuters, AP Editor-in-Chief of The Associated Press and other news agencies contributed to this report. w/dpa/kmsh (AP, AFP) Editor: Andreas Röhmann, DPA, Rheinische Zeitung Editor in Chief Editor, Thomas Müller (AFP, DW, KPN) and others, were among those who spoke out in support of Strauss and his government. They said they were disappointed by what they saw as a lack of cooperation between the state and the media. Rüsselblatt, editor in chief of German daily "Welt" magazine, also called for an independent investigation into the leak, accusing Strauss of failing to act on his promise to protect the rights of journalists. Württemberg's government has refused to comment on the issue, citing "internal and external factors" but said he would not comment further on whether it would be appropriate to do so at a press conference later this week.

There are also reports that some of them have been arrested in connection with a similar case. "
,"Reference text": " Taking stock of press freedom in Germany
Fifty years ago, the offices of "Spiegel" magazine were searched and leading journalists arrested as a result of political pressure. Press freedom eventually prevailed. Today too the media's independence is under threat.
What happened in October, 1962, had a lasting effect on the relationship between politicians, the judiciary and journalists in Germany. Spiegel news magazine had published an article critical of Germany's armed forces, the Bundeswehr. The German army, it said, was only "prepared for defense to a limited extent", adding it would certainly have to employ nuclear missiles to counter attacks. That was the author's conclusion following an evaluation of a NATO maneuver. Leading politicians - first and foremost Chancellor Konrad Adenauer and Defense Minister Franz Josef Strauss - accused the magazine of treason. A constitutional lawyer filed charges against the editorial office, arrest warrants were issued for the author and the chief editor. The latter remained in custody for more than 100 days. The Spiegel editorial department was shut down for weeks. There was a public outcry against the state's handling of the journalists, even protest from members of the coalition government. In the end, Defense Minister Strauss was forced to resign after his considerable participation in the reprisals against the news magazine became evident. Germany's Federal Court of Justice also ruled there was no proof of treason. What became known as the Spiegel Affair still touches issues that are highly relevant even today. Is a democratic state allowed to reprimand critical reporters? And how freely can the German media report on politics? Press freedom today "Such featherbrained attempts by politics to influence the press are today no longer possible," Bodo Hombach, former Social Democrat and director of WAZ media group, told Deutsche Welle. The head of the German Federation of Journalists (DJV), Michael Konken agrees. "We have a critical media with quality publications and broadcasters who bring such problems to the public." At the same time, Konken has to admit that Reporters without Borders has in the past years ranked Germany only in places 17 to 19 in its press freedom index. The top places where occupied by the Scandinavian countries. This, Konken said, pointed to problems in Germany. And indeed, there have been examples confirming that in the recent past. Politics has grip on public broadcasters The "Brender case" is often viewed as an example of a blow to freedom of the press. Nikolas Brender was editor-in-chief of Germany's public broadcaster ZDF. As he was an independently minded journalist who would not refrain from saying what he thought, he was not always popular with politicians. It was first and foremost Roland Koch, premier of the state of Hesse at the time, who opposed renewing Brender's contract - and Bender lost his job. How was this possible? All public broadcasters are officially controlled by their supervisory and administrative boards. After the experience of government controlled media under the Nazis, broadcasters in post-war West Germany were supposed to be democratically controlled. The boards are made up of a cross-section of society, including politicians from all major parties. In the case of ZDF when Brender was editor in chief, the board was dominated by conservative politicians. And that's what stacked the odds against Bender when it came to extending his contract. Powerless The way in which Brender was treated by the politicians on the board caused an uproar across the entire media landscape in Germany. Even representatives of the conservative media thought that a line had been crossed. "An act of unbelievable high-handedness" of those responsible, says Mathias Döpfner, who is at the helm of the conservative Axel Springer publishing house. "A dangerous interference with the DNA of a broadcaster," criticized Frank Schirmacher of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung daily. But, again and again, there have been attempts - mostly by politicial leaders - to interfere with the internal affairs of a broadcaster; a claim confirmed by Hartmann von der Tann, former coordinator for politics with Germany's other big public broadcaster, ARD. Print media also affected Newspapers in Germany experience limits to press freedom for different reasons. Dirk C. Fleck, for his book "The Fourth Power," spoke to 25 leading journalists and editors-in-chief about how independent they are. There's not a lot of room, he says. Speaking to DW, the author described the sobering answers he got and how almost all of the journalists describe the same vicious circle. It began with the boom of the Internet. More and more people got their news from the Web; in particular, young people who are important for advertising. Many companies therefore shifted their advertising budgets to focus on the Internet. German publishers responded by setting up online newsrooms to get some of the money going into online ads. But the free content offered online has not generated enough revenue through advertising. The print media has failed to capitalize on the online market. With the same budget, publishers have since tried to sustain both their print and online editions. As a "

US President Barack Obama will visit the Malcolm Grow Medical Facility near Baltimore on Tuesday. Obama is expected to meet with the facility's medical staff.
The US president is scheduled to travel to Maryland later in the day for a medical conference in Washington, D.C. The visit is the first since the inauguration of US Vice President Joe Biden in January. "We are very excited to be here," Obama said at a news conference at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland, where he will hold a joint press conference with his wife, Michelle, as well as his son and daughter-in-law to discuss the medical issues facing the US military at the time of his inauguration. Biden has been in Baltimore for more than a year and a half for medical conferences. In January, the Obama administration announced that it would be sending a team of medical experts to the hospital to assess the conditions of the patients. It is not yet clear whether the team will be able to make a final decision on whether or not to send medical personnel to Camp Springs, Md., or whether they will stay on the base for another year or two. A spokesman for the White House said the president was "very pleased" with Obama's visit, adding that the visit was a "positive step forward." "It is a positive step for our military," the spokesman said in an e-mailed statement. President Obama also said that he was looking forward to meeting with hospital staff and medical professionals.

In a statement, Biden said: "This is an important step in our efforts to improve the quality of life for all of our troops. We are hopeful that these efforts will lead to a better outcome for everyone." Obama, who is visiting Maryland for his first official visit since taking office, said on Wednesday that "we have a lot of work ahead of us." The president also expressed his "deep concern" over the safety of military personnel and the health of civilians, saying the military "is not going to tolerate this kind of behavior from the civilian population." He also called on Congress to pass a bill that would make it easier for civilians to access medical care at medical facilities, such as medical centers and hospitals, to allow them to have access to medical equipment and to provide training and support to those who need it most. However, Obama did not directly address the need for such training, but said it was important to "make sure that all personnel are trained and equipped to deal with this type of situation," according to Reuters news agency. dpa/jm (AP, AFP, Reuters, AP, EFE) pfd/dpa, jd/rc (AFP, EPA, REUTERS, Channel Islands News Service, The Associated Press) dp/msh (Reuters, agencies), dg/kms (ax, PT, DW), Reuters/AP/AFP/EFE, dPA, pdw, bp, cb/Reuters Editor's Picks Biden: 'It's time to move on to other things' Obama has made it clear he wants to get to work on his health care agenda.

A false report of an active shooter at Joint Base Andrews outside Washington, D.C., briefly put the facility on lockdown. The base hosts Air Force One, used by President Obama.
An active shooter exercise at Joint Base Andrews was mistaken for a real shooting situation on Thursday morning, triggering a lockdown at the military base that houses the president's aircraft. Joint Base Andrews outside Washington, D.C., issued a "shelter in place" order after an active shooter incident was reported at the Malcolm Grow Medical Facility at approximately 9 am local time. The base said on Twitter that there was an active shooter exercise scheduled, but a real active shooter situation was reported. It later cleared the facility. The lockdown delayed the travel of Vice President Joe Biden, who was scheduled to fly to Ohio for a campaign event. The Joint Base Andrews is located in Camp Springs, Maryland, just outside the US capital. The base serves as the home of Air Force One, the US president's aircraft, and is used by other senior government officials. "

A Pakistani journalist has died in a car crash in the Pakistani city of Lahore. His body was found in an open field near the Jinnah Hospital.
The German news agency Deutsche Welle has published a report on the death of a Pakistani doctor who was shot and killed by Indian forces. The doctor, who had been working as a security guard for the Pakistan army, is believed to have been shot by an Indian soldier. He died on Sunday, the day after the attack. "The Pakistani government has been trying to prevent this from happening," said Disha Uppal, a member of the German public affairs team. She added that it was "unfortunate" that the doctor had to be shot, but that he was able to live with his wife and two young children. It was the first time in more than a decade that a doctor was killed in Pakistani-administered Punjab province, which is home to Pakistan's largest Muslim population. According to the report, "the death toll from the incident is likely to rise to at least 10,000." The Pakistani medical examiner's office said the cause of death was not yet known. However, it said it could not be ruled out that there was a connection between the accident and the suicide bomber's death.

,"Reference text": " Threat of the Punjabi Taliban is growing
Deutsche Welle talks to Pakistani political expert Hasan Askari Rizvi about the growing ties between militants in northwest Pakistan and Punjab province.
At least four gunmen disguised in police uniforms raided a hospital in Pakistan's eastern city of Lahore on Monday night, claiming at least five lives. Local officials said the gunmen were trying to free a militant, who was being treated there after being captured during attacks on two mosques last Friday. The police said the gunfight at Jinnah Hospital had lasted around 45 minutes but the gunmen had managed to flee. Friday's twin attacks on the minority Ahmadi community left more than 90 people dead. They were claimed by a group, which identified itself as the Punjabi wing of the Taliban. Deutsche Welle spoke to political expert Hasan Askari Rizvi in Lahore, where there has been a wave of violence in recent days. DW: Who are the "Punjabi Taliban"? It is a kind of a pejorative term, which includes a host of groups. Initially in Punjab, you had two types of militancy: One, the groups that focussed mainly on Indian-administered Kashmir and there were other types of groups that focussed on Pakistan. Those were the sectarian groups targeting mainly the Shias, and there were some Shia groups targeting the Sunni leadership. Over the years a lot of factions have broken away from these groups and these small entities are functioning more or less autonomously. They have trainings in the tribal areas because these are secured for them and certain parts are not under Pakistani control so these groups go there. They operate with the Pakistani Taliban based in tribal areas against the Pakistani troops in the region. They also have an autonomous agenda, which they pursue in Punjab, as they have been doing in the past days. These groups also play host or are a kind of a local link to Taliban suicide bombers who come into the main part of Pakistan from the tribal areas (let's say to Punjab). If they have to target some place, they park themselves with these Punjab groups, and then do it. All these factions and groups that have broken away from traditional militant groups and are functioning in close collaboration with tribal area Taliban are often described as the "Punjabi Taliban". Why do you think these militants are resurfacing now? They have always existed here and there and generally the trend is that they undertake a couple of operations, one after the other. Then the government comes in and takes action against them. Then they just disappear or become sleeping groups and suddenly after a couple of months they resurface. That's the standard pattern. The last major incident in Lahore was in the first week of March. Then there was nothing in April and now towards the end of May you have this kind of incident. Do you think the government should have taken stronger action against them? They should have but the problem is that the Punjab government has a kind of ambiguous approach and I think there is some element of denial within the leadership also. These groups also have some sympathy if not support at the societal level and that makes it difficult for the government to go against them openly. They need to work together and to emphasise to the people that they are terrorists. They use different names and Islam but actually their agenda is terrorism. Somehow the government of Punjab has been rather confused and ambiguous regarding these groups. Interview: Disha Uppal Editor: Anne Thomas "

The head coach of FC Barcelona is set to take over the reins at the helm of the Catalan club. The move comes as the club prepares to host its first ever Primera Liga match on Sunday.
Tito Vilanca will be stepping down from his role as head of football at Barcelona on Friday. He is expected to be replaced by Pep Guardiola, who has been promoted to the role of interim coach. "I'm not going to sit here and tell you what's going on. I don't want to do that," he said in a press conference on Thursday, adding that he was "very happy" with the job he has done so far in his first season in charge of a club that is struggling to find its footing in the Spanish league. His first two seasons have been marked by poor results, with only one win and one draw. In the first half of last season, Barcelona lost 3-0 at home to Real Betis, and Guardiola's side lost 2-1 to Sevilla in their first league match. Guardiola is now the manager of Barcelona's youth team, which has struggled with injuries in recent years and is in dire need of new players. But he is also looking to strengthen his squad for the upcoming season. Barcelona coach Luis Enrique has already said he will not be making any changes to his coaching staff until the end of this year. However, it is not yet clear how long he plans to stick around as a coach, even if he does decide to stay on as an assistant. It is unclear whether the coach will continue to make changes at his club, or whether he may be forced to leave his position in order to focus on his new role. Catalan football is one of Spain's oldest and most prestigious sports, but it has a long way to go before it reaches its full potential.

"It's a great opportunity for us to get back on the pitch," Guardiola said after the team's win over Real Madrid in Sunday's first round of matches in Madrid and Barcelona, where they have won three of their last four league matches, including the Copa del Rey final, in which they lost to eventual winners Barcelona in last week's final. vp/msh (AP, AFP, dpa, Reuters, AP) Editor's Picks Barcelona: What do you think about the move to Barcelona? Barcelona vs. Madrid: Is it the right move for Guardiola? Catalonia: The Catalan side is the only team that has made it into the top flight of Spanish football this season and it's not just a matter of who wins the title. There are also a number of other teams that have made the most of it, such as Manchester United, Manchester City and Real Sociedad. And there are a couple of teams who have not been able to reach the final yet. One of those teams is Barcelona. That's why I'm so excited about this move, because I think it will give Barcelona a real chance of making the next step in its quest for European football's top-flight. After all, this is a team with a history of success and a reputation for being a very good football team. What's next for Barcelona and the rest of Europe? Well, let's see if they can make it to Europe. First, they will have to decide whether or not to sign a new player. Then they must decide what kind of player they want. They have already made a decision on who will play for them and what role they'll play in future seasons. If they do not agree with that decision, then the question is what will happen. "
