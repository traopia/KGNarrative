Located on Kotlin Island, 30 kilometres (19\\xa0mi) west of Petrograd in the Gulf of Finland, Kronstadt defended the then-capital city as the base of the Baltic Fleet. For sixteen days in 18 March 1921, rebels in Kronstadt\\'s naval fortress rose in opposition to the Soviet government they had helped to consolidate. Neither the rebels nor the government expected the Kronstadt protests to trigger a rebellion. The National Center separately plotted a Kronstadt uprising in which the \"kadetes\", with Wrangel\\'s troops, would take turn the city into a new center of Bolshevik resistance, but the rebellion occurred independent of this plan. At a tumultuous meeting of the Petrograd Soviet, despite resistance from rebel representatives, an approved resolution called for the end of the rebellion and the return of power to the local Kronstadt Soviet. Zinoviev\\'s Petrograd Defense Committee airdropped a leaflet over Kronstadt accusing the rebellion of being orchestrated by the White Army, ordering their surrender, and threatening that those who resisted would be \"shot like partridges\". During the 10th Party Congress, concurrent with the rebellion, Kronstadt symbolized the swelling peasant unrest towards the party\\'s unpopular War Communism policy and the need for reform, but Kronstadt had no influence on Lenin\\'s plans to replace War Communism with the New Economic Policy (NEP), which was drafted for the Congress\\'s agenda in advance of even the rebel\\'s demands.

The exact place and time of the battle is not known, but very few remaining medieval sources suggest that the clash took place on the right bank of the Drava River in medieval Slavonia (Latin: Sclavonia) or former Principality of Lower Pannonia respectively, in 925. Slavonia should have been an integral part of the medieval Croatian state if the battle had happened, however according to the Byzantine ruler Constantine Porphyrogenitus it was under Principality of Hungary control. The battle was followed by the unification of Duchy of Croatia and the territory of Lower Pannonia. They started occasionally to perform devastating raids and military campaigns to the south as well, across the Drava river, to the territory of the Principality of Lower Pannonia. According to meager medieval sources, the decisive battle took place in an undefined area of the right, southern bank of the Drava River. After the battle, Tomislav took control over the territory south of Drava, uniting Croatian lands from the Adriatic Sea in the south to the Drava River in the north, as well as from eastern part of Istria (Raša River) in the west to Drina River in the east. The records of the two Synods of Bishops held in Split in 925 and 928 indirectly confirm that Croatia comprised the territory of medieval Slavonia, with its capital Sisak. Just the possibility to choose Sisak, the only bishopric in Slavonia at that time and the seat of the ruler of Principality of Lower Pannonia, confirms that the area of this former principality was after the battle of Drava controlled by King Tomislav of Croatia.',\n",

       "  'The Leticia Incident, also called the Leticia War or the Colombian-Peruvian War (01 September 1932 – 24 May 1933), was a short-lived war between Colombia and Peru over territory in the Amazon rainforest. The war started with an internal insurrection in Peru and a civilian takeover of the city of Iquitos. On 01 September 1932, President Luis Miguel Sánchez dispatched two regiments of the Peruvian Army to Leticia and Tarapacá; both settlements were in the Amazonas Department, now in southern Colombia. The Peruvian forces, which were encamped on the banks of the Putumayo River, stopped several large trade ships from traveling to Leticia. Laureano Gómez, the head of the Senate minority, proclaimed, \"Peace, peace, peace in inner Colombia; war, war, war on the border against our despicable enemy.\" On 19 September, El Tiempo reported that it had received over 10,000 letters calling for war and control of Leticia. Herbert Boy and other German aviators of SCADTA, which later became Avianca, fitted their commercial planes for war as a temporary Colombia Air Force. The city was chosen because Leticia was on the border with Brazil, and the Colombia Forces preferred to attack a softer target rather than the well-defended Peruvian positions in and around the city. The only skirmish took place at the site called Buenos Aires, when a picket of Colombia soldiers ran into a company of Peruvian troops who also left the area and force marched towards Leticia. The Colombia negotiating commission, composed of Roberto Urdaneta, Guillermo Valencia and Luis Cano, signed the agreement through which Leticia was recovered on June 19, 1934. On the same day, Colombia President Enrique Olaya broke off all relations with Peru because of the aerial attack. On 30 April 1933, Peruvian President Sánchez was shot dead; 15 days later, his successor, Óscar Benavides, met with the head of the Colombia Liberal Party, Alfonso López Pumarejo, to secure an agreement to turn Leticia over to a League of Nations commission. Colombia and Peru met in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to sign a peace treaty.',\n",
       "  'The Western Desert campaign (Desert War), took place in the deserts of Egypt and Libya and was the main theatre in the North African campaign of the Second World War. Military operations began in 11 June 1940 with the Italian declaration of war and the Italian invasion of Egypt from Libya in September. The Western Desert Force (renamed Cyrcom and later the Eighth Army) was depleted in early 1941 to send units to Greece, rather than complete the conquest of Libya, just as German troops and Italian reinforcements arrived. With Tunisia, a part of French North Africa to the west and Egypt to the east, the Italians prepared to defend both frontiers through a North Africa Supreme Headquarters, under the command of the Governor-General of Italian Libya, Marshal of the Air Force, Italo Balbo. In Libya, the Royal Army had about 215,000 men and in Egypt, the British had about 36,000 troops, with another 27,500 men training in Palestine. The Egypt–Libya border was defended by the Egyptian Frontier Force and in 11 June 1940, the headquarters of the 6th Infantry Division (Major-General Richard O\\'Connor) took over command in the Western Desert, with instructions to drive back the Italians from their frontier posts and dominate the hinterland if war began. Italian land and air forces in Libya greatly outnumbered the British in Egypt but suffered from poor morale and were handicapped by some inferior equipment. The war was fought primarily in the area known as the Western Desert, which was about 240\\xa0mi (390\\xa0km) wide, from Mersa Matruh in Egypt to Gazala on the Libyan coast, along Litoranea Balbo (Via Balbia), the only paved road. In British parlance, the term \"Western Desert\" applied to the desert of Egypt west of the Nile but came to describe the whole area of conflict, including eastern Cyrenaica in Libya. Benito Mussolini had no plans to invade Egypt, intending to remain on the defensive in Libya if war came.',\n",

In the months before the Days of Rage, despite the tensions within SDS, many members of Weather/SDS worked non-stop in promoting the demonstration. Weatherman found itself isolated from SDS, but maintained hopes that thousands would attend the mass demonstration in Chicago.

Ever since the separatism gathered force in the 1980s, the territorial ambitions of Khalistan have at times included Chandigarh, sections of the Indian Punjab, including whole North India and some parts of western states of India. Chief Minister of Punjab Amarinder Singh claimed that the recent extremism is backed by Pakistan\\'s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) and \"Khalistani sympathisers\" in Canada, Italy, and the UK. He makes the case that the attachment of Punjab with Sikhism is a recent phenomenon, stemming from the 1940s. The resolution document included both religious and political issues, asking for the recognition of Sikhism as a religion separate from Hinduism, as well as the transfer of Chandigarh and certain other areas to Punjab. Operation Blue Star was an Indian military operation ordered by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, between 1 June 1984 and 8 June 1984, to remove militant religious leader Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale and his armed followers from the buildings of the Harmandir Sahib complex (aka the Golden Temple) in Amritsar, Punjab—the most sacred site in Sikhism. Recently, many signs have been raised in several places in support of the Khalistan movement, although the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRCC) reports that Sikhs who support Khalistan may themselves be detained and tortured. The Khalistan movement was brought to a decline only after India fenced off a part of the Punjab border with Pakistan and the Benazir Bhutto government agreed to joint patrols of the border by Indian and Pakistani troops. There has been some controversy over Canada\\'s response to the Khalistan movement. Shiromani Akali Dal President Sukhbir Badal was quoted saying Khalistan is \"no issue, either in Canada or in Punjab\".',\n",

Artwork of Madí movement appeared in eight issues of its magazine, Arte Madí Universal, published between 1947 and 1954. The Grupo Madí was one of two prominent groups of artists pursuing abstract art in Argentina. The Madí art movement formed as a reaction to the AACI, whose art was perceived by the Madí group as being too strict in their method of creating concrete art, resulting in a lack of expression in their artworks. One of the most overt criticisms made by the Madí movement criticized cultural authorities in the Arte Madí Universal magazine, commenting \"he last submission to the Venice Biennial has signified for Argentina a blunt negation of the new values. Some scholars, including Barreiro, saw the government was an outspoken critic against concrete art as a whole, whereas others such as Andrea Giunta assert that the Madí and Concrete groups were not victimized under Perón\\'s regime; rather, they \"coexisted on its margins\". Madí is perhaps the sole remaining art movement which can boast of a half-century of uninterrupted activity since its creation in Buenos Aires in 1946. The Madí Manifesto was created to defend the importance of invention in the light of limitations imposed on concrete art by the excessive rationalism of European concrete art.',\n",

However, archaeological evidence of an outburst flood on the Yellow River, comparable to similar severe events in the world in the past 10,000 years, has been dated to about 1900 BC (a few centuries later than the traditional beginning of the Xia dynasty which came after Emperors Shun and Yao), and is suggested to have been the basis for the myth. Among other things, the Great Flood of China is key to understanding the history of the founding of both the Xia dynasty and the Zhou dynasty, it is also one of the main flood motifs in Chinese mythology, and it is a major source of allusion in Classical Chinese poetry. The story of the Great Flood plays a dramatic role in Chinese mythology, and its various versions present a number of examples of the flood myth motif around the world. For example, the flood usually results from natural causes rather than \"universal Genesis flood narrative\". According to legend, a comprehensive approach to societal development resulted not only in wide-scale cooperation and large-scale efforts to control the flood but also led to the establishment of the first state of China, the Xia dynasty (ca. It was during the reign of Emperor Yao that the Great Flood began, a flood so vast that no part of Yao\\'s territory was spared, and both the Yellow River and the Yangtze valleys flooded. Yu tried a different approach to the project of flood control; which in the end having achieved success, earned Yu renown throughout Chinese history, in which the Gun-Yu Great Flood is commonly referred to as \"Great Yu Controls the Waters\" (Chinese: 大禹治水; pinyin: Dà Yǔ Zhì Shuǐ).

       "  \"The Vyborg–Petrozavodsk Offensive or Karelian offensive was a strategic operation by the Soviet Union Leningrad and Karelian Fronts against Finland on the Karelian Isthmus and East Karelia fronts of the Continuation War, on the Eastern Front of World War II. After Finland had rejected the peace conditions, and Germany halted the Soviet Union advance, the Stavka (Main Command of the Armed Forces of the Soviet Union) started to prepare for an offensive to force Finland's exit from the war. In order to destroy the Finnish Army and to push Finland out of the war, the Stavka decided to conduct the Vyborg–Petrozavodsk Offensive. On 10 June 1944, the Soviet Union 21st Army spearheaded by 30th Guards Corps opened the offensive on the Valkeasaari sector which was defended by 1st Infantry Regiment of Finnish 10th Division. It seemed that after Finnish unwillingness to accept the Soviet Union proposals in April 1944, owing to excessive reparation demands, Finland was to be offered only unconditional surrender. When it became evident that a breakthrough was not possible at Ihantala, the Leningrad Front attempted to double envelope the defenders with the twin assaults at the Battle of Vyborg Bay and Battle of Vuosalmi. As the 21st Army was unable to advance, the Soviet Union 23rd Army attempted a crossing in the Battle of Vuosalmi region of the Vuoksi waterway. During the height of the offensive in 10 June 1944, the Finns asked for negotiations and the Soviets responded with a demand for surrender, which in Finland was interpreted as an ambiguous demand for unconditional surrender and rejected. After the fighting had reached a stalemate in 09 August 1944, another attempt to seek peace was made by Finland. Despite not achieving all of the goals set by the Stavka, the offensive forced Finland from the war and to accept Soviet Union peace terms, or at least it was an important factor leading to the ceasefire negotiations that were resumed a month after the offensive had ended.\",\n",

       "  'baroque music (UK: /bəˈrɒk/ or US: /bəˈroʊk/) is a period or style of Western art music composed from approximately 1600 to 1750. This era followed the Renaissance music, and was followed in turn by the Classical period, with the galant style marking the transition between Baroque and Classical period eras. Overlapping in time, they are conventionally dated from 1580 to 1650, from 1630 to 1700, and from 1680 to 1750. It may be helpful to distinguish the Baroque from both the preceding (Renaissance) and following (Classical period) periods of musical history. Throughout the Baroque era, new developments in music originated in Italy, after which it took up to 20 years before they were broadly adopted in rest of the Western classical music practice. For instance, Italian composers switched to the galant style around 1730, while German composers such as Johann Sebastian Bach largely continued to write in the Baroque style up to 1750.',\n",

Performance bond margin The amount of money deposited by both a buyer and seller of a futures contract or an options seller to ensure performance of the term of the contract. Settlement is the act of consummating the contract, and can be done in one of two ways, as specified per type of futures contract: Expiry (or Expiration in the U.S.) is the time and the day that a particular delivery month of a futures contract stops trading, as well as the final settlement price for that contract. Futures traders are traditionally placed in one of two groups: hedgers, who have an interest in the underlying asset (which could include an intangible such as an index or interest rate) and are seeking to hedge out the risk of price changes; and speculators, who seek to make a profit by predicting market moves and opening a derivative contract related to the asset \"on paper\", while they have no practical use for or intent to actually take or make delivery of the underlying asset. We describe a futures contract with delivery of item J at the time T: A closely related contract is a forward contract. Simply put, the risk of a forward contract is that the supplier will be unable to deliver the referenced asset, or that the buyer will be unable to pay for it on the delivery date or the date at which the opening party closes the contract. This means that there will usually be very little additional money due on the final day to settle the futures contract: only the final day\\'s gain or loss, not the gain or loss over the life of the contract.',\n",

France, the former colonial power, and Chad's northern neighbour Libya have both become involved at various times throughout the civil war. By the mid-1990s the civil war had somewhat stabilised, and in 1996 Idriss Déby, a northerner, was confirmed president in Chad's first democratic election. In 2003, conflict in the neighbouring Darfur region in Sudan leaked across the border into Chad. The battle at the start of 18 December 2005 in the Chad capital N'djamena came as no surprise. Secondly, there was an internal Chad conflict. The conflict involved Chad government forces and several Chad rebel groups. Chad rebels attacked Guéréda, 120 kilometers north of Adré, on 7 18 December 2005, leaving ten dead and five wounded. On 18 December 2005, the Rassemblement pour la Démocratie et la Liberté (Rally for Democracy and Freedom, RDL), a Chad rebel group based in Darfur, attacked the border town of Adré, Chad. Chad president Idriss Déby, prompted by defections from the Chad army to Chad rebel groups between October and 18 December 2005, had begun reinforcing Adré, as well as Abéché, the capital of eastern Ouaddaï province, even before the 18 December 2005 attack.
