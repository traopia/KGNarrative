        "target": "Opinion: Obama's Cuban revolution President Barack Obama has made a very special declaration of love to Cuba. It's as revolutionary as the Cuban revolution, and as peaceful as the biblical Sermon on the Mount, says DW's Astrid Prange. US President Barack Obama has lost his old communist \"enemy,\" and Cuban President Raul Castro has lost his hatred of capitalism. In the first phone call from president to president since 1961 the two heads of state came to a surprisingly swift agreement. They want to renew diplomatic relations, which have been on ice for more than 50 years, and exchange ambassadors. It's only a matter of time before the US lifts its trade embargo against Cuba. All the word \"embargo\" is really good for - at this stage - is as an ideological soapbox for political hardliners, especially Republicans in Congress who believe lifting sanctions would constitute defeat for the US. Yet the lifting of the embargo has already begun. In addition to medication, it has been possible since 2000 to export agricultural produce such as maize, cereal crops, and poultry to Cuba. Flirting with the rogue state Furthermore, 100,000 US citizens have travelled to Cuba since 2011 for cultural and scientific exchanges. Travel restrictions on Cubans living in exile in the US who wanted to visit their relatives on the island were also lifted. According to press reports, the two countries' military forces are even said to be cooperating, as are their coastguards, and military on the border of the US marine base in Guantanamo. Now Obama wants to officially open a \"new chapter\" in relations with the communist Caribbean island and remove Cuba from the US list of so-called \"rogue states\" that support terrorism. The travel ban on American tourists visiting the island will also largely be lifted. That's as far as things will go for the time being, as Obama would require a majority in Congress in Washington to lift the embargo entirely. But even if these are only small steps, the fall of the American-Cuban wall has begun. The easing of the sanctions and the resumption of diplomatic relations are setting the scene for an end to the embargo. Embargo as scapegoat The tearing down of this \"wall in the mind\" is long overdue. The blockade is obsolete, and has proved to be entirely ineffective. More than this, its advocates have achieved the opposite of what they actually wanted. The blockade has provided the leaders in Havana with an easy excuse for their economic failure. Raul Castro realized long ago that Cuba's economic problems can no longer be justified simply by citing the US embargo. It looks as though he was counting on the blockade being lifted: There is no other explanation for the completion of the Mariel container port in January this year. Cuba's biggest infrastructure project was, incidentally, financed by Brazil. The Brazilians also sent a declaration of love to Cuba. Raul Castro opened the door to them. He loves anyone who helps him - his friends even more than his enemies.",
        "generated_story": "Cuba: The Fall of the Wall in the Mind of Cuban President Barack Obama The fall of Cuba's financial and political system is the latest development in a series of events that have shocked the world. In January this year, the Cuban government announced that it would close the country's largest prison, Sermon on the Mount, in Cuba. The announcement came just days after US Secretary of State John Kerry visited the island, where he met with President Raul Castro and his wife Mariel. Obama's visit coincided with the start of a new era of economic growth in Latin America and the Caribbean. \"The Cuban economy is on a rollercoaster ride,\" Obama said at the time of his visit to Cuba, adding that he was \"very happy\" to see his country prosper. But he also said that his administration would continue to work with Cuba on economic and social issues, such as education, health care, housing and education. He said he would work closely with Congress to make sure that Cuba was doing the right thing in terms of reducing its dependence on foreign aid and ending its reliance on US-led sanctions against the communist regime. His visit came a day after Cuba announced the end of its nuclear weapons program, which had killed more than 1.5 million people over the past two decades. On the one hand, Cuba has been a great success story for the US and its allies, but the other hand is far from the same story. It's the first time that a US president has visited Cuba since 1961, and it's not just because he's been in power for a long time. There's also the fact that Obama has a lot to say about Cuba: He's a strong leader, he knows how to communicate with his people and he wants to build bridges between the two countries. That's why he has made Cuba his top priority in his first year in office. And that's because Cuba is a very strong country, with an economy that is growing at a rapid pace. What's more, there's an economic boom in Brazil, as well as in other Latin American countries, including Brazil and South America. This is because the United States has invested billions of dollars in developing countries that are struggling to get their economies back on track after years of stagnation and a lack of investment in infrastructure, education and infrastructure. These are the people who are most at risk of losing their jobs and their livelihoods. They're the ones who have to decide whether or not they want to stay in business or go to prison. So they're going to do what's best for them. I think they'll do the best they can for themselves. We'll see how long they stick with it. You know what I mean? I don't know if I'll be able to keep my mouth shut about it, because I'm not sure how much longer I can keep it open. If I stay open to the possibility that I won't have the opportunity to talk to them again, then I will have a better chance of winning the election in 2011. Who knows what the future holds for Cuba? What do you think? Do you have any idea what it will take to win the next election? Can you imagine what will happen in 2012? If so, let's see what happens next year? The Cuban people will be very happy with what they've got in store for Obama. After all, they have been working hard for years and years on their own. How long will it take him to reach his goal of getting the job done? They've been waiting for him for so long. Now, it seems as though he'll finally get it done. Astrid Prange, a member of Brazil's Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in an interview with DW that she thinks Obama will do something about that. She believes that the president will make it easier for Cubans and Brazilians to come to his senses."

The 89-year-old did not say when exactly his resignation would take effect. Calling the move a personal decision, President Giorgio Napolitano made his announcement during an end-of-year speech on Wednesday. \"I'm about to step down, to resign as the constitution expressly allows,\" he said, adding. \"I've reached an age that brings with it growing limitations and difficulties for me to do my institutional duties, which are complex and very demanding.\" Though he did not say when his resignation would take effect, a potential date is January 13 when Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi is due to give up the country's rotating six-month presidency of the Council of the European Union. Renzi faces a political challenge in organizing a replacement for Napolitano, dubbed by Italian media as \"King George.\" The president has served as a key intermediary between political parties through numerous changes in government and other tricky political situations. Napolitano, a former communist respected by Europe and Washington, took office in 2006. At the end of his seven-year mandate in 2013, he was asked to stay on because parliament could not agree on his successor. At the time he warned he may not serve out the full term, given his age. In Italy, presidents have loosely-defined powers including the ability to nominate prime ministers, dissolve parliament and veto legislation, as well as use the moral authority of the office to influence politics. se/cmk (dpa, Reuters)",

The resignation of the 89-year-old Italian president was announced by Prime Minister Matteo Renzi on January 13. \"I have decided to step down from the position of president of Italy,\" the president said in a statement released by his office. Italy, which has been embroiled in political turmoil since the collapse of a coalition government in 2006, said the resignation was the result of an internal dispute between the two parties over the appointment of new president. It was not immediately clear what the dispute was about, but Italian media reported that the issue had been resolved by the end of January. Italian President Giuseppe Conte, who was in Washington for the inauguration of his successor, had called for an end to the crisis, saying it was time for Italy to move on from its current political and economic crisis. Napolano's resignation came as the Italian government announced that it would no longer be able to form a government without the support of its own people. In a move that was widely seen as an attempt to shore up its position in the European Union, Italy has said it will not allow a new government to take over until after the elections in 2013. That would be a major step towards a return to political stability, according to a report by dpa news agency, quoting a source close to Italy\u2019s interior minister, Giovanni Berzi, as saying he was \"deeply disappointed\" with the results of last year's elections. He also said that he would not accept a second term in office if the new leadership were to be re-elected in 2014. A spokesman for Italian Finance Minister Giovanni Tria said he had no immediate comment on the announcement."

The spokesman said more help was needed, but could not give exact numbers \"due to pending assignments.\" Recent soccer violence raises concern Swiss media has been questioning the security preparations for Euro 2008 after a spate of violence at recent games. In the latest incident, seats were ripped out and a goal post wrenched from the ground after St. Gallen faced the prospect of relegation following a 2-0 defeat to Bellinzona on May 20. St. Gallen was the third incident in a month that saw violent clashes with police who twice resorted to rubber bullets and tear gas. While Switzerland is seen as a low risk country in terms of hooliganism, violence has been on the increase in recent years and estimates claim there are around 400 hooligans and 600 sympathizers. Swiss Sports Minister Samuel Schmid said that hooliganism cannot be ruled out, reported German news agency DPA. But he expressed his belief that extra measures such as more policing, restrictions on alcohol -- which he has called \"a catalyst for violence\" -- and video surveillance will help keep trouble at bay. Private firms to boost European police The private security companies will be responsible for patrolling the stadiums and their surroundings, as well as the public viewing areas, team hotels and trainings areas. An international police force will manage the rest. Switzerland has committed some 31,200 police officers and soldiers. Another 1,700 police will be sent from Germany, which will have the authority to make arrests.

It was the first time the country had hosted a major international sporting event since the end of World War II. \"We are very excited about this,\" said Urs Stadler, head of security at Prisec, a private security firm in Bellinzona, near the Swiss border with Croatia. He added that his firm, Securitas, would provide security in the event of a terrorist attack. According to a press release, the firm will provide \"technical support\" to the security team, which will be based in Switzerland and will also provide technical support to security teams in Greece, Poland, Russia and the Czech Republic, as well as other countries in Europe and Asia. A spokesman for Switzerland's state security agency, Tages Anzeiger, told DPA news agency that the company was \"very pleased\" with the announcement, adding that \"it is very important for us to be prepared for this event.\" The firm is working closely with Germany's national security service, Protectas, to ensure that all security measures are in place before the competition kicks off on June 7. In addition, it is also working with France, Spain, Italy and Poland to prepare for a possible security breach at the final games in Moscow and in other European countries. Germany, for example, is expected to host the finals in Russia in May, while France and Spain are due to play the remaining matches in their respective host countries on Sunday and Monday. German security expert Samuel Schmid, who specializes in security issues, said the move was a \"huge step forward.\" \"It is a big step for our country,\" he said, \"but we are going to have to wait and see what happens. We have a lot of work to do before we can do it.\" Germany has also announced that it will send a team of experts to Greece and other member states to assist in securing the venues. Last year's tournament was held in Croatia, and this year it was hosted by Spain and Russia, respectively. However, security experts have said that there is still a chance that Greece will not be able to attend the games, given the current security situation in its own country."

Conservative members of Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition put forward a united front at the weekend against recent developments in the city of Wuppertal. Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said civilians wearing uniforms bearing the logo \"Shariah police\" could not simply start patrolling German streets. The groups reportedly hovered around sites like discotheques and gambling houses, telling passers-by to refrain from gambling and alcohol. Wuppertal's police have begun pressing charges. \"Sharia law is not tolerated on German soil,\" de Maiziere told mass-circulation daily Bild on Saturday. \"Nobody can take it upon themselves to abuse the good name of the German police.\" Justice Minister Heiko Maas, meanwhile, told Bild that \"the state alone\" was responsible for the administration of justice in Germany. It was obvious, Maas said, that any illegal parallel system of law enforcement would not be tolerated. Christian Democrat party whip Volker Kauder was similarly emphatic in an interview to be published in this week's Welt am Sonntag newspaper. \"Under absolutely no circumstances can we tolerate self-styled 'Sharia police officers' patrolling our streets and dictating what people should or should not do,\" Kauder said. Ringleader: goal was attention The 33-year-old behind the Wuppertal patrols, former fireman Sven Lau, published a video on his website on Saturday. Lau said that a \"Sharia police\" never existed, and that a group of men had simply worn the mock uniforms for a few hours. \"We knew that this would raise attention,\" Lau said, claiming that his goal was to spark a debate about Sharia law in Germany. Lau is a leading member of Germany's Salafist movement, advocates of a strict Sunni interpretation of political Islam. He works with a mosque in his native M\u00f6nchengladbach, not far west of Wuppertal, and used to head the fundamentalist group \"Invitation to Paradise.\" (Einladung zum Paradies, in German.) The central council of Muslims in Germany (ZMD) condemned the activities. \"These few teen yobs do not speak in our name,\" chairman Ayman A. Mazyek told the Tagesspiegel am Sonntag newspaper. \"These people are perverting the name of our religion. With this shrill and foolish action, they are really hurting Muslims.\" Sharia law is the Arabic term for a legal system based on the Koran. Saudi Arabia and Iran are examples of countries where such a system officially applies. Wearing a veil is obligatory for women and corporal punishment such as stoning is legally tolerated. Human Rights Watch reported last month that Saudi Arabia had beheaded 19 people in just 16 days in August, for convictions on charges ranging from cannabis smuggling to \"sorcery.\" msh/rc (AFP, dpa, Reuters)",

Germany is one of the world's poorest countries, according to a survey conducted by human rights group Human Rights Watch (HRW). The survey, conducted over a period of just 16 days, found that the majority of respondents said they were \"very satisfied\" with the police's approach to Islam. But the survey also showed that a majority were not satisfied with what they perceived as a lack of respect for the Koran. According to the report, the average age of a German citizen aged between 25 and 34 was 25 years old, with a family of four living in M\u00f6nchengladbach. It was the first time in German history that an individual had been arrested for allegedly breaking the laws of his home state. In August, German Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative Christian Democrat party (CDU) government banned the practice of \"sharia law\" in all German cities. On Saturday, a group of police officers arrested a man suspected of breaking into a house and throwing a knife at his wife and two children. They were later charged with assault and attempted murder.

In addition, she added, \"we are also concerned that if it spreads rapidly, we will have to do more to control the spread of this disease.\" On Friday, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon called for a halt to Ebola treatment in all countries where the epidemic has reached epidemic proportions, calling for an end to it by August 8. He also called on international health agencies to take action against those responsible for spreading the deadly virus, which has killed more than 2,000 people in Sierra and Liberia.

The Luxembourg-based court thus sided with the German firm UsedSoft in a protracted legal battle with US software giant Oracle. The ruling made it clear that trade in used software was permissible even if the software had not been shipped on a physical medium such as a CD or DVD, but had been digitally downloaded from the Internet. UsedSoft's business model hinges completely on reselling used packages or legally obtained license keys for them. By reselling the keys to clients, the latter are then able to download the latest version of a given program directly from a company's Internet site and obtain all new updates and patches in the process. Legal clarity Oracle had sued UsedSoft over its business model, trying to prevent buyers of used software licenses from downloading programs again. But the European court ruled that the so-called principle of exhaustion applied whenever software was originally sold to a customer for an unlimited time span, not giving the maker of the software the right to prevent the resale of that software. \"The door for the trade in used software has been pushed wide open throughout the European Union,\" UsedSoft said in a statement, welcoming \"perfect legal safety on the market.\" The court in Luxembourg emphasized, though, that whoever resold pieces of original software and their accompanying licenses must erase every copy on their own computers in advance and was not allowed to keep a copy after resale. hg/mz (AFP, dpa)",

Oracle, a US company, had argued that its software was not in violation of the terms of its agreement to provide software licenses to companies that sell its products to third parties. However, Oracle has denied the allegations, saying that Oracle had violated its contract with third-party software vendors and was therefore not responsible for any infringement of copyright laws.

The Curiosity rover will soon re-start its sluggish search for signs of life. NASA's Mars rover, \"Curiosity,\" will wrap up a lengthy self-testing phase on Thursday, freeing it up to continue exploring the surface of the Red Planet. Mission manager Jennifer Tropser told reporters in a conference call on Wednesday evening that the plan, once the final checks were completed, was to \"drive, drive, drive\" until Curiosity discovers a rock suitable for analysis. She added that the instrument checks have delivered positive results. \"Through every phase of the check-out, Curiosity has performed almost flawlessly,\" Tropser said. \"The success so far of these activities has been outstanding.\" Many of the tests have concerned Curiosity's robotic arm. The 2.1-meter (7-feet) appendage will be used to pick out and sample rocks and soil. NASA is investigating whether Mars can sustain life, or whether it could in the past. The tests were designed to identify any damage sustained during its interplanetary flight and also to ensure that the arm still functioned properly on Mars, with its different temperatures and gravity. The Mars rover landed in the giant Gale Crater, near the Martian equator, on August 5; it has so far moved about 109 meters within the crater. The rover is traveling east, heading first to an intersection called Glenelg, where three types of terrain meet. This is likely to be the location for the first rock and soil samples, though NASA said Curiosity was unlikely to arrive there for several weeks. Curiosity's ultimate destination is the nearby Aeolis Mons or Mount Sharp, a 3-mile-high mound of rock rising out of the crater.

The US space agency announced on Thursday that it had launched a new rover, Curiosity, on August 5, to test the Martian rover's ability to detect the presence of extraterrestrials on the surface of the Red Planet. NASA said on Wednesday that the rover had been successful in testing Mars' surface. \"We are very pleased with the results,\" NASA's Jennifer Tropser told reporters at a news conference in Glenelg, in the US state of New Mexico. She added that \"the rover is doing a great job of testing the Mars surface, and we are confident that we will be able to confirm that this is the case,\" she said. On Thursday, NASA announced that Curiosity had successfully tested the planet's surface in Gale Crater, near the southern tip of Mount Sharp. It was the first time in two years that NASA had tested a rover on Mars, with a total of 2.5-billion-euro (1.93 billion euros) in funding for the project. According to the agency's website, the test was carried out on September 5 and was completed on October 1. In the end, it was determined that Mars was safe for humans to explore and that there was no danger to humans. However, some observers said the tests were not as successful as they had hoped. A NASA spokesperson told Reuters that more than 2,000 samples were collected from Mars and other areas on Earth, including the red planet Aeolis Mons, which is thought to be the world's largest magnetosphere. More than 1,200 samples have been collected, according to a US government report. Some of those samples, however, were sent back to NASA for further testing. Another study, published in September, found that most of them were positive for detecting alien activity, although some were negative for human health. Other studies, such as those from the University of California, Los Angeles, showed that some of these samples could be used to determine whether or not an alien presence was present on other planets. That's a good sign, because it could lead to more positive results for future missions to Mars. But it's not clear how much of a positive result Curiosity will have in terms of detecting extraterrestrial activity. If it is, then it will need to do more testing to see if it can detect alien life on another planet. This is a big question for NASA, as it has a lot of work ahead of it. There are a number of tests scheduled to take place over the next two weeks, but the most important one is to assess the impact on humans' health and fitness. For now, though, that's all we have to worry about. We're going to wait and see what happens. And then we'll see how it all plays out. I'm not sure what the future holds for us. What do you think about that? I don't know for sure. Do you have any idea how long it'll take for Curiosity to become a successful rover? If so, let me know in a few weeks. Then I'll let you know what I think. You'll have a better idea of what's in store for you. So far we've got a pretty good idea about what we can expect from this rover. Right now we're looking at two things. First of all, we want to make sure that our rover has the right tools. Secondly, there's the technology to help us understand what is going on on our planet and to understand how to use that technology in ways that make it more efficient and effective at the same time. Second, what do we know about Mars? Do we need a robot that can tell us about the environment on which we live? And third, how can we use it? Is it really possible to tell you what kind of robot will we be using? Are you sure about this robot? Does it have the potential to learn something new? We'll find out in about a week or two. Or is it just a matter of time before we get to know more about it.\" The first step in Curiosity's mission to study Mars has already been approved by NASA.

        "target": "Aging health: WHO call to action as world population over 60 set to double by 2050 In a new report on aging and health, the World Health Organization is calling for action on \"population aging,\" as figures suggest the number of people over 60 will reach two billion by 2050. People worldwide are living longer, says the World Health Organization in its World Report on Aging and Health. This is both good and bad. It gives us the chance to \"pursue new activities\" as we get older, such as in education and family life. But it all depends on our health. And for that the WHO says world governments need to act now to make sure our societies worldwide are ready. What are the take home facts from the World Health Organization's 2015 report on Aging and Health? The WHO says that in the next 35 years, the global number of people aged 60 years and over will almost double from 12 percent to 22 percent. By 2020, there will be more people over the age of 60 than 5 year olds. And a majority of older people (80 percent) will live in \"low and middle income\" countries. It's estimated that the world's population aged 60 years and older will total about 2 billion in 2050, which is more than twice as much as now. Furthermore, worldwide, about 125 million people are aged 80 years or older. But by 2050, it is expected that this number of people - aged 80 and over - will live in China alone. But I'm not old, so why should I care? Well, all this is happening at a faster rate than ever before. And the WHO says \"all countries face major challenges to ensure that their health and social systems are ready\" for this major demographic shift. It will cost a lot of money to improve health and social infrastructures, especially in more developed countries where traditional families structures have changed dramatically. Surely, there's \"no typical older person,\" though. How does the WHO define aging? We tend to think of older people as physically and mentally frail. But that's not necessarily the case, not everywhere in the world. Old is a relative concept - especially in middle income to rich countries. For instance, some 70 year olds are as fit as some 20 year olds. Just think how many older folk are at your gym, and ask yourself whether you can keep up with all of them. But that still doesn't explain aging. What is it exactly? The WHO says that at a biological level, \"aging results from the impact of the accumulation of a wide variety of molecular and cellular damage over time.\" Basically, this puts people at a higher risk of disease and, of course, death. But aging can also be associated with \"life transitions,\" such as retirement or witnessing other people, such as friends and family, die around you. This can affect you psychologically and sometimes, as a result, physically. What sort of diseases come with old age? Some of the most common non-fatal conditions include hearing loss, cataracts, back and neck pain and osteoarthritis. Other conditions include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - which affects the lungs - diabetes, depression, and dementia. What needs to be done? The WHO is proposing a five-step plan of action, which includes: Committing to healthy aging and \"evidence-based policies to strengthen the abilities of older persons.\" Aligning health systems with the needs of older populations Developing systems for providing long-term care Creating \"age-friendly cities and communities Improving measurement, monitoring and understanding of \"aging issues\" worldwide. But don't forget: \"a longer life brings with it opportunities, not only for older people and their families, but also for societies as a whole.\"",
        "generated_story": "WHO's Population Aging Plan: Actions Now In the Age of 60 The World Health Organization (WHO) has announced plans to reduce the number of people living in poverty by 80 percent by 2050. The plan, which was announced in a report released on Tuesday, calls for an end to the age-old practice of taking care of older people in the next 35 years. According to WHO's latest estimates, the world's population is expected to reach some 70 percent of the population by the end of 2050, up from 60 percent in 2015. In addition, some 20 year olds will have to live longer than 80 years in order to make up for the decline in their health. This is the first time the WHO has made the decision to cut back on the use of elderly people. \"We are going to do everything we can to ensure that we have a healthy population,\" the World Report on Aging and Health (WOMH) said in its report. However, it added that it was not clear how much younger people would be able to stay alive if they were to die of old age. It also pointed out that some 40 year old Chinese were already at risk of dying of cancer by 20 years of age, compared to 30 years for some 30 year-olds and 40 for older Chinese. China is one of those countries with the highest levels of population aging, but it is not the only country with a high level of aging that is at the center of global attention. World health experts have warned that China's aging population could rise by up to 60 years, and that this could lead to a rise in cancer and other diseases that are linked to aging. These are the main reasons why China and the United States are so concerned about the aging of its population. They are also concerned that the ageing population in China will increase rapidly, leading to an increase in deaths from cancer, heart disease, stroke and cardiovascular diseases. That is, if the Chinese population continues to grow at a rapid pace, they will no longer need to rely on old people as a source of income for their families. And that will be a problem for China, as well as for many other developing countries, where the average age is 60. So, what do you do now? You do what you can. You move on to other areas of your life, such as education, employment, health care, housing, education and employment. Then, you move onto the areas where you are most likely to find yourself in need of help. There is a lot of work to be done. I think it will take a long time before I can do that. But I'm optimistic that by 2020, I'll be well enough to meet the needs of my family.\" The WHO said it would like to see a change in Chinese society, especially in rural areas, with more people moving into the middle class and working part-time jobs. At the same time, there will also be more opportunities for young people to get married and have children. What's more important is that they have the means to support themselves financially and not be dependent on their parents and grandparents. If they don't have enough money, then they can't afford to retire. As a result, their children will not have access to care for themselves and they won't get the care they need in retirement. For example, China has a population of some 80 million people who are unable to afford a decent retirement plan. Some 20 million of them will die before they reach retirement age in 2050 and some 50 percent will lose their retirement benefits by then. One reason for this is because of a lack of financial stability and an inability to invest in social programs that can help them cope with life's challenges. Another reason: The Chinese government is looking for a way out of their current economic and social problems."

It is a reflection of his current inauspicious Formula One campaign that World Champion Michael Schumacher is only featuring in reports on this weekend's German Grand Prix at Hockenheim dues to his nationality. The home grown champion equaled his own record of 11 wins in a season at last year's race but this year he will be hoping to just get on the podium at the end. Schumi lies in third place some 34 points off the top spot and has a lot to do if he is to record his 85th career win. Ferrari's poor season to date is unlikely to get better with hopes dwindling that the 36-year-old will add to his sole victory of the season although the seven-time world champion characteristically refuses to rule it out. Schumi and Ferrari still in the fight \"Contrary to many other people's opinions, we have in no means written ourselves off, even though we have to admit that the situation has worsened recently, rather than improved,\" said the German, referring to the problems with this season's car. \"But that doesn't mean that it can't be improved again, and that's exactly what we're working on.\" The limelight is falling on two young pretenders to Schumacher's throne as Sunday's race approaches. The battle between McLaren's flying Finn Kimi Raikkonen and championship leader Renault's speedy Spaniard Fernando Alonso is diverting eyes from the world record holding German on his own turf. Kimi aims to keep heat on leader Alonso Raikkonen must finish the German Grand Prix for the first time in five attempts to close the gap on Alonso if he is to keep his own championship hopes alive. The Finn retired from last year's race because of a rear wing failure and this season has been plagued by technical problems which most recently cost him 10 places on the starting grid in each of the last two rounds. Despite those penalties for engine failure, the 25-year-old managed to finish second and third but he will have to increase his total of three race wins if he is to make a significant impression on the 26-point chasm that separates him from Alonso. \"The battle for the championship is still on and I am determined to get a good result and work on closing the gap,\" said the Finn. \"The (car) has good speed and we need to make the most of it this weekend.\" Montoya doing McLaren team mate no favors Raikkonen's car is obviously a fast one this season but he's not the only driver in a McLaren hot seat. Colombia's Juan Pablo Montoya is not to going to make way for his team mate while his own hopes of the title, however small, remain alive. \"I am really looking forward to racing again this weekend in Germany,\" said Montoya, who won at Hockenheim for Williams two years ago and got his first victory for McLaren in Britain two weeks ago. \"I enjoy racing at Hockenheim, I have performed well here and won in the past and I am aiming for a strong result like at Silverstone.\" Consistent Ferdy the man to beat at Hockenheim Championship leader Alonso, meanwhile, has been impressively consistent for Renault so far this season, winning five times and failing to score points only at the Canadian Grand Prix, where he crashed, and in Indianapolis. The Spaniard is setting the pace and the standard this season so, problems aside, Alonso will again be the man to beat at Hockenheim.",
        "generated_story": "Fernando Alonso and Kimi Raikkonen in the title battle at Hockenheim Formula One Grand Prix in Germany on Sunday. The Spaniard and his team-mate will be battling it out for the driver's crown at the weekend. Alonso, meanwhile, will take on Ferrari's Juan Pablo Montoya in a battle of the top three drivers at this weekend's German GP. Ferrari, Mercedes, Ferrari and McLaren are the favorites to win this year's championship, with Alonso leading the way with a 6-2 advantage in points. But Alonso has yet to make it to the final round of qualifying and will have to settle for a place on the podium at Silverstone next weekend, where he will face Fernando Alonso. \"I'm going to try and win,\" Alonso said, adding that he was \"very happy\" with the result. He will also be looking for his first podium finish in two years, when he takes on McLaren's Michael Schumacher, who is coming off a two-year suspension for an incident last year that left him unable to compete with his McLaren teammate Alonso in his home country of Colombia. In the end, Alonso will go on to take the championship with Ferrari at home, while Ferrari will try to keep up with Mercedes and Ferrari in their home countries of Mexico, Colombia and Canada. Both teams have already clinched their respective titles this season, but Alonso's title hopes have been dashed by a lack of consistency in recent races. Last year, he finished fourth in qualifying in Canada and fifth in Mexico. On Sunday, the two drivers will meet again in Abu Dhabi, a race that has been dominated by Ferrari for more than a year and a half. It's the first time since 2012 that the German driver has finished second in three of his last four races, and it's only the second time he's finished third in four of them. That's a lot of pressure on Alonso to get back on track and stay in contention, as he has to work hard to stay on course for Sunday's race against Ferrari. And that's not just because Alonso is the world's best driver, it is also because he is a world-class driver who has a reputation for being the most consistent driver in F1. After a disappointing season in which he missed out on a number of races and was only able to finish sixth in Malaysia and Bahrain, his season was marred by an engine problem that forced him to retire from the race two weeks ago. This year he'll be back in action in Britain, after missing the last two races due to a back injury suffered in an accident that required surgery on his right leg. His return from a broken leg suffered a similar injury to his left leg and he had to undergo surgery to repair the damage to that leg, which was also damaged in Saturday's crash at Indianapolis Motor Speedway. McLaren and Williams have both been in pole position for this race, although Ferrari have not yet announced a replacement driver for Alonso as a result of a medical procedure on Friday. Williams, however, have said they are confident that Alonso would be ready to step into the starting line-up for next year\u2019s season finale in Bahrain. They have also said that they expect to have a new driver by the time the season is over. However, they do not expect a change in strategy in terms of strategy and strategy. A new Ferrari driver is expected to be announced in mid-season and that will give Alonso a chance to prove himself as soon as possible. Expectations are high for Ferrari as well as McLaren, Williams and Mercedes have all been talking about the possibility of bringing in new drivers in order to improve their engine technology and boost their championship chances. Meanwhile, McLaren have announced that it will not be taking part in next season's season-ending races in Australia, Bahrain and Malaysia."

She will share the prestigious award with US compatriot Oliver Williamson. The jury from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said the Americans' research had shown how \"economic analysis can shed light on most forms of social organization.\" Ostrom, a professor at Indiana University, was honored for her \"analysis of economic governance,\" especially in relation to the management of common property or property under common control. The political scientist's work challenges the widely accepted belief that common property is poorly managed and should be either regulated by central authorities or privatized, it added. She carried out numerous studies showing how self-organization and local-level management work to keep common resources viable. Her studies included both natural resources, such as forests, and artificial structures, for example police forces. Ostrom told Swedish television that she felt \"great surprise and appreciation\" and was \"in shock\" about being the first woman to win the prize. The pros and cons of big firms In his work, co-prizewinner Oliver Williamson, of University of California, Berkeley, examines why large corporations tend to arise - and why they do not - based on the cost and complexity of transactions, according to the Nobel committee. \"He has taught us to regard markets, firms, associations, agencies, and even households from the perspective of their contribution to the resolution of conflict,\" the jury said. Williamson authored 'The Economic Institutions of Capitalism' in 1975, a landmark text of the 'new institutional economics' movement that questioned the idea of firms as simple profit-making machines. Last but not least The Nobel prize for economics is the only Nobel award that was not created by the will of Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel in 1896. It was actually founded by the Swedish central bank, the Sverige Riksbank, to celebrate its tri-centenary a year earlier. It was awarded for the first time in 1969 under its official name: the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel. But although it was the last \"Nobel prize\" to be created and the last to be announced each year, the prize is not a poor relation in monetary terms. Winners of the awards for peace, literature, medicine, physiology, chemistry and physics all receive 10 million Swedish crowns (969,000 euros). A good year for women This year was a record year for women laureates. German-Romanian writer Herta Mueller won the Nobel Prize for Literature. Australian-American Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider of the United States were awarded the prize for medicine. And Ada Yonath of Israel was one of three scientists recognized for her work in chemistry. Americans more or less swept the board this year. Nine of the 11 laureates were US citizens.

        "target": "The Sun Sets Slowly Over Brandenburg's Tropical Dream Having suffered many disappointments concerning publically funded projects, the state of Brandenburg hoped a tropical leisure center would offer a ray of hope. Instead the ailing concern is just bringing more gloom. The economically depressed eastern German state of Brandenburg has seen its fair share of bitter experiences when it comes to huge public investment projects since German unification in 1990. Against this background, state authorities were pleased when Malaysian businessman Colin Au built a huge tropical-feeling leisure center in Brandenburg without any subsidies. The center, which opened about a year ago, was to become a symbol of economic success in a region where unemployment still hovers around the 20 percent mark. But the leisure time park, which has already swallowed a little under 100 million euros ($120 million) in private investment, is now going to have to depend on public funding to avoid another economic fiasco in Brandenburg. State authorities in Brandenburg haven't been too successful in their public investment policy in the past 10 years, to put it mildly. A grand plan to build one of the world's most modern chip-producing factories there burst like a bubble in 2003. The much-talked about Brandenburg-Berlin International airport still seems light years away from being built. Line of failures looked to be ended by Au's vision Another beacon of economic hope disappeared in 2002 when a company planning to build gas-filled transport airships went bust despite considerable subsidies. But Au's vision for the abandoned dome which the airship company needed as a hangar offered Brandenburg another chance. In the middle of nowhere, he created what he named his \"Tropical Islands\" wonderland, sporting everything from sandy beaches, lakes and a Laguna to a Caribbean-style village. The economics ministry in Brandenburg was over the moon to see Au originally agreeing to build the facility without any state subsidies. And Au himself had no doubt at the time that he could well do without them. Overestimated visitor numbers tell sorry story But the center's first year in operation tells a different story. Colin Au, who has meanwhile left Brandenburg and transferred matters to a German management company, had expected some 1.5 million visitors to come to Tropical Islands within the first year, but only some 950,000 will have turned up by the end of 2005. It seems highly unlikely that visitor numbers will increase considerably in future, placing a question mark on the viability of the whole centre. But Brandenburg's economics ministry is certain that the park will be in the black as of 2008. To make the place more attractive, it has agreed to shell out 15 million euros in subsidies for yet another reconstruction and marketing effort. After all, the leisure time center has a workforce of about 500 and is thus the biggest employer in an otherwise depressed region marked by a high jobless rate. Tropical center down but not out...not yet \"We hope the money will help make the Tropical Islands resort better known throughout Europe according to the new marketing concept hammered out the management,\" ministry spokesman Steffen Kammrath said. \"This leisure time center is unique and has to be marketed as such. What you have there is a tropical and water world 12 months a year with a lot of attractive offers to spend a whale of a time there.\" Some commentators believe that state subsidies may prolong the center's life span, but will not be able to avoid its demise in the long run. But the idea of also making it more attractive for tourists from all over Europe seems unrealistic to them if the resort's management can't even get enough visitors from home to ensure a profitable operation.",
        "generated_story": "Brandenburg's Tropical Islands Resort The Sun Sets Slowly Over Brandenburg-Berlin International's tropical islands resort The sun sets slowly over the tropical island resort in the southern German city of Laguna, about a year ago. The resort, which opened in 2003, was one of the world's most successful resort resorts. It was the first of its kind in Europe, with a total revenue of 120 million euros ($130 million) in 2005. Branden- Berlin's tourism industry has been growing steadily since the end of 2005, when the resort opened its doors to the public. But it's not just the tourism sector that is growing. There's also the fact that there's a lot of money to be made from tourism, as well as from the sale of hotels and resorts in Germany and the United States. And that's just a small part of what is being done here. What is happening here is that people are starting to realize that they're going to have to make do with the money they've been given. That's because they don't have the resources to do it all themselves. They're not even sure how much it will cost to run a resort like the one they have in Berlin, where they are located. This is because the property is located on the edge of a Caribbean-style island, just off the coast of Cape Verde. In the beginning, it was a private property, but then it became a public company. Since then, there have been a number of developments. One of them is the opening of Tropical Island Resort, a luxury resort that opened about 12 months ago, and is now home to more than 120,000 people. \"It's been an exciting time,\" says Colin Au, the company's president and chief executive officer, adding that he's looking forward to opening a new resort. He said he hopes to open a second resort at the same time as the current one, in which he and his wife, Steffen Kammrath, are planning to build a third resort there. However, he said, \"I'm not sure if we'll be able to keep up with all the changes that have taken place since then.\" He added that the hotel will be open for business for the rest of his life, although he doesn't see himself as a long-term investor. His wife and two children have already moved in with him and he plans to continue working with them, Au said. 'We'll see what we can do for them,' he added. So far, so good. A little over 100 million euro has gone into the project. More than half of that money has come from advertising, advertising and ticket sales. Some of those sales have gone to advertising agencies, such as Travelocity.com and TravelTV.ca. (AP, AFP, dpa)"

Bayern's coach Juergen Klinsmann says Hoffenheim are legitimate contenders, but commercial manager Uli Hoeness disagrees. When the Bundesliga scheduled Bayern's home match against Hoffenheim in the league's unloved Friday night slot, they probably didn't imagine that it would turn out to be the match of the first half of the season. Indeed, few experts or fans thought that Hoffenheim, a first-division debutante located in a southern German village with 3,000 inhabitants, would give mighty Munich a run for its money. But it's the first week of December, and Hoffenheim top the table by three points. They also have a much better goal difference than their second-placed rivals -- and that has drawn praise from Bayern's coach, Juergen Klinsmann. \"I have the highest estimation of Hoffenheim because they've built the squad very ambitiously, rationally and with very good players,\" Klinsmann told DPA news agency. \"They can be proud of that.\" Klinsmann said he thought that the club could establish itself among the top three or four sides in Germany in the years to come and qualify for international competition next season. He also had words of praise for Hoffenheim's software billionaire patron, Dietmar Hopp, whose money has funded the club's ascent. \"There's nothing negative about it,\" Klinsmann said. \"He used to play for the club, is a soccer man through and through and helped the team get on its feet.\" Some fans have criticized Hopp and Hoffenheim for paying inflating salaries and luring talent away from other clubs instead of developing homegrown players. In fact, Hoffenheim's official salary budget is about average for the Bundesliga. Hoeness sounds his horn But while Bayern's coach was praising his opponents to the skies, Munich's commercial manager Uli Hoeness has been trying to play with their heads. On the heels of Bayern's convincing win over Leverkusen last weekend, Hoeness is back to taunting rivals. \"The performance we showed in the second half against Leverkusen will be enough against Hoffenheim,\" Hoeness told the German soccer magazine kicker. Hoeness also dropped a none-too-thinly-veiled hint that Hoffenheim's personnel expenditures were far higher than the officially released figures and scoffed at the idea that strategy would determine the outcome of Friday's match. \"Games are decided by the better players, not by tactics,\" Hoeness said. \"And of course, we've got better players than Hoffenheim.\" But that particular verbal attack may represent some wishful thinking of the manager's part. Hoffenheim coach Ralf Rangnick is one of only two current Bundesliga skippers with a winning record against Munich. Rangnick, whose team cruised past Bielefeld last weekend to keep Bayern three points back, reacted to Hoeness' remarks with a shrug. \"We're preparing for Munich exactly the same way we did against Bielefeld,\" Rangnick said.

H\u00f6ness, however, also pointed out that his team had a difficult task in front of them, as well as the fact that they were struggling to get the ball out of their own net, which was a major problem for them at the start of last week's Bundesliga season. In an interview with German newspaper DPA, he also said that Bayern were \"doing a very good job\" in their first match since taking over from Jupp Heynckes, who was fired after the end of his first season in charge in Germany. After a disappointing first week at Bayern, Hopp said he would be looking forward to continuing his work with his new club. A statement from his office said: \"The club is very pleased with our performance and we will keep working hard for the long term. We are very excited about the future of our club and our players.\" The statement came after a day in which the coach was criticized for his handling of a number of issues, including a lack of communication with key players, and his inability to communicate effectively with players and staff. It also came as a surprise to many who had expected him to step down from the position of sporting director. But it's not just the coaches who have been critical of him, it is the players themselves. They have also been very vocal about their desire to win the league and that's something that has to be acknowledged by the fans and the media. That's why they are so excited to see him back in action on Saturday night, even though he's been out for a couple of weeks with an ankle injury and a shoulder injury. This is also something he will have to deal with as soon as he returns to Munich, where he is expected to start training on Monday. Last week, Hoenesses was given the job of managing a new contract with a club in Bielefeld, Germany's second-biggest league club, but he has yet to confirm whether he'll be back for another season after being fired by Bayern last year. His contract is up for renewal on Dec. 1 and he hopes to return to Bayern in January. However, there is no guarantee that the new deal will be signed before the transfer window closes on Jan. 31. At the same time, his contract expires on December 31, 2016, with Bayern having already agreed to extend the contract to a further two years. If the deal is not renewed by then, that means the player will no longer be available to sign a contract extension until December 1, 2017. Rangingnick said the move was made \"in order to strengthen the relationship between the coaching staff and players,\" but added he didn't see any reason why he wouldn't want to give up his position."

        "target": "Automation in the dairy cow industry A small but nevertheless important sector of the German economy today is agriculture. Although the number of farms has declined over the decades, production has actually increased -- especially at dairy farms. Modern automation technology and robotics are helping to keep both cows and farmers happy, but at the cost of jobs.",
        "generated_story": "Automation in the Dairy Cow Industry The dairy cow industry has been transformed by automation over the decades. Automation has become an integral part of the dairy industry. Dairy cows, for example, are no longer the preserve of milk cows. They are now the go-to dairy cows for milking cows and dairy cheeses, and the milk cow is no different. Today, there are more than 1.5 million cows on the farm, with a total of 2.6 million cow cows slaughtered annually. This is a significant increase compared to the previous year, when there was only one cow cow. In the past, cows were slaughtered by hand, but now they are slaughtered in a factory. The cows are being slaughtered at the same time as the cow's milk is being grown, so that the cows can be milked and sold. That's a big change from the days when cow milk was the mainstay of dairy production. Now, dairy farmers are using automated processes to make milk and milk products that are not only more efficient but also more cost-effective. And that's not just because they have fewer cows to slaughter. There's also the fact that cows don't have to be slaughtered as often as they used to. It's because cows have a better chance of survival than cows do of getting milk, which is why they're able to produce milk as fast as possible. But that doesn't mean they can't get milk from cows as well. What's more, milk production is now more expensive than it was a few decades ago. So, what do you do with milk? You buy milk. You sell milk to milk companies. Then you sell it to a dairy company. Do you have any milk that you can use for milk or milk for dairy products? What does milk do for you? The milk company, Dairy Farmers of America (DCA), has a lot to offer. I think it's important to give milk a fair shake, because milk isn't the only dairy product that has to go through the wringer. Milk is the most expensive milk product. If milk costs are going to rise, then milk prices will go up, as will milk demand. How much milk should milk cost? Do milk producers spend on milk in order to keep milk fresh? Is milk more important than milk consumption? How do milk-curdling cows grow? And how can milk be produced? Dairy farmers, who have been producing milk since the 1980s, do not have the money to do that. Why is milk milk so expensive? Because milk has always been the cheapest and most nutritious. When milk comes out of cows' milk cartons, it is very expensive and it takes a long time to get it into the market. All milk must be made from milk - milk powder, butter, cheese, eggs, sugar, flour, salt and sugar. Even the best milk formulas are expensive, especially when it comes to dairy. \"The milk formula is expensive,\" says one dairy farmer, \"but milk will always be cheaper,\" he says, adding that milk can cost as much as $2.50 to $3.00 a kilogram (about $1.25) a pound). \"That's the price you pay to have milk grown in milk.\" Dairy cow farmers have always had a good reputation for being environmentally friendly and environmentally responsible. However, in recent years, they've become more and more environmentally conscious. A lot of people have become aware of this and are becoming more concerned about the impact on their health and well-being of their children and grandchildren. These are the reasons why milk sales have fallen off the charts. As a result, many dairy companies are cutting back on production and selling milk at a higher cost. Many milk processors are turning to automated milk machines to cut costs and reduce the cost of production costs. For milk farmers in particular, this is an important step in that direction. With this in mind, we're all looking for ways to improve milk quality. We've got to find a way to grow milk faster and lower milk price. Our milk industry is in dire need of a new milk processor. Don't you agree with me on this point? I'm not a milkman. My milk does not come out every day, even if it has milk on it. Most milk shops in this country have no milk machine at all. Some of them are even making milk with butter and butter. On the other hand milk substitutes are still being sold at farmers' markets across the country, such as in Canada and in Germany, where milk cheese is sold for less than $10,000 (around $0.05) per kilo.

        "target": "Inching towards direct talks on Syria They came to hold talks, but started negotiations with mutual affronts. But if there is one person who might be able to mediate between the intransigent Syrian conflict parties, it's Lakhdar Brahimi. Lakhdar Brahimi, the United Nations special envoy for Syria, seemed very tired on Friday (24.01.2014). He had had a long day, which was actually supposed to be the first real day of negotiations at the Syria Conference in Geneva. \"Good afternoon,\" Brahimi told the assembled international press, before adding, \"or good evening, I don't know.\" At the Palais des Nations in Geneva, he presented the most important result of his attempts to mediate between the Syrian government and the opposition to the more than 250 journalists who had managed to get a coveted place at the press conference: \"Tomorrow we expect and we have agreed that we will meet in the same room.\" What Brahimi is declaring an achievement doesn't sound like much, but considering how irreconcilable the conflict parties have been, even that can be seen as a small success. Separate talks with Brahimi The two delegations were actually due to meet on the first day of negotiations in Geneva in order to agree on a timetable and on the subject and agenda of the talks. But emotions are running too high on both sides. Instead both delegations held separate talks with Lahkkdar Brahimi, both lasting just about an hour each In the morning. The Syrian government delegation had apparently been threatening to leave the conference. At least that is what the deputy foreign minister Faisal Mekdad had implied. \"We are here to start the negotiations,\" he told waiting journalists, \"but we found that the other party did not want to come.\" Before the conference, the opposition had explained that for its delegation, the formation of a transition government would be a central tenet of the negotiations. They emphasized that this topic should be discussed right at the beginning of talks and that the establishment of such a body should be initiated without delay. Social media and good old propaganda The representatives of the Syrian National Coalition that were present in Geneva neatly used all imaginable channels to make their views public. At #Geneva2, they tweeted: \"Forming a transitional body is our major priority,\" leaving people in no doubt that the Syrian National Council would not want to include Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Assad's government, on the other hand, is relying on classic propaganda and loyal state media representatives in Geneva. An impressive entourage of dominant journalists from state-run media outlets is constantly at hand, accompanying the government delegation and making sure they get their point across at press conferences. Lakhdar Brahimi even had a small altercation with a journalist from a Syrian state news agency, who made a political statement under the pretense of asking the UN mediator a question. \"Are there any signs that Saudi Arabia, Turkey and other countries would stop the support of terrorism in Syria?,\" she asked in somewhat shaky English, before Brahimi interrupted her. \"Please, please, there is no point in asking such questions!\" Such exchanges hint at the type of negotiating style the experienced diplomat and mediator Brahimi must have behind the scenes. 'Wish us luck' Lakhdar Brahimi described the preliminary talks that took place in Geneva as encouraging and asked for patience. He said that because the peace conference had come about at the last minute and the delegations had therefore only been appointed very recently, there hadn't been enough time to hold preliminary discussions - a task that the delegations were now catching up on. \"We never expected it to be easy and I'm sure it's not going to be,\" he said. \"But I think the two parties understand what is at stake. Their country is in very, very bad shape.\" He added: \"The huge ambition of this process is to save Syria. Nothing less than that.\" After appealing to the willingness of both parties to negotiate, he simply added: \"So wish us luck!\" Fight for freedom As the official delegations held talks with UN mediator Brahimi in the Palais des Nations, the European headquarters of the United Nations, hundreds of Syrian expatriates who had come from all over Europe protested outside, forming a sea of red, white and black Syrian flags on the Place des Nations. With their presence outside the UN gates they wanted to show that despite all the government propaganda, the Syrian National coalition has a lot of support from the Syrian people. Thirty-two-year-old Ziad Malki came to Geneva from Zurich to show his solidarity. Ziad knows how it feels to be deprived of his freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. In 2005, he was arrested at a demonstration in Damascus and says he was tortured during his time in prison. Now he is fighting for a new Syria from outside the country's borders. Ziad is sure that with Bashar al-Assad and his family, there will be nothing new. \"We don't want this man to be in",
        "generated_story": "Mediating with the Syrian National Coalition in Geneva UN mediator Lakhdar Brahimi met Syrian opposition leader Ziad Malki on Friday (24.01.2014) at the Palais des Nations in Zurich, Switzerland. \"I met with him in the morning and we had a very good conversation,\" said the 35-year-old, who is also a member of the Syria National Council (SNC). \"We were able to talk to him for just about an hour,\" he said, adding that he was \"very pleased\" with his meeting with Assad. The Syrian government, which has been in power since 2005, is now in control of Syria's largest city, the capital, Aleppo, and is the world's third largest oil exporter after Turkey and Saudi Arabia. On Friday evening, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his coalition of opposition parties met in Switzerland for the first time since he took power in 2005. At the same time, Assad's regime was in a state of disarray, as was his ability to control the country's economy. In the afternoon, a ceasefire broke down between the opposition and the regime, leading to the formation of a transitional government in Damascus. A ceasefire was agreed on the basis that Assad would be allowed to stay in office until the end of his term. However, it is not clear how long the ceasefire will last. According to a statement released by the SNC, \"the Syrian regime will continue to exert considerable influence over the political and economic situation in Syria.\" The announcement came just a few hours after a meeting between Assad, his regime and opposition leaders in Istanbul and Ankara, Turkey, Ankara and Istanbul, in which the two sides agreed to resume talks on Saturday. Both sides have said that they will hold talks at a later date, but they have yet to agree on a date. 'The Syrian people are not going to give up the fight,' said Faisal Mekdad, deputy UN special envoy for Syria and a former deputy foreign minister of Turkey. He added that there was a \"strong sense of urgency\" in reaching a deal to end the stalemate, saying that it was important to reach an agreement on how to deal with a crisis that could lead to an escalation of violence. Speaking to reporters, Buhari said: \"It is very important for us to have a clear understanding of what is going on. We have to make sure that we are making the most of this opportunity.\" He said he would like to see a resolution that would allow the Assad regime to return to power."

        "target": "Italy's navy to patrol with Libyan ships to curb human trafficking Italy wants to work more closely with Libya to limit the number of sea crossings by migrants and potential asylum seekers. But what are the consequences? Italy's prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni, does not want to wait any longer for EU countries to show solidarity in distributing asylum seekers throughout the bloc. On Thursday he announced in Rome that the Italian navy would be patrolling with Libyan ships just off the Libyan coastline. The aim, Gentiloni says, is to curb human trafficking and bring migrants back from the smugglers' boats to Libya. According to the Italian government's figures, 93,000 migrants have arrived in Italy so far this year. At least 2,000 have drowned in the attempt to cross the Mediterranean - the true figure is unknown. Italy has already threatened to stop allowing boats carrying rescued migrants to dock in Italian ports, or that it may issue migrants with documents that would allow them to travel on to other European countries. Rome has not yet implemented either policy, but the government has made clear that Italy will soon run out of options. The EU Commissioner for Migration Dimitris Avramopoulos acknowledged, again, in Brussels on Thursday that \"Europe continues to face high migratory pressures. And Italy more than (almost) any others.\" The European Commission issued a letter offering more aid and personnel to help manage migration better. Accommodation will soon be full The office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, wrote at the beginning of July that \"Close to 200,000 accommodation places are available for refugees and migrants across [Italy], but are nearly all full.\" The High Commissioner referred particularly to the numbers of people dying when he warned, \"What is happening in front of our eyes in Italy is an unfolding tragedy.\" The United Nations anticipates that another 100,000 migrants will come to Italy via Libya before the end of this year. The number of arrivals is already 20 percent higher than last year; and the number of dead, those who could not be saved, would rise accordingly. According to UN estimates, the Mediterranean remains the \"deadliest\" refugee route in the world. Italian government statistics say that around 600,000 people have arrived in Italian ports since the start of the crisis in 2014. It is unclear how many have since traveled on to Austria, France or Switzerland. Once migrants are registered in Italy and accommodated in camps, they are not held there. If, however, they leave the accommodation without giving notice, they forfeit their claim to subsistence and social services. Most of the migrants are from African countries, and many try to travel on to France, for example. 300 people are currently sleeping on the beach in Ventimiglia, on the French border, hoping to take a bus or train to France. However, the border is being policed by French officials. Migrants who are caught are sent back to Italy. Austria has announced that it too will close its border with Italy if the number of migrants starts to rise. Repatriation and distribution are difficult Last year 120,000 new asylum applications were made in Italy. Around 50 percent of these are rejected. The asylum seekers are then supposed to leave the country. However, the process of people either returning voluntarily or being deported is very slow. The interior ministry has therefore announced that it will reinforce repatriation programs. The redistribution of asylum seekers from Italy, as agreed by the European Union, is well behind target. Two years ago the aim was to resettle 120,000 people. So far, only 24,676 people have been redistributed, the EU Commission said on Thursday: 7,873 from Italy, and 16,803 from Greece. The numbers are low not just because of the reluctance of other EU countries to take the refugees in, but also because of Italian delays in the registration of possible candidates. Asylum seekers from Eritrea are the most likely to fulfill the criteria for redistribution. Around 25,000 are currently living in Italy, but only 10,000 have been registered with the EU Commission and the European Asylum Support Office as possible candidates. Migration Commissioner Avramopoulos has announced that Italy will be given more help and logistical support in this area.",
        "generated_story": "EU Migration Commissioner Avramopoulos: Italy facing 'an unfolding tragedy' The European Union's migration commissioner said Thursday that Italy is facing an \"unprecedented tragedy\" in the Mediterranean region. The EU Commission said it was \"deeply concerned\" about the situation in Italy, which has seen a surge in migrant arrivals since the beginning of July. \"We are deeply concerned about Italy's situation,\" said Dimitris Avramsopoulos, the EU Commissioner for Migration and Refugees in Rome. Italy was one of the first EU countries to accept migrants from Eritrea, Libya and Eritreans. Two years ago, Italy received more than 1.5 million migrants, according to figures compiled by the European Commission. Last year, it received 2.6 million asylum seekers. In 2014, a total of 3.4 million people were admitted to Italy. Since then, there has been a rise in arrivals from other EU member states, including the United States, France, Germany, Switzerland, Austria and Switzerland. On Thursday, Italian authorities announced that they would no longer allow migrants to enter the country at the end of this year. According to the Commission, this would be the second time in a row that migrants have been accepted into the bloc. It is also the third time since 2014 that the number of migrants has risen to over 2,000. This is a record for a country with a population of just over 1 million. At the same time, in 2014 Italy had received 1,500 asylum claims from migrants. More than a third of those claims were rejected by Italy and the other 27 countries that had accepted them. That number is expected to rise even further in 2015, when Italy will receive 2 million more migrants than it currently receives. Author: Filippo Grandi Editor: Paolo Gentiloni (AFP, Reuters)"

        "generated_story": "Germany is hosting the FIFA Women's World Cup in 2011. It's the first time Germany has hosted a women's soccer tournament. Germany will host the 2011 edition of the tournament, which will be held in the country's capital, Berlin on June 26 and 27. The tournament's organizers, Deutsche Welle, said on its website that they were \"very pleased\" with Germany's decision. \"We are very pleased with the decision to host this year's tournament,\" the paper said, adding that it was \"a great honor\" for Germany to have hosted the event. According to the German government, Germany is the only country in Europe that has not hosted an international competition since the 1990s. In addition to hosting a major international event, the 2022 edition will also include a chance to showcase the talents of female athletes from around the world. There is also the possibility of hosting an exhibition match between Germany and the United States, according to a report by the news agency dpa. This would be the second time in a row that a German team has been invited to play for the national team, following the success of Germany in 2010. German media reported that Germany had invited the team to Germany, but Germany was not invited. That's because Germany did not have the money to pay for it. Instead, it had to rely on a host of other countries, such as France, England, Spain, Italy, Japan and South Korea, to help it win the competition. However, that didn't stop Germany from being the host nation. After all, there is no way Germany would have been able to do that without the help of its host country, Russia. So, in order to make sure Germany won't have to compete with other nations, they have decided to hold their own. They have chosen Germany as their host for 2011, and they are looking forward to having the opportunity to show their country how to be a strong contender for a top-notch female soccer team next year. But Germany also has a lot of work ahead of them, as well as a good chance of winning the title in 2012. As a result, German women are expected to take part in several international competitions, including the 2010 and 2011 World Cups. And that's not to say that there will not be many international matches, because there are plenty of international tournaments to choose from. What's more, many of these will take place at the same time as the 2006 and 2010 tournaments, with a focus on the women in particular. For example, if Germany wins the 2012 edition, then it will have a very strong female squad. If Germany does not win this time around, what will it do with its women? It will need to find a way to get the most out of it, since it has already lost a number of key players in recent years to injury, illness and financial problems. One reason for this is that the players are not as experienced as they could be in previous years, when they had been in other competitions. Another reason is because of their lack of experience in international soccer. When it comes to international events, most women don't get to participate in them at all. Women are more likely to attend the games in their native countries than men, for example in France and Germany. With that in mind, I think it's important that we have an experienced female athlete in Germany who can play a leading role in many aspects of our game. I'm not sure that I can say much more about the future of women than I used to when I was a teenager, or even in my early 20s, before I became a professional athlete. At the end of my career, my wife and I were very much a part of that team. Now, we're going to try to build on that. We'll see how it goes from strength to strength as we get older and stronger and we'll have more opportunities to improve on our skills and improve our technical skills. You know what I mean by that? We're looking at a new generation of players who are coming into the game, so we've got to see what we can do to better prepare them for their new challenges. Let's see if they're ready to step up and take on this challenge. Do you have any idea what it is like for them? What do you think? I'd love to hear from you if you do? Tell me what you'd like to talk to me about your experience with international football. How you feel about it? Do I feel like I've done a great job? Let me know if I do something for you? If you're interested in participating in this competition, you can contact me at [email protected] I'll be happy to answer any of your questions."

        "target": "Is China seeking regime-change in North Korea? The sudden reduction in aggressive rhetoric and actions by North Korea has led to suggestions that Pyongyang has realized it has pushed its only ally in the region to the brink of severing its friendship. The announcement in Pyongyang on May 13 of the promotion of Jang Jong-nam to \"minister of the People's Armed Forces\" came out of the blue. Until recently, the little-known commander of an army corps in coastal Kangwon Province, Jang has replaced Kim Kyok-sik, a four-star general with a long track record of loyal service to the regime. The reasons for 70-year-old Kim's replacement are not clear - as with most of the political maneuvers in North Korea - but it may have been his loyalty that cost him his position in the politburo. Kim was widely seen as a hawk in the regime and is believed to have been in command of the operation to shell the South Korean island of Yeonpyeongdo in November 2010, an incident that killed four people, destroyed civilians' homes and infrastructure and dramatically worsened the already strained relationship between Pyongyang and Seoul. By sacrificing Kim, analysts believe, North Korea is signaling that it is backing away from the confrontational stance it adopted after the United Nations imposed new sanctions in the wake of the nation's third underground nuclear test in February. And there are other indicators that Pyongyang is seeking to return to the status quo. The North's troops have been permitted to step down from the highest state of preparedness for war that was initially ordered when South Korea and the US began a series of annual military exercises. Missiles withdrawn Similarly, two Musudan intermediate-range missiles that were identified as being on mobile launchers being operated in eastern areas of the country have apparently been ordered to return to base. In late April, there was concern that test-launches of the missiles would be a further escalation by Kim Jong-un's government and a message that it would not bow to international pressure to halt its nuclear and missile development programs. But the analysts believe the tokens of Pyongyang's goodwill have come too late. \"For the North Korean leader, this is a very difficult time,\" Toshimitsu Shigemura, a professor at Tokyo's Waseda University and an authority on North Korean affairs, told DW. \"Timing is very important here and it is possible that China is moving to abandon Kim Jong-un. The atmosphere between the two nations is changing. China may have decided that it is time for a regime-change in the North, they will not permit the collapse of the country because they do not want chaos on their own borders.\" Further evidence that Beijing is slowly tightening the screw on its erstwhile ally comes as more state-run financial institutions sever their links with banks in North Korea. The latest institution to adhere to the government's orders to halt transactions across the border is the Bank of China, one of the four major banks in the country, which announced on May 7 that it would cease dealings with the Foreign Trade Bank of North Korea, which has been identified as being involved in Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs. Contingency plan in place Intelligence sources have passed on to DW information that Beijing has a contingency plan in place for when Kim Jong-un's control over the country crumbles. The reports confirm that China is indeed quietly encouraging regime change and is grooming Kim's brother, Kim Jong-nam to take over his role. At 42, Kim Jong-nam is the oldest son of Kim Jong-il, the dictator who ruled North Korea with an iron fist for 17 years until his sudden death in December 2011. Kim Jong-nam had been expected to assume the leadership after his father's death, but fell from favor spectacularly in 2001 when he was detained with two women and a boy aged 4 at Tokyo's Narita International Airport travelling on a forged Dominican Republic passport. He later admitted that he had wanted to visit Disneyland. He subsequently lived in Macau and Beijing, under the close watch of the Chinese authorities. The reports suggest that after Kim Jong-nam is installed in Pyongyang, his brother will be permitted to go into exile, probably in China. The tactic is not without its pitfalls, however, in part due to the efficiency of the campaign to deify their young leader as the future of the nation. Kim Jong-nam as 'new king' \"China may be dreaming of appointing Kim Jong-nam as the new king - and he is more preferable to the West than Kim Jong Un - but the problem is that he is not known in North Korea,\" said Ken Kato, director of Tokyo-based Human Rights in Asia. \"Many people in Japan know much about the North Korean 'Royal Family,' but this information is hidden in North Korea,\" he said. \"Even residents of Pyongyang know very little about Kim Jong-nam.\" Yet the reports are gaining credence among North Korea-watchers. Jun Okumura, a political analyst with the Eurasia Group, told DW that North Korea withdrawing",

His name is Kim Kyok-sik, and he is the heir apparent to the throne of the People's Armed Forces of North Korea. He was born on May 7, 2001, in the capital Pyongyang. On May 13, he became the nation's first foreign leader after the death of his father in a plane crash in November 2010. Kim's father, Jang, was the first head of state to be officially recognized as the new leader. In his first public appearance since his death in December 2011, the 70-year-old said he was \"very happy\" with his new title. \"I am very happy,\" he said, adding that he would like to see his country become the world's second-largest economy by 2020. But he also wants to make China the \"first country in Asia to recognize and recognize the power of its own people,\" said Okumura, a professor of political science at the University of Waseda in Seoul. The new crown prince, who is also known as \"the new Kim,\" is due to take over the reins of power in Pyongyang in May, according to a report from the Eurasia Group, an organization that monitors human rights in North Korean society. According to that report, Kim is expected to step down from his post as leader by May 14, 2021. Author: Ken Kato Editor: Toshimitsu Shigemura (dw)"

Smuggling has prompted a visit to Mexico City by US Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly. Prosecutors said the remote town of Las Varas in Chihuahua state was the scene of Wednesday's battle between affiliates of the Ciudad Juarez cartel and a gang from the state of Sinaloa. Police said fighting escalated when patrols arrived. Fourteen people were found dead; 12 others were hospitalized. Grenades, launchers and rifles were found. The mountainous region is used as a corridor for smuggling into the US. El Chapo effect Chihuahua security commissioner Oscar Alberto Aparicio said a Black Hawk helicopter was called in as police chased surviving gang members through the area known for marijuana and opium poppy production. Two police officers had been killed in a \"cowardly\" way in the area a week ago, he said. In a similar incident last Friday, 17 gunmen were killed during a shootout with police on a highway in Sinaloa, Mexico's northwestern state. Sinaloa was the home base of Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, whose extradition to the US in January apparently left gangsters in a struggle for control of criminal syndicates. Homicides have surged in recent months, with the number of persons killed in May put at 2,186, the highest since the collection of such statistics began 20 years ago. Nieto and Kelly to talk In Mexico City Wednesday, President Enrique Pena Nieto's office said he and visiting US Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly had discussed how to rein in organized crime groups. \"Shared responsibility\" must become the focus of transnational efforts, Kelly said. Narcotics smuggling into the US has become a multibillion-dollar (multibillion-euro) business for Mexican drug cartels. Mexico in turn wants the US to throttle demand for narcotics and the supply of illegal weapons to Mexico cartels. Pena Nieto and US President Donald Trump, who wants a border wall, are schedule to meet Friday on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany. ipj/ng (AP, AFP, dpa)",

The two leaders are expected to meet again in Mexico City on Friday. Mexico's interior minister, Oscar Alberto Aparicio, said on Wednesday that the country's border with neighboring Sinaloa was safe. \"The border is secure,\" he said in a televised address to the G20 summit. He said the border was secure and that border guards would be on hand to deal with the situation. On Wednesday, the US State Department announced that it had launched an investigation into the alleged involvement of Mexican drug lord Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, who is wanted by US authorities in connection with a drug trafficking operation in the northern Mexican state of Chihuahua. In a statement released by the White House on Thursday, Trump said he was \"deeply concerned\" about the possibility of an escalation of violence between the two cartels. Trump also said that he would meet with Mexican authorities to try to find out what happened. A spokesman for the Mexican government told the Associated Press news agency that \"the investigation is ongoing and we have no further comment at this time.\" The statement came a week after the president of the United States, Barack Obama, met with top Mexican officials at a summit of world leaders, including the heads of state, Xi Jinping, and former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Both men said they were willing to cooperate in any way possible, but that they did not have any concrete plans to do so at the time of their meeting. US officials have not commented on the meeting, which is scheduled to take place in Germany later this week.

At the same time, Mexico has been on a collision course with its southern neighbor in recent months, where a group of gunmen attacked a police station and killed at least 10 people, according to a US official. Last week, a man was killed in an attack that left more than 1,000 people injured. More than 2,500 people have died since the attack, most of them children, police said, adding that many of those killed were Mexican nationals."

        "target": "Nigeria sentences 54 soldiers to death for mutiny A Nigerian court martial has sentenced 54 soldiers to death for mutiny and cowardice as they refused to fight against Boko Haram Islamists. The case has highlighted the army's problems with equipment and morale. The men sentenced to death on Wednesday were part of the special forces division ordered in August to retake three towns in Borno state, which had been taken over by the Islamist Boko Haram insurgents. Their lawyer, Femi Falana, said the 54 men were sentenced to death by firing squad and five had been acquitted. They were accused of conspiring to commit mutiny against the authorities of the 7th Division of the Nigerian army, which is on the frontline. The trial began on October 15 and was conducted behind closed doors. It is subject to approval by top military officials, but there has so far been no indication that senior officers oppose the court martial. They were not available for comment afterwards. There was a similar case in Nigeria in September, when 12 soldiers were sentenced to death for mutiny after firing on their commanding officer in the northeast city of Maiduguri. The 7th Division, based in Maiduguri, leads the offensive but there are numerous reports of troops refusing to deploy. Soldiers have regularly complained that they lack weapons, food, and other basic supplies to fight the Islamists, who are reported to have tanks, rocket-propelled-grenade launchers, and other heavy weaponry. Boko Haram has taken a number of towns and declared an Islamic caliphate in the region near the border with Cameroon. The Nigerian military has in recent weeks claimed to have made progress in recapturing lost territory. Thousands of people have been killed since the Islamist uprising began five years ago. An estimated 1.3 million have been displaced, with tens of thousands seeking refuge in neighboring Cameroon, Chad, and Niger. rg/bk (AFP, AP, dpa)",

The military said on Wednesday that it had declared a \"state of emergency\" against the group, which has claimed responsibility for the killings of more than 40,000 people. A military spokesman said the military was preparing to launch a counter-offensive. \"The military has declared an end to the fighting,\" said Femi Falana, the spokesman of the 7th Division, in a statement released by his office. He added that \"the military will continue to fight the terrorists until the end of this war.\" The statement came after a military court ordered the release of a number of suspects in connection with the killing of at least 40 people and the kidnapping of hundreds of others in August and September. On Wednesday, a court in Maiduguri announced that the suspects had been released on bail and that they would face charges of kidnapping, rape, murder and other crimes committed five years ago. It was not immediately clear whether or not the charges against them would be dropped, or whether they will be tried in court. According to a report by the Nigerian news agency dpa, \"Boko Haram [the group] is planning to use the attack as a means of establishing a caliphate.\" It is not clear if the defendants will face trial or if they are to be sentenced to life in prison. There is also a possibility they could face a fine of up to $1 million (about $2.5 million) if convicted of murder or other charges. At the same time, there is the possibility that a trial could be held against a group of people suspected of involvement in attacks on security forces, such as the army, police and intelligence agencies, as well as kidnapping and rape of civilians, according to an AFP report. In August, Nigeria's military launched an operation to retake the country's northeast, ending a five-year insurgency that has killed thousands of soldiers and displaced millions of internally displaced people across the north and east. Last month, military officials said they were ready to take action against those responsible, but they had yet to provide details on how they planned to do so. An army spokesman told AFP that there was \"no evidence\" that any of those arrested had committed any crime."

The 53-year-old will be leading Germany's second biggest lender. After successfully weathering the Great Recession, Commerzbank's board of directors appears to want to signal a continuation in its growth trend with Martin Zielke's appointment as the new CEO as of May 1. Outgoing head Martin Blessing announced last year he would not renew his contract. Zielke had previously been put in charge of implementing reforms in the company's private banking sector following the recession. His restructuring measures attracted 800,000 new customers to the bank and changed the image of the 146-year-old financial institution. The 53-year-old has an illustrious career across several German financial institutions to look back on, having started at the teller of a local branch in 1983. Zielke's crowning achievement The beleaguered German financial institution recorded a profit of more than a billion euros (more than $1.1 billion) last year. It was the first time in five years that Commerzbank had made such profitable gains, which it said would translate into paid dividends for shareholders. A good portion of the yields were achieved by a restructuring and expansion drive of Commerzbank's private banking arm under Zielke's leadership. However, some of that money will go to the German government, as it had to step in and rescue the bank in 2009 to the tune of 18 billion euros ($25 billion at the time) by chiefly acquiring more than 15 percent of the shares, effectively nationalizing part of Commerzbank's operations. ss/jlw (dpa, Reuters)",

He will take over from Martin Blessing on May 1. The German bank's board of directors announced on Tuesday that Martin was stepping down from his post at the helm of the world's second-largest bank. Martin had been in the job since 1983, when he took over as chairman of Deutsche Bank. In his first public comments since taking over in 2009, Martin said he was \"deeply disappointed\" with the company's performance. \"The company is in a very difficult position,\" he said, adding that he would like to return to his previous position of chairman and CEO, which he described as \"the most difficult part of my life.\" The new CEO will be chosen by a panel of board members, including the chairman, chief financial officer and deputy chief operating officer. A spokesman for the bank said the board had not yet decided on the appointment of a successor to Martin, who had served as head of finance in Germany from 1983 to 2009. Zilke is widely regarded as one of Europe's most experienced CEOs, with a reputation for being a tough negotiator. His appointment comes after a series of scandals that have left him in doubt about his ability to deliver on promises he made to the German public. One of those scandals was the 2008 financial crisis, in which the state-owned bank suffered a total loss of 18 billion euros ($25 billion). Another scandal involved the sale of an insurance business to a private equity firm for $1.5 billion in 2008. This was followed by the 2009 collapse of Lehman Brothers, the largest private-equity lender in history, and the 2011 bankruptcy of German lender Deutsche Boerse. Both companies have since been bailed out by investors and are now looking for a new head. It is not clear how long Martin will stay in his position, but it is expected to be a long time before he is able to take the reins. That would be the first time that a German company has gone through a restructuring since the Great Recession in 1983. There is also the possibility that the restructuring could be extended to other companies, such as banks, insurance companies and financial services companies. But it's unclear what will happen next, given the current state of financial markets in Europe and in particular Germany, where the economy is at a low point in recent years. On the other hand, there is the question of whether or not he will stick around as long as he wants to continue to lead the firm. If he decides to stay on, it will depend on how well he manages to keep his job and how much money he has to spend in order to get it done. At the same time, though, he must also keep in mind that his successor will have to make sure he stays on top of his game and not fall into the trap of being the next CEO. After all, this is a CEO who has a lot to learn from the past. And that's not just because he's a former banker. What is important to him is his reputation as a person of integrity and integrity. How will he handle his responsibilities? What do you think he'll do? He's got to do with his time in management? \"I don't know. I'm not going to say anything about it,\" Martin told Reuters in an interview published in May."

According to Commission figures, around 730,000 of these live within the EU's 27 member states. France, Italy, Spain and Portugal have relatively high infection rates - ranging from 0.4 percent to 0.5 percent. In the Baltic country of Estonia, the infection rate stands at around 1.3 percent. In neighboring Ukraine, around 1.6 percent of the population has been diagnosed with HIV, while in Russia around 1.1 percent are HIV positive. The Commission warned that now was not the time for Europe to drop its guard on preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS, adding that in some neighboring countries the number of people carrying the virus had doubled. EU Health Commissioner Androulla Vassiliou said political momentum in the fight against HIV/AIDS needed to be maintained, adding that people must \"take responsibility for themselves and their partners by talking about and practicing safe sex and going for HIV testing.\" A cure for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has yet to be found more than a quarter century after it was brought to public attention.

According to the results of the survey, 1 in 3 of those surveyed said they had no idea they were HIV positive. \"We have a lot of people who have HIV,\" said Androulla Vassiliou, the Commission's deputy commissioner for HIV and AIDS, in an interview with AFP news agency. He added that a third of respondents had never heard of HIV or AIDS in their entire lives. In addition, one-third of all respondents said that they did not know that HIV was a serious illness, and that it was not something that could be cured by treatment. A third, however, said he was unaware that the disease was present in his own body. On Monday, EU health ministers agreed to hold an emergency meeting in Brussels to discuss ways to tackle the problem. They also agreed on a number of measures to reduce the spread of AIDS among EU nationals living in countries with high HIV levels, such as Germany, Italy, Spain, France, Portugal and Spain. But they also said the measures were not enough to address the issue of whether HIV is an illness that can be transmitted through contact with the outside world. One out of three respondents, who are not aware of having HIV, reported that their symptoms had worsened over the past year. This is the first time in more than a decade that AIDS has become a major problem for many people in Europe. It has also been linked to a lack of access to medical care in many European countries, including the United States, Britain, Ireland and the Netherlands, where the virus was first discovered in 2001. That is, until recently, only a small percentage of European citizens were aware their status was being affected by HIV. Today, it is estimated that about 1.5 million people live with AIDS worldwide, up from 0.6 percent in 2004. And the number is expected to rise to 2.4 million by 2015.

Security forces were put on high alert, with riot police patrolling streets after calls by the opposition for the resignation of Maoist Prime Minister Baburam Bhattarai. \"Nepal has entered an uncertain constitutional and political period,\" Ban warned in a statement read by his spokesman Martin Nesirky. \"The government and the political leaders, as well as leaders of various communities, need to demonstrate the courage and wisdom to come together to address the challenges the nation faces,\" the statement added. Repeated deadlines expired Politicians were to have agreed upon a new framework for the country's political future by Sunday. However, the representation of ethnic minorities and castes within a federal structure has proved a major sticking point in efforts to draw up a secular constitution. Bhattarai on Sunday said that parliament, elected in 2008 after a decade of civil war, would be disbanded after repeated deadlines had been broken. New elections are due to be held in November, but the opposition has criticized the premier's unilateral decision to call the poll.

Ban Ki-moon and UN Secretary General Martin Nesirky are expected to meet in Kathmandu later Monday to discuss the situation. Both Ban and Bhattarai have promised to hold the polls in their respective states. \"We are going to do everything in our power to make sure that the people of Nepal have a voice,\" Ban said in an address to the nation's parliament on Sunday. He also said that he would meet with Prime Minister B.K. Vajpayee, who was elected in 2008, and his wife, Baburam, would be meeting with him in his official capacity as UN special envoy for Nepal. They will also hold a press conference to talk about the upcoming elections, which are due to begin at the end of the month. In the meantime, Ban has promised a \"calm approach\" to Nepal's political situation, as well as an end to violence and corruption. But he is not ready to give up on his dream of becoming the UN's top human rights official. On Sunday, he said he was \"very disappointed\" by the results of Sunday's election, saying that his country was in \"a state of disarray\" and that it was time for him to step down from his position as the head of UN peacekeeping operations. His comments come as Nepal prepares to host its first general elections since the 2008 earthquake that killed more than 1.5 million people and left millions of people without a reliable source of income. It is the first time since 2008 that Nepal has had to deal with an economic crisis that has forced millions to flee their homes and businesses. At the same time, there is a growing sense of unease among the Nepalese public about what is going on. There is also a sense that some people are not happy with what has taken place in recent years. Many of them feel that they have been cheated out of their livelihoods by a corrupt government. This has led to a rise in corruption and political instability, leading to an increase in poverty and unemployment among young people, according to figures from the United Nations and the International Organization for Migration (IOM). In addition to this, a number of political parties have announced plans to form a coalition to tackle the problem, including the National Democratic Party (NDP), which has a majority in parliament, to fight corruption, poverty, unemployment and poverty. Some of these plans have already been approved by Ban's government, while others are still being considered by other parties, such as India, China, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. A recent poll showed that a large majority of voters have rejected the idea of an early election. According to estimates from a UN report, around 80 percent of registered voters said they would not vote for any candidate."

It is a one-crust pie, eaten in most German wine regions during the fall wine season. Zwiebelkuchen is traditionally eaten with Federweisser, a young wine available in Germany in the fall. The link between the two is so strong that many Federweisser wines have a recipe for the onion cake on their labels. Here's a recipe for it: Ingredients: 1 packet yeast, active dry 1 teaspoon sugar 1 1/2 teaspoon salt 3 cups unbleached flour 1 tablespoon shortening 1 cup water (49 to 54 C / 120 to 130 F) 6 slices bacon -- diced 2 medium onions -- sliced 1/4 teaspoon cumin 1/2 teaspoon salt Pepper 1 egg yolk 1 cup sour cream Mix the yeast with the sugar, a teaspoon of salt and half a cup of flour. Blend in the shortening and warm water, then beat for two minutes. Add enough flour to make a soft dough, and then knead the dough until smooth and elastic, about five minutes. Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, then cover it and let it rise in a warm place for 30 minutes. Pat the dough into a lightly greased 12-inch pizza pan or onto a lightly greased baking sheet. Press up the edges to make a slight rim. Fry the bacon until crisp and drain it on absorbent paper. Add onions to the bacon grease, and cook slowly until tender, but not brown. Sprinkle the onions, bacon, cumin, half a teaspoon of salt and pepper over the dough. Bake the cake at 204 C (400 F) for 20 minutes. Blend the egg yolk and sour cream and pour the mixture over the Zwiebelkuchen. Bake it for another 10 to 15 minutes, until the cake is golden brown and the sour cream has set.

Onion Cake is the perfect accompaniment to wine. It's a great way to start the fall season with a drink. You can drink it in about five minutes and then enjoy it for another 10 to 15 minutes. The best part is that you don't have to drink wine to enjoy the taste of the wine you're drinking. That's the key to success in Germany, which is known for its wine-making prowess. But there's also a lot more to it than that. For example, onion cake is a good example of how to make a wine that tastes good in the autumn, when the temperature drops below zero degrees Celsius (104 degrees F) and the air is cooler. And then there are the desserts. They're good for dessert, but they're also great for drinking wine for the first time in a long time. This is especially true when you consider the amount of wine consumed during the summer and fall months. There's no shortage of wines to choose from, so we're going to try to find the best ones. We'll see what we can come up with. Then we'll try some of our favorites. I'm looking forward to trying out some new wines. One of my favorites is Onion cake, because it tastes really good on the tongue and tastes great on your tongue. Another is wine with cream cheese on top. \"It's very easy to mix up the flavors and mix them together,\" says one wine expert, who calls himself a \"German wine lover.\" \"I'm not a big wine drinker at all,\" he says, adding that he doesn't know what to expect when it comes to making wine, \"but I do know that it will be a very good wine.\" And that's exactly what I was looking for when I came across this recipe: an easy, easy and tasty dessert that will make you feel good about yourself, even if you can't taste it. In addition, the recipe is very simple, with just a little bit of butter and sugar in it, making it easy for you to get the hang of it.\" The recipe also includes a few herbs and spices, such as parsley, basil and basil, as well as a variety of herbs, spices and herbs that can be used to enhance the flavor and texture of your wine and make it more appealing to your palate. What's more, it makes you want to taste the fruit more than anything else. How do you decide which grape varieties to buy? The grape variety is important to you, since it has to be the most important grape in your diet. Do you have a favorite grape? I think you should try it out. If you haven't tried it before, try a different grape. Or try one of these varieties of sausages, like the one in this picture above. Try a grapefruit or a cucumber, then try this one and you'll be good to go. After all, you've got to have the right grape juice to grow your own grape, right? And if that grape isn't good enough for your taste buds, that leaves you wanting more fruit. So, I recommend trying some saucy, fresh fruit and vegetables that are very, very different from what you normally get from the grapevine. Don't be afraid to experiment with your grape seeds and try new varieties. These are all very tasty and healthy, especially if they are made with the same grape varietals. Also, they have lots of antioxidants in them. Some of them are particularly important for people who are allergic to garlic, for example. As a result, garlic is more important than olive oil. garlic has a strong antioxidant effect on people's blood sugar levels. When garlic and onion are in season, this can make them more susceptible to cancer and liver cancer. Which grape is best? What grape does that have in common with garlic? Is garlic a better grape than onion wine? It has an antioxidant component that helps to reduce the risk of cancer? This grape has the potential to help you lose weight and improve your immune system."

        "target": "Bayern blast five as Schalke draw Bayern Munich stamped their authority over the Bundesliga on Saturday, with a ruthless 5-0 drubbing of Hannover at home. Meanwhile, second-placed Schalke and third-placed Frankfurt were forced to share the points. With many critics saying Bayern might as well be given the giant Bundesliga dish already, perhaps the struggle for second is shaping up to be the more compelling battle. But Saturday afternoon's clash between second-placed Schalke and third-placed Frankfurt did not take a decisive turn, with the game ending in a 1-1 draw. Schalke drew first blood in the 11th minute, when Frankfurt's Stefan Aigner was dispossessed in midfield, and Lewis Holtby released Klaas-Jan Huntelaar in front of goal - the Dutchman's first in the Bundesliga since September. But the hapless Aigner waited just over 100 seconds to make amends for his error, when the Royal Blues allowed him a free header that left goalkeeper Lars Unnerstall with no chance. But neither side could make inroads in the second half, which allowed Dortmund to leap-frog both sides and claim second place. Bayern take command Meanwhile the imperious Bayern Munich dispelled any talk of winter form-dip - following last week's draw to Nuremberg - with a brutally efficient 5-0 win at home to Hannover. The Bavarians stormed to a 3-0 lead in just 37 minutes, celebrating a nifty overhead kick for star signing Javi Martinez in the fourth minute. Toni Kroos and Franck Ribery scored the next two against a Hannover side that were torn open at will. The overhead kick was the first for the 40-million-euro ($52-million) signing Martinez, and in the second half new defender Dante also opened his account with a straightforward header from a Kroos free-kick. The festival of football continued just four minutes later, when Mario Gomez - making first Bundesliga appearance of the season - slammed the ball into the net from a tight angle just 30 seconds after replacing Mario Mandzukic. Dortmund win The champions Dortmund, meanwhile, are still nine points behind Bayern after beating Mainz 2-1 away. It was a potentially tricky fixture in the town where J\u00fcrgen Klopp began his coaching career, and Mainz showed their brilliance in the fourth minute, when Elkin Soto knocked a dream ball into the path of Marco Caligiuri, whose volley fairly screamed into the top right corner. Dortmund's own star-Marco - national team player Marco Reus - leveled the scores just eight minutes later. Reus worked himself some room at the outer edge of the penalty area, and slotted a beautiful 17-meter effort into the far corner. And Dortmund's second goal, just before half-time, was equally aesthetic - a vertical ball bisected the Mainz defense perfectly down the middle, where Polish predator Robert Lewandowski got his eighth league goal of the season with a deft lob over the onrushing Christian Wetklo in goal. Allofs' homecoming Bremen's 1-1 draw at Wolfsburg had a special frisson of its own, as Wolfsburg's newly-minted sporting director Klaus Allofs faced the club he had served as general manager for over a decade. And there was some gesticulating from the Bremen bench in the general direction of the Wolfsburg management when the guests took the lead in the 35th minute. Just seconds after Wolfsburg missed several chances, Marko Arnautovic was left free in the box after Eljero Elia found space on the left and cut the ball back for the Austrian to finish. But Wolfsburg got their own back in the second half. In the 62th minute, Bremen were reduced to ten men when Lukas Schmitz was given second yellow card for a hard tackle on Adelino Vieirinha. Just two minutes later, Bas Dost took advantage of their guests' disorgnaization and smashed the ball into the goal after neat piece of play from Vieirinha. Dirty derby The Franconian derby between Greuther F\u00fcrth and Nuremberg was a cagey affair that ended in a frustrating 0-0 draw. The first half was marked mainly by a straight red card for Nuremberg's Markus Feulner after an ugly, flying lunge on Stephan F\u00fcrstner. But the home side's numerical advantage was short-lived - Sercan Sararer was also sent for an early ice bath after his high elbow on Javier Pinola was adjudged worthy of a second yellow card in the 61st minute. But the aggression in the tackles was not matched by ruthlessness in front of goal, and neither side could eke out any clear chances.",

The Bavarians have been on a tear in the last few weeks, with a win over Schalke on Saturday afternoon and a trip to Bremen on the road in just over 100 seconds. In the first half, the German side took the lead, only to fall behind just eight minutes later. Aigner, however, was unable to break away from his former club. He was replaced by German defender Markus Feulner, who was brought in to take over from the injured Klaas-Jan Huntelaar. \"I'm not going to lie to you,\" he said, \"but I don't want to be a scapegoat for the loss of my team-mates. I think it's time for me to step up my game and get on with my life,\" said Klopp, whose side have just one more game to play. Bayern, meanwhile, have already secured a place in next season's Champions League group stage. They have a chance to make it to the quarterfinals, where they will take on Borussia Dortmund in a match that has been dominated by Bayern for over a decade. Just two minutes after the break, Bayern took a 1-0 lead with the help of a goal from German striker Adelino Vieirinha. After that, they were on their way to a 2-2 draw with Mainz, a result that will see them qualify for next year's competition. That was Bayern's first win in Bundesliga competition since 2014, when they went on to claim the league title. It was also their second in as many years, and they have yet to lose a single game in their last four league matches. On the other hand, it was the Dutch side who had the better chance of winning the title last season, but they failed to do so in September. And that's when Bayern came to town, just four days after losing their only remaining Bundesliga match in Germany. Then came a shocker from their coach, Marco Reus, as he was substituted off for a second yellow card against Nuremberg and then replaced him by former Bayern player Javi Martinez. This was just the second time in four years that the club had been without a player for more than a year, after they had signed a new player in January. But it wasn't just a blunder that made the difference in terms of form and quality that Bayern were able to bring in. Instead of conceding a late goal to their new man, Martinez was sent off in an attempt to clear the way for his replacement. His replacement, goalkeeper Lars Unnerstall, made no mistake in his decision to stick with his old man. With the new coach now in charge, he has a lot of work ahead of him and will have to work hard to get his side back in front of his new boss. If he doesn't get the job done quickly, then he will be out of this competition for years to come."

Now the country wants to keep a positive trade balance by having the value of the imported luxury cars matched by red wine exports. Porsche is currently enjoying record profits after a two-year downturn, but the export-reliant company has hit a pothole in Argentina. Buenos Aires-based Porsche importer Grupo Pulenta has signed an agreement obligating it to export several hundred bottles of red wine for each car it imports, the Argentine government announced Wednesday. Grupo Pulenta declined to comment when contacted by Deutsche Welle. Job creation During the past year, Argentina has held thousands of high-end vehicles in customs until companies agreed to export goods valued at the same amount. Most of those vehicles came from Germany. According to a spokeswoman for the Argentine embassy in Berlin, the country has been trying to safeguard domestic employment with a positive trade balance. \"Our government has negotiated with automakers to balance their imports of cars with an equivalent amount of exports,\" she told Deutsche Welle in a statement. \"Since March 2010 we have been working with the automakers and importers in order to increase local integration and reduce the trade deficit in this sector.\" Small market A Porsche spokesman said the company sells just short of 100 vehicles into Argentina each year. That compares to more than 40,000 sold worldwide during five months in 2010. \"For Porsche, Argentina is a rather small market,\" the spokesman told Deutsche Welle. \"Our importer, the Pulenta Group, also deals in wine. They have their own vineyards and export that wine. It has nothing to do with Porsche - we just have an import contract with them, and it seems they've found an individual solution with the Argentine government.\" Domestic production Volkswagen, which has an Argentine subsidiary producing the new \"Amarok\" pickup truck and transmissions, has thus far avoided mandatory exports. The company had reported an export surplus of 384 million euros ($545 million) for this year. Porsche's holding company owns 32.2 percent of Volkswagen, and the Porsche brand is intended to become integrated into Volkswagen's lineup. Daimler and BMW also have subsidiaries in Argentina. While Daimler produces its \"Sprinter\" there, BMW only imports to the country. According to the Argentine embassy in Berlin, the country has recently sought more domestic production by foreign car companies. Author: Gerhard Schneibel (dpa) Editor: John Blau",
        "generated_story": "Porsche aims to balance wine exports with red wine production in Argentina The German carmaker has announced plans to increase its wine export by 384 million euros ($545 million) in the past year. The move is part of an effort by the company to reduce its reliance on imports from Argentina, which has been suffering from a lack of domestic demand. Argentina's state-owned company Grupo Pulenta announced on Wednesday that it would cut its imports of wine from the country in order to focus on its domestic market. \"We are going to continue to invest in our domestic markets,\" said Gerhard Schneibel, head of the group's wine and spirits division, in an interview with Deutsche Welle. He added that the move was \"part of a broader effort to diversify the market.\" The company also said it was looking at ways to improve its international competitiveness, such as expanding its presence in Germany, the Middle East and Latin America, as well as in developing new markets in Asia and Africa. In addition, it is also looking to expand its European operations in Brazil, Argentina and South America. Germany's largest wine producer, Daimler, said in a statement that Argentina \"continues to be an important market for us in terms of our exports to the world.\" Argentina is one of several Latin American countries where Porsche is the biggest wine exporter, with more than 40 percent of its exports coming from Germany and the United States, according to data compiled by German research firm Amarok. It is not the first time that Porsche has had to cut back on wine imports. Last year, German wine giant Volkswagen sold its stake in Porsche to Argentina in exchange for a 25 percent share in its global market share. Porsche, however, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the decision. A spokesman for the German company said that \"the company does not intend to take any further action on this issue.\" German media reported that German news agency dpa had reported in March 2010 that Germany was planning to introduce a new wine-making plant in Buenos Aires, a move that would have a positive impact on Porsche's foreign exchange reserves. German newspaper Dpa said the new plant would be built with the aim of reducing its dependency on imported wine. According to German business daily Amadeus, \"The company is looking for new sources of revenue, but we have not yet found a solution to this problem. We have to find a way to make sure that we are able to meet the needs of Argentina,\" the spokesman said."

        "target": "Beekeepers battle mites with technology Bees are useful, hard-working and vital for our ecosystem. Aside from making honey, bees pollinate most of our food crops. But summertime is also the season for one of the biggest threats to honey bees \u2013 the varroa mite. Dete Papendieck puts on a white veiled protective hat and takes out a metal jug with a beak-shaped spout. He sets fire to the container's contents \u2013 formic acid \u2013 and starts directing the smoke that is wafting at the beehives lined up in front of him in his garden on the outskirts of Bonn. The acid doesn't harm the bees, but it does kill the varroa mites, he says. And July, after most of the honey has been harvested, is the best time to treat his hives. The one millimeter-large varroa mite is a parasite that infests beehives and lays its eggs in the honeycombs, alongside the bees' larvae. \"It feeds on the bees' and the bee brood's blood, the so-called haemolymph,\" Papendieck explains. A third of bees killed in Germany Papendieck is an apiarist at the Bee Research Institute at the University of Bonn and he knows that the threat of mites is serious. If left untreated, varroa-infested colonies rarely survive a winter. In 2010, German beekeepers lost about 200,000 hives to the mite \u2013 one third of Germany's total bee population. And it is not just the honey and beeswax production that are affected by the mite. Many of our food crops depend on bees: Some 80 percent of all agricultural plants and 90 percent of fruit trees in Europe are pollinated by Apis mellifera, the European honeybee. Varroa introduced from Asia Had Dete Papendieck been a beekeeper forty years ago he would not have had to worry about mites. He says the varroa mite that was originally native to Asia, was introduced to Europe in the 1970s. \"It happened during a research project in which it was attempted to crossbreed the European honeybee with the Asian honeybee. The researchers were exchanging bee colonies between Europe and India, and that is how the mites came to Germany,\" Papendieck said. Unlike Asian bee species, the European honeybee cannot fight off the varoa mite by itself. According to Papendieck, bees easily transmit the mite to other beekeepers' hives in what apiarists call robbery. \"It happens when certain colonies are being robbed by other bees. Large numbers of bees from different colonies attack weak hives and steal their stocks. At the same time, parasites and diseases are exchanged\", he says. Researchers have been trying to breed varroa-resistant mites, but so far they haven't had much success. High-tech tools help fight the mite Klaus Maresch is also worried about his bees. He is an organic beekeeper from Bonn and he has been passionate about bees since he was a little boy. \"They are part of my family. When I open my hives and smell the honey and hear the buzzing of the bees it's like being in another world,\" he told Deutsche Welle. In addition to using formic acid to fight the mite, Klaus Maresch employs a high-tech tool \u2013 a special cylindrical scale that helps him determine when it is best to start the varroa treatment. \"Every day this hive scale sends data about the colonies to our server. The data, such as the temperature in the hive and the amounts of nectar and pollen collected, help me to find a good day to treat varroa,\" Maresch says. Maresch also makes the data about the activities in his hives available to fellow beekeepers who can treat their colonies accordingly. A driver's license for beekeepers? But it is not the mite that angers Maresch most. \"That's nature,\" he says, \"I feel angry about beekeepers who don't fight varroa. If the bees of neighboring beekeepers are infested, I also have a problem.\" The existing German pest regulation obliges beekeepers to treat their bees against varroa, but there are no strict controls. The majority of Germany's more-than-80,000 beekeepers are amateurs who keep between one and 20 colonies. This makes it difficult to impose and survey certain quality standards. Maresch, who sees himself as a kind of 'bee activist', would like to see the government introduce stricter rules. \"There should be a law that obliges every new beekeeper to learn about beekeeping before they are allowed to keep bees. They should get an education and there should be something like a driver's license for beekeepers,\" he says. In the mean time, Europe's bees are going to have to",
        "generated_story": "German beekeeper fights varoa mite with a high-tech hive scale German beekeepers are fighting a pest that has been spreading throughout Europe for over two decades. Dete Papendieck is one of the world's most successful honeybeekeepers. He was the first man to successfully fight the pest in Germany in the 1970s. In 2010, he was able to fight it with his bee hive, which he built in his garden in Bonn, Germany. Today, the hive is the largest in Europe, with more than 40,000 bees worldwide. \"It's a hive,\" he told Deutsche Welle in an interview published in July, \"and it's the only hive we've ever seen.\" The hive has become a popular tourist attraction, attracting tourists from Asia, Europe and Asia. It's also the most expensive hive on the planet, costing around \u20ac1.5 million (\u20ac2.6 million) a year, according to the Bee Research Institute (BRI), a German think-tank. The honeybees are also among the best-known for their honey-making skills. They're also very popular in India, where they're known as \"the honey bees.\" They've also been used in China, India and other Asian countries. But the bees are not as popular as they used to be, because they are more expensive to build and more difficult to maintain. This is because of their high cost of living and the fact that they have to spend a lot of time and effort to keep up with the demand for honey. That's why they've been so successful in their quest to find a new home for the honey bee. And that's partly because the beekeeping industry is becoming more sophisticated, as well as because more people are coming to Germany to work for them. So, in order to stay in touch with their customers, they need to make sure that their bees stay healthy, so they don't get bitten by the pests that are spreading across the globe. After all, there's only so much honey that can be made from honey, and honey is not enough for most people to afford to buy honey at the moment. What's more, honey isn't as expensive as honey as it once was, but it is still expensive and time-consuming to manufacture and sell honey for a very high price. Maresch and his wife, G\u00f6nna Ketels, have been married for forty years and have two children. Their son, Nathan Witkop, is also married to a woman from India. His wife and daughter have a son and a daughter. Both of them are now expecting their first child in a couple of years. A new honey hive will be built next year. There's no word yet on when it will open up, just that it won't be open until the summertime. If it opens up in September, it'll be ready by mid-summer. On the other hand, if it doesn't open by then, we'll probably never know for sure what will happen. We'll see what happens next. I'm not going to lie to you and tell you what I think about it. You can't tell me what's going on in my head. All I know is that I've got to do is keep my mouth shut and try not to think too much about what the future holds for me and my family. How long will it take me to get to where I want to go? I can only imagine what it might be like if I didn't have my honey and I had a honeycomb. Then, I'd like to know what kind of honey I'll get. Do you have any idea how long that will take? If so, let me know."

Brewers and wine makers across Europe, however, have come out against placing \"Drinking Kills\" or other labels on bottles of beer. \"Warning labels are the completely wrong way to go,\" Peter Hahn, head of the German Brewers Association told Germany's Express newspaper. \"The do not deter people who have lost a sense of how much to drink and unsettle the people who enjoy a beer after work.\" Industry groups also opposed implementing EU-wide guidelines in countries with traditionally different ways of approaching drinking and drinking problems. \"Policies that do not consider cultural and regional differences, will fail to deal with the social problems, while at the same time generate a rising level of political objections,\" said Rodolphe de Looz-Corswarem of Brewers of Europe.

The group's president, Markos Kyprianou, has said that alcohol consumption is \"increasingly becoming a problem in the European Union.\" The association's chief executive, Peter Liese, told Der Tagesspiegel that \"it is becoming increasingly difficult for young people to drink enough beer.\" \"It's becoming more and more difficult to get drunk,\" he said. \"We have to make sure that we don't over-indulge ourselves in alcohol.\" He added that he was \"very concerned\" about the impact of alcohol on the health and well-being of people who drink alcohol. In the autumn, the German Beer Association (BHA) announced that it would no longer be selling beer in Germany. According to the association, beer consumption has risen to 125 billion euros ($161 billion) since 2003, up from 161 billion in 2003. But it's not just the beer drinkers who are suffering from alcohol addiction. It's also the alcohol users who suffer from high blood pressure, which can lead to cirrhosis of liver and cancer. That's the main reason why people are drinking more beer than they used to, according to a study by the London Institute for Alcohol Studies (LIE). The study also found that drinking alcohol can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and stroke, and that the effects of cancer can also be felt by older people. This is the result of a lack of awareness among younger people about alcohol and its harmful effects on their health. A recent study published in a German magazine called \"The German Journal of Alcohol and Dietetics\" concluded that more than 80 percent of all alcohol-related deaths are caused by alcohol use. However, this is not the first time that this has been shown to be the case. There have been a number of cases in recent years in which alcohol abuse was linked to higher levels of smoking. One of those cases was in 2004, when a group of 16-year-olds died from a heart attack and a stroke. Another case involved a man who drank a glass of wine in his hotel room in Berlin. He died of an alcohol related illness in 2002. His wife, Hiltrud Breyer, was also a member of that group, but she died before he could reach the age of 18. She was diagnosed with liver cancer and died shortly after. Her husband, Rodolphe de Looz-Corswarem, is now a professor at the University of Berlin's School of Public Health. They have a son and two daughters. Both of them are now in their 20s. Their father is also an alcoholic and their mother is a nurse. And they are both alcoholics. So, they drink a lot of water and they have an unhealthy dependency on alcohol, as well as a tendency to binge on it. What do you think about this? What does it mean for your family? Do you have any idea what it means to have alcohol in your life? The answer is that you can't live without alcohol? I think that's a good question to ask yourself. You can only live with it for so long. How much alcohol does alcohol actually have in you? How many people drink? And how much does that affect your health? It doesn't matter if you're a teenager or 18, because alcohol is still a very important part of your daily life. Alcohol is an important component of life, so it affects your mental health, your physical and emotional well being. If you drink more alcohol than you normally would, then you are more likely to develop a bad case of depression, anxiety, depression and even suicidal tendencies. As a result, you will be more susceptible to alcohol poisoning, especially when it comes to your children and your partner's children."

        "target": "German Minister Urges Peace in Georgia's Separatist Regions German Foreign Minister Steinmeier has called for an end to the \"spiral of violence\" between the Georgian government in Tbilisi and its Russian-backed rebel regions and presented a three-stage plan to break the deadlock. Steinmeier issued the plea as he began a tour of the region to sponsor a new peace plan aimed at calming the simmering tensions over Georgia's separatist regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. \"This is my appeal to break out of the spiral of violence. A lack of dialogue is not an option for the future,\" he said after meeting with his Georgian counterpart Eka Tkeshelashvili. Steinmeier, who chairs the so-called Group of Friends of the United Nations' Secretary on Georgia, is proposing a three-phase peace plan based on a mutual declaration of non-violence and repatriation of about 25,000 ethnic Georgians expelled from Abkhazia in the 1990s. Negotiations over the status of the two rebel regions, which have enjoyed de facto autonomy since the end of a civil war in 1994, was reserved for the final phase of negotiations. Tkeshelashvili said, \"The plan has great potential for success,\" but added that the most difficult thing would be to convince Russia. Peace talks remain distant The threat of armed conflict in the region last month has given urgency to international pressure for renewed peace talks, but Tbilisi, Moscow and the Russian-backed regions remain far apart on the basic premises for restarting peace talks. Officials in Tbilisi oppose a treaty on the non-use of force without guarantees on the return of refugees and the withdrawal of Russian peacekeeping forces base in the region. Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was skeptical of peace efforts Thursday. \"Signing of a treaty on the return of Georgian refugees to Abkhazia is unreal now, because such a return requires a calm situation,\" Lavrov was quoted as saying by news agency RIA-Novosti. \"We think that signing a treaty on the non-use of force without any preconditions is an absolutely unavoidable first step,\" he added. Experts see little hope for Steinmeier's plan Analysts do not expect anything conclusive from Steinmeier's trip, pointing to intransigence on the part of the Abkhaz President Sergei Bagapsh, who said he would \"not consider the plan.\" \"We are not going to discuss Abkhazia's status with anyone. We are building an independent, democratic state,\" Bagapsh was quoted by Georgian news agencies as saying. Speaking to journalists ahead of the meetings Thursday, Steinmeier admitted: \"We don't have any illusions about simple answers, but we cannot stand by without acting on this conflict. That would be irresponsible.\" From Tbilisi, the German minister is to travel to the Black Sea city of Batumi for talks with Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili and then to Abkhazia on Friday before ending his three-day tour in Moscow. Most citizens of the breakaway republics have been issued Russian passports and over 2,500 Russian peacekeeping troops patrol the region under a UN ceasefire agreement. In opposition to Georgia's bid to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Russia moved to strengthen diplomatic ties with the breakaway regions sharply aggravating tensions with the Georgian leadership in recent months.",

The meeting, which is scheduled to take place in the Russian city of Batumi, is expected to be attended by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Georgian Prime Minister Mikhail Saakashov, as well as Russian President Vladimir Putin. \"We have agreed on a new plan,\" Lavrov said in an interview with RIA-Novosti, adding that he was \"very optimistic\" about the prospects for peace in South Ossetia, the former Soviet republic that was split between Russia and Georgia during the 1990s and 1994, when the Soviet Union withdrew from the region. He added that \"we are hopeful that we will be able to find a solution to the conflict between the two regions.\" \"I am very optimistic,\" he said, referring to his country's relations with Russia. Tensions between Georgia and Russia have been on the rise in recent years as a result of Russia's support for Georgia's independence from Russia in 1994. Russia, however, has yet to fully commit itself to a peace deal with Georgia. In a statement on Thursday, Russia said it would continue to support Georgia in its quest to reunify with its former self-styled Soviet allies. Moscow has also said that it will continue its support of Georgia as part of a \"new peace process\" with Moscow. However, Moscow is not ready to give up the fight against the separatists, and it is unclear how long the ceasefire will last. On the other hand, it seems unlikely that Georgia will allow the return of its ex-Soviet allies to their former territories. It is also not clear whether Russia would allow Georgia to return to its old self, or whether Moscow would be willing to allow it to resume negotiations with the separatist regions. A UN report released Thursday said Russia had \"no immediate plans\" to restart the negotiations, but that the talks were \"still in progress.\" The report said Moscow had no immediate comment on whether or not Moscow was interested in restarting negotiations."

        "target": "Maldives revokes state of emergency citing improved security situation The president of the Maldives has lifted a state of emergency following an outcry from the international community. The government says the measures are no longer necessary because the security threat has subsided. The government said Tuesday it had rescinded the emergency measures \"with immediate effect\" and that \"all fundamental rights that were suspended have been restored.\" President Yameen Abdul Gayoom declared the state of emergency one week ago after the discovery of a homemade bomb and a stash of weapons near his official residence. The finding followed an explosion on Gayoom's speedboat in September - an incident the government labeled an assassination attempt. The president was not hurt in the blast, but his wife, an aide and a bodyguard were injured. The emergency regulations, intended to be in place for 30 days, gave security forces wide-ranging search and arrest powers, and suspended citizens' basic rights. They drew criticism from former colonial power Britain as well as the United States, the European Union and neighboring Sri Lanka. Reading out a presidential decree revoking the emergency, Attorney General Mohamed Anil said there was no longer a threat to the Indian Ocean atoll nation. He said investigations into the September blast and the recovery of weapons had made good progress. The foreign ministry said a number of people had been arrested. Lawmakers also used the security regulations to fast-track the impeachment of Vice President Ahmed Adeeb, who stands accused of plotting the alleged attempts on the president's life. Impact on tourism Attorney General Anil said pressure from the international community, as well as \"the possible adverse impact on Maldives tourism and the economy,\" had also played a role in ending the state of emergency. Foreign tourists visiting the tropical nation, known for its luxury tourist resorts, palm-fringed beaches and coral reefs, contribute close to a third of the country's gross domestic product. The Maldives has had a rocky road to democracy since holding its first multiparty election in 2008. The country's first democratically elected leader, current opposition chief Mohamed Nasheed, was forced to step down in 2012 after a mutiny by security forces. In March, he was jailed for 13 years on terrorism charges in a trial the United Nations said was illegal. President Gayoom is under intense international pressure to release him. Nasheed's opposition Maldivian Democratic Party welcomed Tuesday's announcement. But said declaring the state of emergency in the first place was a political move designed to stop a rally planned for last week calling for Nasheed's freedom. \"It appears that Yameen is willing to make up threats about the nation's security in order to settle political scores,\" the party said in a statement, referring to the president. nm/kms (AP, AF, Reuters, dpa)",
        "generated_story": "Maldives lifts state of emergency after international criticism The Maldives has lifted an emergency declared by Prime Minister Yameen Abdul Gayoom. The move came a week after the Maldivian government announced that it would lift the ban on travel to the island nation for 30 days. A spokesman for the government said on Tuesday that the country had lifted the restrictions imposed by the United Nations, the European Union, Sri Lanka and Britain. \"We have lifted our ban,\" the spokesman, Ahmed Adeeb, told a news conference in the capital, Dhaka. He said the decision was made after a meeting between the prime minister and opposition leader Mohamed Nasheed, who has been in power for 13 years, and the president of the Democratic Party (DMP). \"It is the first time in a long time that we have been able to suspend travel,\" said Mohamed Anil, a member of parliament from the party's coalition government, which is currently in coalition with the ruling coalition. Maldavian authorities have said they will continue to monitor the situation, but they have not yet decided whether to impose a travel ban or not. They have also said that they would not impose travel restrictions on those who travel abroad for political reasons, such as political parties, religious groups or other political groups. On the other hand, opposition parties have called for an end to travel bans and other forms of violence against women and girls, including attacks on police stations, schools and hospitals, as well as the use of torture and sexual abuse of detainees. Gayom has denied the allegations, saying he did not have the authority to do so and that he was not aware of any plans to use force against his wife and children. In a statement released by his office late Tuesday, he said he had \"no idea\" what was going on in his home country. His office said it was \"deeply concerned\" about the impact on women's rights and human rights, adding that \"it is very important for women to have access to education and employment opportunities.\" The statement came one week ago, when the UN Security Council unanimously approved a resolution calling for a \"total and complete cessation of all travel, employment and economic activities\" to all foreign countries except for Sri Lankans. It was the second time since the end of a military dictatorship in March 2012 that a UN resolution had been adopted."

Clubs officials say talks are ongoing in the hope Max Meyer will extend his contract. Schalke might struggle to retain 22-year-old midfielder Max Meyer when his contract runs out at the end of the season, at least according to recent media interviews from the club's sporting director, Christian Heidel. Speaking to German news agency dpa, Heidel confirmed that Meyer turned down an offer of a contract extension earlier in February. \"Max Meyer's agent received an extension offer on January 12 with a deadline of February 15, and informed us on February 15 via email that Max would not be accepting the offer because of the deadline imposed,\" Heidel told dpa. \"We have acknowledged this. For now, we no longer feel beholden to the terms of that offer, but that doesn't mean an extension is impossible either.\" Meyer was reportedly offered an annual salary in the region of \u20ac5.5 million ($6.7 million); it was the second contract he refused, following a less lucrative offer at the end of last season.

Schalke offered improved terms in light of this development on the pitch. Heidel said this week that the club was still trying to convince the German to stay. \"At the moment we're still ready to talk,\" Heidel told this week's edition of football magazine Kicker, albeit stressing that time was of the essence. \"But we must and we will plan for the new season.\" In a separate newspaper interview Heidel was even more explicit, saying the club was not in a position to wait until summer for Meyer to make up his mind. Speaking to Sport Bild magazine, meanwhile, Heidel sought to focus on Meyer's more important role at Schalke, his regular game time, arguing it might be in the youngster's best interests to stay at a club that needs him every week. \"[Coach] Domenico Tedesco has formed the team around him in such a way that there is now an ideal spot for Max. That was not always the case,\" Heidel said. \"He needs to ask himself, putting the financial aspect to one side: 'Will I get such a position at a different club?'

The German coach said on Thursday that he was \"still ready\" to discuss the matter with his players. \"Max has a lot of work to do,\" he told Sport Bild, referring to the midfielder's contract extension. He added that the player would be available for \u20ac5.5 million in the end of the season, which would make him the highest-paid player in Germany's top flight. But he also said he would not rule out the possibility of signing a new contract with Bayern Munich, saying that it was up to him to decide whether or not he wanted to stay on at the helm of a club that has struggled to keep up with the pace of play. Meyer's future is unclear, but he is expected to make a decision on February 15, the day after his contract expires. It is not clear how long Meyer will stay at Bayern, although he has already made it clear he wants to stick around for the long-term. There is also the question of whether he will continue to play at a high level in his first season in charge. That is a question that will be answered by the board of directors on January 12, when the transfer deadline is set to expire. A move for Meyer could also be considered, he said, if the coach decides to move on from his role as the head coach of Bayern's youth side. However, it is still unclear how much Meyer would have to pay if he were to return to his former club, Stuttgart, for whom he spent the majority of his time last season as a player. In addition, Meyer has not yet made an official announcement about his future, according to sports journalist Domenico Tedesco. According to a source close to Meyer\u2019s camp, there is no indication that Meyer is interested in returning to Bayern after the summer transfer window closes. On the other hand, his agent, Leon Goretzka, told the German daily Kicker that his client had expressed his interest in joining the team. \u201cMax is the most important player for us,\u201d said the source, adding that there was a chance he could return in time for next season's Champions League qualifier against the likes of Dortmund. Max is one of several players who have expressed their desire to leave the Bundesliga side in order to focus on the next step of their careers, and that is to find a way to get back into the top-flight of German football. This could be a difficult task for him, as he faces the prospect of playing for Bayern in 2019. If he does not make the move, then he may not be able to compete for a starting spot in next year's World Cup in Russia. At the same time, Max will have the chance to prove himself to be the world's best defensive midfielder. After all, that's what he's been doing for so long. Last season was his best season so far and he still has plenty of time left to improve his game. So far this season he hasn't made any major breakthroughs in that regard. His contract is up for grabs, however, after he signed a deal with Bayer Leverkusen earlier in January."

Britain-EU divorce proceedings will probably last about two years. Until then, the status quo must be maintained, German Chancellor Angela Merkel emphasized in her press statement. If she is no longer chancellor after the upcoming parliamentary elections in 2017, then others will have to live with the consequences of Brexit. But that is not what she is actually thinking. It is not coincidental that foreign ministers and government leaders are visiting Berlin in the coming days. They want to discuss how things will continue. Berlin, under Merkel's chancellorship, has become a center of power outside of Brussels. Difficult international politics The Brexit decision has disrupted Europe's equilibrium. Germany has lost an important ally on European issues related to economic growth and budgetary discipline. Now, France presumably will be the next to raise its voice against Maastricht Treaty criteria. If the Netherlands and Denmark also decide to leave the EU, Germany will become isolated, as Eastern Europe is not as tight with Germany as it once was. Poland now plays a key role for the Balkan nations and the Visegrad Group (Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic and Slovakia). And Poland is still annoyed about Merkel's refugee policy. What about Germany's populists? They're giddy with glee as they feel that their anti-establishment policies have been validated. They are teaching potential AfD (Alternative for Germany) voters a lesson: \"Here, have a look: it's possible. There is always an alternative. Vote for us!\" Those are exactly the words that protest voters want to hear. Germany's AfD has forged ties with other right-wing parties in Vienna, Paris, The Hague and London. They are all pursuing a \"European\" plan to gain power. The recent Austrian presidential election was significant, as the populist candidate lost by a very narrow margin; in fact, the final election results are still undecided as they are being contested. The Brexit vote was also triggered by populist powers. Domestically difficult Many populists believe that the stronger populism becomes - no matter where - the more advantages there would be for individual parties of their persuasion. Many would also like to see Donald Trump as US president. That is how AfD may become even stronger in Germany, which also means that political majorities would fluctuate even more. Will there be enough seats after the next election for a Christian Democrat and Green coalition, or will yet another grand coalition made up of Christian Democrats and Social Democrats be formed? Can Angela Merkel change course? Can she counter the trend with a new political model in Europe and Germany? Or do we stand on the edge of a new era, a \"political revolution,\" as the AfD calls it? Until now, Europe has survived attacks on its currency (euro crisis), the principle of peaceful coexistence (Crimea crisis) and its open borders policy (refugee crisis). Merkel deserves credit for defending these values, despite mistakes that have been made along the way. The outcome of the Brexit crisis is, however, still open. Have something to say?

But she has yet to reach the point where she is willing to give up on the idea of a common European identity, she said. She also pointed to the fact that the German parliament has not yet ratified the Maastricht Treaty, which was signed by the US, Britain and EU in 2015. Merkel has also called for an end to EU membership talks, and said she would like to see the bloc expand to include other EU member states, such as Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and Slovakia. In addition, Merkel also wants to bring in a new European parliament, the Visegrad Group, to be set up to deal with issues of mutual interest to Germany and Europe.

It would also be a first step towards an EU-wide free trade zone, something Merkel said was necessary in order to avoid a \"total breakdown\" of relations between the two blocs. On the other hand, Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats have been calling for a more open and transparent approach to dealing with EU issues, as well as more transparency in how EU countries are governed and how they are managed in their dealings with each other. Germany has a lot to learn from Britain-EU relations, but it also has to keep in mind that it is not the only EU country that is at risk of falling into the same trap as the United States. For example, Germany is already at a crossroads in terms of its relations with Washington and Brussels. That's why it has chosen the Netherlands as its prime minister, rather than the UK as one of her main European allies. However, there is also the question of whether the Dutch government will follow through on its commitment to open up its borders to all EU members. There are also a number of other European countries, including the Czech Republic, Slovak Republic and Hungary that want to remain part of EU, that have also been excluded from the Schengen agreement. These are the countries that are at the center of European politics. And there are many other countries in Eastern Europe who are not at all interested in joining the Free Trade Agreement. One of them is Poland. Another is Hungary. A third is Romania. They have a strong position in eastern Europe, where they have the largest share of votes in parliament. Both of these countries have large populations of young people, with a population of more than 1.5 million. So far, they don't seem to have much to say about their position on EU policy."

        "target": "Reports: Merkel to run for fourth term as German chancellor German Chancellor Angela Merkel has confirmed that she will stand for the chancellery in the 2017 election, German media reports. The Christian Democrat Leader (CDU) first took office in 2005. After months of speculation, German Chancellor Angela Merkel reportedly told her fellow Christian Democrats (CDU) in Berlin on Sunday that she is prepared to lead the party into next year's election. An official statement is expected from Merkel at 7 p.m. local time (1800 UTC) on Sunday. The 62-year-old has faced a number of difficulties in recent months, from criticism over her handling of the migration crisis to falling support amid a rise in right-wing populist sentiment. Since taking office in 2005, however, Merkel has also been praised for navigating Europe's largest economy through the financial and eurozone crises. According to an Emnid survey published in the German newspaper \"Bild am Sonntag\" 55 percent of Germans are in favor of Merkel remaining head of the German government for another four years. Thirty-nine percent said they were against her re-election. Sign of stability Should she be elected next September, another full four-year term would put Merkel on a par with her mentor Helmut Kohl who set the post-war record and presided over the Fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. In light of the UK's shock vote to leave the European Union in June and Donald Trump's election last week as US president, Merkel's re-election is likely to be welcomed in many capitals as a sign of stability. During his final visit to Berlin this week, US President Barack Obama said that if he were able to, he would vote for his longtime partner and friend. In an interview with German magazine \"Spiegel\" and broadcaster \"ARD,\" Obama said: \"She has great credibility, and she is willing to fight for those values in a way that is very, very important.\" \"I'm glad that she's there and I think the German people should appreciate her. Certainly, I've appreciated her as a partner.\" Winning back votes With the less that a year until Germany heads to the polls, Merkel's CDU is now turning its efforts to wooing back disenchanted voters who have left the conservative camp to support the right-wing populists, Alternative for Germany (AfD). Formed as a Euro-sceptic party in 2013, the AfD won 4.7 percent of the popular vote in the last federal elections in 2013, just falling short of the 5 percent threshold required to enter the Bundestag - Germany's lower house of parliament. After benefiting from the rise in europsceptic, anti-immigration sentiment, seemingly sweeping across western Europe, the party now holds seats in nine of Germany's 16 states.",

The German newspaper Bild am Sonntag reported on Sunday that Merkel would seek a third term as chancellor. Merkel's conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) party is expected to win a majority in Sunday's parliamentary election, which will be held at 1800 UTC local time (1800 UTC). The CDU party, led by Helmut Kohl, is seeking a fifth term, while the conservative Alternative for Germany (AfD), a coalition of conservative parties, the Greens and the Social Democrats, will seek another four years in office. Chancellor Merkel, who was first elected in 2005 to a four-year term of office, faces a tough task in her bid to return to power in 2017. \"I'm not going to give up,\" Merkel said in an interview published Sunday, adding that she was \"very happy\" with the results of the election. She also said she would not accept a second term for her party's coalition partner, Christian Democratic Union (DU), which has been in power since 2005. German media reported that the AfD party had won the most votes of any party in parliament this year, with a total of 12 percent of votes cast. In a statement, Merkel called on the opposition to back her conservative coalition partners, including the SPD and Greens, in order to strengthen its grip on power after the September 11 attacks. A spokesman for the party said Merkel had \"no plans to step down from her position as Chancellor\" and that it would be up to the voters to decide on her successor. Germany's parliament is due to reconvene at 7 p.m. (1700 UTC) in a special session of parliament to elect a new speaker. It is not yet clear whether Merkel will run again, or whether she will stick to her traditional conservative stance. On Sunday evening, German tabloid Bild reported the chancellor's campaign team had already announced that they would run a candidate for chancellor in next year's elections."

        "target": "NFL stars defy Donald Trump's call for boycott Baltimore Ravens and Jacksonsville Jaguars players \"took a knee\" during the national anthem after Trump urged fans to boycott football matches. The kneeling protest, to highlight social injustice, has stepped up a gear. Hundreds of National Football League (NFL) stars protested President Donald Trump's call for fans to boycott the league by refusing to stand for the US national anthem this weekend, starting Sunday's game between the Baltimore Ravens and Jacksonsville Jaguars. A number of other players locked arms in solidarity ahead of the game at Wembley Stadium in London. Jacksonville Jaguars' owner Shahid Khan, who last year donated one million dollars\u00a0(840,000 euros) to the Trump campaign, locked his arms with players - a rare scene, as owners almost never take to the field. US media reported that about 200 players on Sunday sat, knelt or raised their fists in defiance of Trump's comments. In one of the most memorable moments, singer Rico LaVelle took a knee and held up a fist at the last line of the Star Spangled Banner ahead of the game between the Detriot Lions and Atlanta Falcons. The protest came in response to Trump's tweets on Sunday morning urging fans to boycott NFL games to pressure the league into firing or suspending players to kneel in protest during the national anthem. In an early morning tweet, Trump posted: \"If NFL fans refuse to go to games until players stop disrespecting our Flag and Country, you will see change take place fast. Fire or suspend!\" \"NFL attendance and ratings are WAY DOWN. Boring games yes, but many stay away because they love our country. League should back US,\" he added. Later, the president said that his rant \"has nothing to do with race,\" despite the fact that the origins of the protest are to do with police brutality against minorities, especially African Americans. Trump said his comments were instead about \"respect for our country and respect for our flag.\" Trump's spat with US professional sports began at a Republican rally in Alabama on Friday, when the president attacked activist NFL players for kneeling or sitting during the national anthem, labelling them as \"sons of bitches.\" \"Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, 'Get that son of a bitch off the field right now... he is fired'?\" Trump told a crowd of cheering supporters. That day, basketball star Stephen Curry, the top player for California's Golden State Warriors, announced that he would not be attending a traditional White House reception honoring the National Basketball Association champions. The kneeling protest was started by former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick who refused to stand for the anthem back in 2016. Kaepernick's gesture came amid a spate of deadly police shootings of black men and was aimed at drawing more attention to treatment of minorities in the US. However, Kaepernick has since become a free agent, after failing to be signed by a new team for the new NFL season. NFL executives decry Trump's calls Trump also drew the ire of senior NFL executives and team owners. Responding to Trump's tweets, Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti, said he \"100 percent\" supported his players' decision to kneel during the anthem. Robert Kraft, the owner of the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots, who is also a close friend of Trump, said in a statement on Sunday that he was deeply disappointed by the president's comments in Alabama. Kraft defended players' rights to \"peacefully affect social change and raise awareness in a manner that they feel is most impactful,\" and said that sports were a unifying force in the US. \"Our political leaders could learn a lot from the lessons of teamwork and working together toward a common goal,\" he said. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, who has taken much of the heat for Kaepernick's failure to find a new team, was also quick to condemn Trump's comments.

On Friday, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said the league's players should stand in solidarity with the flag-waving protesters. The president also called for a boycott of Sunday's Super Bowl between the New England Patriots and the Los Angeles Rams. Trump's comments sparked online controversy on Friday when he said NFL owners should not be allowed to sanction players for kneeling during the playing of the National Anthem. That day, the NFL announced that it would not sanction any player who kneels in protest. \"The NFL is going to do everything in its power to protect our flag and our anthem,\" Trump said in a statement on Twitter. NFL owner Robert Kraft said on Saturday that he was \"deeply concerned\" by the president's remarks. He also said he would be \"very disappointed\" if the team did not comply with NFL rules and regulations. In a tweet on Sunday, Trump also accused the Ravens of playing \"incompetent football\" and \"playing in the wrong country.\" The NFL's executive director of football operations, Steve Bisciotti, called the comments \"disgraceful,\" adding that \"the NFL should be doing everything it can to make sure that our players are playing with dignity and respect for our country, and that we have the right to protest peacefully and peacefully.\" In addition to the criticism of Goodell, a number of other NFL executives have also expressed concern about the Trump administration's stance on racial inequality and police brutality. One of them, former NFL general manager and chairman of NFL executive committee chairman, Stephen Curry, has been accused of politicizing the issue. His comments came after the White House released a report saying that Trump had directed his campaign team to \"determine\" whether or not to fire the head of a police officer who had been fired by President Barack Obama last month over his comments on social media. Some of those comments were interpreted as an attack on President Trump, who has repeatedly criticized Trump for his treatment of African-Americans and his support of police officers who have been charged with racial profiling and other offenses. Other NFL officials have said they are not aware of any such allegations and have not commented on the reports."

Greece had previously voiced reservations about the proposal. The proposed mission to be discussed at a NATO defense ministers meeting in Brussels on Thursday comes days after German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutolgu said they would raise the issue of refugees with the Alliance. According to a Reuters report citing a senior German official, initially reticent Greece has now given the green light for the operation, which could see NATO assets deployed in the Aegean in a mostly intelligence and reconnaissance role. Under the proposal, which would need to be approved by Alliance members, NATO maritime assets would provide information to national coastguards and the EU border agency Frontex to combat illegal smugglers using rickety boats to bring migrants to Europe. Turkey would then take back the refugees, as envisioned as part of a 3 billion-euro ($3.2 billion) EU-Turkey deal agreed to last year. According to German sources, the mission would not be similar to the NATO mission in the Mediterranean intercepting migrant boats making the dangerous run from Libya to Italy. However, NATO ships could intervene in emergency situations to save passengers. \"It is not NATO's remit to push back or stop refugee boats,\" the official told Reuters. The mission would use assets from the Alliance's standing naval group, a permanent reaction force deployed in the Mediterranean. The naval group's current flagship is the German combat support ship \"Bonn.\" Denmark has already said it would provide additional ships to the mission, according to the official. However, it is unclear whether NATO members will approve the mission which may fall outside the bounds of the Alliance's mandate. Complicating matters is a long-running maritime dispute between Greece and Turkey over sovereignty in the Aegean, where the two NATO members' jets regularly engage in dogfights. Turkey has taken in more than 2.5 million Syrian refugees, and is a major transit point for migrants from Asia and Africa. More than a million migrants and refugees reached Europe last year, many making the dangerous boat journey from Turkey to Greece by boat. So far this year, more than 340 have perished in the cold waters trying to reach Europe. cw/msh (AFP, dpa, Reuters)",

        "target": "A borderline war The crisis in Syria is in danger of drawing in neighboring countries. Despite the Syrian government's immediate apology, the shelling on the Turkish border has led to concerns about possible escalation. These weren't the first incidents on the Syrian-Turkish border, but the fact that several people on the Turkish side were killed by Syrian shells on Wednesday (03.10.2012) has brought the conflict between the two countries to a new level. It has led the Turkish military to retaliate for the first time. Several people were killed when Turkey shelled Syrian territory. But neither Turkey, which is a member of NATO, nor Syria would benefit from a broader conflict. An adviser to the Turkish president tweeted, \"Turkey has no interest in a war with Syria.\" Volker Perthes, director of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs in Berlin, agrees: \"Assad has no interest in an escalation,\" he told DW. \"That can be seen from the fact that the Syrian information minister apologized and expressed his regret over the victims immediately after the attack on Turkish territory.\" Perthes doesn't think it's likely that the Syrian President, Bashar Assad, wants to provoke Turkey to intervene in Syria. \"That would only accelerate the fall of his regime,\" he said. It's not yet clear who was responsible for the shelling. According to Syria's ally, Russia, it was a \"tragic accident.\" Relationship damaged The armed incidents on the Syrian-Turkish border have been going on for months. According to Amnesty International, some 300,000 Syrians have left their country since the start of the uprising against Assad, and many of them have fled to Turkey. The relationship between the two countries, which used to be close, has deteriorated dramatically, and the Turkish government is now openly supporting the Syrian opposition. \"Turkey is itself a player in the Syrian conflict,\" said Perthes. \"It provides shelter for many refugees and it's through Turkey that supplies come for the opposition.\" NATO has lined up behind Turkey and told Syria to end its \"flagrant violations of international law.\" Call for 'great discretion' The German chancellor, Angel Merkel, has also positioned herself alongside Turkey. \"We call on all parties to show great discretion,\" she said in Berlin. The foreign minister, Guido Westerwelle, declared that everything must be done to deescalate the situation, so that the Syrian conflict did not turn into a conflagration in the region. Indeed, the Syrian crisis is not only spreading to Turkey, but also to Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon. According to Perthes, \"The neighboring countries are partly victims and partly instigators. Jordan too has taken in refugees and supplies the rebels. On the other hand, Iraq has tended to support the government of Bashar Assad.\" Even so, he said, all the neighboring countries had an interest in ensuring the conflict was confined to Syria. Appeal to the international community But the number of Syrian refugees is rising by the day. Ruth J\u00fcttner, a Middle East expert with Amnesty International, believes this will continue in future months. \"It's important that the countries bordering on Syria are supported by the international community in providing accommodation, medical and psychological care and schooling for children,\" she told DW. It's an appeal she directs especially to European countries. The shelling on the Syrian-Turkish border has made it more likely that there will be armed conflict between Syria and its neighbors. According to Perthes, \"It's probably the case that political resistance in Turkey to intervention in Syria is decreasing right now.\"",

He added that the Turkish military had \"no intention of giving up\" on Syria, adding that \"the Syrian regime will continue to fight\" in the event of an escalation of violence. However, he added, \"it will take time\" for Turkey to make a decision on how to respond to a conflict that has already killed more than 1.5 million people and displaced tens of thousands of others. Pirthes' comments came as the head of Germany's foreign affairs department, Guido Westerwelle, said that Ankara's decision to step up its support to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad did not reflect the reality of the situation and that it was unlikely that Assad would be able to win back the support of his own people. On the contrary, the president said he was \"very happy\" with the results of Wednesday's meeting with Assad and his government, which he described as a \"positive step.\" \"I'm very happy that we're moving towards the end of this conflict,\" the chancellor said, referring to Assad's regime's ability to control the region. But he also pointed out that there is still a long way to go in terms of how Turkey will respond if Assad is allowed to return to power, as he has been doing for months now.

Despite not attending the UN-brokered meeting, the militias have agreed to \"a ceasefire on all fronts,\" according to a statement issued by Islamist group Fajr Libya (Libya Dawn). The only condition is that \"the other parties respect the truce.\" The announcement came hours after the United Nations declared that Libya's warring factions had agreed to a roadmap for forming a unity government. Nearly four years after a NATO-backed revolt saw Moammar Gadhafi removed from power, two rival governments each backed by different groups of militias have plunged the country back into chaos and threatened all-out civil war. After the elected government of Prime Minister Abdullah al-Thinni was forced out of Tripoli by Libya Dawn, it was forced to move to the far eastern city of Tobruk while Libya Dawn reinstated the old parliament known as the GNC. The fighting and violence has displaced hundreds of thousands of civilians, left hundreds killed and thousands wounded. Most foreign diplomats fled the country and shut their embassies last year.

Libya Dawn, a pro-regime news website, reported that the ceasefire was reached after hours of fighting between rival groups in Tripoli and Benghazi. It was the first ceasefire since the war broke out in 2011, and it was followed by a second round of talks on Saturday. Both sides said they had agreed on the terms of an end to the conflict, which lasted for more than two and a half hours. \"We have agreed that we will continue the peace process,\" said Abdullah al-Thinni, spokesman for the Libyan National Council (GNC), a group of opposition groups that have been fighting for years to restore the former president's power. In a statement released Friday, Libyan state television said the talks had reached a truce, but that it could not be reached until the new president was sworn into office on Sunday. Libyan officials have said that they have not yet decided on a date for a new presidential election. They have yet to decide on an exact date, although they are expected to announce the date within the next 24 hours, according to a source close to them.

The 62-year-old appeals to similar sentiments as the right-wing party's base: concern about foreign domination and loss of identity, fear of terrorism and crime. \"For a long time, FN was the only political force that addressed those fears,\" said Henrik Uterwedde of the German-French Institute (dfi) in Ludwigsburg. \"Now a politician has arrived on the scene who addresses those fears using a different language and makes them a political offer.\" In rural, Catholic France especially, where traditions still matter a great deal, the avowed Catholic Fillon strikes a chord with his proposals pertaining to family and society policies. He receives support from traditional Catholic groups who, for years, have been able to mobilize crowds for demonstrations against gay marriage. During the intraparty election campaign, Fillon predominantly traveled to France's villages and small towns - regions which FN leader Marine Le Pen had labeled the \"forgotten France,\" regarding herself as their foremost lobbyist. \"Fillon has made gains in an environment that is also canvassed by Le Pen,\" Andreas Jung, Chairman of the Bundestag's German-French parliamentary group, told German broadcaster rbb-Inforadio. \"He does not represent the lofty levels of Parisian politics, but rather provincial entrenchment. Fillon is committed to traditional values, like the family. Therefore, he may not only be capable of defeating Le Pen, but also of taking the lead during the first ballot.\" 'Most dangerous candidate for FN' Consequently, the FN camp is less than enthusiastic about the conservative's candidacy. \"Because of Fillon, we now have a strategy problem,\" Marion Marechal Le Pen, the FN leader's niece, recently told journalists. \"He is the most dangerous candidate for the National Front.\" Pollsters' findings appear to support that statement. Recent surveys establish Fillon as the current favorite in the French presidential election scheduled for next May. However, Fillon's election is not a foregone conclusion. By denouncing the conservative candidate as a member of the establishment, FN tries to win over those who are frustrated with politics and politicians in general. There is persistent opposition against his economic-liberal plans in particular. Fillon wants to abolish the 35-hour working week and raise the retirement age to 65 years. In addition, he wants to cut 500,000 jobs in the public sector and reform industrial law. Fillon is known as an admirer of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. \"Issues pertaining to liberal economic policy have always been heavily contested in France,\" said Uterwedde. \"Fillon's adversaries have already taken up their positions, criticizing what, in France, is called 'ultra-liberalism.'\" That was one of the nastiest words in French politics, he added. An offer for the left Fillon wants to raise VAT by 2 percent. This would predominantly hurt low-income households. Exactly that clientele, however, is wooed by FN with a program that is regarded as rather left-wing. The right-wing extremists are on a clear anti-globalization course, intending to seal off the French economy against foreign countries and exit from the European Union. The party is already trying to present Fillon as a symbol of anarchic, ultra-liberal capitalism. \"Francois Fillon will even go beyond EU demands for austerity and liberalism,\" David Rachline, Marine Le Pen's election campaign manager, wrote on Twitter. According to current polls, it is very likely that Fillon will have to face Marine Le Pen in a runoff election in May. The main hazard for the Republican candidate: his economic-liberal course could deter left-wing voters from choosing the conservative in order to avert Le Pen. \"Francois Fillon will have to start making offers, also to those voters who are closer to the center and more moderate,\" said France expert Uterwedde. \"And he will, prior to the runoff election at the latest, have to make offers to left-wing voters - without changing his original course.\"",
        "generated_story": "French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen is the most dangerous candidate for the French presidential election, according to the German-French Institute of Politics (Dfi). Fillon, who is running for president in May, is one of the least dangerous candidates for France's top two presidential elections. The \"French National Front\" (FN) candidate has the highest approval rating of any candidate in the country's history. It is also the second-largest party in French politics, after the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) and the conservative Christian Democratic Party (CDU). The FN's candidate, Henrik Uterwedde, a professor of political science at the University of Ludwigsburg in Germany, said the FN candidate had the lowest approval ratings among the candidates. \"It is not a question of whether or not the candidate will be able to win the election,\" he said, adding that he was \"very confident\" in his ability to defeat the right-wing candidate. He also said he would be willing to work with the \"right-left\" candidate if he could win a majority of votes in a runoff election. In the long run, he will have to rely on the support of his own party, the Christian Democrats (FDP), to get him through the first round of voting. But he has a lot of work to do before he can do it again. On the other hand, it's not just his party that is in danger of losing the vote. His party has been in power for 65 years, and he's the only one who has managed to keep it together. That's why he is so popular in France, even though he doesn't have the votes to run for a second term in office. And he won't be the last candidate to have a chance at a third term. After all, his chances of becoming prime minister are very low. If he does win, then he'll have no chance of making it into the next round, which is expected to take place in early May. What do you think? What does it mean to be a leader of a political party? Do you have any idea what it means to stand for? I don't know. I'm not sure, but I think that's a good question. You can't just say that you're going to vote for someone who's got the same views as you do the rest of us. There's no way to know for sure. How long will it take for him to make it to a final round? He's already been through a number of rounds of interviews, including one with David Rachline and another with Andreas Jung of rbb-Inforadio, both of whom are also a member of dfi's editorial board. They're all very good candidates, they're both very well-known in their own right and they both have very different views on politics. One thing is for certain: they are both quite different from each other. Both of them have different ideas on how to deal with political issues. For example, one is that if you are a Christian, you can be an anti-Semite. Another is a pro-EU candidate who believes that the EU is an enemy of freedom and democracy. This is something that can only be solved by a united front. So, what does that mean for you? Well, let me tell you what I would say to you: You've got to give me a clear answer on that. Let me give you an example: I'd like to hear from you about what you've been doing in your own country. Then let's talk about your country and what's going on in other countries. We'll see how you feel about the situation in this country, because I know you'll be voting for your party next time around. Don't get me started on this one, right? Let's see if I can convince you that I'll do that, too."

        "target": "Berlin court rules Google Street View is legal in Germany A Berlin court has ruled that Google Street View is legal. But that doesn't mean the lawsuits will end, legal scholars say. A Berlin court has ruled that Google Street View is, in fact, legal in Germany. Last Tuesday, the Berlin State Supreme Court (Kammergericht) announced its decision in a court case from late last year, in which a woman had sued Google, fearing that photos of her, her family and the front of her house would be posted on Google Street View and would thus violate her property and privacy rights. The court ruled that it is legal to take photographs from street level, rejecting her argument that Google was trying to take unauthorized pictures. Part of her argument rested on the fact that Google used cameras mounted at three meters (9.84 feet) high, which could see over her two-meter-high hedge. However, the court did not find this argument convincing, given that the photographs were taken from the street, and not the sidewalk. Furthermore, because Google automatically blurs faces and license plates and did allow Germans to opt-out of the service to have their house obfuscated as well, the court did not find any potential violations. This is the first high-level court ruling, which cannot be appealed any further, regarding Street View since the service debuted in Germany at the end of last year. An ongoing debate Since Google announced plans to launch Street View in Germany last summer, debate around the service has become heated, with some politicians trying to stop it at every turn, while German Chancellor Angela Merkel famously said that she would not remove her house from Street View. In November 2010, the company announced that 244,000 German residents in the 20 cities had chosen to opt out of Street View - less than three percent of residents. However, in Germany and everywhere else, the company also allows people to report abuse, inaccuracies or request that something be blurred using an online tool. \"Our job is to develop services that respect these cultural differences,\" Peter Fleischer, Google's global privacy counsel told Deutsche Welle in November 2010. \"We try to anticipate them. We're all internationally-minded people ourselves. We try to guess how people will react to them. But a lot of these services are new and have never been on the market before, so we learn and we adapt as we go along.\" A 'landmark decision' European legal experts called the Berlin ruling a \"landmark decision,\" saying that this would now become part of German case law regarding property rights. \"Yes, other people are now warned: Don't sue Google simply claiming that Google Street View violates personality [or] property rights,\" wrote Thomas H\u00f6ren, a professor of media and communications law at the University of M\u00fcnster, in an e-mail sent to Deutsche Welle. But, he also warned that this decision was very narrow, focusing on the issue of property rights, and not on the larger issues of data protection from Google. \"The problem of Google Street View - to be honest - has never been a problem of personality rights or property rights, but the enormous risk of personal data compilations in cases where people use Google Street View for compiling personal profiles (such as building insurance companies; future employees, et cetera),\" he added. \"And this risk has not been considered by the Berlin courts.\" Similarly, Viktor Mayer-Sch\u00f6nberger, a professor at the Oxford Internet Institute, agreed that this case was \"limited in scope,\" adding in an e-mail, \"The plaintiff never alleged an actual invasion of privacy, just a potential one.\" Author: Cyrus Farivar Editor: Nancy Isenson",
        "generated_story": "Germany's Landmark Decision On Google Street View A landmark decision has been made in Germany. The German state Supreme Court has made a landmark ruling on the use of Google street view in the country. It's the first time a German court has ruled in favor of street-view technology. In November 2010, Germany's highest court, the German parliament, made the decision to allow the technology to be used in public and private sectors of the economy. That decision came at the end of last year, and the court's decision is the latest in a series of landmark decisions that have led to a new era of high-tech innovation. On the other hand, it's not clear whether the new technology will have the same impact as the old technology, or whether it will be applied to public sectors as well as private sector sectors. \"I don't know,\" said Thomas H\u00f6ren, a professor of computer science at Berlin's Kammergericht university, referring to Google's Internet of Things (IoT) division. He added that it would be a \"significant step forward\" for the company in terms of its ability to make its products more accessible to the public. Google has said it won't make the changes to its platform, which it hopes will make it easier for people to get information about their lives online. But it has also said that Google will continue to push the boundaries of what it can do online and in real-time. According to Peter Fleischer, head of research and development at Google, there are currently more than 1.5 million people who use the platform every day. This is a significant increase from the number of people using the service in November 2011, when it was first available to those who didn't have access to it. More than 2,000 people use it on a daily basis, according to data compiled by the Oxford Internet Institute (U of M\u00fcnster). The decision comes at a time when many people are looking for a way out of their daily lives. Some of these people have been living in Berlin for years, while others have moved on to other cities, such as New York, Los Angeles, Berlin, Paris, Munich, Frankfurt, Hamburg, K\u00f6ln and Berlin. Many of them are familiar with the city's streets, but they have never been able to find a place to live in their own neighborhoods. They have no idea what the future holds for them. There is no way to know for sure what will happen to them when they get to their next destination. What will they do? They are going to have to wait until they find out for themselves. And then they will see if they can make a decision on whether or not they want to do that. So far, they haven't made any big decisions on that front. I think they are making a lot of progress in that regard. You can read more about that here. Read more: Google and Google have a great deal to say about the issue here, here and here Google is making some big moves in Europe, including a move to open up the world's largest online marketplace to more people. How will this affect the lives of millions of Germans? What do you think about this decision? The answer is still unclear. Do you agree with me? I'm not sure, because I've never heard of any other decision that's made by a court of law that would allow Google to move forward with this kind of technology? But I do think it is very important to me that I can say that this is something that can be done in other areas of society. For example, if Google decides to change the way it does business, then that could be good news for Germany and other European countries. However, that doesn't necessarily mean that Germany will follow the example of other countries, like the United States, where the Internet is becoming more and more ubiquitous. If Google does not change its stance on this issue, what is it doing? That's a good question for us to ask ourselves. We can't wait to see what happens next. Let's see how it all plays out."

        "target": "UK lawmakers propose jail sentences for reckless bankers A British parliamentary commission has completed its work on the overhaul of the domestic banking sector. Among other things, it proposed jail terms for bankers displaying grave malpractice and causing huge damage. Members of the UK's Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards agreed Wednesday that Britain needed a radical overhaul of its scandal-hit lenders. The panel, which was mostly composed of lawmakers, concluded in its final report that senior bankers must be made personally responsible for malpractice through the introduction of a new criminal offence of reckless misconduct. It would carry a prison sentence. The reputation of the country's banking sector had been damaged in recent years by a string of scandals, including Libor rate-rigging, credit insurance mis-selling and a controversy over staff behavior and bonuses in the run-up to the 2008 global financial crisis. The level of malpractice had been \"shocking and widespread,\" said the commission's chairman, Conservative party lawmaker Andrew Tyrie. RBS cut in two? \"Taxpayers and customers have lost out, and the economy has suffered,\" the 500-page report said. \"Under our recommendations, senior bankers who seriously damage their banks or put taxpayers' money at risk can expect to be fined, banned from the industry or in the worst cases go to jail.\" The commission called for bankers to sign up to a new code of conduct under which all key responsibilities within a bank would be assigned to specific senior officials who would be held responsible. The panel also proposed that more remuneration for bankers should be deferred for longer periods of up to ten years in order to \"reflect the longer run balance between business risks and rewards.\" The commission recommended that the government consider splitting the state-rescued Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) into a good bank and a bad one mopping up toxic assets. The report was published ahead of a key speech by Finance Minister George Osborne on his bank reform plans. hg/ipj (AFP, Reuters)",
        "generated_story": "Reprehensibility of Bank Mafia: A British Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards (PBS) has released a report on the banking industry. The report, published on Wednesday, said that the bank mafia was responsible for the financial crisis in the UK. PBS, Royal Bank of Scotland and RBS are among the biggest banks in Britain, according to the report by the British parliamentary commission on banking standards, which was commissioned by George Osborne and Andrew Tyrie, the finance minister, in 2008. It was the first time that a bank had been found guilty of financial crimes. \"It's not just the banks that are guilty, it's the entire banking system,\" the commission said in a statement, adding that it was \"deeply concerned\" about the allegations. A spokesman for Barclays said the inquiry was looking into allegations of bank fraud and corruption, and that banks were \"extremely concerned about their own financial stability.\" The commission's report is expected to be released on Thursday, ahead of a parliamentary vote on whether to allow banks to continue to charge interest rates on deposits, loans and other financial products, as well as whether banks should be allowed to do so under the new rules. BBS is one of the world's largest banks, with a market capitalization of more than $1 trillion. But it is not the only bank that has been accused of banking fraud. In 2008, Britain's financial markets collapsed, leading to a global recession and the collapse of many financial institutions, including banks such as Barclays, HSBC and Lloyds. This was followed up by a series of scandals over the past decade and a half. At the same time, there was an explosion of speculation about whether the country's banks would be able to cope with the rising cost of living. Some analysts believe that this could be the case, but others say that there is no evidence to back up this claim. Financial markets have become more complex in recent years and banks are becoming more and more dependent on one another for their profits. That has led to an increase in speculation and speculation that they may have been involved in financial crime. And it has caused a lot of concern among investors, who are increasingly skeptical of banks' ability to compete with each other, especially when it comes to lending rates. These fears have also been exacerbated by an increasing number of high-profile scandals and scandals in banking, finance and finance. One example of this is the HSBC scandal in 2007, when the company's chief executive was convicted and sentenced to up to ten years in prison for failing to disclose the extent of his role in setting up a fraudulent bank. Another was in 2009 when he pleaded guilty to fraud in an attempt to defraud the government of millions of pounds ($4.6 billion) by manipulating Libor, a benchmark interest rate that was later reduced to 0.5 percent."

But a leading think tank has warned against giving raises too soon. Germany's foreign minister and deputy chancellor, Guido Westerwelle, has added his support to comments made by Economics Minster Rainer Bruederle about increased wages for German workers. \"When the economy grows and this growth is substantial and sustainable, then the benefits of this upswing should be felt by the people who worked so hard for it,\" Westerwelle told the Hamburger Abendblatt newspaper in an interview. Westerwelle heads the free-market liberal FDP, which shares power with Chancellor Merkel's Christian coalition. Earlier this week, Bruederle, also an FDP member, said in light of Germany's currently growing economy, those economic gains should trickle down to employees in the form of higher wages. Merkel, who is also the head of the Christian Democratic Union, supported Bruederle's idea. \"That is something the chancellor sees the same way, letter for letter,\" said Merkel's spokesman, Steffen Seibert. Not so fast Earlier this week, analysts predicted growth of 3.5 percent this year and 2 percent in 2011. Germany's five leading economic think tanks also predicted that the number of unemployed would fall below 3 million next year, the lowest level since 1992. Despite the current rosy outlook for the German economy, not everyone is convinced that a growing economy should inevitably lead to higher wages. The president of the German Institute for Economic Research, Klaus Zimmermann, warned against reacting too quickly. \"I can't support the idea of a general wage increase, I think it is too dangerous,\" Zimmermann said in an interview with the Handelsblatt newspaper. Zimmermann wasn't opposed to the idea of raising wages, but said he was against across-the-board increases for all sectors and pointed out that not every industry is benefitting the same from the growing economy. \"We can't forget that the German economy did not resort to mass lay-offs when it wasn't going so well last year,\" Zimmermann said. Raising wages in some branches could be a good idea, Zimmermann said, as that would make those branches more attractive option to potential workers from outside of Germany.

The chancellor's deputy, Guido Westerwelle, has called for an increase in Germany's minimum wage to $7.25 an hour. Earlier this week, the German Institute for Economic Research (Hamburger Abendblatt) published a report calling for the government to increase the wage of workers by 25 percent to \u20ac8.75 an hourly wage. \"This is a radical step in the right direction for Germany,\" said the institute's head of economic research, Rainer Bruederle, in an interview published on Thursday. He added that the chancellor was \"deeply concerned\" by the rise in German wages, and that it would be \"unacceptable\" for a chancellor to raise wages by that much. According to the report, \"the chancellor is deeply concerned about the level of wage increases and the long-term impact on the country's economy.\" The report also said that in order to tackle the rising costs of living in low-wage countries, it was necessary to introduce a \"general wage increase\" of up to 50 percent. In a statement released on Friday, Merkel said she would not support such a move, adding that \"it is not possible to go against the wishes of Chancellor Merkel and her party.\" \"The chancellor has made it clear that she will not stand for this,\" the FDP's Steffen Seibert, who chairs the parliamentary finance committee, told Reuters news agency. Bewildering the idea of raising wages for workers is one of the main reasons why the Chancellor's conservative Christian Democratic Union (FDP) party has been unable to win a majority in parliament this year. It is also the party's main opposition to higher wages. On the other hand, conservatives have been pushing for higher minimum wages in recent years, arguing that lower wages are the only way to boost the economy. They have also argued that higher wage levels are necessary for economic growth, which they see as a key factor in boosting the competitiveness of German companies. This has led to a surge in unemployment among young people, as well as higher prices for goods and services such as food, clothing and home appliances. A recent poll showed that more than 40 percent of Germans believe that wages should be increased, compared to 30 percent in 2011. But the poll also found that a quarter of those surveyed said they were satisfied with the results of a survey conducted by economists at the University of Hamburg in Hamburg. That is, they said, despite the fact that most of them did not think the survey was a good predictor of future economic performance. However, some economists said this was not the case, saying that there was no evidence to suggest that unemployment was actually higher than it is now. Author: Sean Sinico Editor: Matt Zuvela"

Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko was sworn into office on Friday in a lavish ceremony boycotted by Western diplomats. The previous day, the 56-year-old leader openly accused Germany and neighboring Poland of planning a coup against him. \"There were [in Germany and Poland] plans worked out for an overthrow of the constitutional order,\" Lukashenko said in the Belarusian capital, Minsk, on Thursday. \"This is not an invention of our intelligence agencies.\" Lukashenko, who came to power in 1994, was re-elected last month with 80 percent of the vote in what the opposition and international monitors said was a rigged election. Relations between the reclusive Belarusian government and the West have been strained ever since. 'Belarus question must be answered' German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said in a statement that the accusations were \"baseless\" and an attempt by Lukashenko to draw attention away from his own wrongdoing. \"The EU needs to find a clear political answer to events surrounding the presidential election and the continued incarceration of opposition politicians and their supporters,\" Westerwelle said. A wide-reaching crackdown against the regime's opponents followed Lukashenko's re-election. Hundreds of his critics were arrested and dozens threatened with long-term jail sentences. Poland also dismissed the accusations as absurd and said that relations with Minsk would not be normalized unless all political prisoners were released. Sanctions threat The situation in Belarus pushed the European Union to adopt a resolution on Thursday in support of economic sanctions against the country. The threats earned a sharp rebuke from Lukashenko, who promised the \"hardest possible reaction\" should the bloc impose sanctions against his country. At the same time, the Belarusian prime minister, Mikhail Myasnikovich, travelled to Moscow in a effort to shore up Russian support for Minsk during its standoff with the EU. That meeting ended with a Russian promise not to impose its own set of sanctions on Belarus over an unrelated spat over oil exports and a commitment to resume a nuclear power plant project shelved after the 1986 Chernobyl disaster.

The government said intelligence data showed links between some Rohingya and terrorism. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government told the Supreme Court of India on Monday that the Rohingya were \"illegal\" immigrants. The hearing is taking place as Rohingya face severe violence in their native Myanmar. More than 400,000 Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh in the past few weeks to escape military and civilian reprisals that the United Nations has described as \"ethnic cleansing.\" Later on Monday, Myanmar's national security advisor said that his government was willing to welcome the refugees who had fled to Bangladesh back to their native Rakhine state, but that the details of the process still had to be worked out. \"We will make sure that everybody who left their home can return to their home but this is a process we have to discuss,\" Thaung Tun told Reuters news agency after a meeting with British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. It was unclear how this would affect the estimated 40,000 Rohingya believed to have settled in India, including 16,000 of whom are registered with the UN's refugee agency. Read more: Myanmar's Rohingya - A history of forced exoduses The Indian government told the court that it had intelligence data that showed links between some Rohingya Muslims and Pakistan-based terror groups and other international terror organizations. It argued that such links made them a \"serious threat to national security.\" The government also said there was a \"serious possibility of eruption of violence against Buddhists in India by radicalized Rohingya.\" Lawyer Colin Gonsalves, who in a separate case is representing about 7,000 Rohingya living in the northern Indian city of Jammu, countered the government's assertions. \"We just want to know: 40,000 people have been here, many of them for the last five years. Have you [the government] filed a single charge sheet, is anyone being prosecuted in the criminal court for being a terrorist? The answer is: no,\" he told DW. The court has adjourned the hearing in the matter to October 3. Lack of evidence India says it is not bound by the UN convention on refugees as it is not a signatory to the accord, but human rights activists disagree. \"The principle of non return of a person to a place where he will be executed or tortured has become a principle of customary international law which India follows,\" Gonsalves told DW. \"And it has attained the status of 'jus cogens,' which is a principle of law that no country can say is not applicable to it, such as torture and genocide.\" In a communication sent to all states in August, the Home Ministry [interior ministry] said the illegal migrants were more susceptible to terrorist recruitment efforts. But an investigation by Indian broadcaster NDTV found \"little evidence of the government claim.\" The investigation that was carried out at major Rohingya settlements in the country showed little involvement in criminal wrongdoing by the refugees. Lack of any evidence to support the government claim has led to speculations that the Rohingya were being targeted for their religion by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu-nationalist government. \"It is really unfortunate that the government is going back on its commitment to refugees which it has reiterated several times in the past merely because these Rohingyas are Muslims,\" said lawyer Prashant Bhushan, who filed the plea on behalf of two Rohingya men. \"I mean this is clearly a case of religious discrimination and an attempt to arouse a sort of feeling of... an anti-Muslim feeling or try and communalise the situation,\" he told reporters outside the courthouse. The UN's human rights chief last week deplored Indian government's move to deport Rohingya refugees. \"India cannot carry out collective expulsions, or return people to a place where they risk torture or other serious violations,\" Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein said. The Rohingya are an Indo-Aryan people, the vast majority of whom are Muslims. They usually migrate to India through a rather porous border to escape persecution in their native Rakhine state in Myanmar, where they have been denied citizenship rights. They are viewed by the local authorities as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. Myanmar's Buddhist majority is often accused of subjecting them to discrimination and violence.

Hundreds of people, the majority of them Rohingya, have been killed in the violence that has seen many homes destroyed and several villages burned down. Myanmar's government maintains the crackdown is part of a counter-terrorism drive, while the UN's al-Hussein has said that it \"seems a textbook example of ethnic cleansing.\"",

The statement came a day after the Supreme Court of India rejected a plea from the Myanmar government to allow the Rohingya to return to their homes in Jammu and Kolkata, the capital of the state of Rakhine, where they have been living for the last five years. India, however, rejected the plea, saying it did not represent the interests of Rohingya Muslims in India. It was the first time that India had accepted a Rohingya refugee application to live in its country. In August, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi accepted the application, which was rejected by a majority of Bangladesh's Buddhist majority. On October 3, India announced that it would no longer accept Rohingya refugees as part of its own ethnic group. This was followed by an announcement on August 25 that Rohingya would be allowed to stay in their own homes for a period of time. However, it was not immediately clear if this was true or not. Earlier this month, a report in the Indian news agency NDTV said that some Rohingya had fled to neighboring Bangladesh, and that they were now living on the streets of Delhi. Indian foreign minister, Prashant Bhushan, said the government would continue to monitor the situation, adding that there was a \"very high likelihood\" of a return of refugees to Myanmar. He added that \"it is not a question of whether the refugees will be able to come back to our country.\""

Monday's announcement by Pat McQuaid, the president of the International Cycling Union, ratified recommendations in an October report from the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), which ordered Armstrong's Tour de France titles be wiped out. \"Lance Armstrong has no place in cycling,\" said McQuaid. Addressing his remarks to cyclists, McQuaid said the fight against doping was his priority. \"UCI is listening and is on your side. We\u2019ve come too far in the fight against doping to return to our past. Cycling has a future and something like this must not happen again.\" The scathing USADA report included testimony from 11 former teammates, accusing Armstrong of running the \"most sophisticated\" doping program in the sport's history. The USADA said it had collected evidence to prove the seven-time Tour de France winner had engaged in the biggest doping conspiracy to date. Effect on cycling and sponsorship Monday's decision comes as the sport of cycling reels from Armstrong's well-documented fall from grace. Organizers of the Tour de France will be trying to move on from the scandal as the race prepares to celebrate its centenary next year. Sponsors have been deserting Armstrong and the sport in general. Last week, Nike - one of Armstrong's main corporate sponsors - said it was terminating its relationship with the cyclist and accused him of deception. Trek, the company that made the bicycles Armstrong rode to seven titles, announced on the same day it would terminate its sponsorship contract - as did the beer maker Anheuser-Busch. The Dutch institution Rabobank ended its association with professional cycling after the doping allegations came to light, leaving 17 riders in need of a sponsor. Last week Armstrong also announced he would step down from his own charity, the Lance Armstrong Foundation, also known as Livestrong, a move believed to have been intended to limit the damage to the organization from the USADA report.

Armstrong was stripped on Monday, the same day the UCI announced that it had suspended him from cycling for a year and a half after he failed a drug test in October. The decision came after Armstrong, who had been banned for life for testing positive for the banned substance testosterone, failed an anti-doping test earlier in the day and was banned from participating in cycling until the end of the cycling season. He was also barred from competing in two other major sporting events, cycling's biggest sporting event and the world's most prestigious cycling event. \"I'm not going to comment on the decision,\" Armstrong said in a statement released by his foundation. A spokesman for Armstrong's cycling team said he had no comment at the time, adding that he was \"not aware of any wrongdoing.\" Armstrong had previously been suspended for two years for failing a doping test at a cycling club in Texas. In October, Armstrong won a World Tour of Ireland cycling championship, but his suspension was overturned on appeal after a court found him guilty of using testosterone in an attempt to boost his performance during the Tour. His suspension came a day after the French cycling federation said it was investigating allegations that Armstrong used testosterone to enhance performance in his sport. It was not immediately clear whether the allegations were true or not, although Armstrong and his wife, Pat McQuaid, have been linked to doping allegations in recent years. Both men have denied the accusations, saying they did not take part in doping tests and that they were not aware that the tests were taking place in their home country of Texas, which is home to the Texas state of Livestrong, where Armstrong grew up. They have also denied any involvement in Armstrong\u2019s doping scheme. \u201cI don't know what the motivation was,\u201d Armstrong told AFP news agency, referring to an incident in which Armstrong tested positive on a test administered by an ex-employee of a rival cycling company in Houston, Texas on Oct. 1. According to a report in The New York Times, a former cyclist who was suspended in September for an alleged drug-related incident with a woman, was found to have had a positive test for testosterone and had the results confirmed by a medical exam taken in Dallas on October 23, according to court documents. An investigation has also been launched into the case, with the findings expected to be published in early November. Read more: How did Armstrong cheat at cycling?

President Obama vowed to nominate a successor 'in due time,' despite political opposition. The 79-year old justice died in his sleep, presumably of natural causes, local media reported on Saturday. Scalia was visiting Texas for a hunting trip, and his body was discovered after he failed to appear for breakfast in the resort where he was staying. US President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama extended \"their deepest condolences to Justice Scalia's family,\" White House deputy spokesman Eric Schultz said. Texas Governor Greg Abbott described the conservative justice as a \"man of God, a patriot and an unwavering defender of the written Constitution and the rule of law.\" \"He was the solid rock who turned away so many attempts to depart from and distort the Constitution. His fierce loyalty to the Constitution set an unmatched example, not just for judges and lawyers, but for all Americans,\" Abbot said. Battle for the empty seat His passing is likely to open a new political front between President Barack Obama and the Republican Party, as Scalia's replacement could shift the composition of the court towards a more liberal persuasion. Several Republican lawmakers have already urged Obama to leave the decision to the next president who will be voted in later this year. \"The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court justice,\" Senate Republican majority leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement, referring to the upcoming November general election. \"Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president,\" McConnell concluded. President Obama, however, said he would fulfill his constitutional duty and nominate Scalia's successor \"in due time.\" \"These are responsibilities I take seriously, and so should everyone. They are bigger than any one party,\" he said. Decades of controversy Scalia joined the Supreme Court in 1986, becoming the first Italian-American to serve in the top judicial body. He was nominated by US President Ronald Reagan. Throughout his long carrier, Scalia voted in favor of privacy and protecting defendants' rights, but also against legalizing abortion, same-sex marriage and gun control. He also drew public attention for his theatrical flair and sharpness of tongue, as well as his alleged unwillingness to compromise. In June last year, the nine-person Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage with a five-to-four vote. Scalia, who was in the minority, commented he would \"hide my head in a bag\" if his own name were associated with the decision. He also said that the majority opinion was \"couched in a style that is as pretentious as its content is egotistic.\" dj/jm (AP, Reuters, AFP, dpa)",

Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Twitter that Scalia's death was the result of an \"unprecedented and unprecedented event\" in US judicial history. \"This is the most significant event in American history,\" McConnell told a news conference in Austin, Texas. He added that \"it is a great honor to be a member of the United States Senate and to serve in this position.\" Obama said he would nominate a replacement for Scalia in November, but he did not say who the replacement would be. McConnell, a conservative from the conservative Christian party of Texas, said the new replacement should be named by the end of this year. The announcement came a day after the US Senate voted to confirm conservative justice Eric Schultz to the court. Obama had been expected to nominate conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch to fill the vacancy vacated by Scalia. In a statement released Saturday, the White House said Obama was \"deeply disappointed\" with the outcome of Friday's Senate vote, which will determine the fate of Obama's successor, former President Ronald Reagan. Democrats, meanwhile, hailed the move as a \"historic moment\" for the country and said it was a sign of \"a new era of American justice.\" \"I am deeply disappointed that the Senate has decided to move forward with this process,\" said Democratic Senator Greg Abbott of New Mexico, adding that he hoped the vote would lead to a new president. Republicans, however, have been divided on the issue of whether to replace Scalia with a liberal justice. They have called for an end to his term in office, saying it is time for a change in leadership. On Friday, Obama announced that his administration would no longer nominate an Italian-American as its next justice, and that it would instead nominate someone from a non-European background."

        "target": "Opinion: The pope's impossible mission in Mexico Pope Francis's trip to Mexico is a dangerous mission - a diplomatic as well as political balancing act, one that brings with it enormous expectations. Francis won't be able to meet them, says DW's Astrid Prange. Dead prisoners, disappearing students, refugees shot dead and murdered priests. Mexico has lived through one violent episode after the other. The mood in the nation is explosive. And now this: just a day before the pope is set to arrive, more than 50 people died in the largest prison revolt in the country's history. What meaning does the pope's presence hold on such an occasion? Only one thing is certain: Francis won't be able to resolve the problems of the world's second largest Catholic nation in just a five-day trip. The unrealistic demands placed on him are not something he can fill. Yet the pope carries with him an important message: you don't have to love your enemies but you do need to speak with them. And he's living the example himself by meeting with the Russian Orthodox Patriarch Kirill on a stopover in Cuba on his way to Mexico. Cuba all over again It's sensational! Bannings and mutual ex-communications are ancient history. Nearly a millennium after the split, the head of the Roman Catholic Church and the head of the Russian Orthodox Church are speaking to each other. It's not as if the two will become friends - their positions are far too different. Yet their centuries-old enmity feels out of place and in view of the massive worldwide persecution of Christians, almost unchristian. And both of these church leaders know this. In Mexico, efforts to stem the polarizing forces at play in society have not been successful. The extreme differences between rich and poor are dividing Mexican society. President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto has prioritized economic growth over dialogue with his critics - a group which includes students as well as teachers and union members who regularly protest against government policies. They demand an end to lawlessness and corruption. The presumed murder of 43 teaching students in Iguala in September 2014, a crime which remains unsolved, stands as a symbol of the lawlessness sweeping Mexico. The recent mutiny in a Monterrey jail serves as further proof of the country's shortcomings in regard to human rights and the rule of law. With a visit to Ciudad Juarez and the largest prison in Mexico, Francis will only make that deficiency more transparent. Even the pope of peace has enemies. The route he's chosen to take on his travels through the country has displeased the staunchly Catholic president. A meeting with the relatives of the Iguala victims is therefore hush-hush and participation in a holy mass remains secret. Considering the tense situation in the country, it's still possible that the pope's route will change once again. The church in the pillory Even within his own church, Francis has met with opposition. A meeting he requested with victims from the church's abuse scandal will not take place - a bitter disappointment for many former seminarians who were abused by Marcial Maciel, the founder of the Legion of Christ, and members of his order. It's just one example of how impunity continues even within the church itself. None of the perpetrators have yet to answer for their crimes in court. It appears as though the pope has accomplished more on the world stage than he has brought on reforms to the Vatican. Despite the revolutionary coming together of Cuba and the US and the revolutionary meeting with Patriarch Kirill, the revolution in Rome has yet to materialize. Do you have something to say? Add your comments below. The thread to this editorial closes in 24 hours.",

He has to travel to Mexico to meet with the Roman Catholic Church and the Russian Orthodox Church in the capital city of Ciudad Juarez. The pontiff has been on a mission since September 2014, when he traveled to the western Mexican state of Chiapas and met with Pope Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto. Nearly a millennium after the end of the Cold War, Pope Francis has returned to his native country of Mexico, where he spent just a day with his wife Marcial Maciel and their two children. \"I have a very difficult mission,\" the pope said in a statement released by the Vatican on Friday, adding that he was \"deeply concerned\" about the situation in his home country, which he called \"the most important country in Latin America.\" \"We have to make sure that we have the best possible situation,\" he said. 'I am deeply concerned for the future of our country and for our children's future.' \" I am very concerned about our future,\" said Pope Benedict XVI, who visited Mexico last September and is expected to visit his homeland in early October. His visit came just days after his predecessor, former US President Barack Obama, was forced out of office following a corruption scandal that left him in jail for more than a year. More than 100,000 people have died since the scandal broke, according to a report from the Catholic Diocese of Monterrey. Many of them died in prison, while others died of cancer, the report said, citing a lack of medical care and other health problems. In addition, many of those who died were not able to attend the funeral of their loved ones. Astrid Prange, a professor of theology at the University of Guadalajara, told DW: \"The pope's mission is to bring peace and reconciliation to this country. It is not easy to do that when you have so many people in your life who are suffering from cancer and who don't know how to cope with it.\" The Vatican has said that it will continue to monitor the Pope's visit, but it is unclear how long he will stay in office. On the other hand, there is the question of whether he is going to go to Cuba, Cuba or Cuba. How long will it take for him to get there? We have no idea. We are not even sure. I can't imagine what he would do if he didn't go there. But we are very hopeful. What do you think? Is it possible that the new pope will do? Does he want to be the next pope? Do you know what I mean by that? I think it's possible he could do it? If so, we will see. If not, then we'll see what we can do about it. That's a good question. Is he willing to give up on the idea of having a chance at peace? What does that mean for you? How can you say no? The answer is that you can say yes? That is a question that is very important to me. There is no way to know. You can tell by looking at what's going on in my life right now. And that's why I'm so worried about my children and my grandchildren. They are so young and they are growing up in such a way that they will grow up with a lot of responsibility for their own lives. So, what do I do now? Well, I guess I'll try to think of it as an opportunity for them to learn more about themselves and what they can learn from me, and that will be interesting to see how they learn about each other. This is something that I've been thinking about for quite a long time. Can you tell me something about myself? Can I tell you what you've learned from my own experience? You've got to ask yourself: What is it that makes you happy? Are you really happy with me? Did you learn anything about yourself? Have you learned anything from your past experiences?

        "target": "Report: Torture is a European problem too A day after Amnesty International published a report on Europe's collusion with the CIA's torture program, the Council of Europe published its own shocking survey of abuse in detention centers across the continent. Prison guards in several European countries carried out reprisals against detainees who talked to the Council of Europe's Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT), the new CPT report has revealed. The council considers this a violation of the spirit of cooperation between the CPT and the Council of Europe's member states. According to the CPT's 24th General Report, released on Wednesday, reprisals were carried out against prisoners in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Greece, Hungary, Moldova, Russia, Spain, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and Ukraine. \"Intimidation or retaliation against persons the CPT has interviewed may not only violate their human rights but also strikes a blow to the preventive mechanism established by the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture,\" CPT President Letif H\u00fcseynov said in a statement. \"I urge national authorities to respect their obligation to prevent, investigate and punish such actions.\" The report also highlighted several problems with the detention of juveniles around Europe, and proposed a series of practical measures to protect young people's rights when detained. Ad hoc visits The little-known CPT, now 25 years old, represents a unique approach to international torture prevention. A team of specialists make roughly 180 visits a year to all kinds of detention centers (including prisons, police stations, holding centers for immigration detainees, psychiatric hospitals, and even social care homes) all across the 47-member Council of Europe - one of the few international blocs that offer platforms for dialogue with Eastern European regimes considered to have poor human rights records, such as Russia, Azerbaijan, and Ukraine. The method combines the carrot of talks with government officials and the stick of ad hoc visits, which all members are committed to allowing into their prisons. Once inside, the CPT also has the right to interview any detainees it chooses - in private, though of course the detainees have the right to refuse. \"The first thing to say is how important the CPT is,\" said Carla Ferstman, director of Redress, a UK-based organization that helps torture survivors. \"As a result of their boot work over a very long period of time, the UN has set up a global system which in many ways mirrors the approach of the CPT.\" But given that the committee has no powers to enforce its proposals to governments, there are question marks over its effectiveness. \"In the report, they complain about how some of the recommendations they've made have not been implemented,\" said Ferstman. \"It's a sign that they're a little bit frustrated.\" But in the long run, she maintains, the CPT has more than proved its value. \"The dialogue that they are able to have is really important,\" she said. \"Looking long-term, they have been very effective.\" CIA collusion, asylum seekers The CPT's report comes a day after Amnesty International released its own report on European collusion with the CIA's torture program. While the CPT's report examines more prosaic day-to-day mistreatment, rather than mass rendition of terrorist suspects at the behest of the US, there are obvious links between the two, since some countries - such as Poland, Macedonia, and the UK - are highlighted in both reports. \"What is finally coming out in all of this is that the Europeans, despite all the criticism of the Bush and Obama administrations on the use of torture - so many of them connived,\" said Judy Dempsey, senior associate at Carnegie Europe. \"It's really a double standard. This report is quite damning and quite shameful, and it follows the Amnesty International one as well.\" The CPT's work also mentions the mistreatment of asylum seekers, a problem increasingly afflicting European countries that take in the largest number of asylum seekers - particularly Spain, Italy, and Greece. \"With Greece there are two things to remember,\" Dempsey told DW. \"A - the appalling situation of the prison system, and B - the lack of training among police of how to deal with asylum seekers. Awful things have happened. Parallel to this is the illegal detention centers. There have been lots of cases of terrible mistreatment over the last several years.\" \"Immigration detention is a growing issue,\" added Ferstman. \"In the UK, there was a whole parliamentary inquiry into one immigration detention center, where some of the women alleged that guards propositioned them in order to get quick treatment on their claims. Each country has its own history of torture.\"",

Author: Judy Dempsey Editor: Carla Ferstman The Council of Europe's executive committee has been meeting in Brussels for a day and a half to discuss how to tackle the issue of torture. A day after the meeting, the Council's head of human rights, Letif H\u00fcseynov, told DW that he and his co-chair of the committee were \"deeply disappointed\" by the lack of progress in tackling the problem. \"We are deeply disappointed,\" he said, adding that it was \"not the first time that we have had to deal with torture.\" \"It is not the last time we will have to do something about this,\" said Dempsey, who is also the executive director of Amnesty International, a non-profit organization that works with victims' families and survivors' rights groups. The council's decision comes as the United States and the European Union prepare to ratify a new convention on torture, which is set to take place on Wednesday. US President Barack Obama is expected to sign off on the convention later this week, but it is unclear whether he will sign on to it. In the meantime, US Secretary of State John Kerry has called for an end to the practice of torturing people under 25 years old. Obama has also called on European countries to stop using torture as a form of punishment for crimes committed during the Cold War. But the US has yet to commit a single crime against humanity, and that's not something that is going to be tolerated by other countries. On Wednesday, Obama said he would sign an executive order to end torture and other forms of violence against women and girls. He also said that the U.S. should take a closer look at the situation in Ukraine, where the perpetrators are being held in custody for up to a year. It's unclear how much longer the torture program will last, given the current political climate in Russia, Ukraine and Georgia. And the fact that there are so many people who are suffering from psychological trauma from the abuse of power, such as mental illness and drug abuse, will only make it worse. That's why we need to make sure we are doing everything in our power to prevent this from happening again. We have a lot of work ahead of us,\" Obama told the UN General Assembly in a speech on Tuesday."

        "target": "Dresden marks 70 years since massive Allied bombing Seventy years ago, Allied bombers attacked Dresden, killing tens of thousands of people, the majority of them civilians and refugees. Every year, the East German city remembers its dead. DW's Naomi Conrad was on hand. As the tram trundled through Dresden's drab suburbs on Friday morning, a prim, elderly woman suddenly turned to her friend sitting on the seat beside her: \"You know, my mother never told me about the bombings.\" She shrugged, then, after a moment's pause, continued. \"It must have been such unspeakable hell that she just couldn't talk about it,\" the woman said. She was referring to February 13, 1945 - the morning, exactly 70 years ago, when Allied bombers swooped down on an unsuspecting city famous for its baroque architecture and that, until that point, had survived the war mostly unscathed. That was to change in the course of three dreadful days: As the bombs rained down on the city, its churches and palaces were turned to rubble. Up to 25,000 people - many of them refugees fleeing the advancing Soviet Red Army - died in the inferno that raged in the city for days. \"There was nothing left, nothing,\" a frail, bent man with a checkered cap recalled, \"just rubble and death.\" He was leaning on the balustrade of a viewing platform in Dresden's old gasometer, staring down at the 360-degree painting by the Iranian-German artist Yadegar Asisi; sirens howled from hidden speakers and strobe lighting illuminated the ruined churches and black smoke billowing from the burnt skeletons that were once buildings. The man swallowed, his voice hoarse, barely audible: \"It's so hard being here.\" The soundtrack and images, he said, \"bring back too many memories.\" 'So, so many dead' He was 15, he recalled, working on a school essay when the sirens began to wail. He never finished the essay. Instead, he ran for shelter with his family. When they returned home three days later, the roof had been blown off, the windows smashed. \"But we were lucky: We survived,\" he said. \"There were so, so many dead.\" His voice broke and, muttering an apology, he shuffled off. The bombings were intended to break the German population's morale - a decision that to many was incomprehensible, given that the war had long been decided and Dresden's economic and strategic importance was relatively minimal. Consequently, the death and destruction wreaked by the Allied bombers quickly became a tool, first for the Nazi propagandists in the last months of the war, then by the East German regime for its anti-West propaganda, and then later by neo-Nazi groups, who traditionally congregate on February 13. Even today, \"the debate continues about guilt and innocence, even about the exact number of victims,\" Dresden Mayor Helma Orosz told a packed audience, including delegations from abroad, gathered for a memorial service in the city's Frauenkirche, which in 2005 was rebuilt with the help of private donations after Germany's reunification, many of them from the United States and Great Britain. Call for peace \"War, hatred and violence begin in people's minds,\" Orosz said. \"We must resist any attempt at once again categorizing people based on their origin and skin color,\" she added, referring to what has often been described as a right-wing catchall movement called PEGIDA, generally translated as Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West, which has taken to the streets in Dresden since October. Later, on a platform overlooking thousands of people, many of them wearing white roses as a sign of peace while bracing the icy cold outside the church, Orosz called on Dresden to remember every victim of the Nazi terror - a plea that was reiterated by German President Joachim Gauck when he took to the microphone: \u201cWe don't want the pain that people suffered here to be misused by others.\u201d Behind him, the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, who, back in the Frauenkirche, had talked of the \u201cmiracle that peace in Europe represents,\u201d leaned in closer to his interpreter. Then, as evening fell over Dresden and church bells tolled, thousands - possibly as many as 10,000, according to the city's press office - lined up along Dresden's riverfront, holding hands to commemorate the dead and call for peace as police men dressed in black riot gear looked on. \"I can remember it all,\" Siegfriede Leonhard, a vivacious woman in her late 70s said. She was 7 when the bombs fell, she said, and had been coming to the commemorations in Dresden \"for at least 60 years.\" Sometimes, she said, stomping her feet to keep warm, she wondered whether she shouldn't remember at home, alone. \"",
        "generated_story": "Dresden hit by Allied bombings The morning of February 13, 1945, the city of Dresden, Germany's capital, was struck by a series of Allied bombs. The bombing killed at least 60 people and wounded more than 1,000. German Chancellor Joachim Gauck ordered the bombing of the German capital three days later. \"The bombing was a total catastrophe,\" said Helma Orosz, a professor at the University of Canterbury in Canterbury, in the United Kingdom. She was one of a handful of German women who survived the attack, including one who died in a plane crash on the way to the airport. Her husband, Siegfriede Leonhard, died on Friday, aged 70. Oroz was the youngest woman in her family's family, who had been living in Dresden for 70 years. In her late 70s, she became the first German woman to be killed by an Allied bombing in Germany. On the day of her death, her husband was killed in an air raid on a military base in eastern Germany, and her daughter, Yadegar Asisi, suffered a heart attack and was hospitalized in critical condition. They were later released from the hospital, where they were treated in intensive care. Their son, Justin Welby, later died of his injuries. A total of 70-year-old women have died since the bombings, most of them aged between 60 and 70, according to a report by German news agency PEGIDA in 2005. Worrying for the future The attack on Dresden came just days after the Red Army had seized control of much of Germany in October and November, when the Soviet forces began to take over the country. At the time, it was thought that Germany was in danger of losing the whole of Europe. That's not the case today. It's the 70th anniversary of Hitler's rise to power and the end of World War II. Today, there are still a lot of people who still live in fear of what might happen to them. But it's also not just the Germans who fear for their own safety. There are also those who think that the attacks are an act of war. And they don't know what they're going to do with their lives. How many people do you know? How old are you? Do you have any idea how old you are? Are you old enough to remember that you were born in 1945? Is your family still alive? Does your mother remember you as a child? Did you remember your father? What did you say to your sister? Was your brother or sister tell you about your dad? You know that he was always a good man? He was very good to you. You didn't tell me anything about him. He's a great man, but you can tell by the look on his face when you look at him, he's got a really good sense of humor. I'm sure he remembers you, too, because you're the same age as me. So I think you'll remember him for a long time. We all know how important it is for you to have a family and that's why we're all here today, even if you've never seen him in person before. If you haven't heard from him before, you probably know him by now. His father is a very important person in your life. When he died, his father was an important figure in German politics and he became a political figure. After all, that was what he did in his youth. Then he went into the army and became an army officer. Now he has a wife and two children. What do we do now? We have to figure out what we can do about it. Do we need to make sure that we have the right people in our lives? If so, we'll do something about that. This is the only way we know for sure. Let's see how long it will take us to find out."

        "target": "Experts: Taliban have not changed strategy with Kabul restaurant attack The weekend attack on a Kabul restaurant frequented by foreigners came as no surprise to international organizations on the ground. Experts don't believe the Taliban have changed their strategy to target more civilians. Dramatic scenes must have played out in the restaurant: Guests sought cover under tables as a group of terrorists shot wildly into the dining rooms. News agencies report the restaurant owner tried in vain to fend off the attackers. He was among the more than 20 people who perished, most of whom were employees at international organizations. The attackers were also among the dead. During the evening dinner rush, at 7:00 p.m. Friday (17.01.2014), one of three Taliban members detonated his explosives-laden vest and blew a breach in the highly secured restaurant. Neither the man-high blast walls, nor the secured access points with armed guards could stop the attackers. The two remaining terrorists were killed later in a firefight with security forces at the scene. No change in Taliban strategy The suicide bombing on the popular Lebanese restaurant, Taverna Du Liban, in the high-end Kabul neighborhood of Wazir Akbar Khan was the worst attack so far in 2014. Afghanistan votes for a new president in April; and the international troops are scheduled to withdraw from the country by the end of the year. Although there are plans for a small contingent to remain in Afghanistan, President Hamid Karzai first has to sign a bilateral security agreement with the United States. But he continues to play for time. In this context, the Taliban may be targeting civilians more in order to drive out not just the military coalition, but the entire international community. Yet \"as horrible as this incident is, I don't see a change in strategy,\" said Thomas Ruttig, the co-director of the Afghan Analysts Network. Similar attacks have also been launched before, \"at least 12 to 15 times in the past eight years,\" Ruttig said. The worst attack was in 2012 at Qargha Lake, a popular weekend destination near Kabul. More than 20 people were killed, all of them Afghans. Extensive security precautions The Taliban, which normally doesn't miss an opportunity for fiery rhetoric, hasn't declared a change in strategy. A spokesman for the Islamist militant group said the attack was retaliation for a NATO airstrike in Parwan Province, a few kilometers north of Kabul. According to an assistant of the Afghan president, seven children and one woman died in the coalition strike. \"You have to carefully monitor the security situation,\" Nils W\u00f6rmer, head of the Konrad Adenauer Institute in Kabul, told DW. \"But I think it's a bit early to talk about a change in [Taliban] strategy.\" W\u00f6rmer's office lies just a few hundred meters from the site of Friday's attack. He could clearly hear the explosion, which shook the window panes in his office. \"It was immediately clear to me that something had happened,\" W\u00f6rmer recounted. But the Konrad Adenauer Institute was prepared. \"We had a relatively concrete warning in the last week related to our neighborhood, and we were very cautious,\" W\u00f6rmer said. He met with colleagues in his secured office. Like most of the international organizations, the Konrad Adenauer Institute is also integrated into the security networks. \"The security precautions are high,\" W\u00f6rmer said. \"But that doesn't exclude the possibility that something similar could happen again.\" But the Afghan security forces have succeeded in preventing many attacks in the past few months, he said. Kabul residents criticize Taliban An informal, impromptu poll by DW's Kabul correspondent, Hussein Sirat, suggested the Taliban are not winning Afghan hearts and minds with such attacks. \"Wherever the Taliban have killed civilians, they have not achieved their goal,\" said Mirwais, a pedestrian in the Kabul city center. Idris, another Kabul resident, seconded Mirwais' sentiment. \"The Taliban intimidate the people so that the security agreement won't be signed,\" he said. \"But the people won't bend to this intimidation.\" How the international organizations adapt to the tense security situation in Kabul will come after many conversations, analyses, and briefings in the following days. But W\u00f6rmer is not thinking about giving up. \"We have a clear agenda and long-term projects, which I considered to be very sensible,\" W\u00f6rmer said. \"I am of the opinion, as I was before, that what I'm doing here with the Konrad Adenauer Institute is worth the risks.\"",

The Taliban, who claimed responsibility for the attack in April, have maintained a \"zero tolerance\" approach to the attacks. \"The Taliban are not going to give up,\" said Nils W\u00f6rmer, a researcher at the Konrad Adenauer Institute in Parwan Province, in northern Afghanistan. However, he added, \"They have not given up on the fight against the Taliban.\" The attack occurred on Friday evening (17.01.2014) in a popular restaurant near the Afghan border town of Mirwais. It was the second time in as many weeks that the insurgents have attacked the restaurant, killing at least 10 people and injuring more than 100 others. On Friday, the Kabul government announced that it would no longer allow the attackers to enter the premises and that they would not be allowed to carry out attacks on its own. A number of Afghan officials, including Wazir Akbar Khan, were also in attendance at Friday's news conference, which was broadcast live on state-run news agency AFP.

We have to make sure that we are prepared for what is to come,\" he told DW. DW: The Kabul attack comes just days after the United States, NATO and the European Union announced a new round of sanctions aimed at reducing the threat posed by the terrorist group. In the past few months, Afghan security forces have stepped up their efforts to combat the insurgency. But the latest attack came just a week after a Taliban suicide bomber killed dozens of civilians in an attack that left more Afghans dead than wounded. Last week, an explosion at a Kabul hotel triggered a chain reaction of violence and violence. More than 1,000 people were killed in that attack, most of them civilians, and hundreds of thousands more were injured. According to a report published in The New York Times, some 1.5 million Afghans have fled the country in search of safety and security, while others have returned to their homes and businesses."

        "target": "Teabag filter cleans water with nanotechnology A new water filter developed in South Africa could provide millions of people with clean drinking water. The filter, about the size and shape of a teabag, would be inexpensive, easy to distribute and simple to use. Marelize Botes is conducting a final set of tests on a new type of diminutive water filter before industrial production can begin. The microbiologist pours water from a plastic bottle though a high-tech, teabag-sized filter before analyzing it in her in her laboratory at the University of Stellenbosch in South Africa. \"The filter is much cheaper than bottled water as well as any other filter on the market,\" she told Deutsche Welle. Instead of being filled with black or green tea, the bag contains active carbon granules and is made from nanofibers treated with biocide, which kills bacteria rather than simply filtering them from the water. Nanotech for pennies \"This project takes nanotechnology to the poorest of the poor people who live in this world, and it will make a difference in their lives,\" said Eugen Cloete, who in addition to inventing the filter is dean of the faculty of science at Stellenbosch University and chair of Stellenbosch University's Water Institute. With some 300 million people in Africa - and over a billion worldwide - living without access to clean drinking water, the need for such a filter is huge. When in mass production, the developers said they expect the teabag to cost just a few South African cents (under half a US cent and under a third of a euro cent). In addition to being inexpensive, Botes said, the filter is also easy to distribute to rural area and simple to use as it can be place in an adapter that fits on nearly any regular-sized plastic bottle. Each filter can clean one liter (one quart) of the most polluted water to the point where it is completely safe to drink. Once used, the filter can be disposed of and is biodegradable. African countries, led by Somalia, Mauritania and Sudan, were ranked to have the most vulnerable water supplies, according to a June report by UK-based risk consultancy firm Maplecroft. Decentralized use The filter's small size and light weight make it ideal for rural areas where other means of filtration do not exist, Cloete said. \"It is simply impossible to build purification infrastructure at every polluted stream,\" Cloete said. \"So we have to take the solution to the people. The water is cleaned right then and there when you drink from the bottle.\" The filter is now undergoing testing by the South African Bureau of Standards, after which Cloete and his team hope it can be rolled out to the United Nations and non-governmental organizations that have expressed interest in it by the end of the year. The project grew out of research into larger filters, according to Cloete. \"We were busy developing filters for larger applications, but when you do the tests in the labatory you do the tests on a much smaller scale,\" he said. \"The results we were getting on a smaller amount of water promoted me to think about a smaller application.\" Author: Joerg Poppendieck, Sean Sinico Editor: Anke Rasper",
        "generated_story": "South Africa's Teabag-sized water filter for decentralized drinking in Africa The South African Bureau of Standards (SBS) has announced that it will be introducing a new system of water filtration in the country by the end of the year. The system will cost just a few South Africans cents a litre (one euro, one US cent) to install. It is part of a $1.5 billion (2.6 billion euros) project to improve water quality in South Africa. \"We are going to introduce this system in June,\" SBS spokesman Joerg Poppendieck told Deutsche Welle, adding that the system would be available to all African countries at a cost of under half a euro cent (1 euro). \"It will also be able to be used in Somalia, Sudan, Somalia and Mauritania as well as in other developing countries,\" he said. According to the report, the project is expected to cost a total of 1.4 billion rand ($1 billion). The project, which is being developed in partnership with the University of Stellenbosch University in Johannesburg, is the first of its kind in North Africa, and is aimed at reducing the need for water to meet the needs of people in need of clean drinking water. However, it is not yet clear whether the new technology will have a positive impact on people's drinking habits or whether it could lead to a reduction in their water consumption. On the other hand, Cloete said it was \"very encouraging\" to see more people drinking clean water, especially in low-income countries such as Sudan and Somalia. In addition, he added, \"it is very encouraging that people are starting to think about water as a source of energy and not just as an energy source.\" The plan is to have the technology in place by June, but also to make it easier for people to get water from sources outside their own country. But the government has yet to decide on whether or not to implement the plan, as it has already been approved by parliament and the United Nations. 'Water for decentralization' The government is also looking into the possibility of setting up a water distribution system that would allow people access to water without having to pay a fee to drink from the same source as they would from a conventional water source. This would make the water system more efficient and more environmentally friendly. And it would also help to reduce the environmental impact of climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. A new water treatment system is planned for the southern African country of Sudan. At the moment, there are no plans to develop a system for distributing water across the entire country, according to an official statement from Sudan's Ministry of Water and Renewable Energy. There are also plans for a number of other countries, including Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Kenya and Ethiopia, that could be implemented in a bid to streamline water management in these countries. Some of these plans have been shelved, however, due to lack of funding. One of those countries is Somalia with a population of just over a million people. Another is Sudan with an estimated 2.2 million. While Sudan has a relatively low population, its population is growing at just under a third of that of Somalia's population. Sudan is one of only a handful of countries with high levels of poverty and unemployment. Somalia has the highest rate of unemployment of any African nation, followed closely by Kenya. Kenya is second, with just 0.7 percent. Tanzania is third, after Somalia at the bottom. Both countries have high unemployment rates and a high level of corruption in government and private sector employment. That's not good news for many people living in poverty, says Marelize Botes, a professor of political science at Stellboshes University. She says the problem is that most people don't know what to do with their money."

It's very easy and the best bit is, it can be reused. Maybe it will come back to you on your birthday. 1. All you need is a piece of fabric big enough to wrap your gift, a ribbon long enough to go right around it, and if you want to make a gift tag, you will also need a piece of old cardboard, a hole punch and another small piece of ribbon. Ready? 2. No, wait, we forgot the present. Get that, and you have everything you need. Spread the fabric on the ground and put your gift on top 3. Fold the fabric around the gift you are wrapping 4. With the last little bit, you don't tuck it under, but create a little flap on top 5. Fold that flap over like this 6. Take one end of the parcel and tuck the fabric inside, BEHIND the gift inside 7. You can take your time to wiggle it all inside. Make it as flat as you can 8. Once it is all inside, turn to the other end and do the same thing again 9. When you have done both ends, it should look like this. Your present is all tucked up inside and you don't need any tape to keep it closed 10. Now for the ribbon. Place the gift on top of it 11. Tie the bow 12. So it looks like this. Finished? If you want a gift tag, that comes now. If you don't you're done! 13. Cut a piece out of an old cardboard box and make a hole in it using a hole punch. Watch your fingers though ;) 14. Put a piece of short ribbon through your hole 15. Tie the tag to your gift 16. And you are finished! P.S. You can either ask your friend to reuse the fabric, and show them how to wrap with it, or if they don't like that idea, you can take it home with you to use again the next time. And remember, you don't have to buy the fabric. You can use an old pillow case, an old t-shirt or skirt, or whatever you want. You can even make your ribbon from an old t-shirt if you don't have any.

How do you wrap your present in a way that makes it stand out from the crowd? You don't have to make it look like you're sitting in front of a computer screen. You just need to be able to look at the screen and see what's going on around you. That's what I'm doing here. I've got a lot to say about this. It's not just about wrapping presents, it's about making sure that everything is covered up and that you have everything you need in order to get the most out of it. This is a very important part of the process. We're going to show you how it works, and how you can use it to your advantage. There's a good chance that it won't be as easy as it sounds, but it will be worth it because you'll have more time to think about it.\" The most important thing is that the present doesn't just stand there and wait for you to open it up. The present has to stand on its own. If you want to take a look around, there are lots of things that can be done. For example, you could use a paper towel to cover up the wrinkles on the edges of your paper. And then there's the fact that if you do that, then you will have a better chance of getting the job done in the future. But that's just not the case with this present. What's more important is the presentation itself, which is very much the same as the one in which you are wrapping it all up in paper, tape, or even a tissue paper bag. These are the materials that are used in wrapping the presents. They are also used to seal the envelopes, so that they are not bound to break down and get stuck in places where they can't fit in. So, this is what we're talking about here, right? We'll talk about that in more detail later. Then we'll get to the point where we can discuss how this presents a great deal of value to our clients and our customers. \"This present is really important to us because it gives us a sense of security,\" says one of our guests. Another guest, a woman, is also a guest. She's also the guest of honor for a friend of mine, who has been working on this project for the past several years. In addition to this, she's been helping with the wrapping of her present, as well as a few other projects, such as an art project. One of these projects is called \"Wrap the Present,\" and the other is \"Wrapping up with Paper and Tape.\" This project is meant to give you an idea of how much work is involved in making a presentation. After all, the packaging is supposed to last for years and years, even if it takes a while to complete. However, we've already seen the results of all the projects that have been completed, including the ones that were completed in time for Christmas. A lot of people are looking forward to wrapping their present with paper towels and using them in different ways. As a result, they're more likely to spend time with their family and friends, rather than trying to cram everything into one big package. Some of them are even planning on doing it themselves. Others, however, are more interested in getting their hands dirty, because they know they'll never have the chance to see the finished product in person again. When it comes to making their own presentation, I think it'll be a long time before we see a product that will last as long as this one is finished."

The ruling primarily affects Germany's Turkish minority. The European Union's highest court on Thursday ruled in favor of a Turkish citizen, who was denied a visa to live in Germany with her husband, because she was illiterate and therefore unable to demonstrate basic German-language skills. According to the court, a lack of language skills shouldn't automatically lead to the rejection of an entry visa application. Instead, Germany must consider the unique circumstances of each individual case. The court went on to say that quickly granting visas for spouses improves the quality of life and promotes the integration of foreign residents. Specifically addressing the case of the Turkish plaintiff, the court ruled that the rejection of her visa had violated a bilateral treaty between Turkey and the EU. In 1970, Brussels and Ankara agreed not to tighten their residency laws for each other's citizens. Law only applies to some In 2007, Germany introduced the requirement that spouses from certain non-EU countries must demonstrate a basic grasp of German before being granted a visa to live in Germany with their husbands or wives. Spouses affected by the law are required to obtain a basic language certificate from recognized centers, such as Germany's Goethe Institute, proving that they have an A1 level, or \"Beginning German\" language ability. The German government claims that the goal of the language requirement is to prevent forced marriages as well as marriages made simply for the sake of obtaining a visa. Citizens of European Free Trade Association (EFTA) member states are exempt from the language requirement. That includes Iceland, Lichtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. In addition, citizens of Australia, Canada, Israel, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea and the United States also don't have to demonstrate German-language skills. slk/xx (AFP, AP, dpa, KNA)",

The decision by the European Union's highest court in the eastern German state of Lichtenstein was seen as a setback for the EU's efforts to tackle language barriers in Germany. A German court ruled Thursday that the law, which was passed in 2007, was in violation of the country's constitution. Germany's lower court, the Goethe Institute, said the decision was \"incompatible with the principles of European free trade agreements.\" The court also ruled that Germany should be allowed to introduce new language standards for its children and grandchildren. \"This is an important step forward for Germany,\" the court said in a statement. It also said that it would not interfere with children's education and that children should have the opportunity to study German in order to better understand the language of their parents and grandparents, according to the German news agency KNA (AFP, dpa, AP). The ruling is the latest setback in an ongoing legal battle between Germany and the United States over a controversial law that aims to make it easier for spouses to communicate with one another. In the case of Germany, it was the first time that a child's language has been required to speak German, and it is not clear whether the new law will be applied to all German-speaking spouses. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said she will appeal the ruling, but she has not ruled out the possibility of a referendum on the issue. She has also called for an end to visa-free travel for EU spouses and children under the age of 18. On Thursday, a German federal court rejected a request by a Swedish court to allow the family to travel to Germany without a visa. According to a court ruling in Sweden, Germany is one of three EU member states that are not part of EFTA. Norway, Canada and New Zealand are the other two countries that have similar laws in place. However, Norway and Sweden have also passed laws that would allow spouses of EU nationals to register as foreign nationals in their countries. Both countries have a different legal system for dealing with foreign spouses, such as those in Israel and South Korea. But the courts have yet to rule on whether or not the laws are in conflict with each other. That's not to say that there is no legal basis for such a change. There is, after all, an agreement between the two states on a number of issues. One of those issues is that if a marriage is to be legally recognized, then it must be recognized as an EU citizen. Another is whether a spouse has the right to use the same language as their children. This is something that can only be done with a partner's consent. For example, if the spouses are married, they have to sign a document stating that they will not be able to legally register their spouses in other EU countries, as long as they do not have German citizenship. And another is a requirement that spouses be registered in another EU country. These laws have been in force for more than a decade. Last year, Sweden passed a similar law in response to an appeal from the US."

Freiburg scored an extra time goal to squeak out a victory against Hoffenheim. Bayern Munich cruised to a 3-0 victory at home against Bavarian rival FC Nuremberg on Sunday, closing the German soccer tables for the weekend. Striker Mario Gomez got things going in the 10th minute for Bayern and also scored the final goal in the 75th minute off a corner kick from Franck Ribery. Ribery came on as a substitute five minutes earlier, making his first appearance for the team since injuring his ankle in September. Near the end of the match, Gomez had an opportunity for his third goal on a penalty kicked but missed. Thirty points at break Phillipp Lahm successfully converted a penalty kick in the 57th minute to round out the scoring for Bayern. The victory for Bayern moved them into sixth place in the table with 19 points and has continued a slow shift in momentum following a rough start to the season. Bayern coach Louis van Gaal said after the game he hoped his team would have 30 points by the end of the first half of the season in five more matches. Cisse saves win for Freiburg In Sunday's other Bundesliga match, Senegal striker Papiss Demba Cisse broke a scoreless deadlock with a goal in the 91st minute to give Freiburg a 1-0 win over Hoffenheim. Cisse has now scored 10 goals in 12 games and is currently the Bundesliga's second highest scorer. The win moves Freiburg into fourth place in the table with 21 points, one ahead of Frankfurt in fourth and three behind Bayer Leverkusen and Mainz, in second and third place, respectively. Nuremberg drop to 10th place with 18 points at the end of a very tight middle group. Just three points separate Nuremburg from Freiburg. Hoffenheim also have 18 points but are two places ahead of Nuremberg in eighth place on goal difference. Author: Matt Zuvela (dpa, sid) Editor: Sean Sinico",
        "generated_story": "Bayern Munich 3-0 Nuremburg: Papiss Demba Cisse seals Bundesliga win for Bayern Munich in the 91st minute German Bundesliga leaders Bayern have clinched a third consecutive league title. The German side beat Mainz on Sunday in their opening match of the season at the weekend. German coach Louis van Gaal's side had a tough time finding a way out of a 1-1 draw at home to N\u00fcrnberg on Saturday, but they were able to hold on to a 2-2 draw in Nuredmberg. Bayern, meanwhile, had to settle for a draw after losing the first two games of their last three matches in Germany. After the break, Bayern took the lead for the second time in three games, with a goal from Mario Gomez and an assist from midfielder Phillipp Lahm. It was Bayern's first league win since the end of September, and it was their third in as many matches this season. They were also the only side to reach the quarter-finals of last season's Champions League, where they lost to Hoffenheim on penalties in September. \"I'm very happy with the result,\" said Bayern defender Matt Zuvela, who scored the winning goal in his first match since returning to Germany from Senegal to play for his hometown club. Germany's national side, however, were unable to break into the game and were forced into a defensive stalemate by the home side. On the other hand, the Bundesliga's second-biggest club, Frankfurt, managed to keep their heads above the parapet, despite the fact that they had lost their first three league games in a row. In the 57th minute, German midfielder Mario Gomes was sent off for an off-the-cuff tackle on a German defender. He was brought down by a deflected ball and the ball bounced off the back of his head, which sent him flying to the ground and into his own net. A few minutes later, a free kick from the left-hand side was saved by defender Sean Sinico, allowing Bayern to take control of possession and set up a counterattack. Frankfurt's goal came five minutes earlier, when a pass from Franco Ribery found Franco Gomez in front of goal. That was the last time the German forward had touched the crossbar, as he had been on the pitch for some time before the match. Facing a Bayern team that has been struggling to find its footing in recent weeks, Germany will be desperate to get back on track after a disappointing first half in which they failed to win a league match and have to make up for that by winning the league's only league game. But they have a lot of work to do before they can do that. And they are not going to give up on their dream of becoming the best team in Europe. With the goal, they will need to work hard to improve their chances of qualifying for next year's World Cup in Russia. For now, though, it's all about getting the job done and making sure that the players are fit and ready to go. At the same time, there is a sense of urgency in terms of how the team is playing. There is no doubt that this is the most important thing for them to be doing, because they know that it is important to have the right balance of power in order to compete with each other. This is something that can only be achieved through a combination of hard work and determination. If they don't have that balance, then they cannot be relied on as a team and that's a problem for us. So, we will see what happens next. We are very much looking forward to next week's Bundesliga match against Cologne in Cologne. I'm sure we'll see if we can get the results we need. You know what I mean by that, right? I think we've got a very good chance of getting a result. What do you think about that? That's the question for you? Do you have any idea what we have in store for Cologne? Did you know about this match? Can you tell us about it? We have no idea? You can't tell me what you want to know. How important is it that we are in this position? What are you waiting for? Is there a chance that you can make a difference? The answer is yes, of course we do not know for sure. Just like last year, I know you're going into this game with confidence and confidence in your ability to score goals and be a part of this team. Then again, that is not the case at all. Last season we had an injury crisis and then we didn't get any results, so that was a big reason why we couldn't make the playoffs. Now we're looking at a win in Frankfurt. Maybe we won't see that at Cologne, or maybe we just have too many things to worry about. Who knows? Maybe it'll be interesting to see how many games we play next season? How many of us will we be playing? If so many people will you'll"

They were originally arrested for taking photographs of restricted areas. Slovak citizens detained by the Iranian authorities on suspicion of taking photographs out of bounds have returned home, said Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico. Eight people in total were arrested in May after taking photographs of restricted areas. A Slovakian news website said the group was detained near the central city of Isfahan, where Iran has nuclear facilities. The six that have been freed attended a news conference held by Prime Minister Fico in the capital, Bratislava on Sunday. Fico told reporters that the government was working to secure the release of the remaining two paragliders who are stiil in custody. \"Negotiations were fair and their result is the release of six out of eight detainees,\" Fico was quoted as saying on the government's website. He added that Slovakia had not made any \"financial commitments\" in the negotiation process. Detainees 'unaware' of rule-breaking One of the released paragliders, Vladislav Frigo, said the group did not break any rules it was aware of. \"We had information that there was a ban on taking photographs below the height of 2,300 metres. We were taking pictures from higher (altitudes),\" said Frigo. He added that the detainees were well treated, had access to television, a refrigerator and could cook for themselves as well as getting regular meals. Foreign nationals accused of spying In recent years, Iran has levelled accusations of espionage against both foreign nationals and Iranians. Two U.S. citizens - Josh Fattal and Shane Bauer - were sentenced to eight years in jail for spying after being arrested while hiking along the Iraq-Iran border in 2009. They denied espionage - neighbouring Oman helped secure their release in 2011 by posting bail of 1-million US dollars (756,000 euros). Last year, Iranian-American Amir Hekmati was sentenced to death for spying for the CIA, but judges overturned the decision and ordered a retrial. lw/ipj (Reuters, dpa)",
        "generated_story": "Six Slovak paragliders released on suspicion of spying in Iran Six Slovaks were released by the Iranian authorities on Sunday after eight years in prison. The arrests were the latest in a series of arrests in Slovakia over allegations of espionage. Slovakia's ambassador to Iran, Vladislav Frigo, was among those arrested in connection with the alleged spying. He was one of a group of men, women and children released from prison in 2009. They had been living in exile in Oman and Slovakia, where they had fled to the United States in 2011. In 2009, they were arrested and charged with spying for the U.S. intelligence agency, the CIA. On Sunday, Slovakia announced that it had released the men and women, along with their passports and passports, to an Iranian court in the southern city of Bratislava. Fico, who has been in custody since 2011, said he was \"very happy\" to have been released. \"I was very happy that I was released,\" he told the court, adding that he hoped to return to Slovakia in 2010. Slovakers have long been suspicious of Iranian involvement in their country's politics, particularly in Iraq, Iran and Iraq-Iran, he said. Last year, Iranian-American intelligence agents raided the offices of the Czech embassy in Isfahan, accusing them of having access to information about the embassy's activities there. Iranian officials have denied the allegations, saying they are not aware of any evidence against them and that they have nothing to do with it. A spokesman for Iran's Ministry of Foreign Affairs told Reuters that Iranian intelligence agencies had not been able to verify the charges against the two men. Iran has denied any involvement, however, and has said it will not extradite them to face espionage charges. It is not clear how long they will be held in jail, or how much money they could receive from the government, but it is believed they may have received in return for their cooperation. According to a source close to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani's office, Tehran has not yet commented on the arrests."

        "target": "French presidential debate does little to woo undecided voters This year's French presidential race is perhaps the most closely watched election in recent history. Many voters are still undecided, including those in the Paris caf\u00e9 where DW's Jake Cigainero saw the latest TV debate. Just over two weeks ahead of the first round of voting in France's presidential election, all 11 candidates met for the second televised debate of the campaign. It was the first time in the history of French elections that the entire official ballot shared a television stage. This race for the Elysee is perhaps the most closely watched election in the history of the Fifth Republic in view of conservative candidate Francois Fillon's embezzlement charges, the deterioration of the left, political amateur Emmanuel Macron's surprise surge to the top, and the rise of Marine Le Pen's National Front. With so much media attention on the five main candidates, Tuesday's debate felt almost like a consolation for the six other candidates rarely in the spotlight. For French voters watching the televised debate at Cafe des Phares on Place de la Bastille, the saturated stage kept the candidates from detailed discussion of pressing issues. For those who are still undecided, the debate did little to bring them closer to choosing their pick for president. Vincent Couronne, a researcher, said it was good to see candidates who don't get as much media attention. However, 11 candidates at once for the political spectator was overkill. \"It wasn't very interesting. It's just one position after another. There's no real debate. It's not like when it was just five candidates.\" Boredom all round Charlotte Theuvenin and her friends, all students in their early 20s, tuned out early on from boredom and exasperation. \"It was too flat and too hypocritical. Fillon and Le Pen play with our money, then say they did nothing and that they are good for our country,\" she said. As though addressing the candidates in front of her on the TV screen, she added, \"How dare you talk about being president when you use our money for your own interests.\" Le Pen had come under fire over accusations that she misused public funds to pay bodyguards as parliamentary assistants. Francois Fillon of Les Republicains, meanwhile, is under investigation for allegedly paying family members more than 1 million euros ($1.1 million) for government work they never carried out. Frequently casting a blank stare at his opponents, Fillon also seemed bored, or at least more subdued compared to the first debate. Couronne said, \"Fillon seems to be not there. Probably because he knows all the small candidates can attack him on the criminal offenses he's accused of.\" Debate watchers cited Europe as the most important issue of this election, with many fearing Le Pen's promise to tear France out of the European Union in a so-called Frexit. Though no one at the cafe vocally supported Le Pen's plan, several acknowledged the EU is a pressure point for France. \"France's place in Europe in relation to Germany is a very important issue,\" said student Thibault Cirier. \"The general problem is France has lost its influence at the European level over the years, and that needs to be remedied, because France is one of the founders of Europe and should have a strong place in the union. The EU is also important for cohesion and to have a strong position internationally.\" Caf\u00e9 viewers say no to Le Pen Cirier was initially excited by Macron when he launched his campaign, but ultimately decided there was no substance. Now he says he will probably vote for far-left candidate Jean-Luc Melenchon. Kevser Taspinar also said she liked Melenchon for his fighting spirit and that \"he throws barbs.\" As a practicing Muslim who wears a headscarf, she said the most important issue for her is laicite, France's state institution of secularism. \"For me Hamon has the best interpretation of this. Maybe Hamon,\" Taspinar said hesitating. \"I'm still undecided, because there's Melenchon.\" Another viewer, Marie Dubois, said that although she really liked Melenchon, she had definitively decided on Macron. \"Melenchon has a way of putting humanity in politics and giving hope,\" she said. \"But Macron is the only possible candidate.\" With polls putting Le Pen and Macron in the second round on May 7, the undecided voters at this Paris cafe said they were certain which candidate they would not for vote for in that scenario. \"Definitely Macron. There is no way I am going to vote for Le Pen,\" Theuvenin said. \"I will never vote for that woman or Front National, no matter who is running against them in the second round.\" Tuesday was the final debate for Macron and Melenchon, two of the crowd-pleasers among the candidates. Both have pulled out of the third debate on grounds that it cuts too close to the first vote just two days later on April 23.",
        "generated_story": "France's Le Pen and Fillon clash in Paris The French presidential candidate, Emmanuel Macron, and his wife, Marie Dubois, clashed in the streets of Paris on Tuesday, May 7, just two days after the French election. The two candidates, who are vying to become the next president of the country, have been locked in a bitter battle over the fate of France's two main political parties. Just over two weeks after Macron's election victory in April 23, the two presidential candidates clashed again, this time over who should lead the party. \"We have to decide who is going to lead us,\" Macron said at a press conference in his hometown of Hamon, near the city's historic Place de la Bastille, where he was born and grew up. In a speech delivered in front of a packed crowd of thousands of supporters at the Elysee Palace in central Paris, Macron called on the people to unite behind him in order to win back their votes. He also called for a united front against the far-right National Front (FN), which has been in power since the 2015 presidential election, to form a coalition government with the FN and the Socialists (SPD). The FN's candidate for president, Jean-Luc Melenchon (Le Pen), is running for the presidency with his father, Vincent Couronne (Fillon), as his running mate. His father is a Muslim, while his mother, Charlotte Theuvenin (Moulin) is an Orthodox Christian. Both men were born in France, but their parents were Muslim. Their father was a member of parliament from the former French colony of Les Republicains, which is now part of Germany. They are now French citizens and their mother is French-German. It is not clear if they will vote for Macron or not. If they do, it will be the first time they have voted for him. But they are not the only ones who have spoken out in favor of Macron. And they don't want him to lose his chance of re-election. That's because they want to make sure that he stays in office and that they get a fair share of their vote. So far, they haven't been able to do that. On the other hand, their father and mother-in-law are French Muslims and they're not allowed to vote in elections, so they won't be voting for their own candidate. This is the second time in as many years they've voted against him, after they lost the presidential elections in 2015 and 2016. After all, he's the one who won the election last year. What's next for them? They want a change of heart? It's not easy to change the course of politics. There's a lot of things that have changed in recent years. One thing that has changed is that the new president is no longer the same person as the old one. You can't just say no to a new person, you've got to give him a chance to prove that you're a good person. I think that's what's going on in this country right now. We're talking about the future of our country as a whole. Let's see what happens next. Do you have a vision for France? What do you think? We'll see how it all looks like next year? You know, we'll find out. How long will it take us to get to the point where we can get there? I'm not sure I can say for sure, because it's still very early in my career. My father has always been a big fan of French politics and I've always wanted to be a French politician, even if I didn't have the money to buy a ticket to Paris. Now, I have no idea how long it'll take me to reach the end of my political career, let alone a presidential run. All I know is, that I'll probably never be president again. Then there's this question of who will win. Is it possible that Macron will get the job done? That would be an interesting question to answer. Will he win? Is he really the right person? Or will he just be left out of it? If he does win, then he'll be on his own."

And the news was good -- most of the numbers were down compared to the preceding year. Germany's streets were never particularly dangerous, but according to the Interior Ministry, they are now safer than at any time since statistics have been collected. Reported criminal offenses on the whole dropped by 1.4 percent over 2005 -- to a total of just over 6.3 million. \"The statistics show reductions in crime among children, adolescents and teenagers, as well as adults,\" said Sch\u00e4uble. He added that criminality among foreigners living in Germany also fell, saying that this development reflected Germany's efforts to integrate non-Germans. Drugs offenses were down 7.8 percent, followed by theft and street crime, which both declined by four percent or more. Youth violence Vandalism, on the other hand, was up 5.9 percent. Fraud rose slightly, as did violent crime -- among young people by an alarming 4.5 percent. Berlin Interior Minister Erhart K\u00f6rting said that was part of a decade-long trend in Germany. \"As many experts have pointed out,\" K\u00f6rting said, \"the potential for violence in society is increasing.\" The head of the German Police Officers' Union Konrad Freiberg also said those figures showed that German society was not truly getting safer. Frankfurt tops most-dangerous list Crime was down in Frankfurt am Main, but it's still the German city with the greatest number of criminal offenses person 100,000 people. Hanover was a close second, followed by D\u00fcsseldorf, Bremen and Berlin. The total percentage of criminal cases solved by German police also improved slightly from 55 to 55.4 percent.

He added that he was \"very pleased\" with the outcome of Tuesday's meeting, which is expected to be attended by more than 1.5 million people. However, he added, \"I am very disappointed that we have not been able to achieve our goal of reducing the number of murders and the increase in violent crime.\" He also pointed to the fact that, in 2006, there was a rise in murders of non-Germans, and that in 2005, it was estimated that there were around 1,000 murders. In the preceding year, a total of 2,500 murders were committed by police, according to data from the Bundesrepublik. On Tuesday, police said they would hold an emergency meeting in Bremen, Germany, on the topic of gun violence. Police chief Konrad Freiberg said that the police were \"increasingly concerned\" about the threat posed by guns and other forms of violence, adding that \"they are increasingly concerned about their own safety and security.\" \"They are concerned that they will have to deal with this threat,\" he said. A spokesman for the interior ministry said the ministry would not comment on whether or not the statement was made public, but said it would be \"inappropriate\" to make it clear that police did not intend to carry out a crime against the public."

        "target": "All or nothing for Bayern in Champions final Bayern Munich have one last chance to salvage a season that has otherwise been marked by their inability to beat Borussia Dortmund: a win against Chelsea in the Champions League final at their home stadium. All season long, Bayern Munich have been consumed with achieving one goal: reaching the final of the Champions League, held at their own Allianz Arena in Munich, and raising the trophy in front of their home fans. After finishing a distant second place to Dortmund in the Bundesliga and dismally losing to them 5-2 in the German Cup final, Bayern Munich are in a must-win situation Saturday against Chelsea. A loss would be the final straw in a disappointing season for a team that can't stand second place. A win for Bayern would mean redemption, to some extent, for their shortcomings in the league. Key players were rested down the stretch in the Bundesliga, especially before the two legs of Bayern's European semifinal against Real Madrid. That was an indication that Bayern had given up on the league and put all their eggs in one basket, hoping for a big payoff with the Champions League title. The same can be said for the German Cup final against Dortmund: true, Bayern essentially beat themselves by making mistake after mistake, but Bayern could, if they win Saturday, wipe the slate clean. Saving the season Win this match, and all will be forgiven in Munich. Lose, and it will be Bayern's second straight season without a piece of hardware, not to mention the heartbreak of losing the biggest match at Allianz Arena since it opened in 2005. \"We must not even think about [losing],\" said Bayern's Franck Ribery on Thursday. \"If we win the Champions League, then we can forget about not winning the league or the cup, nobody will care about that.\" Bayern are a team that thrives under pressure, and the high stakes of this match will be good for them. Chelsea are a team that showed in their semifinal upset of Barcelona that they can rise to a challenge, even if that challenge is simply holding on against a superior opponent. \"We are not the favorites of the game, we are playing away,\" Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech said on Thursday. \"It is very rare when you have the home team playing in the home stadium, using the home dressing room, so I think the advantage goes to Bayern Munich because of that. But we know we have a chance and we will fight for it.\" But this match will come down to the team that can better take advantage of holes that have been blown in each team's defense due to injuries and suspensions. Filling the gaps Between the two sides, seven starting players will miss out on the final. Chelsea saw Raul Meireles, Ramires, and Branislav Ivanovic each get their third yellow card in the second leg against Barcelona, and captain John Terry was given a straight red. Terry and Ivanovic are fixtures on Chelsea's backline, which was already at half-strength due to hamstring injuries suffered by Gary Cahill and David Luiz. Chelsea coach Roberto di Matteo hopes those two are fit enough for the final, since Chelsea will need all the help they can get in the back. For Bayern, David Alaba and Holger Badstuber - both defenders - and Luiz Gustavo, a defensive midfielder, are also suspended for picking up three yellow cards. The impact of the suspensions will hit Chelsea the most. In addition to a weakened back line, Meireles and Ramires are mainstays on offense, supporting strikers Didier Drogba or Fernando Torres. With Ramires out, Drogba could start as striker, with Torres moving to the wing. At any rate, there is more uncertainty in The Blues' lineup than there is in Bayern's, who will be able to rely on striker Mario Gomez and the dynamic-duo of Arjen Robben and Ribery on the wings as they have all season. Most of the question marks will still be defensive for both teams, but to think that this is an indication of a high-scoring affair on Saturday would be a discredit to both team's last lines of defense. Between the posts Neither side would be competing in the final if it wasn't for the heroics of the teams' keepers. Cech defended against wave after wave of attacks from Barcelona in the semifinal for Chelsea, and Manuel Neuer showed nerves of steel in Bayern's penalty shootout in the final leg against Real Madrid, blocking penalties from Madrid stars Cristiano Ronaldo and Kaka. Chelsea's best shot will be to come out of the gate at a sprint and gain an early advantage against Bayern, who will be doing everything they can to keep their long-cultivated dream-final in their control. Otherwise, Bayern's determination to salvage their season may be enough to carry them through to the trophy ceremony - at home, just like they planned it.

He is expected to make his return to the starting line-up after missing the last two games due to an ankle injury suffered in his last match against Barcelona.

It would also have been their second title in as many years if they had managed to reach the semi-finals. But that's not the case at all. At the same time, they have the advantage in terms of possession and the ability to control the ball. In addition to that, the Blues are also able to use their speed and agility to push their way through the opposition's defense. And that is something that can only be achieved with the right combination of strength and speed. This is a team that has a lot of experience in front of goal, so it's a good thing that they've got the experience to do it. There's also the fact that the players are all very good at their jobs. You can see that in all the games that are being played, there's always the possibility that you can get the best out of them. I don't know how many times I've seen them do that. What I can say is that I'm very impressed with them and I think they'll be very happy with me. We'll see how well they do in these games. If they win, then we'll have an even better chance of winning the title.\" \"I'm really happy for them,\" added Rina Goldenberg, a former Chelsea defender who is now Bayern's assistant coach. Terry, however, has said he doesn't think he's ready to give up on his dream of becoming a coach, saying he wants to stick with his former club. 'I want to stay at Bayern,' he said, adding that he'd like to be a part of a coaching staff that will help him develop his game as soon as possible. However, he is not ready for that yet, because he knows he has to play for his club, Bayern will need to find a way to bring him back to his old club in order to keep him in contention for another top spot. His last goal for Bayern came in 2005 when he scored the only goal of his career against Manchester City. Last season, Terry scored a brace against Borussia Madrid to help his side to a 2-1 win over Real. Now, it seems that Terry will have his sights set on a third title with Bayern."

A high-ranking Vatican diplomat will face trial in the Holy See on charges of possessing child pornography in the US and Canada. Catholic priest Carlo Alberto Capella was indicted on Saturday after a Vatican investigation found he had allegedly possessed and exchanged \"a large quantity\" of child pornography during his diplomatic posting. His trial will start on June 22 in front of a Vatican magistrate. If convicted, he could be sentenced to between one and five years in prison and fined between \u20ac2,500 and \u20ac50,000 ($2,100 to $42,000). He is being held in the city's police barracks.

The church rejected the request and withdrew him in September to face investigation at home. Shortly afterwards, Canadian authorities issued an arrest warrant for allegedly possessing and distributing child pornography while visiting a church in Canada. The Capella case has hampered the Catholic Church's attempts to move on from its myriad of pedophile priest scandals. There has been particular focus in recent months on the Chilean branch of the Catholic Church ignoring and covering up of child abuse by pedophile priest Fernando Karadima during the 1980s and 1990s. Pope Francis wrote a letter to Chileans last week expressing \"shame\" for the affair despite previously defending one of the main alleged offenders behind the cover-up.

The charges stem from allegations that he had sex with a minor and distributed the images to minors under his care. Vatican spokesman George Pell said in a statement Saturday that the Vatican was looking into the allegations. \"The Vatican is aware of allegations of sexual abuse of minors by a priest in Chile,\" Pell told reporters at a news conference in Canada. He added that \"there is no evidence to support these allegations.\" The Vatican also said the charges were \"inappropriate and inconsistent with the teachings of the Catholic Church,\" according to a report by the Australian news agency dpa. Pope Francis said on June 22 that it was \"deeply concerned\" about the accusations, adding that there was a \"serious lack of evidence\" to substantiate them. Francis also called on the church to cooperate in the investigation, which is expected to last between one and five years. In a letter to the pope, the Holy See said it would seek an \"immediate cessation\" of all sexual contact between the priest and minors, including contact with minors. It was not immediately clear if the letter was intended to be used as evidence of a cover-up or if it had been intended as an attempt to cover up the alleged abuse. A Vatican spokeswoman told AFP that Vatican investigators had not yet received a formal complaint from the accused priest, Fernando Karadima, who is accused of sexually abusing minors in his home country of Chile in 1980s and 1990s. Catholic bishops in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the US have all said they would cooperate with an investigation into allegations made against the former priest. Last year, Pope Benedict XVI said he would not rule out the possibility of an inquiry into accusations of child sexual exploitation. On Saturday, Vatican officials said that they had received an anonymous tip from a Chilean priest who had sexually abused a child under 12 years of age, and that his wife, Maria, had also received the tip. According to Vatican press releases, a total of \u20ac2,500 and \u20ac50,000 (\u20ac42,100) were allegedly paid to him in exchange for the child's release from prison.

The money is to come from the Russian pensions system. Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov unveiled a plan Monday aimed at creating a \"multi-billion-dollar\" funding vehicle for companies hit by Western sanctions. Moscow-based news agency RIA quoted Siluanov as saying that the emergency fund would be set up next year with money originally earmarked for the State Pension Fund and leftover funds from this year's budget. According to RIA, Moscow was planning to devote \"at least 100 billion roubles\" (2 billion euros) to the fund, which will mainly be aimed at helping cash-starved Russian banks and key oil companies. \"These 100 billion roubles will be added to the reserve next year, which will allow us to help companies,\" RIA quoted Siluanov as saying. \"We are planning to create a reserve of significant size.\" Just last week, the European Union and the United States imposed a third round of sanctions on Moscow for Russia's involvement in the Ukraine conflict. The latest sanctions target the Russian banking sector as well as key energy firms and arms manufacturers. As one of several companies that have asked for government help, Russia's oil giant Rosneft said it would need 1.5 trillion roubles ($39.70 billion) in aid to keep exploring for oil. Siluanov also told RIA news agency that the decision to stop transferring money to the Pension Fund would hand the budget an extra 309 billion roubles. It will be the second year running that Moscow has stopped transfers of funds from the budget to the Pension Fund, which provides benefits for Russia's pensioners, some invalids and families who have lost their breadwinners. uhe/nz (Reuters, RIA)",

The fund will be established in the second year of a two-year plan by Russia's state-owned oil giant Rosneft (RIA) to invest at least 100 billion roubles ($1.5 trillion) ($2 billion). The plan was approved by Moscow's Finance Ministry last week, and the fund is expected to be fully operational by mid-2018. A spokesman for the State Pension Fund (SPF), which manages the pension funds, said in a statement that it was \"deeply concerned about the impact of sanctions on Russian companies in Ukraine.\" \"We are deeply concerned,\" the spokesman said, adding that \"we are aware of the fact that sanctions against Russia have been imposed on companies that are involved in conflict with the United States.\" The statement came a day after the Russian government said it had approved a plan to establish a new fund that would cover the costs of restructuring the state pension system. \"The plan is to set aside a total of 309 billion rubles ($ 309.70 billion) for this purpose, which is more than twice the amount currently available,\" Sputnik news agency reported, citing a source close to the plan. It was not immediately clear whether the move would have any impact on the company's finances. Russian President Vladimir Putin has also said that he would be willing to step down from his post as head of state if Russia agreed to allow him to take a leave of absence, the paper said. Russia has been accused of violating the terms of an anti-missile deal signed with Ukraine last year, but the Kremlin has denied the allegations. Moscow has said the deal was a \"non-negotiable\" one, saying it would allow it to continue to work with other countries in its sphere of influence. However, it did not say how much Russia would pay for such a move. In an interview with RIA, a senior Russian official said he was confident that Moscow would stick to its commitments to Ukraine despite the sanctions. He added that Russia had \"no intention\" of changing its stance on Ukraine, although he had no immediate comment on whether that was the case."

        "target": "Heidi hits the Big Screen Heidi, the world famous girl from the Swiss Alps who first appeared in a novel 121 years ago, has hit the big screen in a fresh look. A century after the death of Heidi inventor Johanna Spyri, the lovable Alpine heroine is being portrayed in a new film which replaces grassy slopes and mountainous range with city skyscrapers and city streets. The $ 3.5 million \"Heidi\", funded by the Z\u00fcrich-based film company Vega and directed by German film maker Markus Imboden, is to be launched in Germany on Thursday. The making of the film was one of the highlights of a past year of events including exhibitions, lectures and fireworks celebrating the July 7 2001 centenary of the death of Spyri, whose novel \"Heidi\" sold 20 million copies and has been translated in 50 languages worldwide. It is thought to be one of the most successful books of all times. The book has inspired 17 films, including Shirley Temple\u2019s Oscar winning portrayal of Heidi in 1937 and a Japanese cartoon series. Imboden\u2019s remake is the 18th \"Heidi\" film. Blue hair in Berlin According to Vega, \"the film was transmitted to today\u2019s world without losing sight of the original novel\". But Imboden\u2019s new movie is far from the charming original, with its rosy-cheeked, curly-headed Heidi, delicate Clara and goat-tending shepherd Peter\u2019s frail old grandmother. In the first film, Heidi, who lives happily with her grandfather in a tiny hut in the Swiss Alps is plucked from her contented life by her Aunt Dete to live in a stiff, rich family in the bustling metropolis, Frankfurt. Heidi becomes so home-sick, she starts to sleepwalk and is eventually sent home. But not before she causes confusion in the otherwise prim household and brings laughter in the life of the disabled and homely, Clara. The Heidi in the latest film has blue hair, surfs the net and roams the streets of Berlin. Friend and shepherd Peter sheds his rustic pastimes and whizzes down streets on his mountainbike. Clara is not the weak, lame young girl of the Spyri novel, but a moody Britney Spears wannabe. Aunt Dete is a modern-day stylist living fashionably in the German capital. The new surroundings are a far cry from the tranquil days of cow milking, goat- tending and flower-plucking in the verdant meadows of the Swiss Alps. Transforming the Heidi myth According to a Berlin daily, the remake is a \"refreshing Heidi\", adding that the script writers had managed to transform the Heidi \"myth\" into an independent, self-assured girl and not into a \"transfigured mountain heroine\". However, it is just this portrait of a naive and charming alpine heroine that has made Heidi so popular all over the world. Heidi has become a well-known Swiss brand worldwide. Some 60,000 tourists \u2013 half from Japan \u2013 are said to visit the picturesque wine-growing village in Graubuenden, which boasts the original Heidi House and other Heidi related attractions such as winding mountain trails and pastures. Imboden\u2019s film, which is to be launched in Germany on Thursday, will also open elsewhere in Europe, and may reach fans in Japan and South Korea too. Whether Imboden\u2019s blue-haired, computer savvy Heidi will charm her Asian viewers, however, remains to be seen.",
        "generated_story": "The Remake of Heidi in the Swiss Alps A century ago, Heidi lived in a Swiss ski resort. Now she\u2019s living in Germany, where she and her husband, Peter, live in Switzerland. Heidi was born on July 7 2001, in Graubuenden, the German city of Frankfurt. Her husband Peter and daughter, Johanna Spyri, moved to Germany from South Korea in 1937. Their daughter Clara, who now lives in Japan, took Heidi to Switzerland to live with her parents. The two have been married for 121 years and have two children together. They have a daughter and a son, and they have three grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. In a recent interview with German magazine Der Spiegel, Imboden said that Heidi \u201cwas the most beautiful woman I have ever seen\u201d and that she was the best-loved wife of Peter. \"She was so beautiful that I thought I was going to give her a lifetime of happiness. She was a very special woman and I am so grateful to her for that. I think she would have loved to have lived with me for a long time, but now she is gone.\u201cI am very sad to see her go, I miss her so much. It was such a wonderful experience to be able to share in her happiness and happiness with the world. We are so proud of her and so happy for the people of Germany who have come to know and love her. And we are very grateful for all of the support she has given us. \u201d Heidi is one of my favorite people in my life, as I look back on the past year and see how much she meant to me and my family and how happy she made me feel when I first met her, then I realized that it was only a matter of time before I got to meet her again. That's how I feel about her now, because I know she will always be my best friend, even if I never get to spend the money I need to make her happy. So I'm very happy to say that we have finally found a place for her in our hearts and we will continue to look forward to the day when she returns to our lives. This is the first time I will ever see Heidi again, so I can't wait to get back to my old life. You know how it is when you see the pictures on your computer screen and you can see all the things that are going on in your head, like her face, her hair and the way she looks at you and your hair, your eyes, you know that you are looking at a beautiful girl, that's what I want to do with your life and what you're doing with it, right? I hope she's happy and happy with you. But I also hope you will be happy about this because it will give you a chance to find out more about Heidi. There are a lot of good things in life that can be done with Heidi, especially if you have the time and energy to work on it. One of those things is to build a home for yourself and raise a family, which is something that is very important to us all. For me, it has always been my dream to grow up and be a part of that family. My dream was to become a model for my children and grandchildren. Then I decided to start my own business and start a business. After all, what better way do you do that than to sell your home to someone who has no money? You can sell it for $ 3.5 million or more and make a living doing it? That would be great for your family! And then there are all these other things you could sell for less than that, or even better, sell to somebody who can afford to buy a house and then sell the house for more money. All of these things are just a dream come true for Heidi and for you to enjoy your own home. What a great success Heidi has had as a wife and mother. How did she get into the business? Well, she had a career in music and was very successful in that field. As a singer and actress she became a successful actress and singer. However, there was also a time when Heidi had to step down from her position of artistic director in order to focus on her own career. When she retired from the music business in 2009, all she could do was sell her home and get a job as an interior decorator. A few years later she sold her house to a man who is now a director of a music company. He is also the father of two young children. His wife, Maria, is a former model. Maria and Peter are now divorced and their son Peter is an actor and comedian. Both of their children have moved on to other careers in film and television."

        "target": "Rethinking the term 'honor killing' The murder of 28-year-old Samia Shahid comes less than two weeks after Qandeel Baloch was killed by her brother. The media was quick to report them as \"honor killings.\" We have to rethink that term, writes Gouri Sharma. When news broke that Samia Shahid, a British-Pakistani woman, had been found dead while visiting relatives in Pakistan at the end of July, mainstream media outlets were quick to report it as an honor killing. It was the second time in two weeks that the media had reported a killing of a woman this way - the first being the murder of Pakistani social media star Qandeel Baloch. There are strong similarities between the cases. Both were murdered in places where they would have felt they were at their safest - in their family homes. It's likely they knew their killers - in Baloch's case, her brother has admitted to strangling her, and Shahid's father and cousin have already been questioned. And as more reports emerge about Shahid's death, it's clear that both were killed because they didn't behave in a way deemed acceptable in a conservative, patriarchal society. 'Deeply offensive' term The debate around terminology in \"honor killings\" isn't new, and after Baloch's murder there were members of the media - such as ABC Australia journalist Juanita Phillips - who decided against using the term, calling it \"deeply offensive\" and referring to it as a \"family killing\" instead. And there are outlets, like the Guardian, that already use inverted commas with the word honor. But some commentators argue that more needs to happen if media consumers are to gain a better understanding of the problem. \"I think an important step for the media would be to refuse to give weight to the term 'honor crimes,'\" said UK-based freelance journalist Shehnaz Khan. \"While it is imperative to highlight that these crimes and murders stem from the roots of misogyny and therefore a false sense of 'honor,' there is absolutely nothing but'shame' within them, as murder is nothing but dishonorable.\" \"The word 'honor' can sometimes carry an almost positive connotation that we are inclined to automatically accept just because it's not happening to us, when the reality is, this a huge problem affecting thousands of girls and women across the world,\" she added. Naming the issue But this isn't a view shared by all journalists. Ruby Hamad, a writer at Australia's Daily Life newspaper, said that the first step in dealing with the issue is naming it. \"There are some deeply patriarchal societies that still limit women's freedom according to old tribal concepts of honor, where, unfairly, the behavior of women reflect on their entire family,\" Hamad said. \"By naming these 'honor killings,' we are acknowledging the role that this misogynistic concept of honor plays, not only in the murders themselves but in these entire societies, and how it entraps both men and women.\" Through the eyes of the perpetrator? There are other issues with the term though. Some have argued that by framing it as such, media outlets are showing the crime through the eyes of the perpetrator - and not through the victim - as they should. And with such cases regularly hitting the headlines, framing is important. The United Nations estimates that around 5,000 women - predominantly from Asia and the Middle East - are killed annually in honor-related crimes, a figure that women's advocacy groups say is closer to 20,000 worldwide. This raises an important cultural element for the media to consider - how far does the term play into cultural stereotypes? \"When honor is considered the most important thing in life, then all family members become expendable,\" Hamad said. \"The collective outweighs the rights of the individual. Does this feed into cultural stereotypes? Perhaps. But that doesn't mean we should pretend that this cultural context isn't there.\" Looking for answers - and alternatives There have been many alternatives put forward by women's advocacy groups, including hate crime, misogynistic murder, femicide and shame killings. But which one should we pick? Al Jazeera for one has decided which one they won't use. \"We are always updating our style guidelines to convey a deeper and more authentic understanding of world affairs. Recent events in Pakistan ignited a healthy debate in Al Jazeera on the term 'honor killings' in particular. Our editors are currently studying alternatives to the term, but'misogynistic murder' is not one of them,\" said an Al Jazeera spokesperson. Terminology in the media matters, and for murders as complex as these, it's the media's responsibility to find a name that better fits the crime. Only then will it become easier to work towards a solution.",

The amnesty came on the 21st anniversary of the brutal crackdown of a student-led pro-democracy movement in 1988 and the subsequent seizure of power by the current junta. Journalists were invited to Yangon\u2019s notorious Insein prison on Friday as the authorities released the first batch of prisoners. At least 600 inmates were freed as part of an amnesty for over 7,000 inmates nationwide. Among those released in Yangon were two journalists and 25 political prisoners -- rights groups say this is only 1 percent of the total number of political prisoners held by the military regime. Maung Zarni, a research fellow at the London School of Economics, was \u201chappy for the prisoners who were part of the release\u201d. \u201cThis is a very positive personal development and I am happy they have been released but we need to understand that the junta is using the prisoners\u2019 release as a public relations exercise. It is the 21st anniversary of the military coup so they are using this as a way to pacify political discontent in the country.\u201d Amnesty comes ahead of next year\u2019s polls Myanmar's director general of prisons, Zaw Win, said that the prisoners had been freed so they could take part in next year's polls. In recent months, rights activists, pro-democracy activists and Western countries have cast doubt on the credibility of the planned elections as many key political activists are still in detention. This includes pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who recently began a new 18-month period of house arrest after being found guilty of violating her house arrest order in a widely condemned trial. \u201cThe whole Suu kyi trial is rather unlawful,\u201d said Zarni. \u201cBecause the country does not have an independent judiciary, the judges are just puppets who dance to the tune of the top leadership.\u201d Junta is holding on tightly In 1990, Suu Kyi\u2019s National League for Democracy won Myanmar\u2019s last general election by a landslide. But the junta never recognised the results and has since tightened its control over the country. The 2008 constitution, which was drafted and approved by the military generals, which guarantees the army 25 percent of parliamentary seats, is yet another sign of its desire to consolidate power. \u201cThe military is going to be in power for a long time,\u201d warns Zarni, \u201cbecause they have got control of all the political and economic institutions in the country as well as the entire state of Burma. So with or without elections, this is likely to remain the same.\u201d New Democratic Party formed Meanwhile, a new political party has been formed in Myanmar. The Democratic Party is headed by Mya Than Than Nu, who is the daughter of the country\u2019s first democratically-elected prime minister, U Nu. The party has proposed a power-sharing deal with the military, which would give 40 percent of power to politicians and 60 percent to the military rulers. Harn Yawnghwe, the director of the Brussels-based Euro-Burma Office, doubts the new party stands a chance: \u201cIt is possible that they they would be able to get some votes. But it is not likely, even if they were able to contest the elections freely, that they will be able to form a new government because the military is not prepared to let any party rule.\u201d Democrats should exploit elections He thinks the only way out for the democratic forces in Myanmar is to use the upcoming elections wisely and \u201cto take part in them even if they are against them. I think we have to look at the elections as a process which will lead to democracy -- maybe in few more years.\u201d The National League for Democracy has indicated that it will not take part in the polls unless all Myanmar\u2019s political prisoners, including Suu Kyi, are released. Suu Kyi\u2019s lawyers have filed an appeal against the extension of her house arrest and the court is expected to give a ruling on October 2. But few are hopeful that the junta will amnesty her anytime soon. Author: Disha Uppal Editor: Anne Thomas",

Zaw Win, the head of the country\u2019s National League for Democracy party, said on Friday that his party was ready to release political detainees. \"We will continue to work with the NLD and other political parties,\" he said in a statement released by the party's parliamentary office. The party said it was \"deeply concerned\" about the situation in Yangon, which has seen a rise in violence since the military took power in 1990. It also said that the new government was willing to take action against those who had committed crimes against humanity and human rights violations, including murder, rape, torture and sexual abuse of women and girls. Aung San Suu Kyi has been accused by rights groups of plotting a coup against her and her government. She has denied any involvement in the coup attempt, saying that she was not involved in any political activity. On Friday, her party announced that it would release more than 1,000 political inmates, most of them women, on October 2. According to the group's website, some 3,500 people have been released from prison in recent years. In 2008, a total of 2,200 people were released, according to figures compiled by Amnesty International. Most of those released in 2008 and 2009 were former military officers, who were later convicted of crimes committed in 1988 and 1989. They are now serving sentences ranging from 15 to 30 years in prison, with a maximum sentence of life imprisonment and a fine of up to $1,600. Many of these prisoners are still alive and well, although they are no longer eligible to apply for parole. Some have even been sent to prison for life without parole, while others have had their sentences reduced to 15 years or less. This is the first time that a political prisoner has had to be released on parole after serving a life sentence for a crime committed against him or his family. Last year, they were sentenced to life in jail for rape and attempted murder. Their sentences were suspended for two years after a court found that they had violated the terms of their release.

He added that humanity's life support systems had been compromised by globalization and powerful economic interests. The report was released during UN climate talks in the German city of Bonn which are drawing up rules pertaining to the Paris agreement, which seeks to lower carbon emissions. The document suggested that several drivers were responsible for the threat to human health, including ecosystem disruption, climate change, inequality, unhealthy and wasteful lifestyles, along with unsustainable consumption and production. Worsening effects UNEP estimated that an extra 250,000 deaths could occur each year between 2030 and 2050 as a result of climate change, leading to malnutrition, malaria, diarrhea and heat stress. Between them air pollution and a lack of access to clean water and sanitation cause almost 8 million premature deaths each year. Environmental impacts are responsible for the deaths of more than one quarter of all children under the age of five, the report states. UNEP called for governments to act to remove harmful substances from working environments, reduce the use of carbon fuels and rely instead on renewable energy, and change lifestyles to allow a more sustainable use of the world's resources. The report also called for a bigger investment to protect the planet's natural ecosystem. UNEP predicted a further increase in emerging zoonotic diseases (spread between animals and humans), and called on developing countries, in particular, to prioritize prevention methods. \"Never before have so many animals been kept by so many people - and never before have so many opportunities existed for pathogens to pass through the biophysical environment and wild animals to livestock and people,\" the report warned.",
        "generated_story": "A quarter of deaths due to environmental degradation, says UNEP The World Health Organization (UNEP) has warned that the effects of climate change on people's health and well-being can be felt in the developing world. The UN Environment Program, which aims to improve the lives of people in developing countries by 2030 and 2050, predicts that more than half of the world's children will die from environmental pollution by the time they reach the age of five. According to a UN report published in 2012, the number of children dying from exposure to pollution is expected to rise by a quarter by 2050. This is in line with the WHO's goal of reducing global greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent by 2020. But it's not just children who are at risk, according to the report. It's also children and young people who have been exposed to toxic chemicals, such as mercury, arsenic, chromium, lead, zinc and lead. These children are also at higher risk of developing cancer and heart disease. \"They are more likely to develop cancer than older children,\" said Achim Steiner, UN environment policy chief in Bonn, Germany. He added that \"they will have to face the consequences of their actions.\" The report also said that children under five would be at high risk for cancer, heart defects and other health problems if they had to live with high levels of mercury exposure. In the United Nations Environment, Health, and Social Development Programme (EHDP), the UN agency for the promotion of healthy lifestyles and health, said in a statement released on Thursday that it was \"deeply concerned\" about the impact of environmental change and its impact on human health. Among other things, it said, \"We are very concerned that we are going to see more and more children suffering from cancer as a result of this change in our environment and our ability to meet the needs of our children.\" It added, however, that there was no evidence that these deaths were caused by human activities. A third of all children born between the ages of 5 and 6 will be affected by environmental damage. That's a significant increase from the level of pollution that has already been seen in Asia and the Pacific. However, there is still a lot of work to be done to address this problem, particularly in Southeast Asia, Africa and South America, where there are currently over 1.5 million people living with chronic diseases. At the same time, many of these children have also suffered from respiratory problems and are unable to access the care they need. There is also a lack of access to basic health care and nutrition services that are available to them. So, in order to reduce the burden on the poor and to provide them with adequate nutrition, nutrition and exercise, children should be able to take care of themselves and their families. And, of course, this is something that can only be achieved through education and training, not through the use of pesticides and artificial fertilizers. What's more important is that they have the opportunity to learn from their parents and develop a better understanding of what's going on in their lives, so they can make informed decisions about how to best live and what to do with their children. I think that's something we can all look forward to as soon as we have a chance to make a change. We can't wait until we see what the future holds for our kids and grandchildren, but I'm not sure how long it will take for them to get used to it. They will need to grow up and learn to cope with all the challenges that come along with being a child and having to deal with everything that comes with growing up in an environment that is becoming increasingly polluted and polluted. If they don't have enough money, they will not have any choice but to continue living in this environment. As a consequence, their chances of survival will likely be reduced, as will the chances for success in school, work and education."

Minister wants ban on meat names for plant-based foods Terms like \"vegan sausage\" and \"vegetarian schnitzel\" confuse consumers and need to be replaced, according to German Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt. He wants new names for plant-based dishes. Germans shouldn't be biting into a \"vegan sausage\" or cutting a slice of \"vegetarian schnitzel,\" German Minister for Food and Agriculture Christian Schmidt told the daily \"Bild\" newspaper on Wednesday, adding that names traditionally used for meat-based dishes should not be applied to plant-based foods. \"I don't want anyone to pretend that these pseudo-meat dishes are actual meat dishes,\" Schmidt said. The minister said manufacturers should come up with distinct names for plant-based meat-substitutes. Schmidt also said meat was part of a healthy and balanced diet and belonged on the menu in schools and kindergartens. Soy? Steak? Soy-steak? Schmidt's statements echo demands from the German Farmers Association and German Butchers Association. Both lobbying groups have asked for a ban on terms such as \"vegetarian ham\" or \"soy steak.\" Schmidt's call for plant-based foods to have their own name was also made in October in the state of Lower Saxony, a state with many large livestock farms. The German Vegetarian Association, however, argued against the proposal. A spokesperson for the organization said that \"names that are used for animal-based products should without a doubt also be legal to use for vegetarian substitute products.\" More meatless 'whatever-you-want-to-call-thems' The market for vegetarian and vegan dishes has grown steadily in the past few years in Germany, partly at the expense of the meat industry. According to a research paper by the Institute for the Study of Trade (IfH), revenue for vegetarian and vegan products in Germany was 454 million euros ($474 million) in 2015 and grew by more than 100 percent between 2010 and 2015. In the same time period, the demand for meat products fell by almost 10 percent. mb/sms (dpa, epd)",
        "generated_story": "German Farmers Association: No more'vegetarian sausages' and no more schnitzel' The German Vegetarian Association (IfH) has announced that it will no longer be selling \"veg, sausage, or other meat products\" in Germany. The move comes after a series of scandals over the past few years. In October, the German Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt said that the country's farmers association would stop selling meat and dairy products to the public. \"We have to do something about it,\" Schmidt told the weekly Bild newspaper, adding that he would like to see more meat in the future. He added that there would also be \"a lot more vegetables and more fruit products.\" The association, which represents farmers in Lower Saxony, is one of Germany's largest agricultural trade associations. According to its website, it has more than 454 million euros ($474 million) in annual sales from the agricultural sector between 2010 and 2015. It is the first time in German history that a German farmer has sold meat to a foreign buyer, and the last time it was sold was in 2015, when Germany was the world's second-largest meat exporter after the United States. Schmidt's comments come as farmers' groups have been calling for the end of meat sales to all German exporters. They have also called on the government to stop subsidizing meat exports to other countries, such as France, Germany, Italy, Spain and South Africa. German farmers associations have called for an end to meat imports and a return to agricultural production, with the aim of reducing the number of people who are forced to work in meat-processing plants. However, there is still room for growth, Schmidt added, pointing out that meat production has fallen by 40 percent since the beginning of the year. This is in line with a trend that has been gaining momentum in recent years, he said. 'We are going to continue to sell meat, but we will not be doing it for profit,' he added. But he also pointed out the fact that, in order to meet the growing demand for meat at the grocery store, farmers would need to cut back on their meat consumption. Schmidt said he was \"very concerned\" about the impact of such a move on farmers, saying that \"there is a lot of work to be done.\" \"I am very concerned about this,\" said Schmidt, who is also the head of German Butchers Association, a trade association that represents German meat processors."

Stephen Harper has stepped down as leader of the Conservatives after nine years in the top job. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper resigned as Conservative Party leader on Tuesday after the Liberals, led by Justin Trudeau, emerged victorious in legislative elections. \"I have spoken to Prime Minister Stephen Harper, and he has instructed me to reach out to the newly elected parliamentary caucus to appoint an interim leader,\" Conservative Party president John Walsh said in a statement. \"The people are never wrong,\" Harper said of his defeat. \"The disappointment is my responsibility and mine alone,\" Harper said, adding that he had called Trudeau to congratulate him. Trudeau calls for hopeful, diverse future In electing Trudeau, the charismatic son of a former popular prime minister, Canadian voters illustrated the growing discontent with nine years of Conservative rule that saw lowering of corporate taxes, avoidance of climate change legislation and disagreement with the Obama administration over the controversial Keystone XL pipeline. \"Canadians have spoken,\" Trudeau said, adding that he would be the man to lead the \"hopeful, positive\" country \"with a vision\" that they had asked for. In his victory speech, Trudeau said his government \"believed deeply in the diversity of our country,\" striking a contrast with the strain of nativism that had become apparent under Conservative rule. \"We beat fear with hope,\" said Trudeau, a 43-year-old former teacher. Liberals blow past projected results Projections ahead of the elections had Harper and Trudeau in a dead heat, but as polls closed on Monday night it became clear that the Liberals had won an outright majority, with a projected 175 of parliament's 338 seats. This represented a huge leap from four years ago when Liberals were handed their most crushing defeat in history with a mere 34 seats. Harper will stay on as a member of Parliament for his constituency, public broadcaster CBC reported, as he was re-elected to his seat.

The announcement came hours after Harper announced he would step down from his post as Canada\u2019s leader. Harper, who was elected in 2011 to a second term, was replaced by Liberal Party leader Justin Trudeau on Tuesday night by former Conservative party leader John Walsh. \"I'm stepping down,\" Harper said in a statement released by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC). Harper had been in power since 2011, when he was ousted by then-prime minister Stephen Trudeau. In his resignation speech, Harper also said he will not seek re-election in the next election, which is set to take place in 2014. He also called on the federal government to provide Canada with an alternative energy source for its energy needs. Canada has been without a reliable source of energy for more than a quarter of a century, according to the CBC, and the Harper government has struggled to find the right partner for the energy sector in recent years. On Tuesday, the government announced that it would no longer seek a third term in parliament, but would instead seek an extension of Harper's term. Trudeau, meanwhile, said his party would continue to work with the Liberals to develop a new energy strategy for Canada, including the Keystone XL pipeline, a controversial oil pipeline project that has sparked protests across the country. Canadian media have reported that Harper and Trudeau will meet in Ottawa on Wednesday to discuss the issue of climate change and whether Canada should pursue a carbon tax on oil and gas exports. A spokesman for Harper told reporters that he had no immediate comment on Monday's announcement, adding that \"the government will continue its work to address the concerns of Canadians.\" Harper has also promised to hold a referendum on whether or not to allow the pipeline to be built in Canada. Last year, he said the plan would not be approved by Parliament, saying it was \"inappropriate\" to do so. But Harper did not rule out the possibility of another referendum, as he has repeatedly said that his government is in no position to influence the outcome of any election. After all, it's not the first time that a Canadian leader has resigned from the leadership of his own party. It's the second time in four years that Trudeau has taken over the reins of power, following the 2011 election of former Liberal leader Paul Martin. That's when Harper took over from Martin, whose party is now in opposition. Martin's resignation came just days after Trudeau announced his intention to run again for a fourth term at the same time as Harper. Both the Liberal and New Democratic parties are currently in government, with a majority of seats up for grabs in both houses of Parliament and a minority government. While Harper is no stranger to controversy, Trudeau is the most famous figure in Canadian politics, having served as the party's leader since the late 1980s and early 1990s. During his first term as premier of Canada in 2006, Canada was the world's largest oil exporter. His successor, former President Barack Obama, took the oath of office last year. At the time of Trudeau's ouster Harper was widely seen as a strong contender to succeed him. However, there was a sense of unease among many Canadians that the new leader was not going to win the popular vote. Many of those who voted for him were disappointed with his decision to step aside. They were also concerned about the lack of support from other parties, particularly the opposition parties. Some of them, like the New Democrats, are now calling for an end to his reign, while others are calling on Harper to stay on as opposition leader until his successor is elected."

He urged them to stop fighting. \"We hope the Houthis will come to their senses and realize the interests of Yemen and the Yemeni people should be the top priority for everyone,\" he said. It is unclear whether the Houthis would reciprocate the Saudi gesture. \"The cease-fire will end should Houthis or their allies not live up to the agreement - this is a chance for the Houthis to show that they care about their people and they care about the Yemen people,\" the Saudi foreign minister emphasized. At this point, US Secretary of State John Kerry said anyone who cared about Yemeni people \"should take clear notice of the fact that a human catastrophe is building,\" adding that a cease-fire was \"not peace\" and that all parties must find a political solution to end the conflict.

Among its guests were many US soldiers, who were certainly not thinking of politics, the Middle East or strained relations between the United States and Libya. But reality caught up with them: a bomb detonated near the dance floor that night, killing two Americans and a Turkish woman. Over 200 people were injured. A Berlin court ruled that Libya and its intelligence services were responsible for the bombing. In 2001, following a nearly four-year long trial, the judges convicted a Libyan diplomat and three others to prison sentences between 12 and 14 years. The big oil-exporting country in the meantime was busy working on its reputation. Already in the 1990s, Tripoli began striving to improve its relations to the European Union. Financial reparation opened the door to Europe In 2004, the Gaddafi International Foundation for Charity Associations and the legal representatives of the German La Belle victims settled on $35 million in compensation. This opened the door to Europe. Just a few weeks later, Germany's chancellor at the time, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, visited Moammar Gadhafi in a traditional Bedouin tent outside of Tripoli. Britain's Prime Minister Tony Blair also paid Gadhafi a visit. A few months earlier, in April 2004, the European Union had welcomed the Libyan leader to Brussels. It was Gadhafi's first official visit to Europe in 15 years. Bernd Westphal, the German ambassador to Libya, said bilateral relations had been through difficult times. \"The German Embassy in Tripoli today is working for a quick return to the liveliness of close relations between Germany and Libya,\" Westphal said. \"We want to build on our traditional friendship with Libya and we want to strengthen the political, economic and cultural cooperation between our two countries and peoples.\" Business interests booming in Libya In the past few years, Libya has moved from being the supporter of international terrorism to an attractive economic partner for the West. European business representatives have been increasingly knocking on Libya's door. Even the United States is showing increased interest in the northern African nation. Washington is pleased that Libya announced at the end of 2003 that it would discontinue its efforts to develop and produce weapons of mass destruction. Libya's ambassador to Germany, Said Abdulaati, said political and economic relations between Libya and Germany were \"excellent.\" Libya is one of Germany's strongest trading partners in northern Africa. Last year, Germany exported goods to Libya worth 657.7 million euros ($805.7 million), according to the German Federal Statistics Office. \"The economy is the driving power in German-Libyan relations,\" said Abdulaati in an interview with the Arab-German association for trade and industry. But Germany isn't the only European country making deals in Libya. France last month signed an accord with Libya on peaceful nuclear research. \"This accord represents a qualitative leap in relations between the two countries and proves that Libya has transformed its weapons of mass destruction into constructive weapons,\" Public Works Minister Maatuk Maatuk said at the signing ceremony in March. \"We are telling the world that we are moving towards the development of Libyan nuclear technology for peaceful purposes.\" This week, the Netherlands' Economics Minister Laurens Jan Brinkhorst will visit Libya to negotiate gas and oil agreements. It will be the first high-level visit by a Dutch official since Gadhafi took power in 1969.",
        "generated_story": "Libyan President Moammar Gadhafi was assassinated on April 5, 1986. He was the first democratically elected president of Libya since the country's independence from the United States in the 1990s. \"La Belle\" was one of the most important events in Libya's history. It marked the beginning of a new era of political and economic cooperation between the two countries. The Libyan regime, which has been in power for more than 15 years, is no longer governed by the US, the European Union or the International Monetary Fund (IMF), but rather by a group of European states. In the end, it was Libya, not the West, that ruled the Middle East and Africa. After the fall of Gaddafi's regime in April 2004, Libya became the second-largest Arab country after the Soviet Union. Since then, there have been a number of developments, including the creation of an independent state in Tripoli and the expansion of diplomatic relations with the EU. This week, however, Germany's foreign minister, Bernd Westphal, announced that his country would be moving closer to its former ally, Britain, in a bid to ease tensions between Libya and its Arab neighbors. A few weeks earlier, he said, \"We are going to do everything in our power to make Libya a better place for the people of Europe,\" adding that he was \"very happy\" with his new government. But he added that \"we are not satisfied with what we are doing.\" \"I don't think we have a solution to this problem,\" he told the German news agency dpa, referring to the fact that the Libyan government has not been able to find a way out of its current economic and political problems. That's not to say that Libya is not a great place to live, but that it is a very poor country, with a lot of people living in poverty and suffering from a lack of opportunities for self-reliance and social justice.\" The new president, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, said he wanted to \"make it a priority\" for Libya to get its economy back on track, and that is what he is looking forward to doing. At the same time, his government is also looking for ways to improve its image in Africa, where it has a reputation for being the world's most corrupt and corrupt country. On the other hand, many of those who have come to Libya from other countries, such as Britain and France, have also become disillusioned with their own government and have become more cynical about their role in politics. They have even begun to distance themselves from their former leader, who they see as a threat to their country and their interests. One of them is the former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, a staunch defender of democracy and human rights who was once a strong supporter of his regime. Last year, Blair and his wife, Maatuk, both of whom are now in exile in Germany, expressed concern about the state of Libyan affairs and said that they would like to see a return to democracy in Europe. However, they are unlikely to be convinced that this will be the case. According to a report published in The German Federal Statistics Office (DFS) in March, Libyan officials have said they expect the government to continue to cooperate with them in their efforts to restore stability and stability."

        "target": "Bremen Election Results Could Have National Repercussions It might be Germany's smallest state with a population of less than 700,000, but the make-up of Bremen's new government could curb the ability of Angela Merkel's coalition to continue with planned reforms. The Social Democrats (SPD) and Christian Democrats (CDU) have ruled the small northern city-state of Bremen in a coalition for the past 12 years. But after winning state elections on Sunday with 36.8 percent, the SPD is now flirting with the idea of ditching their previous coalition partners to rule together with the Greens, who made their best-ever showing in a German state poll with 16.4 percent. Bremen's state SPD leadership is to hold talks later on Wednesday with the CDU, which polled 25.7 percent. After an SPD meeting in Bremen, Mayor Jens B\u00f6hrnsen made the first signal he could be favoring the Greens. He said that during the campaign he had deliberately abstained from mentioning the possibility of a renewed CDU coalition because \"after 12 years it shouldn't automatically be continued.\" Bremen's acting head of government and CDU member Thomas R\u00f6wekamp, however, warned against an SPD-Green coalition. \"The majority of people don't want a red-green experiment, but a continuation of the grand coalition,\" he said. Both the SPD and CDU conceded heavy losses in the election, which showed a swing towards the Greens and the Left Party, which scored an unexpected 8.4 percent to win representation in a western German state legislature for the first time in its brief history. Block reforms? If Bremen's SPD decide in favor of the Greens, this would affect the ability of Chancellor Angela Merkel's grand coalition of CDU and SPD to push ahead with reforms requiring constitutional changes, such as stage two of Germany's urgently needed federalism reform. The federal Bundesrat, which is made up of state cabinet members, has to approve the majority of legislative bills passed by the lower chamber, the Bundestag, before they become law. Also, any proposed constitutional changes require two-thirds of all votes in order to be passed by the Bundesrat. The CDU and SPD currently hold 47 of the Bundesrat's 69 seats, which is one seat more than the necessary two-thirds majority. But without Bremen, the number held by the grand coalition would fall to 44 seats, meaning they would need the cooperation of one of the small opposition parties for any constitutional changes. Internal strife Earlier in the week, Chancellor Merkel called for unity within her ruling left-right coalition after the losses in Bremen set the stage for more infighting between the two parties. Merkel also warned the SPD against moving to the left after it lost some five percent points. The chancellor said the outcome showed the SPD had made a mistake by attacking the coalition and campaigning on promises of a minimum wage, which she believes will hamper efforts to fight unemployment of just under 10 percent. \"The result showed that this strategy did not pay off,\" Merkel told a press conference.",
        "generated_story": "Merkel's coalition of Social Democrats and CDU could block reforms Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative coalition is set to form the Bundestag on Wednesday. The SPD and the conservative Christian Democrats are scheduled to meet in Bremen for the first time in 12 years. A coalition government is expected to be in place by the end of the week, with the Greens, the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD), the ruling coalition partner in the German parliament, set for elections on Sunday. Chancellor Merkel has said that she will not allow the SPD to block the reforms. \"I don't see any reason why I shouldn't be able to do that,\" Merkel said at a news conference at the Bundesrat, referring to Germany's federal parliament. Merkel, who has been in power since 2005, said she would be willing to work with her coalition partners in order to ensure that reforms are implemented in a way that is fair to the people and not against the interests of those who oppose them,\" she said. She added that the coalition would also include the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), which is currently the largest party in parliament and which has a majority in both houses of parliament as well as the Green Party, which holds the second-largest share of both chambers. Both parties, however, have been unable to agree on how to tackle the issue of social mobility. In the past, Merkel and her conservatives have struggled to find common ground on social issues, such as education, health care and social security. On the other hand, they have managed to reach agreement on a number of key issues. One of them is the right-wing SPD-Green coalition, a coalition that includes the Left Party and Greens. Another issue is whether or not Merkel will agree to some of these reforms, or whether they will be implemented at all. If she does not agree with these proposals, she may have to call for a referendum on whether to allow them to take place. That's a question that has dominated the headlines in recent weeks. It's not just Merkel who is in trouble, it's also the chancellor, and she has to face the consequences of her policies. This is not only the case in Germany, but also in other European countries, including the United States, France, Spain, Italy, Germany and even the UK. There is a lot of talk about how Germany is becoming a more developed country and how it is going to deal with it. What is important is that we have a stable and stable government. We have the opportunity to make sure that this is something that can be done and we can move on from the current situation. I think that's the most important thing right now, because we need to move forward with this. But we also need a strong coalition. And that means that there is an opportunity for Germany to get on the same page and move ahead with reforms that are already being implemented. So far, so good. You know what I'm talking about, right? The chancellor has made it clear to me that her plan is to bring Germany back to a level of stability and stability that will allow her to continue to lead the country in many ways, even if she doesn't have an easy path to success in her current role as chancellor. How do you see this coming? How can you get ahead of this? What are the chances that you can do? You can't just sit back and wait and see what happens next? I can only imagine what will happen if you are a member of a grand coalition and you're not a part of that coalition,\" said Jens B\u00f6hrnsen, chancellor of Germany."

Speaking to reporters after a meeting with NATO military chiefs in Lithuania's capital Vilnius on Saturday, US General Philip Breedlove expressed \"sincere hope\" about a renewed peace plan, agreed to earlier in the day in the Belarusian capital Minsk, by separatists and representatives from Ukraine's and Russia's governments. The new pact, including an artillery buffer zone, was a move to strengthen a peace plan signed earlier this month, also in Minsk. However, Breedlove said violence levels in Ukraine in recent days were as high as prior to the earlier ceasefire. \"The ceasefire is still there in name, but what is happening on the ground is quite a different story,\" Breedlove said, adding that Russian forces were still operating in Ukraine, although he could not pinpoint how many. \"The fluidity of movement of Russian forces and Russian-backed forces back and forth across that border makes it almost impossible to understand the numbers,\" he said. A convoy from Russia consisting of about 170 trucks arrived in Ukraine on Saturday, with a reported cargo of humanitarian aid. Previous aid convoys sent from Russia were met with outrage in Kyiv, as it was suspected they may have been used to provide support to the pro-Moscow separatists in eastern Ukraine. Russia has repeatedly denied such accusations. The separatists have said they want to break from Kyiv and have already declared \"people's republics'\" in Donetsk and Luhansk.

The move follows a political protest at the first such match. In a statement released on Friday, the German football association (DFB) announced that the games would be rescheduled for 2018 and that talks would take place between them and their Chinese counterparts in order explore how to move forward. \"To the regret of all parties involved, the project has not received the broad approval that had been expected,\" the DFB said. \"In fact, the project was used by a handful of spectators to send messages that were considered hurtful by the Chinese team, officials, the Chinese Football Association's support staff and Chinese spectators.\" Protests in opening match The first of the arranged matches, against TSV Schott Mainz of the fourth-tier Regionalliga S\u00fcdwest was interrupted midway through the first half when the Chinese players left the field because a small group of activists had unfurled Tibetan flags. The team later returned to the field after the flags had been taken down, before succumbing to a 3-0 defeat. On Monday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry strongly criticized the protest. Initially, it had been thought that the Chinese side would play in the Regionalliga S\u00fcdwest - a regional division of Germany's fourth tier which has only 19 teams but the plan was revised so the matches would just be friendlies. This followed an agreement signed in 2016 between the German FA and the Chinese government to help boost the sport in the Asian country, where the Bundesliga is increasingly popular. Financial boost not enough to soothe concerns Despite the financial boost for the clubs \u2013 TSV Schott Mainz were reportedly paid a fee of \u20ac15,000 ($17.800) for last weekend's game \u2013 the move hasn't proved entirely popular with German fans, many of whom see it as just another example of commercial interests trumping sporting concerns. But the protests, and potential for further disruption, seem to be behind the cancellations - the DFB said both federations were aware of \"substantial evidence of further escalation,\" FSV Frankfurt, who were due to host the Chinese side on Saturday, said earlier this week that they would not ban protests despite an angry response to last week's incident from Beijing. \"We will not back a single centimeter off the basic rights our our democracy, including those relating to freedom of speech,\" FSV Frankfurt President Michael G\u00f6rner said in an interview with the Stuttgarter Nachrichten and Stuttgarter Zeitung newspapers. His words echoed those of DFB vice-president Ronny Zimmerman, who said that the games should be played \"within the framework of freedom of expression.\" The fixtures that have been abandoned include games against Wormatia Worms and Bundesliga club Hoffenheim's reserves. mp/pfd (dpa, SID)",

FA spokesman Michael G\u00f6rner told dpa news agency that the FA would not comment on the decision. \"We are deeply disappointed,\" he said in a statement released earlier this week, adding that \"the decision to cancel the event was not made lightly.\" The DFB had earlier announced that it would suspend the participation of Germany's top-flight side, TSV Schott Mainz, for the rest of 2018. However, FA President Ronny Zimmerman said on Saturday that his organization would continue to work closely with the Chinese government to ensure that China's national football team would be able to compete at the level it is currently competing in. He also said that he was looking forward to working with his country's football federation, the Bundesliga's governing body, in order to improve its image in Germany. Faced with a lack of support from the international community, Chinese President Xi Jinping traveled to Germany on Friday to meet with German football officials to discuss the situation. His visit came a day after the World Cup qualifier against Hoffenheim was canceled after Chinese media reported that Chinese officials were planning to take part in an anti-corruption campaign. According to media reports, Xi's visit to the German capital was intended as a way to strengthen ties between the two countries. In the end, China agreed to allow the team to play under the auspices of FIFA and the International Football Confederation (IFC). The Chinese Foreign Ministry said the move was in line with Beijing's demand for a fair and transparent investigation into allegations of corruption and abuse of power by Chinese authorities. China has repeatedly denied the allegations, saying the accusations were \"basically fabricated,\" and that they did not have any evidence of any wrongdoing. It is not clear how much money China is willing to pay for such a move, or how long it will take for it to be implemented, but it seems to me that there is no evidence to suggest that Beijing is interested in doing anything to undermine the integrity of its football system. On the other hand, there has been a lot of speculation about whether or not China will be involved in any way in relation to its involvement in football. There is also speculation that some Chinese players may have been invited to attend the game, which is scheduled to begin on Sunday. But it has not been confirmed yet."

In 2010, German car owners had to pay a high price for their mobility, according to ADAC, which cited record-high fuel prices as the major cost factor. \"For drivers, 2010 will go down in history as the most costly year ever,\" ADAC said in a statement. High taxes The cost of acquiring and operating a car has risen 42 percent since 1995, compared to a 24 percent increase in the general cost of living. Due to tax increases and higher production costs, fuel prices soared 86 percent over the 15-year period. In 2010 alone, the average price for a liter of super gasoline was more than 1.40 euros ($1.84) - the highest the average price ever.

But many of the parliamentarians whose vote will finally set Brexit on its wayhave voted against their hearts, as well as their minds. It was a vote against their minds, because the withdrawal from the EU will almost certainly, at least on a short to medium term basis, have negative repercussions for the British economy. And it was a vote against their hearts, because for many, a view of the future, divorced from Brussels and increasingly reliant on an unpredictable US President Donald Trump, is somewhat alarming. In recent days, many members of parliament have described it as \"a catastrophe.\" No vote \"against the will of the people.\" Of course there are \"Brexiteers\" who believe that a Britain independent of Brussels will be able to return to its former greatness, once it is no longer held back by the \"Little Europeans.\" But they are in the minority - the majority of parliamentarians already declared their support for remaining in the EU during the referendum campaign. Yet despite this, Theresa May's government was able to push its legislative proposal through the House of Commons without any great difficulty. The predominant view, also amongst members of the two leading parties, is that to hinder Brexit and to fail to support the government in its endeavors to do so, would be to go \"against the will of the people.\" Anti-EU newspapers have targeted Brexit opponents. And those who have publically come out in support of the EU have had to reckon with death threats. The at times passionate debate in the lower house, that went on over several days, was a temporary highlight in this European tragedy, which in the worst case could contribute to the continent disintegrating into individual sovereign states. Don't be intimidated The British public supports the hard-line position taken by Prime Minister May in withdrawing from the common market. Polls are showing that her strategy is gaining increased support. There is no turning back now. The British are now looking for clarity on the repercussions of their withdrawal from the EU. They want the negotiations with the EU to start as soon as possible. It was an historical misjudgement by David Cameron that he could win the referendum. Most of the members of the lower house believed the then-prime minister and voted to hold a referendum. But now they can no longer stop Brexit. But they should not let themselves be intimidated by party discipline, nor the leading Brexiteers, nor by voter impatience.

The British parliament voted in favor of leaving the bloc. It is a vote against Britain's interests to remain in the EU. This is the first time Britain has ever voted against its EU membership. And it's not just the UK that has to decide the fate of its citizens, it is also the people who have to make up their minds about the future of our country. That's why the vote has been called by the majority of British MPs, who voted for the referendum in 24 hours. \"The people of Great Britain are going to have a voice in this referendum,\" said Birgit Maass, a member of parliament from the pro-European Alliance (ARA), a grouping of anti-EU groups that includes the United Kingdom, the US, France, Germany, Britain, Canada and the Netherlands. In the event of a no-confidence vote, British Prime Minister Theresa May said she would seek a \"yes\" vote on the issue. But she did not rule out the possibility of another referendum, she said, adding that it was \"not a question of whether or not we should leave.\" The vote was called in response to a number of questions raised during the debate, including whether Britain should be allowed to keep its European membership, and whether it should continue to be able to continue as a single EU member state. She also said it would be \"unacceptable\" if Britain were to stay in an EU free trade deal with other member states, such as France and Germany. A referendum on Brexit would not be the last chance for Britain to exit the single market, but it could still be a long way off. There is no doubt that the result of this vote will be that Britain will no longer be in a free-trade agreement with the rest of Europe. However, that doesn't mean it won't be an open door for other countries to enter into an agreement, which could lead to friction between Britain and other EU members. What is important to understand is that this will not only affect the interests of Britain but will also affect other European countries, as well as the ability of other nations to form a common market for goods, services and services. So, what does this mean for British interests? It means that, for example, we will need to look at how we can be more flexible in terms of what we are willing to do with our European partners. We will see what happens when we get to the point where we do that. I think that's the most important thing for us, because it will give us a chance to move forward with a deal that will allow us to get closer to our EU partners, rather than being left out of it. If we don't get that deal, then we have no chance at all. As a result, there's a lot of uncertainty about what will happen in our relationship with Europe after Brexit. You can see why many people are opposed to Brexit and why some of them are against it, especially those who are not in favour of an exit deal. Why is this so important? What do you think? The answer is simple: the same thing is true for all of us who want to see a united Europe and that is why we need a strong and stable European economy. How can we make sure that we're doing that? And how do we ensure that our partners are doing the right thing? That is something that I'm very much looking forward to doing, so that when the time comes, I'll have the opportunity to say, 'OK, let's get on with it.' And that means we'll be working on a plan to work together on this, too. After all, this is what I've been saying for a while now. Let's be clear about this: We're not talking about a 'no-deal' Brexit, right? We have got to talk about how to solve this problem, not what is going on in Brussels and Brussels. These are the things that are at stake here in Britain right now, like the way things are playing out in Washington, D.C. Right now we've got a very strong opposition to this plan and we want a clear picture of how things will play out. At the moment, all the parties are united in their opposition. They are all united on one thing: they're all in agreement that Brexit is bad for our interests and they want it to happen? They're united because we all want the best for each other."

Klaus Stadeck is the author of the book, which is set to be published in 2018. The book is a collection of short stories, essays and essays on the challenges of living in a toxic environment. In the first part, the story is about a man who has to live with the consequences of his actions in order to survive. It's a story that has a lot to do with his work as an artist and publisher. He's also the founder and editor-in-chief of an online magazine. His work has been translated into English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Russian, English and Spanish. \"I'm very proud of my work,\" he says, adding that he's \"very proud\" of what he has done in his time as a freelance artist, publisher, editor and author. But he doesn't think he'll ever be able to write a book like this again, he adds: \"It's not just about drinking water, it's about making sure that you're not contaminating the environment with toxic chemicals.\" He says that's why he and his team have been working on this book for more than a year and a half, and that they're going to continue to work on it until the time is right to publish it. They're also looking for a way to make it more accessible to people who don't have access to toxic substances, such as lead, arsenic, mercury, chromium, zinc, lead and zinc. And they want to get it out of their system so that people can use it in their everyday lives. That's the main reason why I'm writing this. I've been thinking about it for so long. What do you think? Do you have any ideas? What kind of water is toxic to your body? Does it make you feel better about yourself? Is it toxic for your health and well-being? I think it depends on who you are and how you live your life. You can't live without it, right? You have to take care of yourself and your family. There's nothing wrong with that, but it can also be harmful to other people's health, especially those who are suffering from cancer or who suffer from a chronic illness, like me, who have had to deal with cancer? And that can only be cured by drinking the same water as you, Klaus, can do? The answer to that is yes, I do have some ideas. One of them is \"yes.\" The other is that I have a very good idea of how toxic it is to drink the water. So I'll take a look at it and see what I can come up with for myself. Then I will write about that in my next book. If you haven't already read the article, you can read it here.

        "target": "A Brief History of the Seaside Holiday These days, millions take seaside holidays for granted as one of life's pleasures. But 200 years ago, a dip in the sea was more a test of courage. Hardly anyone could swim. As late as the 18th century, many Europeans still thought of the sea as the realm of Satan: storm-tossed and inhabited by terrifying monsters. \"Unlike the mountains, the coasts were terra incognita as a holiday spot,\" says Manfred B\u00e4tje, director of the Bade-Museum on the North Sea island of Norderney. Anyone who set foot in the water was \"stepping into the unknown\". Brighton showed the way That only began to change after the British aristocracy discovered the healing power of salt water. As early as 1780, Brighton, England's biggest and oldest seaside resort, was a bustling spa. Philosopher and physicist Georg Christoph Lichtenberg (1742-1799) of G\u00f6ttingen gave Germans the starting signal with his 1793 essay \"Why doesn't Germany have any large public seaside resorts?\" In it, he called for the creation of a resort in Cuxhaven on the North Sea. He received support from the most notable German physician of the time, the Prussian king's court physician, Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland. But things turned out somewhat differently. Germany's first seaside resort was indeed built in September, 1793, but in Heiligendamm on the Baltic Sea. Four years later, permission was granted for construction of Germany's first resort on the North Sea, on Norderney. \"For the first bathing season on July and August of 1800, only around 250 guests turned up. Now, the nearly 6000 residents host a good 530,000 bathers annually, plus around 230,000 day-trippers,\" B\u00e4tje reels off the figures. Romanticist inspiration In the 19th century, the landscapes of Caspar David Friedrich, such as his famous Chalk Cliffs on R\u00fcgen (1818), gave seaside holidays added impetus. From then on, the sea was no longer a voracious beast. From the shore, the cultivated, modern European contemplated the vast melancholy of the deep. \"The calm sea became an embodiment of unspecified yearning, the waves an expression of vitality and dynamism,\" soliloquizes museum director B\u00e4tje. But the journey to the sea long remained an arduous, time-consuming one. It took the mail coach a good thirty hours to cover the distance from Hamburg to the North Frisian town of Aurich over bumpy, muddy roads. The express cab from Bremen only took about 16 hours to reach the East Frisian town of Norden - including six changes of horses along the way. \"It wasn't comfortable,\" explains B\u00e4tje. Not until the introduction of seaside tourist steamers out of Hamburg and Bremen to the islands and the expansion of the railways did the journey become easier. Strict bathing rules At first, it was primarily the well-to-do bourgeois and nobility who were able to afford a seaside holiday. Victorian-era society is known for its extreme prudishness, and the beach was not exempt. Bathing machines were essentially changing cabins on wheels that could be rolled into the surf. The sexes were kept strictly separated. Wet swimsuits could not be allowed to cling, thus revealing the body's contours. Women sported baggy flannel garments with bloomers underneath that swiftly became waterlogged to where the bather was risking her life. Hardly anyone really knew how to swim anyway. \"Most bathers wouldn't stay in the water any more than two minutes, often just seconds at a time. The English had a rule: 'Three dips and out',\" quips archivist Manfred B\u00e4tje, whose Bade-Museum is housed in a building for a former wave pool, just a few steps from Norderney's Weststrand, where, during the summer months, vacationers sunbathe in wicker beach chairs and on blankets, cooled by a salty sea breeze. Sunbathing first came in style early in the 20th century, and the first true swimsuits were produced in the United States. \"Starting in 1919, today's bathing culture gradually began to take shape,\" B\u00e4tje looks back. At the same time, ideals of beauty were in flux - such as the attitude towards tan skin, which had long been regarded as a mark of farmers and manual laborers. B\u00e4tje: \"People were still cultivating their genteel pallors.\" Water, Waves, Wellness Today, the sun worshipers are the devout masses, and seaside holidays are their pilgrimages. The North Sea resorts alone count some 12.9 million overnight stays annually. Health is once again a primary concern: sea air, sea water, sea salts and the algaes and mud used in",
        "generated_story": "A Brief History of the Seaside Holiday in Germany In the 19th century, the seaside holiday was a popular tourist attraction in the United States. But it was also a cultural phenomenon. Four years later, in 1742-1799, Germany became the first European country to host a large number of tourists. Today, more than 1.5 million tourists visit Germany every year, and over 200,000 people come to Germany for the summer months to enjoy the sights and sounds of sea life. In 1792, German President Manfred B\u00e4tje visited the North Sea, where he spent two minutes with his wife and two children. They spent a good thirty hours on the beach, swimming, fishing, boating, sailing, canoeing and sailing. After that, they went back to their homes in R\u00fcgen, Bremen, Norderney, Heiligendamm, Cuxhaven and the Baltic Sea. As late as 1793, there were about 16 hours of vacation time for German tourists, with the exception of two days in July and August of 1800, when they returned to England for a summer vacation. These days, however, many of these tourists spend more time in England and Scandinavia than in other European countries. One of Germany's most famous vacation spots is the Chalk Cliffs, located off the coast of England. It's the most popular holiday destination in Europe, but it also has its share of tourist attractions. The Bade-Museum, which opened in 1818, has a collection of German and English-language exhibits. There's a museum dedicated to the area, as well as an exhibition on German maritime history and culture. This exhibition is part of a series of exhibitions, including a selection of books, a history of maritime archaeology and a look at the German-speaking world. Author: Caspar David Friedrich Editor: Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland The museum is located in a small town in western Germany, near the city of Cologne. More than 2,500 visitors visit the museum each year. Most of them come from the East Frisian region of North America. Many of those visitors are German, who came from other parts of Europe to visit their families and friends. \"They come here to spend time with their children,\" says the curator, Dieter Sell, adding that \"they come because they want to see their family and their friends again.\" In addition, visitors can stay for up to two hours a day, he says, or they can go for longer periods of time, depending on weather conditions and whether the weather is good or bad. For example, on a recent visit to Brighton in September, 1794, people were able to get a taste of what it's like to be in Brighton. On the other hand, it is not as if the sea itself is anything other than a vacation destination. That's not the case at all. A good deal of people from all over the world come and go. And that's because the ocean is a beautiful place. You can see the beauty of it all, even if you don't have a boat or a car. If you have to go to sea, you can't see it from a distance. What's more, most people are not aware that there are people who are going to take the boat with them. Some people think that they are taking the ferry. Others think they're going on holiday to relax and get away with it. However, that doesn't necessarily mean that everyone is taking it easy. Not all Germans are aware of this. Even the Germans, for instance, do not think about the fact that the ship is sailing at sea. Instead, some people take it for granted that it will be a long time before it reaches the English Channel."

        "target": "Threat of the Punjabi Taliban is growing Deutsche Welle talks to Pakistani political expert Hasan Askari Rizvi about the growing ties between militants in northwest Pakistan and Punjab province. At least four gunmen disguised in police uniforms raided a hospital in Pakistan's eastern city of Lahore on Monday night, claiming at least five lives. Local officials said the gunmen were trying to free a militant, who was being treated there after being captured during attacks on two mosques last Friday. The police said the gunfight at Jinnah Hospital had lasted around 45 minutes but the gunmen had managed to flee. Friday's twin attacks on the minority Ahmadi community left more than 90 people dead. They were claimed by a group, which identified itself as the Punjabi wing of the Taliban. Deutsche Welle spoke to political expert Hasan Askari Rizvi in Lahore, where there has been a wave of violence in recent days. DW: Who are the \"Punjabi Taliban\"? It is a kind of a pejorative term, which includes a host of groups. Initially in Punjab, you had two types of militancy: One, the groups that focussed mainly on Indian-administered Kashmir and there were other types of groups that focussed on Pakistan. Those were the sectarian groups targeting mainly the Shias, and there were some Shia groups targeting the Sunni leadership. Over the years a lot of factions have broken away from these groups and these small entities are functioning more or less autonomously. They have trainings in the tribal areas because these are secured for them and certain parts are not under Pakistani control so these groups go there. They operate with the Pakistani Taliban based in tribal areas against the Pakistani troops in the region. They also have an autonomous agenda, which they pursue in Punjab, as they have been doing in the past days. These groups also play host or are a kind of a local link to Taliban suicide bombers who come into the main part of Pakistan from the tribal areas (let's say to Punjab). If they have to target some place, they park themselves with these Punjab groups, and then do it. All these factions and groups that have broken away from traditional militant groups and are functioning in close collaboration with tribal area Taliban are often described as the \"Punjabi Taliban\". Why do you think these militants are resurfacing now? They have always existed here and there and generally the trend is that they undertake a couple of operations, one after the other. Then the government comes in and takes action against them. Then they just disappear or become sleeping groups and suddenly after a couple of months they resurface. That's the standard pattern. The last major incident in Lahore was in the first week of March. Then there was nothing in April and now towards the end of May you have this kind of incident. Do you think the government should have taken stronger action against them? They should have but the problem is that the Punjab government has a kind of ambiguous approach and I think there is some element of denial within the leadership also. These groups also have some sympathy if not support at the societal level and that makes it difficult for the government to go against them openly. They need to work together and to emphasise to the people that they are terrorists. They use different names and Islam but actually their agenda is terrorism. Somehow the government of Punjab has been rather confused and ambiguous regarding these groups. Interview: Disha Uppal Editor: Anne Thomas",
