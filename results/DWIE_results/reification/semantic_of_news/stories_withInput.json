        "target": "Opinion: Obama's Cuban revolution President Barack Obama has made a very special declaration of love to Cuba. It's as revolutionary as the Cuban revolution, and as peaceful as the biblical Sermon on the Mount, says DW's Astrid Prange. US President Barack Obama has lost his old communist \"enemy,\" and Cuban President Raul Castro has lost his hatred of capitalism. In the first phone call from president to president since 1961 the two heads of state came to a surprisingly swift agreement. They want to renew diplomatic relations, which have been on ice for more than 50 years, and exchange ambassadors. It's only a matter of time before the US lifts its trade embargo against Cuba. All the word \"embargo\" is really good for - at this stage - is as an ideological soapbox for political hardliners, especially Republicans in Congress who believe lifting sanctions would constitute defeat for the US. Yet the lifting of the embargo has already begun. In addition to medication, it has been possible since 2000 to export agricultural produce such as maize, cereal crops, and poultry to Cuba. Flirting with the rogue state Furthermore, 100,000 US citizens have travelled to Cuba since 2011 for cultural and scientific exchanges. Travel restrictions on Cubans living in exile in the US who wanted to visit their relatives on the island were also lifted. According to press reports, the two countries' military forces are even said to be cooperating, as are their coastguards, and military on the border of the US marine base in Guantanamo. Now Obama wants to officially open a \"new chapter\" in relations with the communist Caribbean island and remove Cuba from the US list of so-called \"rogue states\" that support terrorism. The travel ban on American tourists visiting the island will also largely be lifted. That's as far as things will go for the time being, as Obama would require a majority in Congress in Washington to lift the embargo entirely. But even if these are only small steps, the fall of the American-Cuban wall has begun. The easing of the sanctions and the resumption of diplomatic relations are setting the scene for an end to the embargo. Embargo as scapegoat The tearing down of this \"wall in the mind\" is long overdue. The blockade is obsolete, and has proved to be entirely ineffective. More than this, its advocates have achieved the opposite of what they actually wanted. The blockade has provided the leaders in Havana with an easy excuse for their economic failure. Raul Castro realized long ago that Cuba's economic problems can no longer be justified simply by citing the US embargo. It looks as though he was counting on the blockade being lifted: There is no other explanation for the completion of the Mariel container port in January this year. Cuba's biggest infrastructure project was, incidentally, financed by Brazil. The Brazilians also sent a declaration of love to Cuba. Raul Castro opened the door to them. He loves anyone who helps him - his friends even more than his enemies.",
        "generated_story": "U.S. President Barack Obama has called for the end of the Wall in Cuba. The Cuban president has said that he wants to end the \"war on terror\" in the country. \"We have to stop the war on terrorism,\" Obama said in a speech in Havana on January this year. He also called on the international community to support the Cuban government in its fight against terrorism. In his speech, Cuban President Raul Castro described his country as a \"strategic partner\" to the United States, saying that it was \"a great country.\" \"The Cuban people are the most important people in this world,\" he said, adding that Cuba was the first country in Latin America to establish a state of emergency. Obama's speech came just a few days after his predecessor, former Cuban dictator Fidel Castro, was overthrown by a military coup in 1961. After the overthrow of Castro in 2011, Cuba's government began building a wall of its own, with the goal of reducing the number of Cubans living in exile in neighboring Brazil. Astrid Prange, a professor of political science at the University of Cape Town in Brazil, told DW that the wall was a symbol of Cuban resistance to Castro's regime, and that \"the people of Cuba are not going to give up on us.\" The wall is part of a series of concrete plans to build a new Cuban embassy in Washington, D.C. Under the plan, the government would build the new embassy, which would have been opened in 2000. It would be the largest building ever built by an American president. But the building would not be completed until after Obama was inaugurated in January, according to a report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSI) in New York. There is also a chance that Obama will be able to introduce legislation that would allow the construction of new embassies, as well as the expansion of diplomatic relations between Cuba and other Latin American countries. However, there is still a long way to go before Obama can make a decision on whether or not he will sign the bill. That is, if he is to sign it, he has to do it in his own name. And that is a very difficult task for a president who has spent so much time in office. Many of his predecessors, including former US President George W. Bush, were also involved in Cuban politics, but they were not as involved as Obama is now. They were more interested in building the embassy than in establishing a political relationship between the US and Cuba, where Obama grew up and where he was born. Both of them are still very much involved with politics and have a lot to say about the future of their countries and their relationship with each other. One thing is for sure: Cuba is not the only country that has a great deal to offer in terms of human rights and the rule of law. What is important is that they are willing to work together in order to achieve that goal. This is something that can only be achieved through cooperation, cooperation and cooperation. For example, in 2012, President Obama signed an executive order that made it easier for Cuban-Americans to travel to Brazil to study and study abroad. At the same time, Obama also signed a law that banned the use of torture and torture of detainees in Guantanamo Bay. During his visit to Cuba last year, his wife and children were allowed to stay in contact with him and his family. On the other hand, they also received a letter from his son, who is currently in prison."

The 89-year-old did not say when exactly his resignation would take effect. Calling the move a personal decision, President Giorgio Napolitano made his announcement during an end-of-year speech on Wednesday. \"I'm about to step down, to resign as the constitution expressly allows,\" he said, adding. \"I've reached an age that brings with it growing limitations and difficulties for me to do my institutional duties, which are complex and very demanding.\" Though he did not say when his resignation would take effect, a potential date is January 13 when Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi is due to give up the country's rotating six-month presidency of the Council of the European Union. Renzi faces a political challenge in organizing a replacement for Napolitano, dubbed by Italian media as \"King George.\" The president has served as a key intermediary between political parties through numerous changes in government and other tricky political situations. Napolitano, a former communist respected by Europe and Washington, took office in 2006. At the end of his seven-year mandate in 2013, he was asked to stay on because parliament could not agree on his successor. At the time he warned he may not serve out the full term, given his age. In Italy, presidents have loosely-defined powers including the ability to nominate prime ministers, dissolve parliament and veto legislation, as well as use the moral authority of the office to influence politics. se/cmk (dpa, Reuters)",

Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi said on Wednesday he would step down from his post on January 13. \"I have decided that I will step aside from my current position,\" Renzio said in a statement. The Italian president had been in office since 2006, when he was appointed to the post of prime minister of Italy. He was replaced by Italian President Mario Monti, who took over in January 2013 after the collapse of a coalition government in the country's eastern heartland. Italy, which is now the world's third-largest economy after Germany and the United Kingdom, is expected to elect a new president by the end of this year. It will be the first time Italy has had a president who has been president since the beginning of his term in 2006. In his resignation, Italy will have to decide whether it wants to continue as a member state or whether the new government will continue to be led by a non-European president. Napolano's resignation comes as Italy is set to host a summit of EU leaders in Brussels later this month, with the aim of setting the stage for the next round of negotiations on the bloc's membership. Former Italy president Napoletano was widely seen as one of Europe's most powerful men. His resignation came just days after Italy announced that it would no longer be able to hold the rotating presidency of its 28-member bloc, due to a lack of support from the EU's 27 member states, including Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, Greece, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Turkey, Ukraine and Romania. France and Italy have also been at loggerheads in recent weeks over the appointment of an anti-corruption prosecutor to lead the investigation into the corruption scandal at the former Italian prosecutor's office in Rome. A spokesman for Italy\u2019s interior ministry said the president was \"deeply disappointed\" by his ouster, adding that he had \"no idea\" what was happening in Italy and that there was no reason to believe that Italy was going to do what it was doing."

The spokesman said more help was needed, but could not give exact numbers \"due to pending assignments.\" Recent soccer violence raises concern Swiss media has been questioning the security preparations for Euro 2008 after a spate of violence at recent games. In the latest incident, seats were ripped out and a goal post wrenched from the ground after St. Gallen faced the prospect of relegation following a 2-0 defeat to Bellinzona on May 20. St. Gallen was the third incident in a month that saw violent clashes with police who twice resorted to rubber bullets and tear gas. While Switzerland is seen as a low risk country in terms of hooliganism, violence has been on the increase in recent years and estimates claim there are around 400 hooligans and 600 sympathizers. Swiss Sports Minister Samuel Schmid said that hooliganism cannot be ruled out, reported German news agency DPA. But he expressed his belief that extra measures such as more policing, restrictions on alcohol -- which he has called \"a catalyst for violence\" -- and video surveillance will help keep trouble at bay. Private firms to boost European police The private security companies will be responsible for patrolling the stadiums and their surroundings, as well as the public viewing areas, team hotels and trainings areas. An international police force will manage the rest. Switzerland has committed some 31,200 police officers and soldiers. Another 1,700 police will be sent from Germany, which will have the authority to make arrests. France will offer the third largest contingent with 750 officers and Croatia, Poland, Sweden, Greece, Russia and Spain will also send reinforcements.",

Conservative members of Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition put forward a united front at the weekend against recent developments in the city of Wuppertal. Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said civilians wearing uniforms bearing the logo \"Shariah police\" could not simply start patrolling German streets. The groups reportedly hovered around sites like discotheques and gambling houses, telling passers-by to refrain from gambling and alcohol. Wuppertal's police have begun pressing charges. \"Sharia law is not tolerated on German soil,\" de Maiziere told mass-circulation daily Bild on Saturday. \"Nobody can take it upon themselves to abuse the good name of the German police.\" Justice Minister Heiko Maas, meanwhile, told Bild that \"the state alone\" was responsible for the administration of justice in Germany. It was obvious, Maas said, that any illegal parallel system of law enforcement would not be tolerated. Christian Democrat party whip Volker Kauder was similarly emphatic in an interview to be published in this week's Welt am Sonntag newspaper. \"Under absolutely no circumstances can we tolerate self-styled 'Sharia police officers' patrolling our streets and dictating what people should or should not do,\" Kauder said. Ringleader: goal was attention The 33-year-old behind the Wuppertal patrols, former fireman Sven Lau, published a video on his website on Saturday. Lau said that a \"Sharia police\" never existed, and that a group of men had simply worn the mock uniforms for a few hours. \"We knew that this would raise attention,\" Lau said, claiming that his goal was to spark a debate about Sharia law in Germany. Lau is a leading member of Germany's Salafist movement, advocates of a strict Sunni interpretation of political Islam. He works with a mosque in his native M\u00f6nchengladbach, not far west of Wuppertal, and used to head the fundamentalist group \"Invitation to Paradise.\" (Einladung zum Paradies, in German.) The central council of Muslims in Germany (ZMD) condemned the activities. \"These few teen yobs do not speak in our name,\" chairman Ayman A. Mazyek told the Tagesspiegel am Sonntag newspaper. \"These people are perverting the name of our religion. With this shrill and foolish action, they are really hurting Muslims.\" Sharia law is the Arabic term for a legal system based on the Koran. Saudi Arabia and Iran are examples of countries where such a system officially applies. Wearing a veil is obligatory for women and corporal punishment such as stoning is legally tolerated. Human Rights Watch reported last month that Saudi Arabia had beheaded 19 people in just 16 days in August, for convictions on charges ranging from cannabis smuggling to \"sorcery.\" msh/rc (AFP, dpa, Reuters)",

It sided with a German firm in its legal battle with US giant Oracle. The European Court of Justice on Tuesday ruled that used software licenses may generally be resold by individuals or companies. The Luxembourg-based court thus sided with the German firm UsedSoft in a protracted legal battle with US software giant Oracle. The ruling made it clear that trade in used software was permissible even if the software had not been shipped on a physical medium such as a CD or DVD, but had been digitally downloaded from the Internet. UsedSoft's business model hinges completely on reselling used packages or legally obtained license keys for them. By reselling the keys to clients, the latter are then able to download the latest version of a given program directly from a company's Internet site and obtain all new updates and patches in the process. Legal clarity Oracle had sued UsedSoft over its business model, trying to prevent buyers of used software licenses from downloading programs again. But the European court ruled that the so-called principle of exhaustion applied whenever software was originally sold to a customer for an unlimited time span, not giving the maker of the software the right to prevent the resale of that software. \"The door for the trade in used software has been pushed wide open throughout the European Union,\" UsedSoft said in a statement, welcoming \"perfect legal safety on the market.\" The court in Luxembourg emphasized, though, that whoever resold pieces of original software and their accompanying licenses must erase every copy on their own computers in advance and was not allowed to keep a copy after resale. hg/mz (AFP, dpa)",

The decision by the European Union's top court in Strasbourg is the latest in a series of rulings on the legality of reselling software. In a ruling published on Tuesday, the EU's highest court said it was permissible for resellers to sell their software to customers without a license. \"This is an important step in the fight against copyright infringement,\" the court's ruling said, adding that the decision was \"in accordance with the law.\" The court also said that users of the software should not be reselled unless they have a valid license to do so, which would be a violation of EU law. It said the ruling was the result of a \"technical dispute\" over a software application that was downloaded by an individual user, and not a legal dispute between the user and the company that downloaded the application. EU court rules that software can be downloaded without an author's consent The ruling came as a surprise to many users, who had been expecting a similar ruling from the same court earlier this year, but were instead surprised to learn that a court had ruled in favor of Microsoft. Microsoft, Oracle, SAP and SAP have all said they would no longer sell software which they say infringes their patents. They have argued that Microsoft's software does not infringe the rights of users and therefore cannot be sold to third parties. Oracle has said its software is not subject to copyright protection and that its customers should be able to opt out of it. SAP, Microsoft and Oracle are among the companies that have been accused of violating the terms of their license by downloading software from their servers. Both companies have denied the allegations, saying that they were merely trying to protect users' privacy. A court ruling Tuesday also found that Oracle and other software vendors are not liable for the infringement of customers' intellectual property rights. According to court documents, used-memory software such as Oracle's \"UsedSoft,\" which is used to store data stored on servers, can only be used by third-party software providers. That means that if a user downloads a file, they can't sell the file to a third party, even if they don't have the right to access the data. This ruling, however, could lead to the creation of an \"unlawful market\" in which users are unable to profit from pirated software, according to an analysis by dpa, a German news agency."

The Curiosity rover will soon re-start its sluggish search for signs of life. NASA's Mars rover, \"Curiosity,\" will wrap up a lengthy self-testing phase on Thursday, freeing it up to continue exploring the surface of the Red Planet. Mission manager Jennifer Tropser told reporters in a conference call on Wednesday evening that the plan, once the final checks were completed, was to \"drive, drive, drive\" until Curiosity discovers a rock suitable for analysis. She added that the instrument checks have delivered positive results. \"Through every phase of the check-out, Curiosity has performed almost flawlessly,\" Tropser said. \"The success so far of these activities has been outstanding.\" Many of the tests have concerned Curiosity's robotic arm. The 2.1-meter (7-feet) appendage will be used to pick out and sample rocks and soil. NASA is investigating whether Mars can sustain life, or whether it could in the past. The tests were designed to identify any damage sustained during its interplanetary flight and also to ensure that the arm still functioned properly on Mars, with its different temperatures and gravity. The Mars rover landed in the giant Gale Crater, near the Martian equator, on August 5; it has so far moved about 109 meters within the crater. The rover is traveling east, heading first to an intersection called Glenelg, where three types of terrain meet. This is likely to be the location for the first rock and soil samples, though NASA said Curiosity was unlikely to arrive there for several weeks. Curiosity's ultimate destination is the nearby Aeolis Mons or Mount Sharp, a 3-mile-high mound of rock rising out of the crater. Mount Sharp is about 4.3 miles (7 kilometers) away from Curiosity's landing site. The $2.5-billion (1.93-billion-euro) six-wheeled rolling science lab is designed to last two years in order to complete its Mars mission. msh/jm (AFP, AP, Reuters)",

The rover is due to be launched on August 5, after two years of testing on the Red Planet. On Thursday, NASA announced that the rover had completed its first self test of the Martian surface, Mount Sharp, in Gale Crater. \"We are very pleased with the results,\" NASA spokeswoman Jennifer Tropser said in a statement, adding that it was \"very, very good\" that Curiosity was able to get the job done on its own. NASA said on Thursday that \"the results of our tests were very encouraging,\" and that more than 2.5-billion-euro ($2.93 billion) had been invested in the mission. More than 1.3 million people have signed up to take part in Curiosity's two-year mission, which began on Wednesday, and is expected to last for two and a half years. Read more: NASA launches Curiosity mission to Mars NASA has launched a new rover, Curiosity, to test its ability to detect and detect alien life on Mars. It's the first of its kind to do so on a manned mission since the Curiosity rover was launched in 2009. In its second year of operation, the spacecraft has already been tested on three different samples of soil samples collected from Mars' surface. All of these samples were collected at the end of Wednesday's mission in Chile, with a total of 3,000 samples taken from the ground and tested for life-reservation potential. Some of those samples, however, were found to not be suitable for manned missions, according to the US space agency. Other samples are being tested at a site in southern Chile called Aeolis Mons, near the southern tip of Mars, where Curiosity began its journey on May 19. Troopser added that she was impressed by how well the tests went, saying that they showed \"a lot of good things\" about Curiosity. She also said that there was a \"huge amount of positive feedback\" from tests on other samples. That's a good sign, she said, because the test results could be used to determine whether or not the robot is capable of detecting the presence of extraterrestrial life, such as humans or other extraterrestrials."

        "target": "Aging health: WHO call to action as world population over 60 set to double by 2050 In a new report on aging and health, the World Health Organization is calling for action on \"population aging,\" as figures suggest the number of people over 60 will reach two billion by 2050. People worldwide are living longer, says the World Health Organization in its World Report on Aging and Health. This is both good and bad. It gives us the chance to \"pursue new activities\" as we get older, such as in education and family life. But it all depends on our health. And for that the WHO says world governments need to act now to make sure our societies worldwide are ready. What are the take home facts from the World Health Organization's 2015 report on Aging and Health? The WHO says that in the next 35 years, the global number of people aged 60 years and over will almost double from 12 percent to 22 percent. By 2020, there will be more people over the age of 60 than 5 year olds. And a majority of older people (80 percent) will live in \"low and middle income\" countries. It's estimated that the world's population aged 60 years and older will total about 2 billion in 2050, which is more than twice as much as now. Furthermore, worldwide, about 125 million people are aged 80 years or older. But by 2050, it is expected that this number of people - aged 80 and over - will live in China alone. But I'm not old, so why should I care? Well, all this is happening at a faster rate than ever before. And the WHO says \"all countries face major challenges to ensure that their health and social systems are ready\" for this major demographic shift. It will cost a lot of money to improve health and social infrastructures, especially in more developed countries where traditional families structures have changed dramatically. Surely, there's \"no typical older person,\" though. How does the WHO define aging? We tend to think of older people as physically and mentally frail. But that's not necessarily the case, not everywhere in the world. Old is a relative concept - especially in middle income to rich countries. For instance, some 70 year olds are as fit as some 20 year olds. Just think how many older folk are at your gym, and ask yourself whether you can keep up with all of them. But that still doesn't explain aging. What is it exactly? The WHO says that at a biological level, \"aging results from the impact of the accumulation of a wide variety of molecular and cellular damage over time.\" Basically, this puts people at a higher risk of disease and, of course, death. But aging can also be associated with \"life transitions,\" such as retirement or witnessing other people, such as friends and family, die around you. This can affect you psychologically and sometimes, as a result, physically. What sort of diseases come with old age? Some of the most common non-fatal conditions include hearing loss, cataracts, back and neck pain and osteoarthritis. Other conditions include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - which affects the lungs - diabetes, depression, and dementia. What needs to be done? The WHO is proposing a five-step plan of action, which includes: Committing to healthy aging and \"evidence-based policies to strengthen the abilities of older persons.\" Aligning health systems with the needs of older populations Developing systems for providing long-term care Creating \"age-friendly cities and communities Improving measurement, monitoring and understanding of \"aging issues\" worldwide. But don't forget: \"a longer life brings with it opportunities, not only for older people and their families, but also for societies as a whole.\"",
        "generated_story": "The World Health Organization (WHO) has released a new report on aging and health in the next 35 years. The report, which is expected to be published by the end of the year, predicts that some 70 year olds will die before the age of 60 in 2050. According to the report published in 2015, around 80 percent of people aged 60 and older will live to 80 years of age. This is a significant increase from 60 years ago, when the average age was 60. However, the WHO said that by 2050, some 20 year old children will have reached the 60-year-old mark. \"This is an important milestone for the world's population,\" said WHO's chief medical officer, Dr. Margaret Chan, in an interview with the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland. It is also the first time that a WHO report has been published on the health of older people since the 1970s, and it shows that the number of old people living to 60 is rising rapidly, according to WHO data. Some 70 years old men and women have already reached 60, while others are at the mid-80s. In addition to this, there are also some 50,000 children aged between 20 and 60 who will reach 60 by 2020. WHO says that this will be a \"significant milestone\" for aging, as it will help to reduce the risk of death from cardiovascular disease, stroke, cancer and other diseases. But it is not just the elderly who are ageing, it's the younger, more frail and more vulnerable people who have to wait longer for their health to recover from the disease. They will also be more likely to die from old age as well as from cancer, diabetes, heart disease and cancer. World health experts say that in order to prevent these diseases, people should be able to live longer and healthier lives. That is, they say, if they have the means to get older and have a better chance of surviving longer. These are the factors that will make them more susceptible to diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and dementia. As a result of these factors, many of them will not live long enough to benefit from life-long health care, particularly in developing countries. At the same time, these younger people will still need to take care of themselves and their families. And that's a big problem for young people, because they will no longer have access to care for themselves or their loved ones. So, for those who can't afford to have children, this is going to become a major challenge for them. There are a lot of factors at play. One of those factors is the aging process. For example, over 80 million people are living longer than they should have been in their 20s or 30s by now. Another factor is that they won't have as many children as they used to. What's more important is their ability to cope with their own health problems. If they do, then they'll have more time to adapt and adapt to their new lifestyles. How will they adapt? The WHO has set a goal of reducing the burden of health-related illness by 60 percent by 2030. By 2020, that number will rise to 70 percent, but that doesn't necessarily mean that all of their children would be well-versed in life expectancy."

It is a reflection of his current inauspicious Formula One campaign that World Champion Michael Schumacher is only featuring in reports on this weekend's German Grand Prix at Hockenheim dues to his nationality. The home grown champion equaled his own record of 11 wins in a season at last year's race but this year he will be hoping to just get on the podium at the end. Schumi lies in third place some 34 points off the top spot and has a lot to do if he is to record his 85th career win. Ferrari's poor season to date is unlikely to get better with hopes dwindling that the 36-year-old will add to his sole victory of the season although the seven-time world champion characteristically refuses to rule it out. Schumi and Ferrari still in the fight \"Contrary to many other people's opinions, we have in no means written ourselves off, even though we have to admit that the situation has worsened recently, rather than improved,\" said the German, referring to the problems with this season's car. \"But that doesn't mean that it can't be improved again, and that's exactly what we're working on.\" The limelight is falling on two young pretenders to Schumacher's throne as Sunday's race approaches. The battle between McLaren's flying Finn Kimi Raikkonen and championship leader Renault's speedy Spaniard Fernando Alonso is diverting eyes from the world record holding German on his own turf. Kimi aims to keep heat on leader Alonso Raikkonen must finish the German Grand Prix for the first time in five attempts to close the gap on Alonso if he is to keep his own championship hopes alive. The Finn retired from last year's race because of a rear wing failure and this season has been plagued by technical problems which most recently cost him 10 places on the starting grid in each of the last two rounds. Despite those penalties for engine failure, the 25-year-old managed to finish second and third but he will have to increase his total of three race wins if he is to make a significant impression on the 26-point chasm that separates him from Alonso. \"The battle for the championship is still on and I am determined to get a good result and work on closing the gap,\" said the Finn. \"The (car) has good speed and we need to make the most of it this weekend.\" Montoya doing McLaren team mate no favors Raikkonen's car is obviously a fast one this season but he's not the only driver in a McLaren hot seat. Colombia's Juan Pablo Montoya is not to going to make way for his team mate while his own hopes of the title, however small, remain alive. \"I am really looking forward to racing again this weekend in Germany,\" said Montoya, who won at Hockenheim for Williams two years ago and got his first victory for McLaren in Britain two weeks ago. \"I enjoy racing at Hockenheim, I have performed well here and won in the past and I am aiming for a strong result like at Silverstone.\" Consistent Ferdy the man to beat at Hockenheim Championship leader Alonso, meanwhile, has been impressively consistent for Renault so far this season, winning five times and failing to score points only at the Canadian Grand Prix, where he crashed, and in Indianapolis. The Spaniard is setting the pace and the standard this season so, problems aside, Alonso will again be the man to beat at Hockenheim.",
        "generated_story": "Alonso and Raikkonen in battle for German Formula One crown at Hockenheim The Spanish driver and Ferrari driver are set to battle it out in the German Grand Prix on Sunday. The two-time world champion will take on Ferrari's Juan Pablo Montoya in a battle between the two drivers for the title this year. Both drivers will be looking for their first victory of the season in Germany, with the Spaniard looking to win his second title in as many years. \"I'm going to try and win this weekend,\" said Alonso, who has won the last three races of his career, including last year's German GP and the Canadian GP. Alonso has already secured his first world title with Ferrari in two years, and he will try to repeat that feat with his fourth win in five races this season. He will also be hoping to make it to the final round of qualifying at Silverstone, where he is expected to challenge for a spot in next year\u2019s championship. Last year, he finished fourth in qualifying, but this time around he has a chance to take the crown with a victory in Canada. Ferrari, meanwhile, have already clinched the championship with two races remaining in their three-year championship reigns. They will now be joined by McLaren driver Michael Schumacher, a former Ferrari teammate, Fernando Alonso and Kimi Raikonen, both of whom have been on the verge of retirement since the end of last season, respectively. In Canada, Ferrari and McLaren are the only two teams that have yet to announce a new driver for next season's Canadian grand prix, while McLaren have announced that they will not be renewing their driver's licence until 2018. That would be the first time since 2011 that Alonso had been able to compete with McLaren's Sebastian Vettel in his last race, which took place in Mexico two weeks ago. It was the second time in three years that Ferrari has been unable to find a driver to fill the gap left by Alonso. On the other hand, the Japanese driver is looking forward to a return to racing in 2018, when he hopes to become the world's most successful driver. But Alonso is also hoping that he can get back on track and take a step back from his long-term absence from the sport. After all, it's only a matter of time before he returns to his former team, McLaren, to face his old rival, Juan Francisco Monto. And that's not just a question of whether he'll be back at the track next weekend. This weekend, Alonso will have to decide whether or not he wants to go back to McLaren or Ferrari again, as he's been struggling with an ankle injury that has kept him out of practice for several races. If he doesn't, his chances of making it back into the top 10 will depend on how well he handles his new car and how he manages to stay on top of it. With Ferrari now in pole position, there's a lot of pressure on him to keep up his form and stay up to date with new drivers. For now, though, all eyes are on Alonso as the race is on. His best chance is to get into his McLaren team and make the most of a potential breakthrough in 2017. However, if he fails to do that, then it could be a very different story for Ferrari. Fernando has always been a good driver, even if his car is not as good as it used to be. At the same time, that could mean he might not get the job done at McLaren."

She will share the prestigious award with US compatriot Oliver Williamson. The jury from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said the Americans' research had shown how \"economic analysis can shed light on most forms of social organization.\" Ostrom, a professor at Indiana University, was honored for her \"analysis of economic governance,\" especially in relation to the management of common property or property under common control. The political scientist's work challenges the widely accepted belief that common property is poorly managed and should be either regulated by central authorities or privatized, it added. She carried out numerous studies showing how self-organization and local-level management work to keep common resources viable. Her studies included both natural resources, such as forests, and artificial structures, for example police forces. Ostrom told Swedish television that she felt \"great surprise and appreciation\" and was \"in shock\" about being the first woman to win the prize. The pros and cons of big firms In his work, co-prizewinner Oliver Williamson, of University of California, Berkeley, examines why large corporations tend to arise - and why they do not - based on the cost and complexity of transactions, according to the Nobel committee. \"He has taught us to regard markets, firms, associations, agencies, and even households from the perspective of their contribution to the resolution of conflict,\" the jury said. Williamson authored 'The Economic Institutions of Capitalism' in 1975, a landmark text of the 'new institutional economics' movement that questioned the idea of firms as simple profit-making machines. Last but not least The Nobel prize for economics is the only Nobel award that was not created by the will of Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel in 1896. It was actually founded by the Swedish central bank, the Sverige Riksbank, to celebrate its tri-centenary a year earlier. It was awarded for the first time in 1969 under its official name: the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel. But although it was the last \"Nobel prize\" to be created and the last to be announced each year, the prize is not a poor relation in monetary terms. Winners of the awards for peace, literature, medicine, physiology, chemistry and physics all receive 10 million Swedish crowns (969,000 euros). A good year for women This year was a record year for women laureates. German-Romanian writer Herta Mueller won the Nobel Prize for Literature. Australian-American Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider of the United States were awarded the prize for medicine. And Ada Yonath of Israel was one of three scientists recognized for her work in chemistry. Americans more or less swept the board this year. Nine of the 11 laureates were US citizens.

        "generated_story": "Nobel Peace Prize winner Elinor Ostrom is the first woman to win the prize for economics. The Swedish Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel was awarded in 1968 by the Swedish Academy of Sciences (Sveriges Riksbank) in memory of the Nobel peace prize winner. Author: Ada Yonath (AFP, Reuters) The award for economic sciences is awarded annually to the best economist in the world. It was first awarded to a woman in 1868, and since then it has been given to women. In 1968, the award was handed out to an Australian-American woman who had been a professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley in San Francisco. Since then, women have been awarded more prizes for their work in economics than men. Last year's winner was the Australian Nobel Laureate Carol Greider, who was born in Australia in 1896 and died in New York in 1975. She was one of only two women to receive the prestigious prize, which she won in 1972, when she received a 10 million Swedish crowns ($969,000 euros) prize. \"I'm very honored to have won this award,\" she said in an interview with AFP news agency, adding that she was \"very proud\" of her achievements. 'I was very proud of my achievements' In the year that followed, a number of Nobel Peace Prizes were awarded, including the most recent, 'The Economic Institutions of Capitalism' (2016), which was presented to her by her husband, Oliver Williamson, in a ceremony marking the 50th anniversary of Adolf Nobel's death. This year, Williamson will be presented with a lifetime achievement award. He will receive a cash prize of 10.5 million euros ($11.7 million) for his work on the topic of economic research. Williamson is also a former professor at Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana, where he taught economics for a year and a half, before moving on to other fields, such as political science and social sciences. On top of that, he will also receive an honorary doctorate in economic studies from the American University, Stanford University and the Institute for the Study of Economic and Social Problems (ISRI). Williamson was a member of a group of researchers who were able to study the economics of human capital in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, Ireland and Switzerland. His research was published in his book, \"The Economics of Capital,\" and he won a Nobel prize in Economics in 1969. During his time as president of ISRI, William was also awarded a second time in 1970, this time for an economics degree. A year earlier, his wife, Ada, gave him the same award, but he was unable to accept it because of an illness that prevented him from returning to his studies. When he returned to Sweden in 1973, she died of cancer. After a long illness, her son, Sam Edmonds, was diagnosed with leukemia and was given a life-threatening heart attack. Her husband died the following year. At the time of his death, Samuel Williamson had just received his first Nobel award in 1964. Now he has a wife and two children."

        "target": "The Sun Sets Slowly Over Brandenburg's Tropical Dream Having suffered many disappointments concerning publically funded projects, the state of Brandenburg hoped a tropical leisure center would offer a ray of hope. Instead the ailing concern is just bringing more gloom. The economically depressed eastern German state of Brandenburg has seen its fair share of bitter experiences when it comes to huge public investment projects since German unification in 1990. Against this background, state authorities were pleased when Malaysian businessman Colin Au built a huge tropical-feeling leisure center in Brandenburg without any subsidies. The center, which opened about a year ago, was to become a symbol of economic success in a region where unemployment still hovers around the 20 percent mark. But the leisure time park, which has already swallowed a little under 100 million euros ($120 million) in private investment, is now going to have to depend on public funding to avoid another economic fiasco in Brandenburg. State authorities in Brandenburg haven't been too successful in their public investment policy in the past 10 years, to put it mildly. A grand plan to build one of the world's most modern chip-producing factories there burst like a bubble in 2003. The much-talked about Brandenburg-Berlin International airport still seems light years away from being built. Line of failures looked to be ended by Au's vision Another beacon of economic hope disappeared in 2002 when a company planning to build gas-filled transport airships went bust despite considerable subsidies. But Au's vision for the abandoned dome which the airship company needed as a hangar offered Brandenburg another chance. In the middle of nowhere, he created what he named his \"Tropical Islands\" wonderland, sporting everything from sandy beaches, lakes and a Laguna to a Caribbean-style village. The economics ministry in Brandenburg was over the moon to see Au originally agreeing to build the facility without any state subsidies. And Au himself had no doubt at the time that he could well do without them. Overestimated visitor numbers tell sorry story But the center's first year in operation tells a different story. Colin Au, who has meanwhile left Brandenburg and transferred matters to a German management company, had expected some 1.5 million visitors to come to Tropical Islands within the first year, but only some 950,000 will have turned up by the end of 2005. It seems highly unlikely that visitor numbers will increase considerably in future, placing a question mark on the viability of the whole centre. But Brandenburg's economics ministry is certain that the park will be in the black as of 2008. To make the place more attractive, it has agreed to shell out 15 million euros in subsidies for yet another reconstruction and marketing effort. After all, the leisure time center has a workforce of about 500 and is thus the biggest employer in an otherwise depressed region marked by a high jobless rate. Tropical center down but not out...not yet \"We hope the money will help make the Tropical Islands resort better known throughout Europe according to the new marketing concept hammered out the management,\" ministry spokesman Steffen Kammrath said. \"This leisure time center is unique and has to be marketed as such. What you have there is a tropical and water world 12 months a year with a lot of attractive offers to spend a whale of a time there.\" Some commentators believe that state subsidies may prolong the center's life span, but will not be able to avoid its demise in the long run. But the idea of also making it more attractive for tourists from all over Europe seems unrealistic to them if the resort's management can't even get enough visitors from home to ensure a profitable operation.",
        "generated_story": "The Sun Sets Slowly Over Brandenburg's Tropical Islands Resort The sun sets slowly over the tropical islands of the German resort town of Tropical Island in the southern German state of Lower Saxony. A little under 100 million euros ($120 million) has been invested into the resort since 2003. The resort is located on the island of Laguna, a Caribbean-style island off the coast of southern Germany. It is the first of its kind in Germany, and it has attracted a lot of attention for the past 10 years. In 2003, it became the largest resort in Europe, with more than 30,000 visitors a year. Since then, there have been a number of developments, including the opening of a new theme park and a brand-new theme hotel, which opened in 2002. However, in 2005, the property was sold to a private investor, Steffen Kammrath, for a total of 15 million euro ($15 million). The property is now owned by a group of investors who have invested in it since the beginning of 2005. \"We are very happy with the results,\" said Colin Au, chief executive officer of Berlin-Berlin International. He added that the company was \"very pleased\" with its results, adding that \"it is a great success\" and that it is looking forward to the next phase of development. 'The sun is setting slowly,' he said, \"and we are going to continue to invest in this resort.\" \"It is very exciting to be able to spend so much money on this project,\" he added, referring to his company's investments in developing and expanding the brand. His company has also been investing in new facilities, such as a hotel and restaurant, as well as in expanding its network of retail stores and online retail outlets. They have also invested heavily in infrastructure and are now looking to expand their retail presence in a bid to attract new customers. This has led to an increase in demand for their products and services, particularly in low-cost, high-end resorts. But it's not just the hotels that are attracting new visitors. There are also a host of new restaurants, bars, restaurants and bars that have opened up their doors to new business models. One of these restaurants is known as the \"Tropical Islands,\" which is named after the name of one of Germany's most famous Caribbean islands. And that's where the sun set slowly. At the end of 2002, they opened their first store, at a cost of 120 million Euros ($140 million), and the store was closed. Now, their store is open to visitors for 12 months."

        "target": "Bayern's Klinsmann Praises, Hoeness Attacks Hoffenheim The Bundesliga's two top teams don't play until Friday, but the mind games are already underway. Bayern's coach Juergen Klinsmann says Hoffenheim are legitimate contenders, but commercial manager Uli Hoeness disagrees. When the Bundesliga scheduled Bayern's home match against Hoffenheim in the league's unloved Friday night slot, they probably didn't imagine that it would turn out to be the match of the first half of the season. Indeed, few experts or fans thought that Hoffenheim, a first-division debutante located in a southern German village with 3,000 inhabitants, would give mighty Munich a run for its money. But it's the first week of December, and Hoffenheim top the table by three points. They also have a much better goal difference than their second-placed rivals -- and that has drawn praise from Bayern's coach, Juergen Klinsmann. \"I have the highest estimation of Hoffenheim because they've built the squad very ambitiously, rationally and with very good players,\" Klinsmann told DPA news agency. \"They can be proud of that.\" Klinsmann said he thought that the club could establish itself among the top three or four sides in Germany in the years to come and qualify for international competition next season. He also had words of praise for Hoffenheim's software billionaire patron, Dietmar Hopp, whose money has funded the club's ascent. \"There's nothing negative about it,\" Klinsmann said. \"He used to play for the club, is a soccer man through and through and helped the team get on its feet.\" Some fans have criticized Hopp and Hoffenheim for paying inflating salaries and luring talent away from other clubs instead of developing homegrown players. In fact, Hoffenheim's official salary budget is about average for the Bundesliga. Hoeness sounds his horn But while Bayern's coach was praising his opponents to the skies, Munich's commercial manager Uli Hoeness has been trying to play with their heads. On the heels of Bayern's convincing win over Leverkusen last weekend, Hoeness is back to taunting rivals. \"The performance we showed in the second half against Leverkusen will be enough against Hoffenheim,\" Hoeness told the German soccer magazine kicker. Hoeness also dropped a none-too-thinly-veiled hint that Hoffenheim's personnel expenditures were far higher than the officially released figures and scoffed at the idea that strategy would determine the outcome of Friday's match. \"Games are decided by the better players, not by tactics,\" Hoeness said. \"And of course, we've got better players than Hoffenheim.\" But that particular verbal attack may represent some wishful thinking of the manager's part. Hoffenheim coach Ralf Rangnick is one of only two current Bundesliga skippers with a winning record against Munich. Rangnick, whose team cruised past Bielefeld last weekend to keep Bayern three points back, reacted to Hoeness' remarks with a shrug. \"We're preparing for Munich exactly the same way we did against Bielefeld,\" Rangnick said. In any case, soccer fans in Germany know what they'll be doing Friday evening -- finding a bar with cable sports television to watch a top match that no one, before the start of the season, would have considered possible.",
        "generated_story": "Hoeness Reacts to the First Half of the Bundesliga Season Hoffenheim's Commercial Manager has responded to a question about the club's first half of its Bundesliga campaign. The German side's commercial manager, Dietmar Hopp, said he was \"very happy\" with the results of Friday's match against Bayern Munich. \"I am very happy that we are in a good position,\" he said, adding that he hoped the match would be \"a great success.\" \"We have a lot of work to do in the first week of December and we will be working very hard to make sure that everything is going to be a success for us,\" said Hopping, who has been in charge since the end of last season. He added that the team's goal-line coach, Juergen Klinsmann, \"will be able to give us the best possible result in terms of quality and consistency in our game.\" The Bundesliga's most successful club, Leverkusen, is currently in first place in Germany's top-flight, with a total of 19 points from 19 games. But it's still a long way to go, and it will take some time to get used to it. On Friday night, the German club announced that they would not be renewing their contract until December, which would give them the right to renew the contract for the rest of this season, as well as the option to extend the current deal until January, when they will have to decide whether or not they want to re-sign the former Bayern man. A move that would have been unthinkable at the time, however, has now been approved by the league's executive committee, Ralf Rangnick, after a meeting between the two sides in Munich on Friday evening. In an interview with DPA news agency, he also said that his club was looking forward to continuing to work hard on the new contract. H\u00f6ness said: \"The club is very pleased with our progress so far. We are very excited to see what the future holds for our club and the players. I think we can do a great job in this competition.\" A positive sign for Hoffenhofen's business is the fact that, in spite of a lack of success in recent years, they have managed to win the domestic league title with ease. They are also looking to improve on their recent form, where they are on course to reach the Champions League quarter-finals. That is, if they can keep up with Bayern's form and stay on top of their Bundesliga table. This is a very positive development for them, but it is also an important step in their long-term development. It is important to remember that in order to achieve this goal, you need to keep your head above water and your feet above the water. At the very least, that means that you must be willing to take risks and stick to your game plan. And that's what we're doing. Last week, Bayern were the only team to beat the second-placed side, so that was a positive result for Bayern. Bayern, meanwhile, had to settle for a 1-1 draw with Hoffengladbach. After a 3-0 win over Leverkirchen on Thursday night in Stuttgart, Schalke and Borussia Dortmund, Dortmund are now in third place, just one point behind the top two. With the loss of Bayern and Dortmund to Bayern last weekend, it seems as though the squad is in good shape as a whole. However, there is still room for improvement, even if it isn't as good as last week's result."

        "target": "Automation in the dairy cow industry A small but nevertheless important sector of the German economy today is agriculture. Although the number of farms has declined over the decades, production has actually increased -- especially at dairy farms. Modern automation technology and robotics are helping to keep both cows and farmers happy, but at the cost of jobs.",
        "generated_story": "Dairy Cow Industry: Automation in the Dairy Industry In the decades since the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), the dairy cow industry has been transformed into a whole new kind of industry. Dairy cows, for example, have become the world's largest dairy cows. But there is still a lot of work to be done, and there are still plenty of challenges to overcome. In order to meet these challenges, we have to make the most of the advances in technology and innovation. We need a new way of doing things, so we are going to focus on the areas that are most important to us, such as milk production, milk processing, dairy products, meat processing and dairy processing. This means that we need to invest in new technologies and new processes that will enable us to do the things we can't do today. That's why we've got to think about the future of dairy production and how it will impact our lives and the livelihoods of our customers. There are so many things that can be automated to help us do these things. For instance, there's the fact that the milk cows are no longer producing milk. They are now producing cheese, which is what we call \"dairy milk,\" which means they can produce milk without the need for refrigeration. And they are growing fast. The milk cow is becoming the next big thing in dairy farming. It's becoming more and more important than ever to grow milk and milk in a dairy environment. Now, it's all about technology, not just in milk, but also in meat production as well. With the rise in demand for milk from dairy farmers across the globe, more milk is being produced and less is needed to supply the cows with the nutrients they need. As a result of this growing demand, the cow has become a major supplier of milk to dairy companies. However, this is not the case with milk-producing cows as it is with cow-milk products. Milk production is growing at a very fast pace and demand is expected to continue to rise. At the same time, farmers are increasingly turning to automated processes to reduce the number of cows that die each year, thereby reducing the risk of over-harvesting cows and thus increasing milk demand. These processes are also becoming increasingly automated, with more cows being slaughtered every year and fewer cows dying every day. So, in an effort to cut down on overproduction and reduce milk consumption, some cows have been given the option of using automated machinery to process milk for the first time in their lives. What's more, these machines are becoming much more efficient and efficient, making it easier for farmers to produce their milk more efficiently and efficiently, thus reducing milk costs and increasing the efficiency and efficiency of their operations. \"We are at the point now where we will be able to manufacture milk as quickly as possible,\" says one dairy farmer, who is also part of a group of farmers who are working on an automated dairy farm. He says the technology will also help farmers in developing new varieties of cow milk that they will use in future. According to a recent report by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) in New York City, automated milk machines will make it possible for them to sell milk at an even higher cost to farmers and ranchers than they currently do in other countries. A new technology is now being developed to address this problem, he says, adding that this technology could be used to improve milk quality and ensure that farmers have access to the best milk products for their cows' milk supply and that milk supplies are available to their customers, rather than just milk companies that do not have the capacity to import milk raw materials from abroad. While this may not be possible in many countries, Dairy Cow is one of those countries that has the highest milk prices in terms of volume and quality, especially in China, where milk has always been the mainstay of production. When it comes to milk sales, that's a good thing, because it makes it so much easier to get milk into the market and then sell it to other dairy processors, particularly those that don't have a milk processor or a cow that doesn't produce enough milk or meat to feed cows for a long period of time. Food production has also become more complex, as the industry is increasingly reliant on automated production methods. Since the 1980s, many milk processors have begun to use automated methods to extract milk with a high level of sugar and sugar content from the raw milk they produce in large quantities. Some of these methods are being phased out in favor of mechanization and automation, while others will only be available in small quantities, according to an industry expert who has worked on dairy operations for many years. If you're not familiar with dairy, you'll be surprised to learn that these products are not available at all. You'll also see the impact that automation has had on our dairy industry, said the expert."

        "target": "Inching towards direct talks on Syria They came to hold talks, but started negotiations with mutual affronts. But if there is one person who might be able to mediate between the intransigent Syrian conflict parties, it's Lakhdar Brahimi. Lakhdar Brahimi, the United Nations special envoy for Syria, seemed very tired on Friday (24.01.2014). He had had a long day, which was actually supposed to be the first real day of negotiations at the Syria Conference in Geneva. \"Good afternoon,\" Brahimi told the assembled international press, before adding, \"or good evening, I don't know.\" At the Palais des Nations in Geneva, he presented the most important result of his attempts to mediate between the Syrian government and the opposition to the more than 250 journalists who had managed to get a coveted place at the press conference: \"Tomorrow we expect and we have agreed that we will meet in the same room.\" What Brahimi is declaring an achievement doesn't sound like much, but considering how irreconcilable the conflict parties have been, even that can be seen as a small success. Separate talks with Brahimi The two delegations were actually due to meet on the first day of negotiations in Geneva in order to agree on a timetable and on the subject and agenda of the talks. But emotions are running too high on both sides. Instead both delegations held separate talks with Lahkkdar Brahimi, both lasting just about an hour each In the morning. The Syrian government delegation had apparently been threatening to leave the conference. At least that is what the deputy foreign minister Faisal Mekdad had implied. \"We are here to start the negotiations,\" he told waiting journalists, \"but we found that the other party did not want to come.\" Before the conference, the opposition had explained that for its delegation, the formation of a transition government would be a central tenet of the negotiations. They emphasized that this topic should be discussed right at the beginning of talks and that the establishment of such a body should be initiated without delay. Social media and good old propaganda The representatives of the Syrian National Coalition that were present in Geneva neatly used all imaginable channels to make their views public. At #Geneva2, they tweeted: \"Forming a transitional body is our major priority,\" leaving people in no doubt that the Syrian National Council would not want to include Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Assad's government, on the other hand, is relying on classic propaganda and loyal state media representatives in Geneva. An impressive entourage of dominant journalists from state-run media outlets is constantly at hand, accompanying the government delegation and making sure they get their point across at press conferences. Lakhdar Brahimi even had a small altercation with a journalist from a Syrian state news agency, who made a political statement under the pretense of asking the UN mediator a question. \"Are there any signs that Saudi Arabia, Turkey and other countries would stop the support of terrorism in Syria?,\" she asked in somewhat shaky English, before Brahimi interrupted her. \"Please, please, there is no point in asking such questions!\" Such exchanges hint at the type of negotiating style the experienced diplomat and mediator Brahimi must have behind the scenes. 'Wish us luck' Lakhdar Brahimi described the preliminary talks that took place in Geneva as encouraging and asked for patience. He said that because the peace conference had come about at the last minute and the delegations had therefore only been appointed very recently, there hadn't been enough time to hold preliminary discussions - a task that the delegations were now catching up on. \"We never expected it to be easy and I'm sure it's not going to be,\" he said. \"But I think the two parties understand what is at stake. Their country is in very, very bad shape.\" He added: \"The huge ambition of this process is to save Syria. Nothing less than that.\" After appealing to the willingness of both parties to negotiate, he simply added: \"So wish us luck!\" Fight for freedom As the official delegations held talks with UN mediator Brahimi in the Palais des Nations, the European headquarters of the United Nations, hundreds of Syrian expatriates who had come from all over Europe protested outside, forming a sea of red, white and black Syrian flags on the Place des Nations. With their presence outside the UN gates they wanted to show that despite all the government propaganda, the Syrian National coalition has a lot of support from the Syrian people. Thirty-two-year-old Ziad Malki came to Geneva from Zurich to show his solidarity. Ziad knows how it feels to be deprived of his freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. In 2005, he was arrested at a demonstration in Damascus and says he was tortured during his time in prison. Now he is fighting for a new Syria from outside the country's borders. Ziad is sure that with Bashar al-Assad and his family, there will be nothing new. \"We don't want this man to be in",

In the morning, he met with a delegation of diplomats from around the globe to mediate over the situation in Aleppo. \"We have been able to reach out to the people of Aleppo,\" he said, adding that he was \"deeply impressed\" by what he had seen from the delegation. The Syrian government, however, rejected the offer, saying that it was only for the sake of peace and stability. It was also the first time in a long time that Brahimi had been in contact with any of Syria's opposition groups, including the Free Syrian Army (FSA), which is fighting the Assad regime in eastern Ghouta, according to a UN report released on Friday (24.01.2014) by UN Special Rapporteur Faisal Mekdad."

        "target": "Italy's navy to patrol with Libyan ships to curb human trafficking Italy wants to work more closely with Libya to limit the number of sea crossings by migrants and potential asylum seekers. But what are the consequences? Italy's prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni, does not want to wait any longer for EU countries to show solidarity in distributing asylum seekers throughout the bloc. On Thursday he announced in Rome that the Italian navy would be patrolling with Libyan ships just off the Libyan coastline. The aim, Gentiloni says, is to curb human trafficking and bring migrants back from the smugglers' boats to Libya. According to the Italian government's figures, 93,000 migrants have arrived in Italy so far this year. At least 2,000 have drowned in the attempt to cross the Mediterranean - the true figure is unknown. Italy has already threatened to stop allowing boats carrying rescued migrants to dock in Italian ports, or that it may issue migrants with documents that would allow them to travel on to other European countries. Rome has not yet implemented either policy, but the government has made clear that Italy will soon run out of options. The EU Commissioner for Migration Dimitris Avramopoulos acknowledged, again, in Brussels on Thursday that \"Europe continues to face high migratory pressures. And Italy more than (almost) any others.\" The European Commission issued a letter offering more aid and personnel to help manage migration better. Accommodation will soon be full The office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, wrote at the beginning of July that \"Close to 200,000 accommodation places are available for refugees and migrants across [Italy], but are nearly all full.\" The High Commissioner referred particularly to the numbers of people dying when he warned, \"What is happening in front of our eyes in Italy is an unfolding tragedy.\" The United Nations anticipates that another 100,000 migrants will come to Italy via Libya before the end of this year. The number of arrivals is already 20 percent higher than last year; and the number of dead, those who could not be saved, would rise accordingly. According to UN estimates, the Mediterranean remains the \"deadliest\" refugee route in the world. Italian government statistics say that around 600,000 people have arrived in Italian ports since the start of the crisis in 2014. It is unclear how many have since traveled on to Austria, France or Switzerland. Once migrants are registered in Italy and accommodated in camps, they are not held there. If, however, they leave the accommodation without giving notice, they forfeit their claim to subsistence and social services. Most of the migrants are from African countries, and many try to travel on to France, for example. 300 people are currently sleeping on the beach in Ventimiglia, on the French border, hoping to take a bus or train to France. However, the border is being policed by French officials. Migrants who are caught are sent back to Italy. Austria has announced that it too will close its border with Italy if the number of migrants starts to rise. Repatriation and distribution are difficult Last year 120,000 new asylum applications were made in Italy. Around 50 percent of these are rejected. The asylum seekers are then supposed to leave the country. However, the process of people either returning voluntarily or being deported is very slow. The interior ministry has therefore announced that it will reinforce repatriation programs. The redistribution of asylum seekers from Italy, as agreed by the European Union, is well behind target. Two years ago the aim was to resettle 120,000 people. So far, only 24,676 people have been redistributed, the EU Commission said on Thursday: 7,873 from Italy, and 16,803 from Greece. The numbers are low not just because of the reluctance of other EU countries to take the refugees in, but also because of Italian delays in the registration of possible candidates. Asylum seekers from Eritrea are the most likely to fulfill the criteria for redistribution. Around 25,000 are currently living in Italy, but only 10,000 have been registered with the EU Commission and the European Asylum Support Office as possible candidates. Migration Commissioner Avramopoulos has announced that Italy will be given more help and logistical support in this area.",

The tournament will be hosted by FIFA, the world's governing body for women. Germany has announced that it is hosting the 2011 edition of the tournament, which will take place in Cologne, Germany, starting with the 2014 edition. It is Germany's first time hosting a major international sporting event since the FIFA women\u2019s soccer competition in 1990. In a statement released on Thursday, FIFA said that Germany would be the only country to hold the event in its history. \"We are very excited about this year's tournament,\" the statement said. According to the German news agency Deutsche Welle, \"we are looking forward to seeing what kind of women we will have in store for 2011.\" Germany is also looking at a host of other major sporting events, such as the soccer World Cups in France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Russia and the United States. There are also plans to have a number of international events planned for the year, including the 2010 FIFA World Championships in London, Paris, New York, Sydney, Abu Dhabi, Moscow, Beijing, Tokyo, Milan, Barcelona, Madrid, Athens, Manchester, London and Sydney. Among them is the 2012 edition, to be held in Berlin, and to feature a total of 16 teams from around the globe. German media reported on Wednesday that the organizers were looking into the possibility of hosting an international competition, in which women would compete against each other for a chance to win a spot on the field of play. Many of those interested in participating in this tournament are already familiar with Germany as a member of FIFA's executive committee. They have already been invited to participate in several international competitions, as well as to compete in some of its most prestigious sporting competitions in recent years. Last year Germany hosted the Women in Sport (WSM) competition at the same venue, where it hosted its first international tournament since 1992. WSM, a German-language news magazine, reported that \"Germany is looking to make the most out of this event.\" The country is hoping to attract a new generation of female athletes to its ranks, with more than 1.5 million spectators expected to flock to Germany in 2012, according to a report in Deutsche Zeitung. Women will also have the opportunity to showcase their talents in a variety of sports and entertainment categories, ranging from boxing, soccer, basketball, gymnastics, tennis and more. DW: \"I think we are going to see a lot of young women in Germany. We are hoping that we can be a part of something that will give them a platform to express themselves in sport and in life,\" said DW's sports editor Stefanie Meyer in an interview published in June."

        "target": "Is China seeking regime-change in North Korea? The sudden reduction in aggressive rhetoric and actions by North Korea has led to suggestions that Pyongyang has realized it has pushed its only ally in the region to the brink of severing its friendship. The announcement in Pyongyang on May 13 of the promotion of Jang Jong-nam to \"minister of the People's Armed Forces\" came out of the blue. Until recently, the little-known commander of an army corps in coastal Kangwon Province, Jang has replaced Kim Kyok-sik, a four-star general with a long track record of loyal service to the regime. The reasons for 70-year-old Kim's replacement are not clear - as with most of the political maneuvers in North Korea - but it may have been his loyalty that cost him his position in the politburo. Kim was widely seen as a hawk in the regime and is believed to have been in command of the operation to shell the South Korean island of Yeonpyeongdo in November 2010, an incident that killed four people, destroyed civilians' homes and infrastructure and dramatically worsened the already strained relationship between Pyongyang and Seoul. By sacrificing Kim, analysts believe, North Korea is signaling that it is backing away from the confrontational stance it adopted after the United Nations imposed new sanctions in the wake of the nation's third underground nuclear test in February. And there are other indicators that Pyongyang is seeking to return to the status quo. The North's troops have been permitted to step down from the highest state of preparedness for war that was initially ordered when South Korea and the US began a series of annual military exercises. Missiles withdrawn Similarly, two Musudan intermediate-range missiles that were identified as being on mobile launchers being operated in eastern areas of the country have apparently been ordered to return to base. In late April, there was concern that test-launches of the missiles would be a further escalation by Kim Jong-un's government and a message that it would not bow to international pressure to halt its nuclear and missile development programs. But the analysts believe the tokens of Pyongyang's goodwill have come too late. \"For the North Korean leader, this is a very difficult time,\" Toshimitsu Shigemura, a professor at Tokyo's Waseda University and an authority on North Korean affairs, told DW. \"Timing is very important here and it is possible that China is moving to abandon Kim Jong-un. The atmosphere between the two nations is changing. China may have decided that it is time for a regime-change in the North, they will not permit the collapse of the country because they do not want chaos on their own borders.\" Further evidence that Beijing is slowly tightening the screw on its erstwhile ally comes as more state-run financial institutions sever their links with banks in North Korea. The latest institution to adhere to the government's orders to halt transactions across the border is the Bank of China, one of the four major banks in the country, which announced on May 7 that it would cease dealings with the Foreign Trade Bank of North Korea, which has been identified as being involved in Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs. Contingency plan in place Intelligence sources have passed on to DW information that Beijing has a contingency plan in place for when Kim Jong-un's control over the country crumbles. The reports confirm that China is indeed quietly encouraging regime change and is grooming Kim's brother, Kim Jong-nam to take over his role. At 42, Kim Jong-nam is the oldest son of Kim Jong-il, the dictator who ruled North Korea with an iron fist for 17 years until his sudden death in December 2011. Kim Jong-nam had been expected to assume the leadership after his father's death, but fell from favor spectacularly in 2001 when he was detained with two women and a boy aged 4 at Tokyo's Narita International Airport travelling on a forged Dominican Republic passport. He later admitted that he had wanted to visit Disneyland. He subsequently lived in Macau and Beijing, under the close watch of the Chinese authorities. The reports suggest that after Kim Jong-nam is installed in Pyongyang, his brother will be permitted to go into exile, probably in China. The tactic is not without its pitfalls, however, in part due to the efficiency of the campaign to deify their young leader as the future of the nation. Kim Jong-nam as 'new king' \"China may be dreaming of appointing Kim Jong-nam as the new king - and he is more preferable to the West than Kim Jong Un - but the problem is that he is not known in North Korea,\" said Ken Kato, director of Tokyo-based Human Rights in Asia. \"Many people in Japan know much about the North Korean 'Royal Family,' but this information is hidden in North Korea,\" he said. \"Even residents of Pyongyang know very little about Kim Jong-nam.\" Yet the reports are gaining credence among North Korea-watchers. Jun Okumura, a political analyst with the Eurasia Group, told DW that North Korea withdrawing",
        "generated_story": "North Korea's 'new king' Kim Jong-un has become the new king of North Korea. The North Korean leader is the world's most powerful man. He is also the leader of the People's Armed Forces (PLA), the country's military, the Foreign Trade Bank of Pyongyang (FTR) and the United Nations (UN). He has been in power for 17 years, but his reign is now over. In his first public speech since taking power in November 2010, Kim Yong-nam said that he wanted to be the \"new leader\" of his country. \"I want to make sure that the people of my country are treated with respect and respect,\" Kim told the audience at the opening ceremony of a peace conference in Pyongyang on May 7. Kim also said he would be willing to work with the UN and other international organizations to improve human rights in the North, including the International Criminal Court (ICC) in New York. On May 13, he was to meet with UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon in Washington, D.C. to discuss his plans for a new era of peace and reconciliation. His visit to Pyongyang came after a failed attempt by the West to oust him from power by a military coup in December 2011. After the failed coup attempt in January 2011, Pyongyang's new leader Kim fled to South Korea, where he is believed to still be living in exile. Since then, however, his regime has changed, and he has returned to his old ways. According to a report published in June 2011 by Human Rights in Asia (HRI), Kim's regime is no longer in a position of power. It is, in fact, now a state of emergency, which has led to the deaths of more than 1,000 people. This is not the first time that Kim has come under fire from the outside world. During his time in office, it was not uncommon for him to receive death threats from his own people, according to HRI. But Kim was also known for his willingness to cooperate with international law enforcement agencies, such as the World Trade Organization (WTO), as well as his close relationship with his wife and two children. At the same time, there was a growing sense of unease among North Koreans about the possibility of Kim becoming the next leader. That is why, for the most part, they don't see it as a threat to their own country at all. They see him as an ally of China, who has a lot to offer. And that is what they see in Kim. So they are going to try to get Kim to give them a chance. If he doesn't, then they will have to wait and see what happens. There are a number of factors that could lead to that. One of them is his lack of trust in authority and his inability to act on his father's wishes. For example, if Kim were to step down as head of state in his native country, that would have been a disaster. Another factor could be his unwillingness to take responsibility for what he's doing. As long as Kim is still alive and able to exert his power, a change in leadership would not be a bad thing. However, one thing is for certain: He's not ready to let go of that power just yet. What does he have in mind? He wants to do something about it. How can he do that? That's the question that will be asked of him. Do you think he'll change his mind about this? How will he deal with it? What do you say to him? The question is whether or not he will give up the power to change the way he treats his people? It's a question of course he does not have a clear answer to this question. You can't just say he won't do it, because he hasn't given up on the idea of changing the rules of engagement. Nor can you give him the chance to decide what kind of person he wants. Why should he change? In the long run, this is a very difficult question to answer. Is he really the one who will decide the fate of all his children and grandchildren? If so, what will the future hold for them? And how will they be treated by his successor? \"We will see,\" said Jun Okumura from Waseda University in Tokyo. Author: Ken Kato (dw)"

Two police officers had been killed in a \"cowardly\" way in the area a week ago, he said. In a similar incident last Friday, 17 gunmen were killed during a shootout with police on a highway in Sinaloa, Mexico's northwestern state. Sinaloa was the home base of Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, whose extradition to the US in January apparently left gangsters in a struggle for control of criminal syndicates.

After successfully weathering the Great Recession, Commerzbank's board of directors appears to want to signal a continuation in its growth trend with Martin Zielke's appointment as the new CEO as of May 1. Outgoing head Martin Blessing announced last year he would not renew his contract. Zielke had previously been put in charge of implementing reforms in the company's private banking sector following the recession. His restructuring measures attracted 800,000 new customers to the bank and changed the image of the 146-year-old financial institution. The 53-year-old has an illustrious career across several German financial institutions to look back on, having started at the teller of a local branch in 1983. Zielke's crowning achievement The beleaguered German financial institution recorded a profit of more than a billion euros (more than $1.1 billion) last year. It was the first time in five years that Commerzbank had made such profitable gains, which it said would translate into paid dividends for shareholders. A good portion of the yields were achieved by a restructuring and expansion drive of Commerzbank's private banking arm under Zielke's leadership.

In a statement, Commerzank said the appointment was made \"in good faith\" and that \"the board will continue to look at all the options in the coming months and years.\" \"We have a very strong team and we are very confident that we will have the right people in place to help us achieve the goals we set out to achieve in 2009,\" it said. A spokesman for Martin Biel, who was named CEO in July, said in an interview with Reuters that a decision had been taken \"on the basis of an internal review of our board's performance and the decision to appoint Martin as our new head of financial operations.\" Martin was appointed CEO on July 1, 2009, following the death of his father Martin in a car crash in 1983. His son Martin, now 53, was also named to replace him, but he has yet to make an announcement about his future."

        "target": "'One in three' unaware they are HIV-positive The number of people living with HIV/AIDS in the European Union and neighboring countries has increased by nearly a third, with one in three unaware they have the virus, the EU Commission warned Monday. In a document on combating AIDS, the Commission said that as of 2007, around 2.2 million people carried the virus in the EU and nearby countries, an increase of 700,000 from 2001. According to Commission figures, around 730,000 of these live within the EU's 27 member states. France, Italy, Spain and Portugal have relatively high infection rates - ranging from 0.4 percent to 0.5 percent. In the Baltic country of Estonia, the infection rate stands at around 1.3 percent. In neighboring Ukraine, around 1.6 percent of the population has been diagnosed with HIV, while in Russia around 1.1 percent are HIV positive. The Commission warned that now was not the time for Europe to drop its guard on preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS, adding that in some neighboring countries the number of people carrying the virus had doubled. EU Health Commissioner Androulla Vassiliou said political momentum in the fight against HIV/AIDS needed to be maintained, adding that people must \"take responsibility for themselves and their partners by talking about and practicing safe sex and going for HIV testing.\" A cure for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has yet to be found more than a quarter century after it was brought to public attention. However, efficient treatments exist to slow the evolution of the virus. dfm/AFP Editor: Chuck Penfold",
        "generated_story": "One in three people living with HIV/AIDS in the EU and neighboring countries are unaware they are HIV-positive The EU's health commissioner has warned that more than 1 in 3 of the 28 member states have HIV or AIDS, according to figures released by the European Commission on Monday. The figures are the highest since 2007, when it was reported that 1.5 million people had the disease. According to the figures, the number of people who have tested positive for HIV and AIDS rose to 3.6 million in 2007 from 2.4 million a year earlier. \"One out of three,\" said Androulla Vassiliou, a spokeswoman for the Commission, \"is unaware of their HIV status.\" \"This is a very serious problem,\" she added, adding that \"it is not the first time that people have been exposed to HIV in their own country. It is the last time they will be exposed.\" The Commission's chief executive, Chuck Penfold, said the findings were \"very concerning\" and that he was \"deeply concerned\" about the extent to which people were unaware that they were HIV positive. He added that the new figures \"indicate that there is an increased risk of HIV infection in other countries, particularly in countries where the virus is more widespread than HIV,\" he said in a statement. But he also pointed out that HIV is still a relatively new disease in many countries. In addition, he noted, there was a \"significant increase\" in cases of AIDS in recent years, as well as an increase in deaths from AIDS and other forms of sexually transmitted diseases, such as HIV, cancer, AIDS-related infections and cancer. And he pointed to a rise in condom use among men and women, who are more likely to be infected by HIV than women. A recent study by researchers at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in New York found that a third of men, aged between 45 and 64, had been infected with AIDS by 2001. That figure is up from just one in five in 2001, and it is expected to rise to two percent by 2007. More than half of those who were infected in 2006 and 2007 are thought to have had HIV by now, with the most recent figures from 2007 showing that men are twice as likely as women to become infected, compared to women and children. Many of these infections are also linked to high blood pressure, which can lead to cirrhosis, liver disease, kidney failure and liver failure. One in four men is also suspected of having HIV. Two in ten men have the condition. This figure rises to three men in total, but it's not clear how many of them are infected or whether they have AIDS. There is no clear link between the two infections. What is known about these two groups is that their symptoms are very different from each other. They are not related to their sexual orientation or gender identity. These two types of infections can be easily identified by looking at a picture of a condom or a photo of an infected person. If you look closely, you can see that most people do not recognize the difference between them and the person who is infected. You can also see what the symptoms look like when they look at their picture on the screen. For example, HIV can cause a lot of problems for a person with a blood disorder who has never had sex with an HIV patient. How many people are aware of this? What does this mean for their health? How do you know if you have a positive HIV test? Can you tell if the test results are positive? Do you think that you're going to get tested? Is it a good idea to test positive or is it something you'll have to wait until the end of 2007 to find out? If so, what is your prognosis? Are you sure you want to see the results of testing? Does it mean that your HIV score is good enough for you to tell your partner? And if not, then what's the best way to go about testing your own HIV tests? That's a big question mark for me. I don't know for sure, because I'm not sure I can tell you that I would be surprised if I didn't tell my partner about it. So, I think I'll just say that we're not doing the right thing. We'll see how long it takes for us to know what we can do about this. Let's hope that it doesn't take too long before we see a change in our attitudes towards this disease? I'd like to think we'll be able to do something about that. Hopefully, that's something that will help us get a better understanding of what it means to live with this virus? The answer is clear: no, we will do everything possible to make sure that everything is okay? We can't do anything wrong? It depends on how well you are doing? Well, let's see if we have an answer to that question. Is there a clear answer for this question? \"I think it will take a long time,\" the commission's executive director told me"

It is a one-crust pie, eaten in most German wine regions during the fall wine season. Zwiebelkuchen is traditionally eaten with Federweisser, a young wine available in Germany in the fall. The link between the two is so strong that many Federweisser wines have a recipe for the onion cake on their labels. Here's a recipe for it: Ingredients: 1 packet yeast, active dry 1 teaspoon sugar 1 1/2 teaspoon salt 3 cups unbleached flour 1 tablespoon shortening 1 cup water (49 to 54 C / 120 to 130 F) 6 slices bacon -- diced 2 medium onions -- sliced 1/4 teaspoon cumin 1/2 teaspoon salt Pepper 1 egg yolk 1 cup sour cream Mix the yeast with the sugar, a teaspoon of salt and half a cup of flour. Blend in the shortening and warm water, then beat for two minutes. Add enough flour to make a soft dough, and then knead the dough until smooth and elastic, about five minutes. Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, then cover it and let it rise in a warm place for 30 minutes. Pat the dough into a lightly greased 12-inch pizza pan or onto a lightly greased baking sheet. Press up the edges to make a slight rim. Fry the bacon until crisp and drain it on absorbent paper. Add onions to the bacon grease, and cook slowly until tender, but not brown. Sprinkle the onions, bacon, cumin, half a teaspoon of salt and pepper over the dough. Bake the cake at 204 C (400 F) for 20 minutes. Blend the egg yolk and sour cream and pour the mixture over the Zwiebelkuchen. Bake it for another 10 to 15 minutes, until the cake is golden brown and the sour cream has set. Serve warm or at room temperature with white wine.",
        "generated_story": "A German Wine Companion to the Fall Wine Season The fall wine season is just around the corner, and it's a great time to indulge in some of the best wine in the world. Onion Cake: A German wine companion for the fall Wine season. It's all about the wine, not the food. You can find it on the menu for about five minutes, but you can't get enough of it. There are a lot of different types of wine to choose from, so you have to make your own. The best ones are the ones that have the most to do with the autumn wine. I think I'm going to try a few of them. They're all very good, they're just as good as the rest of us. And then there's the one that's really good for you: the onion cake. That's what I like to call the \"wine companion,\" because it gives you an idea of how good it is to be able to enjoy wine while you're out and about. \"It's like drinking wine,\" I say, \"but with a little bit less sugar and a bit more salt.\" I also like the fact that the cake is so good that I can eat it in about 20 minutes. But I don't know how long I'll be drinking it, because I haven't had a chance to drink it since I was in high school. What I do know is that when I get home, I want to take a look at the recipe and see what it says about me and my family and how I feel about wine and the way it tastes in my mouth. This is a recipe I've been working on for a long time and I really enjoyed the taste of all the different varieties. One of my favorite things about this recipe was that it was very easy to find the right wine for me, which is why I love it so much. Another thing I liked about it: it made me think about how easy it would be to serve it to my friends and family, who are all grown up in Germany and who have never had the opportunity to taste it before. In addition to that, it also gave me a taste for wine that is very different from other German wines, such as wine made in Italy, Spain, Portugal, Italy and Spain. For example, the Italian wine is made with wine from the same grape varieties as well as from a variety of herbs, herbs and cheeses that are grown in different regions of Germany. With the addition of mushrooms, onions, garlic, basil and parsley, you get a whole lot more variety in your wine than you might think. Also, there is the possibility that you could make it into a wine without having to cook it at all. All of these ingredients can be added to a cake and serve as an appetizer to your guests. If you are not a fan of onion cakes, then you'll probably have a hard time eating them, especially if you've never tried one. However, that doesn't mean you shouldn't try them at home. When you try to eat them with your mouth full of parsnips and vinegar, your tongue is dry and your stomach aches. Do you know why? Because they are so dry? They are also very dry. So, when it comes to vegetables, vegetables are very hard to grow and they have very little nutritional value. These vegetables can only be used in a very small amount of water. As long as you eat the vegetables you will be using them as much as possible. Then you use them sparingly because you want them to dry up and you won't have as many vegetables as if they were still fresh. Or, as in this case, just enough to keep them fresh and fresh for another 10 to 15 minutes before you go to bed. Which is exactly what we're talking about here. We'll see how it all goes down this fall. After all, we've all been through this season, right? We've had our fair share of fruit and vegetables in our garden. Now we'll have more to come. Let's see if we can figure out what's in store for this year's harvest, shall we? What do you think? How do we make sure that we eat our vegetables? Do we have enough wine? Can you tell us what you like? I'd love to tell you about your favorite dishes? If so, let me know! I recommend you do the research on this one! You'll find out for yourself. Read more: What you need to know about these dishes: How to prepare your vegetables for your harvest. How can you prepare for harvest? And what are you doing with them? Is there a good recipe for that? Let us know. Tell us how you'd like it! What are your favorites? You've got to have some good wine! We're looking forward to seeing what happens next year!

        "target": "Bayern blast five as Schalke draw Bayern Munich stamped their authority over the Bundesliga on Saturday, with a ruthless 5-0 drubbing of Hannover at home. Meanwhile, second-placed Schalke and third-placed Frankfurt were forced to share the points. With many critics saying Bayern might as well be given the giant Bundesliga dish already, perhaps the struggle for second is shaping up to be the more compelling battle. But Saturday afternoon's clash between second-placed Schalke and third-placed Frankfurt did not take a decisive turn, with the game ending in a 1-1 draw. Schalke drew first blood in the 11th minute, when Frankfurt's Stefan Aigner was dispossessed in midfield, and Lewis Holtby released Klaas-Jan Huntelaar in front of goal - the Dutchman's first in the Bundesliga since September. But the hapless Aigner waited just over 100 seconds to make amends for his error, when the Royal Blues allowed him a free header that left goalkeeper Lars Unnerstall with no chance. But neither side could make inroads in the second half, which allowed Dortmund to leap-frog both sides and claim second place. Bayern take command Meanwhile the imperious Bayern Munich dispelled any talk of winter form-dip - following last week's draw to Nuremberg - with a brutally efficient 5-0 win at home to Hannover. The Bavarians stormed to a 3-0 lead in just 37 minutes, celebrating a nifty overhead kick for star signing Javi Martinez in the fourth minute. Toni Kroos and Franck Ribery scored the next two against a Hannover side that were torn open at will. The overhead kick was the first for the 40-million-euro ($52-million) signing Martinez, and in the second half new defender Dante also opened his account with a straightforward header from a Kroos free-kick. The festival of football continued just four minutes later, when Mario Gomez - making first Bundesliga appearance of the season - slammed the ball into the net from a tight angle just 30 seconds after replacing Mario Mandzukic. Dortmund win The champions Dortmund, meanwhile, are still nine points behind Bayern after beating Mainz 2-1 away. It was a potentially tricky fixture in the town where J\u00fcrgen Klopp began his coaching career, and Mainz showed their brilliance in the fourth minute, when Elkin Soto knocked a dream ball into the path of Marco Caligiuri, whose volley fairly screamed into the top right corner. Dortmund's own star-Marco - national team player Marco Reus - leveled the scores just eight minutes later. Reus worked himself some room at the outer edge of the penalty area, and slotted a beautiful 17-meter effort into the far corner. And Dortmund's second goal, just before half-time, was equally aesthetic - a vertical ball bisected the Mainz defense perfectly down the middle, where Polish predator Robert Lewandowski got his eighth league goal of the season with a deft lob over the onrushing Christian Wetklo in goal. Allofs' homecoming Bremen's 1-1 draw at Wolfsburg had a special frisson of its own, as Wolfsburg's newly-minted sporting director Klaus Allofs faced the club he had served as general manager for over a decade. And there was some gesticulating from the Bremen bench in the general direction of the Wolfsburg management when the guests took the lead in the 35th minute. Just seconds after Wolfsburg missed several chances, Marko Arnautovic was left free in the box after Eljero Elia found space on the left and cut the ball back for the Austrian to finish. But Wolfsburg got their own back in the second half. In the 62th minute, Bremen were reduced to ten men when Lukas Schmitz was given second yellow card for a hard tackle on Adelino Vieirinha. Just two minutes later, Bas Dost took advantage of their guests' disorgnaization and smashed the ball into the goal after neat piece of play from Vieirinha. Dirty derby The Franconian derby between Greuther F\u00fcrth and Nuremberg was a cagey affair that ended in a frustrating 0-0 draw. The first half was marked mainly by a straight red card for Nuremberg's Markus Feulner after an ugly, flying lunge on Stephan F\u00fcrstner. But the home side's numerical advantage was short-lived - Sercan Sararer was also sent for an early ice bath after his high elbow on Javier Pinola was adjudged worthy of a second yellow card in the 61st minute. But the aggression in the tackles was not matched by ruthlessness in front of goal, and neither side could eke out any clear chances.",
        "generated_story": "Bayern Munich host Wolfsburg in Bundesliga clash Bayern Munich are set to take on Borussia Dortmund in the Bundesliga on Saturday afternoon. The Bavarians will be looking for their first win of the season when they travel to Hannover on Sunday. Mainz, who have lost three of their last four league games, are on the brink of relegation after losing to Schalke in their opening match of this season's Champions League group stage. Bremen, meanwhile, have a chance to make it back into the top four with a win over Hannsburg, which they hope will give them the upper hand in next week's second round. Bayern, however, will have to wait until the last possible moment to see if they can get past the Bavarian side. Aigner's goal came just over 100 seconds after the break, and the German striker was on his way off the bench to score his first goal in a Bundesliga match since the end of last season. \"I'm really happy with the result,\" said Bayern coach J\u00fcrgen Klopp, adding that he was \"very happy\" with his team-mates' performances in recent weeks. He also said that his side were \"doing a good job\" at keeping the ball in front of him, despite the fact that they had only just two minutes left to play. But Bayern's defensive frailties were not enough to keep the visitors at bay. In the second half, Bayern were able to get back on track, but they were unable to do much more than that. On the other hand, they could have done a lot more. They had to settle for just one goal, as well as one point from the first half. That was the only goal Bayern managed to put away. It was only a matter of time before the match was called off, with Dortmund having already lost to the relegation-threatened Stuttgart. After that, it was back to business as usual. With the return of Javi Martinez, the club's top goal scorer, is now on course for a second consecutive Bundesliga title, this time in Germany. And that's not all that Bayern have in store for this weekend's match against Mainzen. At the same time, Dortmund are looking to add to their already impressive record of 11 wins in 12 games. Last year's title hopes were dashed by the arrival of former Bayern star Mario Gomez, now a free-kick specialist at the age of 37. This time around, though, there was a bit of a different story. Germany's most promising young player, Toni Kroos, has been on fire for the past couple of weeks, scoring just four goals in his last 10 games for his club. His latest goal is the most impressive of his career so far and he's looking forward to his return to action in September."

        "target": "In Argentina, red wine exports to balance Porsche imports About 100 Porsches are imported to Argentina each year. Now the country wants to keep a positive trade balance by having the value of the imported luxury cars matched by red wine exports. Porsche is currently enjoying record profits after a two-year downturn, but the export-reliant company has hit a pothole in Argentina. Buenos Aires-based Porsche importer Grupo Pulenta has signed an agreement obligating it to export several hundred bottles of red wine for each car it imports, the Argentine government announced Wednesday. Grupo Pulenta declined to comment when contacted by Deutsche Welle. Job creation During the past year, Argentina has held thousands of high-end vehicles in customs until companies agreed to export goods valued at the same amount. Most of those vehicles came from Germany. According to a spokeswoman for the Argentine embassy in Berlin, the country has been trying to safeguard domestic employment with a positive trade balance. \"Our government has negotiated with automakers to balance their imports of cars with an equivalent amount of exports,\" she told Deutsche Welle in a statement. \"Since March 2010 we have been working with the automakers and importers in order to increase local integration and reduce the trade deficit in this sector.\" Small market A Porsche spokesman said the company sells just short of 100 vehicles into Argentina each year. That compares to more than 40,000 sold worldwide during five months in 2010. \"For Porsche, Argentina is a rather small market,\" the spokesman told Deutsche Welle. \"Our importer, the Pulenta Group, also deals in wine. They have their own vineyards and export that wine. It has nothing to do with Porsche - we just have an import contract with them, and it seems they've found an individual solution with the Argentine government.\" Domestic production Volkswagen, which has an Argentine subsidiary producing the new \"Amarok\" pickup truck and transmissions, has thus far avoided mandatory exports. The company had reported an export surplus of 384 million euros ($545 million) for this year. Porsche's holding company owns 32.2 percent of Volkswagen, and the Porsche brand is intended to become integrated into Volkswagen's lineup. Daimler and BMW also have subsidiaries in Argentina. While Daimler produces its \"Sprinter\" there, BMW only imports to the country. According to the Argentine embassy in Berlin, the country has recently sought more domestic production by foreign car companies. Author: Gerhard Schneibel (dpa) Editor: John Blau",
        "generated_story": "Porsche aims to balance red wine exports with exports Argentina-based Porsche has announced plans to double its red wines exports this year. The move is part of an effort to reduce its reliance on imports from Germany, the world's top wine exporter. Argentina's Pulenta Group said on Wednesday that it planned to increase its exports to the country by 384 million euros ($545 million) in the past year, with the aim of reducing its dependence on German imports. \"We are going to do everything in our power to make sure that we are able to meet the needs of our customers,\" the company said in a statement. It added that the move was \"part of a broader strategy to cut costs and increase our competitiveness.\" The company also said it would continue to invest in new products, such as the new Amarok wine, which will be sold in Argentina in 2010. In addition, it will also introduce a new range of new cars, including the Porsches and the Sprinter, to help offset the loss of sales to German carmakers BMW, Daimler and Mercedes-Benz. According to a report in Deutsche Welle, Porsche is also looking at expanding its wine production in Latin America, particularly in Brazil and Argentina, where it has a presence of more than 1.5 million bottles of wine annually. That's a 25 percent increase from the same period in 2009, according to data compiled by German research firm Amblau. Porsche also announced in March 2010 it was looking to diversify its portfolio to include wine from China, India, Brazil, Mexico and South Africa. This would be the first time in its history that a German company has made a significant contribution to its domestic wine market. Germany's Volkswagen, for example, is one of the largest wine importers in South America. German wine is a key component of Porsche's wine portfolio, but it's not the only one that has been affected by the downturn in China. Volkswagen has also been hit by a slump in sales of its German-made sports cars and a drop in demand for its flagship Porsche sports car. BMW and Volkswagen are among the top three German companies in terms of domestic sales, followed by Porsche, Audi and BMW. Porsche, however, has not yet announced a decision on whether or not to expand its production abroad."

        "target": "Beekeepers battle mites with technology Bees are useful, hard-working and vital for our ecosystem. Aside from making honey, bees pollinate most of our food crops. But summertime is also the season for one of the biggest threats to honey bees \u2013 the varroa mite. Dete Papendieck puts on a white veiled protective hat and takes out a metal jug with a beak-shaped spout. He sets fire to the container's contents \u2013 formic acid \u2013 and starts directing the smoke that is wafting at the beehives lined up in front of him in his garden on the outskirts of Bonn. The acid doesn't harm the bees, but it does kill the varroa mites, he says. And July, after most of the honey has been harvested, is the best time to treat his hives. The one millimeter-large varroa mite is a parasite that infests beehives and lays its eggs in the honeycombs, alongside the bees' larvae. \"It feeds on the bees' and the bee brood's blood, the so-called haemolymph,\" Papendieck explains. A third of bees killed in Germany Papendieck is an apiarist at the Bee Research Institute at the University of Bonn and he knows that the threat of mites is serious. If left untreated, varroa-infested colonies rarely survive a winter. In 2010, German beekeepers lost about 200,000 hives to the mite \u2013 one third of Germany's total bee population. And it is not just the honey and beeswax production that are affected by the mite. Many of our food crops depend on bees: Some 80 percent of all agricultural plants and 90 percent of fruit trees in Europe are pollinated by Apis mellifera, the European honeybee. Varroa introduced from Asia Had Dete Papendieck been a beekeeper forty years ago he would not have had to worry about mites. He says the varroa mite that was originally native to Asia, was introduced to Europe in the 1970s. \"It happened during a research project in which it was attempted to crossbreed the European honeybee with the Asian honeybee. The researchers were exchanging bee colonies between Europe and India, and that is how the mites came to Germany,\" Papendieck said. Unlike Asian bee species, the European honeybee cannot fight off the varoa mite by itself. According to Papendieck, bees easily transmit the mite to other beekeepers' hives in what apiarists call robbery. \"It happens when certain colonies are being robbed by other bees. Large numbers of bees from different colonies attack weak hives and steal their stocks. At the same time, parasites and diseases are exchanged\", he says. Researchers have been trying to breed varroa-resistant mites, but so far they haven't had much success. High-tech tools help fight the mite Klaus Maresch is also worried about his bees. He is an organic beekeeper from Bonn and he has been passionate about bees since he was a little boy. \"They are part of my family. When I open my hives and smell the honey and hear the buzzing of the bees it's like being in another world,\" he told Deutsche Welle. In addition to using formic acid to fight the mite, Klaus Maresch employs a high-tech tool \u2013 a special cylindrical scale that helps him determine when it is best to start the varroa treatment. \"Every day this hive scale sends data about the colonies to our server. The data, such as the temperature in the hive and the amounts of nectar and pollen collected, help me to find a good day to treat varroa,\" Maresch says. Maresch also makes the data about the activities in his hives available to fellow beekeepers who can treat their colonies accordingly. A driver's license for beekeepers? But it is not the mite that angers Maresch most. \"That's nature,\" he says, \"I feel angry about beekeepers who don't fight varroa. If the bees of neighboring beekeepers are infested, I also have a problem.\" The existing German pest regulation obliges beekeepers to treat their bees against varroa, but there are no strict controls. The majority of Germany's more-than-80,000 beekeepers are amateurs who keep between one and 20 colonies. This makes it difficult to impose and survey certain quality standards. Maresch, who sees himself as a kind of 'bee activist', would like to see the government introduce stricter rules. \"There should be a law that obliges every new beekeeper to learn about beekeeping before they are allowed to keep bees. They should get an education and there should be something like a driver's license for beekeepers,\" he says. In the mean time, Europe's bees are going to have to",
        "generated_story": "German beekeeper fights the varoa mite with a high-tech hive scale German beekeepers have been battling a pest that has become a major problem in the summertime. The pest, which can be easily spread across the globe, is one of the world's most destructive pests. In Germany, the pest is known as the honey bee, and it has been known to attack honeybees in Europe for over two decades. But in July, Klaus Maresch, head of Germany's Bee Research Institute in Bonn, told Deutsche Welle that he and his colleagues had been fighting the insect for more than 40 years. \"We are fighting this pest for the first time,\" he said, adding that \"we have to be careful about what we do with our honey bees.\" The insect is a common pest in Asia and Europe, but in Germany it is more widespread than in other countries, such as China, India, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines. It can also spread to other parts of Europe and Asia, as well as Africa, where it can spread throughout the entire globe. This is why we have a honeybee hive in our garden. We have the largest hive on the planet, with over 2,000 bees in it. That's a lot of bees to deal with, especially when you have so many bees on your property. And we are not just talking about bees, we talk about beekeeping in general. There is also the fact that bees are very adaptable. They adapt well to the environment and adapt to different climates. For example, when the bees migrate from Asia to Africa to Europe in search of a new home, they are able to stay in one place for a long time. However, in recent years they have become more and more dependent on humans, who are more susceptible to pests and diseases than they were to humans. Last year, German scientists found that the bug was spreading through the soil, causing it to enter the hive and then spread into the surrounding area. According to German scientist Dete Papendieck, this has led to an increase in insect populations in eastern Europe. She said that over the last few years, \"the bug has spread through our soil and is now spreading across Europe.\" \"It is very difficult for humans to live in a hive,\" she said. 'It's not easy for us to survive in an environment where there is so much biodiversity and so little food available for people to eat. So we try to make it as easy as possible for them as we can, so that they don't get sick and die.\" In addition, she added, there are a number of species that are resistant to insecticides and pesticides. One of them is the mites, a species which has a population of around 1.5 million in North Rhine-Westphalia. Another species is called the pterodactyl, an insect that can cause respiratory problems in humans and can even cause cancer. These are the ones that have caused the most damage to people's health, particularly in rural areas. A new species of mollusks has also been discovered in China and India. Some of these species are thought to have killed millions of people in their native countries and are spreading to new areas of Asia. I think this is something that we need to do more to protect ourselves and our species, because it's very, very important for our health and well-being,\" said the scientist."

        "target": "EU Mulls Warning Labels to Curb Alcohol Abuse While still targeting smoking, European Union's public health commissioner is considering adding alcohol to the list of vices the bloc should clamp down on. In a report commissioned by the European Commission, the London Institute for Alcohol Studies recommended raising the legal age to buy alcohol to 18 (in some countries, such as Germany, 16-year-olds can buy beer), lowering the permitted blood alcohol level while driving to 0.5, banning alcohol advertising on TV and in movies as well as adding warning labels to bottles as ways of preventing alcohol abuse across the bloc. Which of the methods EU Health Commissioner Markos Kyprianou actually introduces will be announced \"sometime in the autumn,\" according to a spokesperson. Other options include a 10 percent increase in the price of alcohol. Kyprianou has, however, hinted that he favors warning labels -- similar to those that appear on packs of cigarettes -- that make the dangers of alcohol clear. \"Drinking harms your unborn baby\" on bottles? Brewers and wine makers across Europe, however, have come out against placing \"Drinking Kills\" or other labels on bottles of beer. \"Warning labels are the completely wrong way to go,\" Peter Hahn, head of the German Brewers Association told Germany's Express newspaper. \"The do not deter people who have lost a sense of how much to drink and unsettle the people who enjoy a beer after work.\" Industry groups also opposed implementing EU-wide guidelines in countries with traditionally different ways of approaching drinking and drinking problems. \"Policies that do not consider cultural and regional differences, will fail to deal with the social problems, while at the same time generate a rising level of political objections,\" said Rodolphe de Looz-Corswarem of Brewers of Europe. Keeping social vices separate Green party EU parliamentarian Hiltrud Breyer meanwhile called on the alcohol industry to stop \"saber rattling\" before it sees the a final version of the EU's strategy to prevent alcohol abuse. German Consumer Affairs Minister Horst Seehofer said he would wait to see what Kyprianou's actual suggestions are before commenting. Other German politicians, however, were more willing to voice the opposition to putting a sip of wine on the same footing with a puff of a cigarette. \"People should not expect that a skull and crossbones end up on every bottle of beer and wine,\" German EU representative Karl-Heinz Florenz told Der Tagesspiegel newspaper, adding that when it comes to alcohol, each member state should be responsible for how it deals with alcohol abuse. The harm of \"passive drinking\" While cigarettes are a health risk from the first puff, moderate drinking can actually be healthy and there is no danger from \"passive drinking,\" Peter Liese, a German EU representative, told the paper. The commission's report disagreed with Liese's conclusion, saying alcohol abuse had a major role in as many as 200,000 deaths in Europe due to car accidents and disease and played a role in some 60,000 underweight births. The report also estimated the effects of alcohol abuse of costing the EU 125 billion euros ($161 billion) in 2003. Some 25 percent of men and 10 percent of women in Europe drink what the EU considers to be more than healthy amounts of alcohol and between 3 percent and 5 percent are suffering from alcoholism, according to EU statistics.",
        "generated_story": "German Brewers Association warns against \"passive drinking\" on bottles of beer The German Brewers' Association has warned against the harmful effects of alcohol on beer bottles. The group's president, Karl-Heinz Florenz, told the Der Tagesspiegel newspaper that the problem was \"increasingly acute.\" \"It is becoming more and more acute,\" he said. \"The problem is increasing the number of people who drink alcohol, and the increasing number who are drinking it.\" According to the German beer association, more than 125 billion euros ($125 billion) has been spent on alcohol over the past five years. In the autumn, Germany's beer industry is expected to see a rise in alcohol consumption. But the European Commission, which is responsible for regulating beer in the EU, is also concerned about the impact on the drinking habits of young people. It is not clear how much of a problem this is, but it seems to me that it is the most acute problem that has arisen in recent years, because of the high alcohol content in beer. This has led to an increase in underage drinking in Germany and in other European countries, where alcohol is consumed by teenagers and young adults, according to a study by the London Institute for Alcohol Studies (DLR). The study found that drinking alcohol by 16-year-olds is more likely to lead to alcohol abuse than binge drinking, as alcohol can be metabolically metabolized in a person's body. That is why, in 2003, the average age of drinking beer was 18. Since then, it has risen to 19. Today, beer consumption is estimated to be up to 161.5 percent. However, there is no evidence to suggest that alcohol-related drinking is harmful to people's health. A recent study published in German magazine the Leibniz Zeitung found the alcohol use of underage drinkers was down to 1.6 percent, down from 2.4 percent a year earlier. And the study said that, on average, people drink more alcohol than they normally would, meaning they consume less alcohol in their lifetime. So, what does this mean for the health and well-being of children? It means that they are not drinking enough alcohol to make it into adulthood. What does it mean to become a member of an EU-wide \"super-social club\" that is supposed to promote healthy lifestyles? The report also pointed out that \"social clubs\" have become increasingly popular among teenagers, with many of them drinking more beer than adults. They have also become more active in social clubs, such as the Green party's social club. These clubs are also known as \"micro-finance clubs,\" and they have a reputation for being able to get their money's worth out of their own pocket. As a result of this, they can no longer afford to buy alcohol at a discount, even if they do have to pay for it. For example, when it comes to beer, a group of teenagers can buy a bottle of wine and drink it for a mere 125 euros (125 million euros) a day. Some of these teenagers have been drinking a beer for two to three hours a week since 2003. Their parents, however, say they don't drink beer at all and that's not a good sign for their children."

        "target": "German Minister Urges Peace in Georgia's Separatist Regions German Foreign Minister Steinmeier has called for an end to the \"spiral of violence\" between the Georgian government in Tbilisi and its Russian-backed rebel regions and presented a three-stage plan to break the deadlock. Steinmeier issued the plea as he began a tour of the region to sponsor a new peace plan aimed at calming the simmering tensions over Georgia's separatist regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. \"This is my appeal to break out of the spiral of violence. A lack of dialogue is not an option for the future,\" he said after meeting with his Georgian counterpart Eka Tkeshelashvili. Steinmeier, who chairs the so-called Group of Friends of the United Nations' Secretary on Georgia, is proposing a three-phase peace plan based on a mutual declaration of non-violence and repatriation of about 25,000 ethnic Georgians expelled from Abkhazia in the 1990s. Negotiations over the status of the two rebel regions, which have enjoyed de facto autonomy since the end of a civil war in 1994, was reserved for the final phase of negotiations. Tkeshelashvili said, \"The plan has great potential for success,\" but added that the most difficult thing would be to convince Russia. Peace talks remain distant The threat of armed conflict in the region last month has given urgency to international pressure for renewed peace talks, but Tbilisi, Moscow and the Russian-backed regions remain far apart on the basic premises for restarting peace talks. Officials in Tbilisi oppose a treaty on the non-use of force without guarantees on the return of refugees and the withdrawal of Russian peacekeeping forces base in the region. Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was skeptical of peace efforts Thursday. \"Signing of a treaty on the return of Georgian refugees to Abkhazia is unreal now, because such a return requires a calm situation,\" Lavrov was quoted as saying by news agency RIA-Novosti. \"We think that signing a treaty on the non-use of force without any preconditions is an absolutely unavoidable first step,\" he added. Experts see little hope for Steinmeier's plan Analysts do not expect anything conclusive from Steinmeier's trip, pointing to intransigence on the part of the Abkhaz President Sergei Bagapsh, who said he would \"not consider the plan.\" \"We are not going to discuss Abkhazia's status with anyone. We are building an independent, democratic state,\" Bagapsh was quoted by Georgian news agencies as saying. Speaking to journalists ahead of the meetings Thursday, Steinmeier admitted: \"We don't have any illusions about simple answers, but we cannot stand by without acting on this conflict. That would be irresponsible.\" From Tbilisi, the German minister is to travel to the Black Sea city of Batumi for talks with Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili and then to Abkhazia on Friday before ending his three-day tour in Moscow. Most citizens of the breakaway republics have been issued Russian passports and over 2,500 Russian peacekeeping troops patrol the region under a UN ceasefire agreement. In opposition to Georgia's bid to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Russia moved to strengthen diplomatic ties with the breakaway regions sharply aggravating tensions with the Georgian leadership in recent months.",

It also aims at bringing stability and stability to a region that has suffered from the collapse of its Soviet-era economy in the 1990s and a rise in violent separatist activity in eastern Ukraine. In a statement released on Thursday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the plan was \"in the best interests of all Georgians\" and that it was a \"positive step forward\" for peace in Georgia. \"It is a positive step for Georgia,\" he said, adding that he hoped the new deal would bring \"peace and prosperity to Georgia.\" \"We are hopeful that Georgia will be able to return to its former self-styled glory,\" said Lavrov, who was visiting Moscow for talks with President Ilham Aliyev and his wife Eka Tkeshelashvili."

        "target": "Maldives revokes state of emergency citing improved security situation The president of the Maldives has lifted a state of emergency following an outcry from the international community. The government says the measures are no longer necessary because the security threat has subsided. The government said Tuesday it had rescinded the emergency measures \"with immediate effect\" and that \"all fundamental rights that were suspended have been restored.\" President Yameen Abdul Gayoom declared the state of emergency one week ago after the discovery of a homemade bomb and a stash of weapons near his official residence. The finding followed an explosion on Gayoom's speedboat in September - an incident the government labeled an assassination attempt. The president was not hurt in the blast, but his wife, an aide and a bodyguard were injured. The emergency regulations, intended to be in place for 30 days, gave security forces wide-ranging search and arrest powers, and suspended citizens' basic rights. They drew criticism from former colonial power Britain as well as the United States, the European Union and neighboring Sri Lanka. Reading out a presidential decree revoking the emergency, Attorney General Mohamed Anil said there was no longer a threat to the Indian Ocean atoll nation. He said investigations into the September blast and the recovery of weapons had made good progress. The foreign ministry said a number of people had been arrested. Lawmakers also used the security regulations to fast-track the impeachment of Vice President Ahmed Adeeb, who stands accused of plotting the alleged attempts on the president's life. Impact on tourism Attorney General Anil said pressure from the international community, as well as \"the possible adverse impact on Maldives tourism and the economy,\" had also played a role in ending the state of emergency. Foreign tourists visiting the tropical nation, known for its luxury tourist resorts, palm-fringed beaches and coral reefs, contribute close to a third of the country's gross domestic product. The Maldives has had a rocky road to democracy since holding its first multiparty election in 2008. The country's first democratically elected leader, current opposition chief Mohamed Nasheed, was forced to step down in 2012 after a mutiny by security forces. In March, he was jailed for 13 years on terrorism charges in a trial the United Nations said was illegal. President Gayoom is under intense international pressure to release him. Nasheed's opposition Maldivian Democratic Party welcomed Tuesday's announcement. But said declaring the state of emergency in the first place was a political move designed to stop a rally planned for last week calling for Nasheed's freedom. \"It appears that Yameen is willing to make up threats about the nation's security in order to settle political scores,\" the party said in a statement, referring to the president. nm/kms (AP, AF, Reuters, dpa)",

Clubs officials say talks are ongoing in the hope Max Meyer will extend his contract. Schalke might struggle to retain 22-year-old midfielder Max Meyer when his contract runs out at the end of the season, at least according to recent media interviews from the club's sporting director, Christian Heidel. Speaking to German news agency dpa, Heidel confirmed that Meyer turned down an offer of a contract extension earlier in February. \"Max Meyer's agent received an extension offer on January 12 with a deadline of February 15, and informed us on February 15 via email that Max would not be accepting the offer because of the deadline imposed,\" Heidel told dpa. \"We have acknowledged this. For now, we no longer feel beholden to the terms of that offer, but that doesn't mean an extension is impossible either.\" Meyer was reportedly offered an annual salary in the region of \u20ac5.5 million ($6.7 million); it was the second contract he refused, following a less lucrative offer at the end of last season.

Heidel said this week that the club was still trying to convince the German to stay. \"At the moment we're still ready to talk,\" Heidel told this week's edition of football magazine Kicker, albeit stressing that time was of the essence. \"But we must and we will plan for the new season.\" In a separate newspaper interview Heidel was even more explicit, saying the club was not in a position to wait until summer for Meyer to make up his mind. Speaking to Sport Bild magazine, meanwhile, Heidel sought to focus on Meyer's more important role at Schalke, his regular game time, arguing it might be in the youngster's best interests to stay at a club that needs him every week. \"[Coach] Domenico Tedesco has formed the team around him in such a way that there is now an ideal spot for Max. That was not always the case,\" Heidel said. \"He needs to ask himself, putting the financial aspect to one side: 'Will I get such a position at a different club?'

The record-breaking storm has battered the Bahamas and Cuba, while Hurricane Jose followed in its path. As one of the Atlantic Ocean's largest storms plowed through the Caribbean, leaving destruction in its wake, residents of the US state of Florida prepared for what could be the worst storm to make landfall in over a century. At least 17 people have been killed and dozens more injured across several island nations in the Caribbean. Irma is expected to be there second major hurricane to make landfall in the United States in less than two weeks. Hurricane Harvey struck Texas last week, killing more than 60 people and displacing roughly 1 million others. In the US territory of Puerto Rico, 1 million people \u2013 nearly one-third of the population \u2013 lost electricity during the storm, said Puerto Rican Governor Ricardo Rossello. \"It will be difficult to estimate how long the power outage will last,\" Rossello said. Later, officials confirmed that at least two people on the island had been killed by the storm's devastation. Two other major storms have developed in the Caribbean, namely Hurricane Jose and Hurricane Katia. Jose was east of the Lesser Antilles with maximum sustained winds of 120 miles person hour (195 kilometers person hour) as a hurricane watch was in effect for Antigua and Barbuda. Jose has followed the same path as Hurricane Irma, and was upgraded to a Category 4 on Friday by the US National Hurricane Center. Katia has remained relatively static, hovering off the coast of Mexico. Florida on edge Florida Governor Rick Scott said 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain were expected after Irma made landfall at the weekend as he urged evacuations during a press conference on Friday. Nearly 700,000 people have been asked to leave Miami and its surrounding areas. \"Today is the day to do the right thing for your family and get inland for safety... Do not ignore evacuation orders.

Britain-EU divorce proceedings will probably last about two years. Until then, the status quo must be maintained, German Chancellor Angela Merkel emphasized in her press statement. If she is no longer chancellor after the upcoming parliamentary elections in 2017, then others will have to live with the consequences of Brexit. But that is not what she is actually thinking. It is not coincidental that foreign ministers and government leaders are visiting Berlin in the coming days. They want to discuss how things will continue. Berlin, under Merkel's chancellorship, has become a center of power outside of Brussels. Difficult international politics The Brexit decision has disrupted Europe's equilibrium. Germany has lost an important ally on European issues related to economic growth and budgetary discipline. Now, France presumably will be the next to raise its voice against Maastricht Treaty criteria. If the Netherlands and Denmark also decide to leave the EU, Germany will become isolated, as Eastern Europe is not as tight with Germany as it once was. Poland now plays a key role for the Balkan nations and the Visegrad Group (Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic and Slovakia). And Poland is still annoyed about Merkel's refugee policy. What about Germany's populists? They're giddy with glee as they feel that their anti-establishment policies have been validated. They are teaching potential AfD (Alternative for Germany) voters a lesson: \"Here, have a look: it's possible. There is always an alternative. Vote for us!\" Those are exactly the words that protest voters want to hear. Germany's AfD has forged ties with other right-wing parties in Vienna, Paris, The Hague and London. They are all pursuing a \"European\" plan to gain power. The recent Austrian presidential election was significant, as the populist candidate lost by a very narrow margin; in fact, the final election results are still undecided as they are being contested. The Brexit vote was also triggered by populist powers. Domestically difficult Many populists believe that the stronger populism becomes - no matter where - the more advantages there would be for individual parties of their persuasion. Many would also like to see Donald Trump as US president. That is how AfD may become even stronger in Germany, which also means that political majorities would fluctuate even more. Will there be enough seats after the next election for a Christian Democrat and Green coalition, or will yet another grand coalition made up of Christian Democrats and Social Democrats be formed? Can Angela Merkel change course? Can she counter the trend with a new political model in Europe and Germany? Or do we stand on the edge of a new era, a \"political revolution,\" as the AfD calls it? Until now, Europe has survived attacks on its currency (euro crisis), the principle of peaceful coexistence (Crimea crisis) and its open borders policy (refugee crisis). Merkel deserves credit for defending these values, despite mistakes that have been made along the way. The outcome of the Brexit crisis is, however, still open. Have something to say?

        "target": "Reports: Merkel to run for fourth term as German chancellor German Chancellor Angela Merkel has confirmed that she will stand for the chancellery in the 2017 election, German media reports. The Christian Democrat Leader (CDU) first took office in 2005. After months of speculation, German Chancellor Angela Merkel reportedly told her fellow Christian Democrats (CDU) in Berlin on Sunday that she is prepared to lead the party into next year's election. An official statement is expected from Merkel at 7 p.m. local time (1800 UTC) on Sunday. The 62-year-old has faced a number of difficulties in recent months, from criticism over her handling of the migration crisis to falling support amid a rise in right-wing populist sentiment. Since taking office in 2005, however, Merkel has also been praised for navigating Europe's largest economy through the financial and eurozone crises. According to an Emnid survey published in the German newspaper \"Bild am Sonntag\" 55 percent of Germans are in favor of Merkel remaining head of the German government for another four years. Thirty-nine percent said they were against her re-election. Sign of stability Should she be elected next September, another full four-year term would put Merkel on a par with her mentor Helmut Kohl who set the post-war record and presided over the Fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. In light of the UK's shock vote to leave the European Union in June and Donald Trump's election last week as US president, Merkel's re-election is likely to be welcomed in many capitals as a sign of stability. During his final visit to Berlin this week, US President Barack Obama said that if he were able to, he would vote for his longtime partner and friend. In an interview with German magazine \"Spiegel\" and broadcaster \"ARD,\" Obama said: \"She has great credibility, and she is willing to fight for those values in a way that is very, very important.\" \"I'm glad that she's there and I think the German people should appreciate her. Certainly, I've appreciated her as a partner.\" Winning back votes With the less that a year until Germany heads to the polls, Merkel's CDU is now turning its efforts to wooing back disenchanted voters who have left the conservative camp to support the right-wing populists, Alternative for Germany (AfD). Formed as a Euro-sceptic party in 2013, the AfD won 4.7 percent of the popular vote in the last federal elections in 2013, just falling short of the 5 percent threshold required to enter the Bundestag - Germany's lower house of parliament. After benefiting from the rise in europsceptic, anti-immigration sentiment, seemingly sweeping across western Europe, the party now holds seats in nine of Germany's 16 states.",
        "generated_story": "Merkel's re-election bid comes amid growing populist sentiment in Germany Chancellor Angela Merkel is set to run for a fourth term in office this week. The conservative chancellor is expected to seek a third term as chancellor in a four-year term that began in 2013. Merkel's conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) party is seeking a fifth term, after a string of defeats in the Bundestag, the lower house of parliament, in June and July. Chancellor Merkel, who is seen as one of the most popular politicians in Europe, is due to take the oath of office at 7 p.m. local time on Sunday. German media reported that Merkel would seek the party's nomination for chancellor next year, a move that could have a major impact on the country's political landscape. In the run-up to Sunday's election, Merkel will face a tough challenge from the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), which is hoping to form a coalition government with the center-left Social Democratic party (SPD) and the Christian Democrat (Christian Democrat). The AfD, an anti-immigrant party, has been gaining momentum in recent months, with a growing number of young voters turning out in droves to vote for Merkel. It is the first time since Merkel took office in 2005 that the CDU has won a majority of seats in parliament. Last year's elections were marred by a series of scandals, including a corruption scandal that led to the resignation of former Chancellor Helmut Kohl. This time, however, it was Merkel who won the election. \"I'm not going to stand for another four years,\" Merkel said in an interview with German newspaper Bild am Sonntag. She said she would run again in 2017, this time for the second time in five years. But she did not rule out the possibility of a second term. On Sunday, she said that she was ready to step down from her post at the end of her term if the right-wing party failed to win the parliamentary majority needed for her to stay on as Chancellor."

        "target": "NFL stars defy Donald Trump's call for boycott Baltimore Ravens and Jacksonsville Jaguars players \"took a knee\" during the national anthem after Trump urged fans to boycott football matches. The kneeling protest, to highlight social injustice, has stepped up a gear. Hundreds of National Football League (NFL) stars protested President Donald Trump's call for fans to boycott the league by refusing to stand for the US national anthem this weekend, starting Sunday's game between the Baltimore Ravens and Jacksonsville Jaguars. A number of other players locked arms in solidarity ahead of the game at Wembley Stadium in London. Jacksonville Jaguars' owner Shahid Khan, who last year donated one million dollars\u00a0(840,000 euros) to the Trump campaign, locked his arms with players - a rare scene, as owners almost never take to the field. US media reported that about 200 players on Sunday sat, knelt or raised their fists in defiance of Trump's comments. In one of the most memorable moments, singer Rico LaVelle took a knee and held up a fist at the last line of the Star Spangled Banner ahead of the game between the Detriot Lions and Atlanta Falcons. The protest came in response to Trump's tweets on Sunday morning urging fans to boycott NFL games to pressure the league into firing or suspending players to kneel in protest during the national anthem. In an early morning tweet, Trump posted: \"If NFL fans refuse to go to games until players stop disrespecting our Flag and Country, you will see change take place fast. Fire or suspend!\" \"NFL attendance and ratings are WAY DOWN. Boring games yes, but many stay away because they love our country. League should back US,\" he added. Later, the president said that his rant \"has nothing to do with race,\" despite the fact that the origins of the protest are to do with police brutality against minorities, especially African Americans. Trump said his comments were instead about \"respect for our country and respect for our flag.\" Trump's spat with US professional sports began at a Republican rally in Alabama on Friday, when the president attacked activist NFL players for kneeling or sitting during the national anthem, labelling them as \"sons of bitches.\" \"Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, 'Get that son of a bitch off the field right now... he is fired'?\" Trump told a crowd of cheering supporters. That day, basketball star Stephen Curry, the top player for California's Golden State Warriors, announced that he would not be attending a traditional White House reception honoring the National Basketball Association champions. The kneeling protest was started by former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick who refused to stand for the anthem back in 2016. Kaepernick's gesture came amid a spate of deadly police shootings of black men and was aimed at drawing more attention to treatment of minorities in the US. However, Kaepernick has since become a free agent, after failing to be signed by a new team for the new NFL season. NFL executives decry Trump's calls Trump also drew the ire of senior NFL executives and team owners. Responding to Trump's tweets, Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti, said he \"100 percent\" supported his players' decision to kneel during the anthem. Robert Kraft, the owner of the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots, who is also a close friend of Trump, said in a statement on Sunday that he was deeply disappointed by the president's comments in Alabama. Kraft defended players' rights to \"peacefully affect social change and raise awareness in a manner that they feel is most impactful,\" and said that sports were a unifying force in the US. \"Our political leaders could learn a lot from the lessons of teamwork and working together toward a common goal,\" he said. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, who has taken much of the heat for Kaepernick's failure to find a new team, was also quick to condemn Trump's comments. Read more: NFL player's refusal to stand for national anthem ignites online controversy \"The NFL and our players are at our best when we help create a sense of unity in our country and our culture,\" Goodell said. \"There is no better example than the amazing response from our clubs and players to the terrible natural disasters we've experienced over the last month.\" Denouncing Trump's remarks, Goodell said: \"Divisive comments like these demonstrate an unfortunate lack of respect for the NFL, our great game and all of our players, and a failure to understand the overwhelming force for good our clubs and players represent in our communities.\" But Trump hit back later on Sunday at a worsening furore, saying the row \"has nothing to do with race.\" Instead, he said: \"This has to do with respect for our country, and respect for our flag.\" At least seven NFL team owners donated at least $1 million each to Trump's presidential campaign last year. They include the owners of the New York Jets, New England Patriots, Dallas Cowboys, Washington Redskins, Jacksonville Jaguars, Houston Texans, Los Angeles Rams and Tampa Bay Buccaneers",

The NFL commissioner's office on Sunday issued a statement saying that the league's decision was \"inappropriate\" and \"unacceptable.\" The statement came after the NFL announced on Twitter that it would not sanction players who knelt in protest of President Donald Trump's recent comments about President Barack Obama's policies on racial inequality in the United States. \"The president has made it clear that he doesn't want to be a part of our society,\" NFL spokesman Steve Bisciotti said in an interview with the Associated Press. Trump has also called for a boycott of NFL games this weekend against the Dallas Cowboys and New England Patriots, which have been embroiled in a national controversy over their treatment of black athletes. On Sunday, Trump tweeted that NFL owners should \"respect the rule of law\" when it comes to kneeling during football games. In response to the president's comments, NFL owner Robert Kraft announced that his team would be boycotting the Super Bowl in London, England, in order to protest the Trump administration's proposed ban on the use of military personnel during sporting events. He also said the team should be fined 840,000 euros ($1.8 million) for failing to provide adequate security for its players, who are black and African-American. That's the same amount of money Goodell said he would have to pay for security at the stadium, where the players are scheduled to take part in pre-game warm-ups and pregame activities. But the White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment by the AP."

        "target": "Turkey, Greece seek NATO mission in Aegean, says German official Germany, Greece and Turkey will ask NATO to approve a maritime surveillance mission in the Aegean to combat illegal people smugglers. Greece had previously voiced reservations about the proposal. The proposed mission to be discussed at a NATO defense ministers meeting in Brussels on Thursday comes days after German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutolgu said they would raise the issue of refugees with the Alliance. According to a Reuters report citing a senior German official, initially reticent Greece has now given the green light for the operation, which could see NATO assets deployed in the Aegean in a mostly intelligence and reconnaissance role. Under the proposal, which would need to be approved by Alliance members, NATO maritime assets would provide information to national coastguards and the EU border agency Frontex to combat illegal smugglers using rickety boats to bring migrants to Europe. Turkey would then take back the refugees, as envisioned as part of a 3 billion-euro ($3.2 billion) EU-Turkey deal agreed to last year. According to German sources, the mission would not be similar to the NATO mission in the Mediterranean intercepting migrant boats making the dangerous run from Libya to Italy. However, NATO ships could intervene in emergency situations to save passengers. \"It is not NATO's remit to push back or stop refugee boats,\" the official told Reuters. The mission would use assets from the Alliance's standing naval group, a permanent reaction force deployed in the Mediterranean. The naval group's current flagship is the German combat support ship \"Bonn.\" Denmark has already said it would provide additional ships to the mission, according to the official. However, it is unclear whether NATO members will approve the mission which may fall outside the bounds of the Alliance's mandate. Complicating matters is a long-running maritime dispute between Greece and Turkey over sovereignty in the Aegean, where the two NATO members' jets regularly engage in dogfights. Turkey has taken in more than 2.5 million Syrian refugees, and is a major transit point for migrants from Asia and Africa. More than a million migrants and refugees reached Europe last year, many making the dangerous boat journey from Turkey to Greece by boat. So far this year, more than 340 have perished in the cold waters trying to reach Europe. cw/msh (AFP, dpa, Reuters)",

Despite the Syrian government's immediate apology, the shelling on the Turkish border has led to concerns about possible escalation. These weren't the first incidents on the Syrian-Turkish border, but the fact that several people on the Turkish side were killed by Syrian shells on Wednesday (03.10.2012) has brought the conflict between the two countries to a new level. It has led the Turkish military to retaliate for the first time. Several people were killed when Turkey shelled Syrian territory. But neither Turkey, which is a member of NATO, nor Syria would benefit from a broader conflict. An adviser to the Turkish president tweeted, \"Turkey has no interest in a war with Syria.\" Volker Perthes, director of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs in Berlin, agrees: \"Assad has no interest in an escalation,\" he told DW. \"That can be seen from the fact that the Syrian information minister apologized and expressed his regret over the victims immediately after the attack on Turkish territory.\" Perthes doesn't think it's likely that the Syrian President, Bashar Assad, wants to provoke Turkey to intervene in Syria. \"That would only accelerate the fall of his regime,\" he said. It's not yet clear who was responsible for the shelling. According to Syria's ally, Russia, it was a \"tragic accident.\" Relationship damaged The armed incidents on the Syrian-Turkish border have been going on for months. According to Amnesty International, some 300,000 Syrians have left their country since the start of the uprising against Assad, and many of them have fled to Turkey. The relationship between the two countries, which used to be close, has deteriorated dramatically, and the Turkish government is now openly supporting the Syrian opposition. \"Turkey is itself a player in the Syrian conflict,\" said Perthes. \"It provides shelter for many refugees and it's through Turkey that supplies come for the opposition.\" NATO has lined up behind Turkey and told Syria to end its \"flagrant violations of international law.\" Call for 'great discretion' The German chancellor, Angel Merkel, has also positioned herself alongside Turkey. \"We call on all parties to show great discretion,\" she said in Berlin. The foreign minister, Guido Westerwelle, declared that everything must be done to deescalate the situation, so that the Syrian conflict did not turn into a conflagration in the region. Indeed, the Syrian crisis is not only spreading to Turkey, but also to Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon. According to Perthes, \"The neighboring countries are partly victims and partly instigators. Jordan too has taken in refugees and supplies the rebels. On the other hand, Iraq has tended to support the government of Bashar Assad.\" Even so, he said, all the neighboring countries had an interest in ensuring the conflict was confined to Syria. Appeal to the international community But the number of Syrian refugees is rising by the day. Ruth J\u00fcttner, a Middle East expert with Amnesty International, believes this will continue in future months. \"It's important that the countries bordering on Syria are supported by the international community in providing accommodation, medical and psychological care and schooling for children,\" she told DW. It's an appeal she directs especially to European countries. The shelling on the Syrian-Turkish border has made it more likely that there will be armed conflict between Syria and its neighbors. According to Perthes, \"It's probably the case that political resistance in Turkey to intervention in Syria is decreasing right now.\"",

Although they sent no representatives to Switzerland, Islamists have agreed to halt the fighting. The Islamist-backed militia alliance that took over Tripoli and installed its own government announced a ceasefire on Friday, following a breakthrough in Geneva-based peace talks. Despite not attending the UN-brokered meeting, the militias have agreed to \"a ceasefire on all fronts,\" according to a statement issued by Islamist group Fajr Libya (Libya Dawn). The only condition is that \"the other parties respect the truce.\" The announcement came hours after the United Nations declared that Libya's warring factions had agreed to a roadmap for forming a unity government. Nearly four years after a NATO-backed revolt saw Moammar Gadhafi removed from power, two rival governments each backed by different groups of militias have plunged the country back into chaos and threatened all-out civil war. After the elected government of Prime Minister Abdullah al-Thinni was forced out of Tripoli by Libya Dawn, it was forced to move to the far eastern city of Tobruk while Libya Dawn reinstated the old parliament known as the GNC. The fighting and violence has displaced hundreds of thousands of civilians, left hundreds killed and thousands wounded. Most foreign diplomats fled the country and shut their embassies last year. The Tobruk government, as well as a few other factions who favor a peaceful resolution, came to Geneva to work on \"confidence-building measures,\" which includes the release of detainees from both sides, opening closed ports and securing safe freedom of movement around the country. es/bw (AP, AFP, Reuters)",

It said it would continue to hold talks until the end of the war. \"We will not allow any further escalation of violence,\" the group's leader Abdullah al-Thinni told a news conference in Libya's capital, Tripoli, adding that the ceasefire would last for at least two more days."

        "target": "France's conservatives: Combating the National Front with a swing to the right A staunch conservative is joining the race for the French presidency. Republican candidate Francois Fillon could turn into a big problem for right-wing extremist Marine Le Pen's National Front. France's Republicans are moving to the right: by choosing Francois Fillon, voters nominated a presidential candidate who has a reputation as a staunch conservative. The former prime minister has already announced that he intends to refocus politics with the traditional family in mind. Fillon takes a dim view of homosexual couples adopting children. He wants to introduce a cap on the number of refugees allowed into France, he intends to make it harder for foreign nationals to access the social welfare system, and he wants to put Muslim communities and mosques under government control. In addition, Fillon advocates a renationalization of school curricula. Fillon makes gains in FN territory Fillon's agenda could turn out to be a problem for the \"National Front\" (FN). The 62-year-old appeals to similar sentiments as the right-wing party's base: concern about foreign domination and loss of identity, fear of terrorism and crime. \"For a long time, FN was the only political force that addressed those fears,\" said Henrik Uterwedde of the German-French Institute (dfi) in Ludwigsburg. \"Now a politician has arrived on the scene who addresses those fears using a different language and makes them a political offer.\" In rural, Catholic France especially, where traditions still matter a great deal, the avowed Catholic Fillon strikes a chord with his proposals pertaining to family and society policies. He receives support from traditional Catholic groups who, for years, have been able to mobilize crowds for demonstrations against gay marriage. During the intraparty election campaign, Fillon predominantly traveled to France's villages and small towns - regions which FN leader Marine Le Pen had labeled the \"forgotten France,\" regarding herself as their foremost lobbyist. \"Fillon has made gains in an environment that is also canvassed by Le Pen,\" Andreas Jung, Chairman of the Bundestag's German-French parliamentary group, told German broadcaster rbb-Inforadio. \"He does not represent the lofty levels of Parisian politics, but rather provincial entrenchment. Fillon is committed to traditional values, like the family. Therefore, he may not only be capable of defeating Le Pen, but also of taking the lead during the first ballot.\" 'Most dangerous candidate for FN' Consequently, the FN camp is less than enthusiastic about the conservative's candidacy. \"Because of Fillon, we now have a strategy problem,\" Marion Marechal Le Pen, the FN leader's niece, recently told journalists. \"He is the most dangerous candidate for the National Front.\" Pollsters' findings appear to support that statement. Recent surveys establish Fillon as the current favorite in the French presidential election scheduled for next May. However, Fillon's election is not a foregone conclusion. By denouncing the conservative candidate as a member of the establishment, FN tries to win over those who are frustrated with politics and politicians in general. There is persistent opposition against his economic-liberal plans in particular. Fillon wants to abolish the 35-hour working week and raise the retirement age to 65 years. In addition, he wants to cut 500,000 jobs in the public sector and reform industrial law. Fillon is known as an admirer of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. \"Issues pertaining to liberal economic policy have always been heavily contested in France,\" said Uterwedde. \"Fillon's adversaries have already taken up their positions, criticizing what, in France, is called 'ultra-liberalism.'\" That was one of the nastiest words in French politics, he added. An offer for the left Fillon wants to raise VAT by 2 percent. This would predominantly hurt low-income households. Exactly that clientele, however, is wooed by FN with a program that is regarded as rather left-wing. The right-wing extremists are on a clear anti-globalization course, intending to seal off the French economy against foreign countries and exit from the European Union. The party is already trying to present Fillon as a symbol of anarchic, ultra-liberal capitalism. \"Francois Fillon will even go beyond EU demands for austerity and liberalism,\" David Rachline, Marine Le Pen's election campaign manager, wrote on Twitter. According to current polls, it is very likely that Fillon will have to face Marine Le Pen in a runoff election in May. The main hazard for the Republican candidate: his economic-liberal course could deter left-wing voters from choosing the conservative in order to avert Le Pen. \"Francois Fillon will have to start making offers, also to those voters who are closer to the center and more moderate,\" said France expert Uterwedde. \"And he will, prior to the runoff election at the latest, have to make offers to left-wing voters - without changing his original course.\"",
        "generated_story": "French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen is the most dangerous candidate for the French presidential election, according to the German-French Institute of Political Economy (Rbb-Inforadio). Fillon, who is running for president in May, is seen as a \"dangerous candidate\" for France's upcoming election. The \"National Front\" (FN) candidate is a member of the European Union's executive body, the Bundestag, which is responsible for overseeing the country's economic and social welfare programs. He has been accused by some of his critics of being too liberal and too anti-European. \"I don't think he's a danger to France at all,\" said Andreas Jung, a professor of political science at the University of Leuven in southwestern France. In a 35-hour interview with DW, Uterwedde said the FN candidate was \"very dangerous.\" \"He's very dangerous,\" he said, adding that he would not be able to win the election if he didn't have the \"right\" candidate in his party. But he also said he was willing to work with the right-wing National Front party in the run-up to May's elections, and that the party would be better off with a candidate who was more moderate and less pro-EU. That is, if the left-leaning party could win a majority of seats in parliament, it would have a chance of winning a second term in office. And it's not just a question of who will be the next prime minister. It's also about the long-term future of France and the way in which it is going to be governed and how long it will take for it to become a political reality. A new centrist candidate, Marine le Pen, has already been elected to parliament by a vote of no confidence in her party's leadership. She is expected to take the oath of office on May 25. Facing a tough challenge from the far-right, LePen has a long list of problems, including the fact that she is not a Catholic and has never been married to a Roman Catholic priest. At the same time, she has no experience in public life, so she will have to rely on the support of her conservative Christian friends and family. On the other hand, her supporters have long been skeptical about her commitment to social justice. They say she doesn't seem to have any interest in social issues, such as women's rights or the rights of women to choose between men and men. However, they are not convinced that her views on social and economic issues are at odds with those of other candidates. For example, in a recent interview she said she would vote for a woman who had been raped and killed by her father. Her father was a priest and her mother was also raped by his stepfather."

        "target": "Berlin court rules Google Street View is legal in Germany A Berlin court has ruled that Google Street View is legal. But that doesn't mean the lawsuits will end, legal scholars say. A Berlin court has ruled that Google Street View is, in fact, legal in Germany. Last Tuesday, the Berlin State Supreme Court (Kammergericht) announced its decision in a court case from late last year, in which a woman had sued Google, fearing that photos of her, her family and the front of her house would be posted on Google Street View and would thus violate her property and privacy rights. The court ruled that it is legal to take photographs from street level, rejecting her argument that Google was trying to take unauthorized pictures. Part of her argument rested on the fact that Google used cameras mounted at three meters (9.84 feet) high, which could see over her two-meter-high hedge. However, the court did not find this argument convincing, given that the photographs were taken from the street, and not the sidewalk. Furthermore, because Google automatically blurs faces and license plates and did allow Germans to opt-out of the service to have their house obfuscated as well, the court did not find any potential violations. This is the first high-level court ruling, which cannot be appealed any further, regarding Street View since the service debuted in Germany at the end of last year. An ongoing debate Since Google announced plans to launch Street View in Germany last summer, debate around the service has become heated, with some politicians trying to stop it at every turn, while German Chancellor Angela Merkel famously said that she would not remove her house from Street View. In November 2010, the company announced that 244,000 German residents in the 20 cities had chosen to opt out of Street View - less than three percent of residents. However, in Germany and everywhere else, the company also allows people to report abuse, inaccuracies or request that something be blurred using an online tool. \"Our job is to develop services that respect these cultural differences,\" Peter Fleischer, Google's global privacy counsel told Deutsche Welle in November 2010. \"We try to anticipate them. We're all internationally-minded people ourselves. We try to guess how people will react to them. But a lot of these services are new and have never been on the market before, so we learn and we adapt as we go along.\" A 'landmark decision' European legal experts called the Berlin ruling a \"landmark decision,\" saying that this would now become part of German case law regarding property rights. \"Yes, other people are now warned: Don't sue Google simply claiming that Google Street View violates personality [or] property rights,\" wrote Thomas H\u00f6ren, a professor of media and communications law at the University of M\u00fcnster, in an e-mail sent to Deutsche Welle. But, he also warned that this decision was very narrow, focusing on the issue of property rights, and not on the larger issues of data protection from Google. \"The problem of Google Street View - to be honest - has never been a problem of personality rights or property rights, but the enormous risk of personal data compilations in cases where people use Google Street View for compiling personal profiles (such as building insurance companies; future employees, et cetera),\" he added. \"And this risk has not been considered by the Berlin courts.\" Similarly, Viktor Mayer-Sch\u00f6nberger, a professor at the Oxford Internet Institute, agreed that this case was \"limited in scope,\" adding in an e-mail, \"The plaintiff never alleged an actual invasion of privacy, just a potential one.\" Author: Cyrus Farivar Editor: Nancy Isenson",

The court's decision is the latest in a series of landmark decisions in the country's high-profile Internet debate. In November 2010, the Berlin State Supreme Court ruled that the technology should be allowed to be used in public and private sectors. This decision, which was announced late last year, was the result of a legal battle between the German state of M\u00fcnster and the US government over the use of Street- View technology on the Internet. German law professor Cyrus Farivar said the decision was a \"huge victory\" for Google. \"It is a victory for the people of Germany,\" he told Deutsche Welle in an interview published in November, adding that it was \"an important step forward for our country.\" The ruling came after a court in Berlin had ruled against Google, Germany's largest Internet search company, on November 10, 2010. According to the court ruling, Google had to pay a total of \u20ac1.5 billion (\u20ac2.6 billion) in fines for violating the law. Google said it would appeal the ruling to a lower court, where it is expected to take up the case. It is not clear whether Google will appeal, or whether it will continue to do so, as it has already done in other European countries. Germany is one of only a handful of countries where Google has been able to sell its street view technology to private companies, such as Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple and others. But Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment. On the other hand, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said that she will not allow the firm to use the product on its own. She has called for an independent investigation into the matter, saying that there is \"no evidence\" that Google would be willing to cooperate with the government in any way. That is, if Google can prove that its technology is good enough for public use, then it can use it to improve the image quality of its products, said Google's Thomas H\u00f6ren, head of research at the Oxford Internet Institute (Oxford). \"We are not going to allow this to happen,\" said Peter Fleischer, a professor of computer science at Berlin's university."

Among other things, it proposed jail terms for bankers displaying grave malpractice and causing huge damage. Members of the UK's Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards agreed Wednesday that Britain needed a radical overhaul of its scandal-hit lenders. The panel, which was mostly composed of lawmakers, concluded in its final report that senior bankers must be made personally responsible for malpractice through the introduction of a new criminal offence of reckless misconduct. It would carry a prison sentence. The reputation of the country's banking sector had been damaged in recent years by a string of scandals, including Libor rate-rigging, credit insurance mis-selling and a controversy over staff behavior and bonuses in the run-up to the 2008 global financial crisis. The level of malpractice had been \"shocking and widespread,\" said the commission's chairman, Conservative party lawmaker Andrew Tyrie. RBS cut in two? \"Taxpayers and customers have lost out, and the economy has suffered,\" the 500-page report said. \"Under our recommendations, senior bankers who seriously damage their banks or put taxpayers' money at risk can expect to be fined, banned from the industry or in the worst cases go to jail.\" The commission called for bankers to sign up to a new code of conduct under which all key responsibilities within a bank would be assigned to specific senior officials who would be held responsible. The panel also proposed that more remuneration for bankers should be deferred for longer periods of up to ten years in order to \"reflect the longer run balance between business risks and rewards.\" The commission recommended that the government consider splitting the state-rescued Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) into a good bank and a bad one mopping up toxic assets. The report was published ahead of a key speech by Finance Minister George Osborne on his bank reform plans. hg/ipj (AFP, Reuters)",

The inquiry, which is set to be launched on Wednesday, will look into allegations of fraud and corruption in the country's banks. It is expected to examine whether banks are guilty of financial crime and whether they are in any way responsible for the financial misconduct of their customers. According to the report, the inquiry will examine allegations that RBS and Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) committed fraud in 2008 and 2009, when Libor interest rates were set at a record low of 0.5 percent. \"We are looking into whether the allegations are true or not,\" said Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the commission, in a statement released by the government's Office of Parliamentary Standards (OBS). The commission's findings are part of a wider review of British banks' financial practices that is due to take place in September. In 2008, a report by a parliamentary committee found that the banks were in no position to charge customers for their loans and that they did not have the proper documentation to prove they had committed a crime. This finding, however, is not the first time that a British bank has been accused of misconduct in relation to its lending practices. Earlier this year, it was reported that one of Britain's largest banks had been charged with fraud for failing to report suspicious transactions on the books of customers it had loaned them. A spokesman for Barclays said the investigation was continuing, adding that \"the allegations against the bank are not substantiated by any evidence to support the allegation.\" The report also said that an inquiry was being carried out in connection with the 2008 financial crisis, but that no evidence was available to substantiate the charges."

But a leading think tank has warned against giving raises too soon. Germany's foreign minister and deputy chancellor, Guido Westerwelle, has added his support to comments made by Economics Minster Rainer Bruederle about increased wages for German workers. \"When the economy grows and this growth is substantial and sustainable, then the benefits of this upswing should be felt by the people who worked so hard for it,\" Westerwelle told the Hamburger Abendblatt newspaper in an interview. Westerwelle heads the free-market liberal FDP, which shares power with Chancellor Merkel's Christian coalition. Earlier this week, Bruederle, also an FDP member, said in light of Germany's currently growing economy, those economic gains should trickle down to employees in the form of higher wages. Merkel, who is also the head of the Christian Democratic Union, supported Bruederle's idea. \"That is something the chancellor sees the same way, letter for letter,\" said Merkel's spokesman, Steffen Seibert. Not so fast Earlier this week, analysts predicted growth of 3.5 percent this year and 2 percent in 2011. Germany's five leading economic think tanks also predicted that the number of unemployed would fall below 3 million next year, the lowest level since 1992. Despite the current rosy outlook for the German economy, not everyone is convinced that a growing economy should inevitably lead to higher wages. The president of the German Institute for Economic Research, Klaus Zimmermann, warned against reacting too quickly. \"I can't support the idea of a general wage increase, I think it is too dangerous,\" Zimmermann said in an interview with the Handelsblatt newspaper. Zimmermann wasn't opposed to the idea of raising wages, but said he was against across-the-board increases for all sectors and pointed out that not every industry is benefitting the same from the growing economy. \"We can't forget that the German economy did not resort to mass lay-offs when it wasn't going so well last year,\" Zimmermann said. Raising wages in some branches could be a good idea, Zimmermann said, as that would make those branches more attractive option to potential workers from outside of Germany.

The German government's deputy chancellor, Guido Westerwelle, has called for an increase in Germany's minimum wage to $15 an hour this year. In a speech at the German Institute for Economic Research (Hamburger Abendblatt) in Berlin on Thursday, Merkel said she would not allow the wage increase to take place until 2011. \"I don't think the chancellor is going to allow this to happen,\" she said, adding that she was \"not willing to give up the fight.\" The chancellor's comments came after a poll showed that a majority of Germans were against the idea of higher wages for low-wage workers in the country. According to the poll, a third of those who voted for the new chancellor said they would vote against it. However, it was not immediately clear whether the number of workers would rise or fall, according to a survey conducted by the institute's director, Rainer Bruederle, who is also a member of the FDP's economics and economics committee. He said it would be \"unacceptable\" for a chancellor to make such a move, given that the economy is already suffering from the effects of austerity measures imposed by President George W. Bush in 1992 and the economic crisis that followed, when the Berlin Wall collapsed in 1991, to be replaced by a new government. On the other hand, the Chancellor's economic policy team has been working on a plan to raise wages by 1.5 percent in 2011, compared to 2.6 percent for current-year wage earners. This is the first time in German history that Germany has seen a rise in wages since the end of World War II. Last year, Germany was the world's largest economy, with a total of 6.4 percent growth in GDP. That's up from 3.7 percent last year and is expected to rise again in 2012. It's not clear how much of that growth will be driven by lower wages, but it's likely to have a positive impact on the labor market, which is growing at a faster rate than the private sector. And it is not just the government that is opposed to wage increases. There are also concerns about the impact of rising wages on workers' health and well-being, as well as the fact that unemployment is rising in many parts of Germany, and that wages are rising faster than wages in other countries, such as China, India, Japan and South Korea."

The previous day, the 56-year-old leader openly accused Germany and neighboring Poland of planning a coup against him. \"There were [in Germany and Poland] plans worked out for an overthrow of the constitutional order,\" Lukashenko said in the Belarusian capital, Minsk, on Thursday. \"This is not an invention of our intelligence agencies.\" Lukashenko, who came to power in 1994, was re-elected last month with 80 percent of the vote in what the opposition and international monitors said was a rigged election. Relations between the reclusive Belarusian government and the West have been strained ever since. 'Belarus question must be answered' German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said in a statement that the accusations were \"baseless\" and an attempt by Lukashenko to draw attention away from his own wrongdoing. \"The EU needs to find a clear political answer to events surrounding the presidential election and the continued incarceration of opposition politicians and their supporters,\" Westerwelle said. A wide-reaching crackdown against the regime's opponents followed Lukashenko's re-election. Hundreds of his critics were arrested and dozens threatened with long-term jail sentences. Poland also dismissed the accusations as absurd and said that relations with Minsk would not be normalized unless all political prisoners were released. Sanctions threat The situation in Belarus pushed the European Union to adopt a resolution on Thursday in support of economic sanctions against the country. The threats earned a sharp rebuke from Lukashenko, who promised the \"hardest possible reaction\" should the bloc impose sanctions against his country. At the same time, the Belarusian prime minister, Mikhail Myasnikovich, travelled to Moscow in a effort to shore up Russian support for Minsk during its standoff with the EU. That meeting ended with a Russian promise not to impose its own set of sanctions on Belarus over an unrelated spat over oil exports and a commitment to resume a nuclear power plant project shelved after the 1986 Chernobyl disaster.

The government said intelligence data showed links between some Rohingya and terrorism. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government told the Supreme Court of India on Monday that the Rohingya were \"illegal\" immigrants. The hearing is taking place as Rohingya face severe violence in their native Myanmar. More than 400,000 Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh in the past few weeks to escape military and civilian reprisals that the United Nations has described as \"ethnic cleansing.\" Later on Monday, Myanmar's national security advisor said that his government was willing to welcome the refugees who had fled to Bangladesh back to their native Rakhine state, but that the details of the process still had to be worked out. \"We will make sure that everybody who left their home can return to their home but this is a process we have to discuss,\" Thaung Tun told Reuters news agency after a meeting with British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. It was unclear how this would affect the estimated 40,000 Rohingya believed to have settled in India, including 16,000 of whom are registered with the UN's refugee agency. Read more: Myanmar's Rohingya - A history of forced exoduses The Indian government told the court that it had intelligence data that showed links between some Rohingya Muslims and Pakistan-based terror groups and other international terror organizations. It argued that such links made them a \"serious threat to national security.\" The government also said there was a \"serious possibility of eruption of violence against Buddhists in India by radicalized Rohingya.\" Lawyer Colin Gonsalves, who in a separate case is representing about 7,000 Rohingya living in the northern Indian city of Jammu, countered the government's assertions. \"We just want to know: 40,000 people have been here, many of them for the last five years. Have you [the government] filed a single charge sheet, is anyone being prosecuted in the criminal court for being a terrorist? The answer is: no,\" he told DW. The court has adjourned the hearing in the matter to October 3. Lack of evidence India says it is not bound by the UN convention on refugees as it is not a signatory to the accord, but human rights activists disagree. \"The principle of non return of a person to a place where he will be executed or tortured has become a principle of customary international law which India follows,\" Gonsalves told DW. \"And it has attained the status of 'jus cogens,' which is a principle of law that no country can say is not applicable to it, such as torture and genocide.\" In a communication sent to all states in August, the Home Ministry [interior ministry] said the illegal migrants were more susceptible to terrorist recruitment efforts. But an investigation by Indian broadcaster NDTV found \"little evidence of the government claim.\" The investigation that was carried out at major Rohingya settlements in the country showed little involvement in criminal wrongdoing by the refugees. Lack of any evidence to support the government claim has led to speculations that the Rohingya were being targeted for their religion by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu-nationalist government. \"It is really unfortunate that the government is going back on its commitment to refugees which it has reiterated several times in the past merely because these Rohingyas are Muslims,\" said lawyer Prashant Bhushan, who filed the plea on behalf of two Rohingya men. \"I mean this is clearly a case of religious discrimination and an attempt to arouse a sort of feeling of... an anti-Muslim feeling or try and communalise the situation,\" he told reporters outside the courthouse. The UN's human rights chief last week deplored Indian government's move to deport Rohingya refugees. \"India cannot carry out collective expulsions, or return people to a place where they risk torture or other serious violations,\" Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein said. The Rohingya are an Indo-Aryan people, the vast majority of whom are Muslims. They usually migrate to India through a rather porous border to escape persecution in their native Rakhine state in Myanmar, where they have been denied citizenship rights. They are viewed by the local authorities as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. Myanmar's Buddhist majority is often accused of subjecting them to discrimination and violence.

Trek, the company that made the bicycles Armstrong rode to seven titles, announced on the same day it would terminate its sponsorship contract - as did the beer maker Anheuser-Busch. The Dutch institution Rabobank ended its association with professional cycling after the doping allegations came to light, leaving 17 riders in need of a sponsor.

Armstrong's suspension came after he was found guilty of using a banned substance in a race in which he competed for the first time. \"I was not aware that I had been banned,\" Armstrong said in an interview with the Associated Press, adding that he did not know about the allegations against him. He was suspended for one year and fined $1.5 million (\u20ac2.6 million) for \"conduct detrimental to the integrity of the sport.\" Armstrong was also banned for three years by US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), the world's governing body for drug testing, for failing to provide evidence of a positive test for banned substances.

President Obama vowed to nominate a successor 'in due time,' despite political opposition. The 79-year old justice died in his sleep, presumably of natural causes, local media reported on Saturday. Scalia was visiting Texas for a hunting trip, and his body was discovered after he failed to appear for breakfast in the resort where he was staying. US President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama extended \"their deepest condolences to Justice Scalia's family,\" White House deputy spokesman Eric Schultz said. Texas Governor Greg Abbott described the conservative justice as a \"man of God, a patriot and an unwavering defender of the written Constitution and the rule of law.\" \"He was the solid rock who turned away so many attempts to depart from and distort the Constitution. His fierce loyalty to the Constitution set an unmatched example, not just for judges and lawyers, but for all Americans,\" Abbot said. Battle for the empty seat His passing is likely to open a new political front between President Barack Obama and the Republican Party, as Scalia's replacement could shift the composition of the court towards a more liberal persuasion. Several Republican lawmakers have already urged Obama to leave the decision to the next president who will be voted in later this year. \"The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court justice,\" Senate Republican majority leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement, referring to the upcoming November general election. \"Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president,\" McConnell concluded. President Obama, however, said he would fulfill his constitutional duty and nominate Scalia's successor \"in due time.\" \"These are responsibilities I take seriously, and so should everyone. They are bigger than any one party,\" he said. Decades of controversy Scalia joined the Supreme Court in 1986, becoming the first Italian-American to serve in the top judicial body. He was nominated by US President Ronald Reagan. Throughout his long carrier, Scalia voted in favor of privacy and protecting defendants' rights, but also against legalizing abortion, same-sex marriage and gun control. He also drew public attention for his theatrical flair and sharpness of tongue, as well as his alleged unwillingness to compromise. In June last year, the nine-person Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage with a five-to-four vote. Scalia, who was in the minority, commented he would \"hide my head in a bag\" if his own name were associated with the decision. He also said that the majority opinion was \"couched in a style that is as pretentious as its content is egotistic.\" dj/jm (AP, Reuters, AFP, dpa)",

He will be in Germany for the first time since he returned to the country from Mexico in 2012. \"I'm very excited about this trip,\" he told me, adding that he hopes it will give him a \"sense of belonging.\" \"It's a great opportunity for me to get to know my German friends and learn a bit more about them. I'm really looking forward to seeing what they have to say about me and about my life in Europe. We'll see what I can learn from them,\" said the 20-year-old, who was born and raised in Berlin and grew up in a German family in the city of Berlin. His father is a professor of German at the Berlin State University, and he has been teaching German for three and a half years. In addition to his German studies, he is also interested in German culture and German language. A visit to Mexico is one of his favorite things to do in his native country. It's his first trip abroad since returning to Berlin in 2009, when he took a job as an assistant professor at Germany's prestigious G\u00fcnter Institute for German Studies. On his return trip he plans to study German history, German literature, philosophy, art, literature and philosophy at a university near Berlin's Weimar-Munich campus. After the trip, the two of them will stay in touch via Skype, Skype and text messaging. They will also meet in person for a few hours a day, during which they will talk about their experiences in foreign countries, including Germany and the United States of America. There, they'll discuss the various topics of interest to them, as well as how they can help each other in their quest to find a way to better understand themselves in other countries. One of their main goals is to learn German so that when the time comes to travel abroad, it's easier for you to understand your own language and understand what it means to be able to communicate with other people. That's the goal of this tour, to help you understand how important it is that you have a good understanding of yourself and what you can do to improve yourself in different areas of your life. And that's what we're going to try and do. You can't just go to a foreign country and talk to people who don't know you, because you're not familiar with your language, but you've got to go there. So we'll try to make sure you know what's going on in your personal life, so we can get a sense of how you feel about the world and how it affects you as a person. Do you want to become a part of it? I hope so. What do you think? Can you tell me? What's your opinion on the topic of foreign languages? Is it something you'd like to see? How can you say something different about your country? Are you a member of a country that doesn't speak German? Does it make sense to you? If so, I think you'll find it very interesting to me that the language you speak is very different from the way you read about it. How does it differ from other languages, cultures and cultures? You know, from Latin America to China to India to Australia? That is the question that I have always wanted to ask myself: What is it about you that makes you so different? And what does that mean about yourself? Do I really have an answer for that? Well, let me tell you something that is really important to us? The answer to that question is yes, yes and no. If you do not know the answer, then you should ask yourself: How did you get here? Did you learn anything from me?\" I'll let you decide for yourself if you really care about something else. My personal experience is not that different than that of someone who has come here from Germany? My experience with my country is quite different. When I came here I was very impressed with how much I learned about German and I didn't really know any German. But I also learned a lot of things about myself, which is why I've always been fascinated by the idea of learning German in school? So I guess it was a really good experience to come back here and see how different I am from my home country, Mexico. Can I learn something from a different perspective? Yes, of course I would say that it would be interesting if I could learn more from you. Is there something I should have learned in my own life? Absolutely not! I'd love to have the same experience as you did in China? Maybe I wouldn't be surprised if it wasn't so much about China. Why did I come to this country at all? Why not? Because I know that China is because I"

        "target": "Opinion: The pope's impossible mission in Mexico Pope Francis's trip to Mexico is a dangerous mission - a diplomatic as well as political balancing act, one that brings with it enormous expectations. Francis won't be able to meet them, says DW's Astrid Prange. Dead prisoners, disappearing students, refugees shot dead and murdered priests. Mexico has lived through one violent episode after the other. The mood in the nation is explosive. And now this: just a day before the pope is set to arrive, more than 50 people died in the largest prison revolt in the country's history. What meaning does the pope's presence hold on such an occasion? Only one thing is certain: Francis won't be able to resolve the problems of the world's second largest Catholic nation in just a five-day trip. The unrealistic demands placed on him are not something he can fill. Yet the pope carries with him an important message: you don't have to love your enemies but you do need to speak with them. And he's living the example himself by meeting with the Russian Orthodox Patriarch Kirill on a stopover in Cuba on his way to Mexico. Cuba all over again It's sensational! Bannings and mutual ex-communications are ancient history. Nearly a millennium after the split, the head of the Roman Catholic Church and the head of the Russian Orthodox Church are speaking to each other. It's not as if the two will become friends - their positions are far too different. Yet their centuries-old enmity feels out of place and in view of the massive worldwide persecution of Christians, almost unchristian. And both of these church leaders know this. In Mexico, efforts to stem the polarizing forces at play in society have not been successful. The extreme differences between rich and poor are dividing Mexican society. President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto has prioritized economic growth over dialogue with his critics - a group which includes students as well as teachers and union members who regularly protest against government policies. They demand an end to lawlessness and corruption. The presumed murder of 43 teaching students in Iguala in September 2014, a crime which remains unsolved, stands as a symbol of the lawlessness sweeping Mexico. The recent mutiny in a Monterrey jail serves as further proof of the country's shortcomings in regard to human rights and the rule of law. With a visit to Ciudad Juarez and the largest prison in Mexico, Francis will only make that deficiency more transparent. Even the pope of peace has enemies. The route he's chosen to take on his travels through the country has displeased the staunchly Catholic president. A meeting with the relatives of the Iguala victims is therefore hush-hush and participation in a holy mass remains secret. Considering the tense situation in the country, it's still possible that the pope's route will change once again. The church in the pillory Even within his own church, Francis has met with opposition. A meeting he requested with victims from the church's abuse scandal will not take place - a bitter disappointment for many former seminarians who were abused by Marcial Maciel, the founder of the Legion of Christ, and members of his order. It's just one example of how impunity continues even within the church itself. None of the perpetrators have yet to answer for their crimes in court. It appears as though the pope has accomplished more on the world stage than he has brought on reforms to the Vatican. Despite the revolutionary coming together of Cuba and the US and the revolutionary meeting with Patriarch Kirill, the revolution in Rome has yet to materialize. Do you have something to say?

The pontiff is due to arrive in the country on Friday. He will be accompanied by the Russian Orthodox Church, the Roman Catholic Church and the Legion of Christ. Pope Francis is scheduled to visit Mexico's capital city of Iguala in September 2014. Astrid Prange, a political scientist at the Catholic University of Mexico (CDU), told DW that the pope's trip was \"unprecedented\" and that he would be meeting with the president. \"It is unprecedented for a pope to travel to a country that is so close to Russia,\" she said, adding that \"it is a very special place.\" The visit comes just a day after Pope Benedict XVI, who has been visiting Mexico for nearly a millennium, died in a plane crash in his native Argentina on Sept. 14, 2014, after suffering a heart attack while traveling with his wife and two children. His death was the result of a medical emergency that left him unable to work for more than 24 hours, according to the Vatican spokesman, Marcial Maciel."

        "target": "Report: Torture is a European problem too A day after Amnesty International published a report on Europe's collusion with the CIA's torture program, the Council of Europe published its own shocking survey of abuse in detention centers across the continent. Prison guards in several European countries carried out reprisals against detainees who talked to the Council of Europe's Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT), the new CPT report has revealed. The council considers this a violation of the spirit of cooperation between the CPT and the Council of Europe's member states. According to the CPT's 24th General Report, released on Wednesday, reprisals were carried out against prisoners in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Greece, Hungary, Moldova, Russia, Spain, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and Ukraine. \"Intimidation or retaliation against persons the CPT has interviewed may not only violate their human rights but also strikes a blow to the preventive mechanism established by the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture,\" CPT President Letif H\u00fcseynov said in a statement. \"I urge national authorities to respect their obligation to prevent, investigate and punish such actions.\" The report also highlighted several problems with the detention of juveniles around Europe, and proposed a series of practical measures to protect young people's rights when detained. Ad hoc visits The little-known CPT, now 25 years old, represents a unique approach to international torture prevention. A team of specialists make roughly 180 visits a year to all kinds of detention centers (including prisons, police stations, holding centers for immigration detainees, psychiatric hospitals, and even social care homes) all across the 47-member Council of Europe - one of the few international blocs that offer platforms for dialogue with Eastern European regimes considered to have poor human rights records, such as Russia, Azerbaijan, and Ukraine. The method combines the carrot of talks with government officials and the stick of ad hoc visits, which all members are committed to allowing into their prisons. Once inside, the CPT also has the right to interview any detainees it chooses - in private, though of course the detainees have the right to refuse. \"The first thing to say is how important the CPT is,\" said Carla Ferstman, director of Redress, a UK-based organization that helps torture survivors. \"As a result of their boot work over a very long period of time, the UN has set up a global system which in many ways mirrors the approach of the CPT.\" But given that the committee has no powers to enforce its proposals to governments, there are question marks over its effectiveness. \"In the report, they complain about how some of the recommendations they've made have not been implemented,\" said Ferstman. \"It's a sign that they're a little bit frustrated.\" But in the long run, she maintains, the CPT has more than proved its value. \"The dialogue that they are able to have is really important,\" she said. \"Looking long-term, they have been very effective.\" CIA collusion, asylum seekers The CPT's report comes a day after Amnesty International released its own report on European collusion with the CIA's torture program. While the CPT's report examines more prosaic day-to-day mistreatment, rather than mass rendition of terrorist suspects at the behest of the US, there are obvious links between the two, since some countries - such as Poland, Macedonia, and the UK - are highlighted in both reports. \"What is finally coming out in all of this is that the Europeans, despite all the criticism of the Bush and Obama administrations on the use of torture - so many of them connived,\" said Judy Dempsey, senior associate at Carnegie Europe. \"It's really a double standard. This report is quite damning and quite shameful, and it follows the Amnesty International one as well.\" The CPT's work also mentions the mistreatment of asylum seekers, a problem increasingly afflicting European countries that take in the largest number of asylum seekers - particularly Spain, Italy, and Greece. \"With Greece there are two things to remember,\" Dempsey told DW. \"A - the appalling situation of the prison system, and B - the lack of training among police of how to deal with asylum seekers. Awful things have happened. Parallel to this is the illegal detention centers. There have been lots of cases of terrible mistreatment over the last several years.\" \"Immigration detention is a growing issue,\" added Ferstman. \"In the UK, there was a whole parliamentary inquiry into one immigration detention center, where some of the women alleged that guards propositioned them in order to get quick treatment on their claims. Each country has its own history of torture.\"",
        "generated_story": "The CPT is a European problem too, and it's time to step up its game The Council of Europe's executive committee on the prevention of Torture (CPT) is set to meet in Brussels on Wednesday to discuss how to tackle the issue. A day after the US President signed the European Convention for the Prevention and Punishment (ECP) into law, the council of European countries is meeting in Washington. The meeting is the first in a series of meetings scheduled to take place at the United Nations in New York, Washington, Brussels, Rome, Paris, London, Berlin and Rome. \"We have a lot of work to do,\" said Carla Ferstman, executive director of the Council's Committee on Europe, a think-tank for human rights and the rights of victims of torture in the U.S. and around the world, she said, adding that it was time for Europe to \"step up\" in its fight against torture and other forms of violence against women and children. In the last several years, there have been a number of cases in which women were subjected to rape, torture, sexual abuse, forced labor and sexual exploitation. Now there are more than a dozen cases, including one involving a woman who was raped and killed by a man with a knife, according to a report by Amnesty International. More than 1,000 people have died in such cases since the end of Bush's presidency in 2005. That's a record for a US president who has been accused of torturing women, girls and young people for years. It's not just women who are victims, it is men, too. There are also children who have had to go through the abuse of power and humiliation of their parents. This is something that has to be dealt with, as well as the fact that the perpetrators of these crimes are still alive and well and that they are being held accountable for their actions. For example, if the perpetrator of a rape is found guilty, he can be sentenced to life in prison, which is punishable by up to 25 years in jail. On Wednesday, President Barack Obama signed a bill that would make it easier for victims and survivors of rape and torture to return to their homes and seek asylum. But the bill would also require the use of force against the accused, such as those who commit sexual assault, rape or murder. And it would be a crime to use force on a person who is under the age of 25 and whose family has not been convicted of any crime. At the same time, this bill is meant to protect the victims' families and their children from abuse and neglect. What's more important is that these victims have the right to access the justice they deserve. As a result of this, they will be able to make their own decisions about what kind of treatment they want to receive and how they should be treated. If they don't, then they won't have to live with the consequences of what they've endured. They will have no choice but to accept that their rights are violated. DW's Letif H\u00fcseynov, an expert on torture at Carnegie Europe in Moscow, told DW: \"It is not only a matter of time before we see a change in Europe. We will see what happens in terms of how we treat these people and what we can do about it.\" \"I think it will take a long time,\" he said."

        "target": "Dresden marks 70 years since massive Allied bombing Seventy years ago, Allied bombers attacked Dresden, killing tens of thousands of people, the majority of them civilians and refugees. Every year, the East German city remembers its dead. DW's Naomi Conrad was on hand. As the tram trundled through Dresden's drab suburbs on Friday morning, a prim, elderly woman suddenly turned to her friend sitting on the seat beside her: \"You know, my mother never told me about the bombings.\" She shrugged, then, after a moment's pause, continued. \"It must have been such unspeakable hell that she just couldn't talk about it,\" the woman said. She was referring to February 13, 1945 - the morning, exactly 70 years ago, when Allied bombers swooped down on an unsuspecting city famous for its baroque architecture and that, until that point, had survived the war mostly unscathed. That was to change in the course of three dreadful days: As the bombs rained down on the city, its churches and palaces were turned to rubble. Up to 25,000 people - many of them refugees fleeing the advancing Soviet Red Army - died in the inferno that raged in the city for days. \"There was nothing left, nothing,\" a frail, bent man with a checkered cap recalled, \"just rubble and death.\" He was leaning on the balustrade of a viewing platform in Dresden's old gasometer, staring down at the 360-degree painting by the Iranian-German artist Yadegar Asisi; sirens howled from hidden speakers and strobe lighting illuminated the ruined churches and black smoke billowing from the burnt skeletons that were once buildings. The man swallowed, his voice hoarse, barely audible: \"It's so hard being here.\" The soundtrack and images, he said, \"bring back too many memories.\" 'So, so many dead' He was 15, he recalled, working on a school essay when the sirens began to wail. He never finished the essay. Instead, he ran for shelter with his family. When they returned home three days later, the roof had been blown off, the windows smashed. \"But we were lucky: We survived,\" he said. \"There were so, so many dead.\" His voice broke and, muttering an apology, he shuffled off. The bombings were intended to break the German population's morale - a decision that to many was incomprehensible, given that the war had long been decided and Dresden's economic and strategic importance was relatively minimal. Consequently, the death and destruction wreaked by the Allied bombers quickly became a tool, first for the Nazi propagandists in the last months of the war, then by the East German regime for its anti-West propaganda, and then later by neo-Nazi groups, who traditionally congregate on February 13. Even today, \"the debate continues about guilt and innocence, even about the exact number of victims,\" Dresden Mayor Helma Orosz told a packed audience, including delegations from abroad, gathered for a memorial service in the city's Frauenkirche, which in 2005 was rebuilt with the help of private donations after Germany's reunification, many of them from the United States and Great Britain. Call for peace \"War, hatred and violence begin in people's minds,\" Orosz said. \"We must resist any attempt at once again categorizing people based on their origin and skin color,\" she added, referring to what has often been described as a right-wing catchall movement called PEGIDA, generally translated as Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West, which has taken to the streets in Dresden since October. Later, on a platform overlooking thousands of people, many of them wearing white roses as a sign of peace while bracing the icy cold outside the church, Orosz called on Dresden to remember every victim of the Nazi terror - a plea that was reiterated by German President Joachim Gauck when he took to the microphone: \u201cWe don't want the pain that people suffered here to be misused by others.\u201d Behind him, the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, who, back in the Frauenkirche, had talked of the \u201cmiracle that peace in Europe represents,\u201d leaned in closer to his interpreter. Then, as evening fell over Dresden and church bells tolled, thousands - possibly as many as 10,000, according to the city's press office - lined up along Dresden's riverfront, holding hands to commemorate the dead and call for peace as police men dressed in black riot gear looked on. \"I can remember it all,\" Siegfriede Leonhard, a vivacious woman in her late 70s said. She was 7 when the bombs fell, she said, and had been coming to the commemorations in Dresden \"for at least 60 years.\" Sometimes, she said, stomping her feet to keep warm, she wondered whether she shouldn't remember at home, alone. \"",
        "generated_story": "German city of Dresden hit by Allied bombings in 1945 The German capital Dresden was hit on February 13, 1945, by a series of Allied bombing attacks. The bombing of the city's Frauenkirche was the first of its kind in Europe since the end of World War II. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Prime Minister Joachim Gauck were among those killed in the bombing, which killed at least 7,000 people and injured more than 100, according to eyewitnesses. \"It was a very sad day for Dresden,\" said German historian Yadegar Asisi, referring to the attack on the German city in October 1945. Orosz, who worked for the Red Army during the war, said she was \"devastated\" by the bombings, and that she had \"no recollection of what happened.\" \"I was devastated,\" she said, adding that \"it was very difficult for me to recall the events of that day, because I didn't know what was going on. I had no memory of those events, but I can tell you that I was shocked and saddened by what I saw. It was an extremely sad and very painful day.\" The attack came just three days after Germany's liberation from the Soviet occupation of eastern Europe in February 1945 and shortly after the fall of Berlin. In the last months, Germany has suffered from a number of terrorist attacks, including the attacks on Dresden and Dresden, as well as the deaths of hundreds of thousands of civilians. On the day of her death, German President Justin Welby called for an end to all bombings and said he would not allow any more attacks in Germany. He also called on Germany to stop bombing its eastern neighbor, the Czech Republic, in order to prevent the spread of terrorism. Germany, however, refused, saying that it would continue to do so. DW's Naomi Conrad reported on Friday that Berlin's mayor, Siegfriede Leonhard, was also in attendance at the memorial service. According to German news agency PEGIDA, Berlin is one of only a handful of German cities with a population of over 7 million people. A total of 7.5 million Germans are believed to be living in Berlin today, with the exception of a small town in eastern Germany that is home to a concentration camp."

        "target": "Experts: Taliban have not changed strategy with Kabul restaurant attack The weekend attack on a Kabul restaurant frequented by foreigners came as no surprise to international organizations on the ground. Experts don't believe the Taliban have changed their strategy to target more civilians. Dramatic scenes must have played out in the restaurant: Guests sought cover under tables as a group of terrorists shot wildly into the dining rooms. News agencies report the restaurant owner tried in vain to fend off the attackers. He was among the more than 20 people who perished, most of whom were employees at international organizations. The attackers were also among the dead. During the evening dinner rush, at 7:00 p.m. Friday (17.01.2014), one of three Taliban members detonated his explosives-laden vest and blew a breach in the highly secured restaurant. Neither the man-high blast walls, nor the secured access points with armed guards could stop the attackers. The two remaining terrorists were killed later in a firefight with security forces at the scene. No change in Taliban strategy The suicide bombing on the popular Lebanese restaurant, Taverna Du Liban, in the high-end Kabul neighborhood of Wazir Akbar Khan was the worst attack so far in 2014. Afghanistan votes for a new president in April; and the international troops are scheduled to withdraw from the country by the end of the year. Although there are plans for a small contingent to remain in Afghanistan, President Hamid Karzai first has to sign a bilateral security agreement with the United States. But he continues to play for time. In this context, the Taliban may be targeting civilians more in order to drive out not just the military coalition, but the entire international community. Yet \"as horrible as this incident is, I don't see a change in strategy,\" said Thomas Ruttig, the co-director of the Afghan Analysts Network. Similar attacks have also been launched before, \"at least 12 to 15 times in the past eight years,\" Ruttig said. The worst attack was in 2012 at Qargha Lake, a popular weekend destination near Kabul. More than 20 people were killed, all of them Afghans. Extensive security precautions The Taliban, which normally doesn't miss an opportunity for fiery rhetoric, hasn't declared a change in strategy. A spokesman for the Islamist militant group said the attack was retaliation for a NATO airstrike in Parwan Province, a few kilometers north of Kabul. According to an assistant of the Afghan president, seven children and one woman died in the coalition strike. \"You have to carefully monitor the security situation,\" Nils W\u00f6rmer, head of the Konrad Adenauer Institute in Kabul, told DW. \"But I think it's a bit early to talk about a change in [Taliban] strategy.\" W\u00f6rmer's office lies just a few hundred meters from the site of Friday's attack. He could clearly hear the explosion, which shook the window panes in his office. \"It was immediately clear to me that something had happened,\" W\u00f6rmer recounted. But the Konrad Adenauer Institute was prepared. \"We had a relatively concrete warning in the last week related to our neighborhood, and we were very cautious,\" W\u00f6rmer said. He met with colleagues in his secured office. Like most of the international organizations, the Konrad Adenauer Institute is also integrated into the security networks. \"The security precautions are high,\" W\u00f6rmer said. \"But that doesn't exclude the possibility that something similar could happen again.\" But the Afghan security forces have succeeded in preventing many attacks in the past few months, he said. Kabul residents criticize Taliban An informal, impromptu poll by DW's Kabul correspondent, Hussein Sirat, suggested the Taliban are not winning Afghan hearts and minds with such attacks. \"Wherever the Taliban have killed civilians, they have not achieved their goal,\" said Mirwais, a pedestrian in the Kabul city center. Idris, another Kabul resident, seconded Mirwais' sentiment. \"The Taliban intimidate the people so that the security agreement won't be signed,\" he said. \"But the people won't bend to this intimidation.\" How the international organizations adapt to the tense security situation in Kabul will come after many conversations, analyses, and briefings in the following days. But W\u00f6rmer is not thinking about giving up. \"We have a clear agenda and long-term projects, which I considered to be very sensible,\" W\u00f6rmer said. \"I am of the opinion, as I was before, that what I'm doing here with the Konrad Adenauer Institute is worth the risks.\"",

The filter, about the size and shape of a teabag, would be inexpensive, easy to distribute and simple to use. Marelize Botes is conducting a final set of tests on a new type of diminutive water filter before industrial production can begin. The microbiologist pours water from a plastic bottle though a high-tech, teabag-sized filter before analyzing it in her in her laboratory at the University of Stellenbosch in South Africa. \"The filter is much cheaper than bottled water as well as any other filter on the market,\" she told Deutsche Welle. Instead of being filled with black or green tea, the bag contains active carbon granules and is made from nanofibers treated with biocide, which kills bacteria rather than simply filtering them from the water. Nanotech for pennies \"This project takes nanotechnology to the poorest of the poor people who live in this world, and it will make a difference in their lives,\" said Eugen Cloete, who in addition to inventing the filter is dean of the faculty of science at Stellenbosch University and chair of Stellenbosch University's Water Institute. With some 300 million people in Africa - and over a billion worldwide - living without access to clean drinking water, the need for such a filter is huge. When in mass production, the developers said they expect the teabag to cost just a few South African cents (under half a US cent and under a third of a euro cent). In addition to being inexpensive, Botes said, the filter is also easy to distribute to rural area and simple to use as it can be place in an adapter that fits on nearly any regular-sized plastic bottle. Each filter can clean one liter (one quart) of the most polluted water to the point where it is completely safe to drink. Once used, the filter can be disposed of and is biodegradable. African countries, led by Somalia, Mauritania and Sudan, were ranked to have the most vulnerable water supplies, according to a June report by UK-based risk consultancy firm Maplecroft. Decentralized use The filter's small size and light weight make it ideal for rural areas where other means of filtration do not exist, Cloete said. \"It is simply impossible to build purification infrastructure at every polluted stream,\" Cloete said. \"So we have to take the solution to the people. The water is cleaned right then and there when you drink from the bottle.\" The filter is now undergoing testing by the South African Bureau of Standards, after which Cloete and his team hope it can be rolled out to the United Nations and non-governmental organizations that have expressed interest in it by the end of the year. The project grew out of research into larger filters, according to Cloete. \"We were busy developing filters for larger applications, but when you do the tests in the labatory you do the tests on a much smaller scale,\" he said. \"The results we were getting on a smaller amount of water promoted me to think about a smaller application.\" Author: Joerg Poppendieck, Sean Sinico Editor: Anke Rasper",

In a statement released on Monday, the government said it would introduce the technology in a bid to make it easier for people to access water in their homes and businesses. \"The technology will be available to all South Africans,\" the statement said. It also said that the system would be able to be used in schools, hospitals, universities and other public institutions, as well as for schools and kindergartens in rural areas. Under half a third (1.5 US cent) a year, it will allow schools to provide free drinking water to their students and teachers. This is in line with the United Nations' goal of reducing the number of school-age children in developing countries to just a few percent by 2030, according to a report from the UN's World Food Programme (WFP) in June. At the same time, WFP also reported that some schools in Stellenbosch University in Johannesburg have already begun offering free water for students to use as a substitute for school water. However, there is still a long way to go before the new technology is ready for use. According to the report, more than 1,000 schools across the continent are expected to receive water from water purification plants by June, with a total of 2,500 schools participating in this year's project. A new system is also being developed in other African countries, such as Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Namibia, Mozambique, Rwanda and the Czech Republic. While the project is not yet ready to launch, Cloete says it is \"very ambitious\" and that it could take years before it can be fully implemented. He also says that he would like to see a system that would allow for the use of renewable energy sources, including solar, wind, solar and solar energy. 'We are going to have to wait and see what happens,' he told Deutsche Welle in an interview on the sidelines of an international conference on water and sanitation, which is scheduled to take place later this month."

        "target": "How to wrap a present without using paper or tape Next time you get invited to a birthday party, you could try wrapping the present using a piece of fabric and ribbon. It's very easy and the best bit is, it can be reused. Maybe it will come back to you on your birthday. 1. All you need is a piece of fabric big enough to wrap your gift, a ribbon long enough to go right around it, and if you want to make a gift tag, you will also need a piece of old cardboard, a hole punch and another small piece of ribbon. Ready? 2. No, wait, we forgot the present. Get that, and you have everything you need. Spread the fabric on the ground and put your gift on top 3. Fold the fabric around the gift you are wrapping 4. With the last little bit, you don't tuck it under, but create a little flap on top 5. Fold that flap over like this 6. Take one end of the parcel and tuck the fabric inside, BEHIND the gift inside 7. You can take your time to wiggle it all inside. Make it as flat as you can 8. Once it is all inside, turn to the other end and do the same thing again 9. When you have done both ends, it should look like this. Your present is all tucked up inside and you don't need any tape to keep it closed 10. Now for the ribbon. Place the gift on top of it 11. Tie the bow 12. So it looks like this. Finished? If you want a gift tag, that comes now. If you don't you're done! 13. Cut a piece out of an old cardboard box and make a hole in it using a hole punch. Watch your fingers though ;) 14. Put a piece of short ribbon through your hole 15. Tie the tag to your gift 16. And you are finished! P.S. You can either ask your friend to reuse the fabric, and show them how to wrap with it, or if they don't like that idea, you can take it home with you to use again the next time. And remember, you don't have to buy the fabric. You can use an old pillow case, an old t-shirt or skirt, or whatever you want. You can even make your ribbon from an old t-shirt if you don't have any. Happy wrapping.",
        "generated_story": "How to Wrap a Present Without Using Paper or Tape How to wrap a present without using paper or tape. How do you wrap your present with a plastic wrap? You can do it without paper, tape, scissors or scissors. It's easy. You just have to use paper and tape and you're good to go. That's what I did with my present. I wrapped it in a paper towel and put it on the table. Then I put the paper on top of the tape so that it wouldn't stick to the edges. Now I can wrap the present in plastic and then wrap it around my finger. This is how I wrap presents. The paper is used to seal the presents, so it doesn't look like a piece of paper. And it's not just paper that's used for wrapping presents - it can also be used as a pen and ink pen. There's also the pen, which you can use to write your name on, and the ink that you put on it. These are the materials that are used in the wrapping of presents to make them stand out from the crowd. They're also used when wrapping gifts, such as wrapping envelopes or wrapping paper to hold them in place. If you want to see a picture of your gift wrapped around your finger, you need to know how to do that. In this case, the plastic is the glue that holds the packaging together. After all, this is what you'd do with paper if you were wrapping your presents around a cardboard box. Paper is not the only material that can be wrapped with plastic, but it is also a good way to keep your hands dry. When wrapping a gift, it has to be sealed with tape to prevent mold from forming on your fingers and hands. For example, if a package of wrapping tape was used, then it would be covered with cardboard. But if the package was wrapped in cardboard, there would have been a lot of mold. What's more important is that the material is made of a durable material, not plastic. So, in order to protect your hand from mold and mold, use plastic tape or a rubber band. To keep things dry, wrap paper tape over your eyes and nose, or use rubber bands over the eyes, nose and mouth to remove the moldy material. Do you have any idea how long it will take to dry? How long will it take before you start to feel the effects of all that plastic wrapping? I don't know, maybe a year or two before I'll be able to tell you the exact date of when I'm going to finish wrapping my gift. We'll see how it all ends up. Let's see if we can get it wrapped up, shall we? If not, let's just say that we'll wrap everything up and wrap up the gift wrap. Don't worry about it! We've all been through this before, right? We all know what we're going through in our lives and we've seen what happens when we wrap our presents with our hands and our fingers. Sometimes, we just wrap them around our finger and stick them under our fingernails. At the very least, make sure that they stay dry and that everything stays clean and tidy. No matter how much you try to hide them, they'll still be there for you. Even if they're not perfect, that won't stop you from wrapping them all over again, because you'll never know for sure. As long as you've got the right material in your mouth, everything will stay clean. Just like that, I promise you will be happy with the way things are going. \"I'm not going anywhere,\" I said, adding that I'd like to stay in touch with you all the time, \"but I want you to have a clear idea of what's going on with your gifts.\" I also added a few things that will help you feel better about the gifts. One of these things is to remember that packaging is very important to you and your family. Wrapping presents is important for your health and well-being, especially when it comes to your children and grandchildren. Remember that your child is a little bit different than when you wrapped them up in paper? That was the case for me in my last post on this blog. Thank you so much for the tip! I hope you enjoy this post! You're doing a great job! Thanks to all of you who've been reading my blog for a long time. Thanks for sticking with me! And thanks for all your patience and understanding, everyone is doing your part to help me get everything done. Good luck with this project! How does it work? What are you doing with all these presents? Is it working well? Well, for one thing? It depends on how well you are handling the product. All the products are great for everyone, including your kids, your grandchildren and grandkids. With the help of my mother, my grandmother and my father, who is an expert in all aspects of life and I have always been very, very good at home."

The ruling primarily affects Germany's Turkish minority. The European Union's highest court on Thursday ruled in favor of a Turkish citizen, who was denied a visa to live in Germany with her husband, because she was illiterate and therefore unable to demonstrate basic German-language skills. According to the court, a lack of language skills shouldn't automatically lead to the rejection of an entry visa application. Instead, Germany must consider the unique circumstances of each individual case. The court went on to say that quickly granting visas for spouses improves the quality of life and promotes the integration of foreign residents. Specifically addressing the case of the Turkish plaintiff, the court ruled that the rejection of her visa had violated a bilateral treaty between Turkey and the EU. In 1970, Brussels and Ankara agreed not to tighten their residency laws for each other's citizens. Law only applies to some In 2007, Germany introduced the requirement that spouses from certain non-EU countries must demonstrate a basic grasp of German before being granted a visa to live in Germany with their husbands or wives. Spouses affected by the law are required to obtain a basic language certificate from recognized centers, such as Germany's Goethe Institute, proving that they have an A1 level, or \"Beginning German\" language ability. The German government claims that the goal of the language requirement is to prevent forced marriages as well as marriages made simply for the sake of obtaining a visa. Citizens of European Free Trade Association (EFTA) member states are exempt from the language requirement. That includes Iceland, Lichtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. In addition, citizens of Australia, Canada, Israel, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea and the United States also don't have to demonstrate German-language skills. slk/xx (AFP, AP, dpa, KNA)",

The court ruled that the law violated the rights of spouses and children of EU citizens living in Germany.

It said the decision was \"in the interests of the German people, not the EU.\" The decision came after a court in Brussels ruled in favor of a German law that would have made German citizens more likely to have German-speaking spouses in their home countries. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said she will not sign the new law, which was passed in 2007, because it does not comply with EU rules on the use of foreign language in marriage. In a ruling released Thursday, German Prime Minister Sigmar Gabriel said his country would no longer have to rely on foreign languages for marriage and family reunification."

Freiburg scored an extra time goal to squeak out a victory against Hoffenheim. Bayern Munich cruised to a 3-0 victory at home against Bavarian rival FC Nuremberg on Sunday, closing the German soccer tables for the weekend. Striker Mario Gomez got things going in the 10th minute for Bayern and also scored the final goal in the 75th minute off a corner kick from Franck Ribery. Ribery came on as a substitute five minutes earlier, making his first appearance for the team since injuring his ankle in September. Near the end of the match, Gomez had an opportunity for his third goal on a penalty kicked but missed. Thirty points at break Phillipp Lahm successfully converted a penalty kick in the 57th minute to round out the scoring for Bayern. The victory for Bayern moved them into sixth place in the table with 19 points and has continued a slow shift in momentum following a rough start to the season. Bayern coach Louis van Gaal said after the game he hoped his team would have 30 points by the end of the first half of the season in five more matches. Cisse saves win for Freiburg In Sunday's other Bundesliga match, Senegal striker Papiss Demba Cisse broke a scoreless deadlock with a goal in the 91st minute to give Freiburg a 1-0 win over Hoffenheim. Cisse has now scored 10 goals in 12 games and is currently the Bundesliga's second highest scorer. The win moves Freiburg into fourth place in the table with 21 points, one ahead of Frankfurt in fourth and three behind Bayer Leverkusen and Mainz, in second and third place, respectively. Nuremberg drop to 10th place with 18 points at the end of a very tight middle group. Just three points separate Nuremburg from Freiburg.

        "generated_story": "Bayern Munich 3-0 Hoffenheim: Papiss Demba Cisse seals Bundesliga win for Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga on Sunday. The Belgian striker sealed the win with a goal and two assists in his first Bundesliga start since returning from injury. He scored the first goal of the season for his new club, FC Nuremberg, in a 2-1 win over Mainz on the weekend at the Allianz Arena in Frankfurt. \"I'm really happy with the way I'm playing this weekend,\" he said after the match, adding that he was \"very happy\" with his performance. Germany's top goal scorer, Mario Gomez, scored a brace for the second time in as many games after returning to the starting lineup after missing the last two games with an ankle injury and a hamstring strain. Bayern, meanwhile, have been struggling to find a way back into the top-flight since the end of September, when they were relegated from the league after a 1-2 draw at home to Schalke Leverkusen on Saturday. After a difficult first half, Bayern managed to get back on level terms with their Bundesliga opponents after losing their first two matches in September and October. They were able to take advantage of a lack of quality in their own half and found themselves in front of their goal-line for a third time this season. In the 91st minute, Ribery scored his second goal in three games for Frankfurt, and his fourth in four matches this term. On Sunday, the German side came back from a deficit to win 2 - 0 to Hoffenerheim, who have lost three of four games in all competitions, to draw level at 1 - 1. That was the only goal Bayern had in its first three matches, with only one of those losses coming against Cologne and Hannover. It was Bayern's first league win since Sept. 1, 2014, after they had lost to Cologne in Germany. But it wasn't enough for them to pull off the upset, as they went on to lose 3 - 2 to Bayern. With the help of an assist from defender Phillipp Lahm, Rhineland-Palatinate's Paul Schubert made it three wins in five games, scoring twice and setting up a fourth. Schauffele, however, were unable to make it through the 10th minute due to an off-balance attack from Mario Goretzka, whose goal came on a free kick by the left-hand side of Rhine-Westphalia's Francoise Samaras."

Eight people in total were arrested in May after taking photographs of restricted areas.

They denied espionage - neighbouring Oman helped secure their release in 2011 by posting bail of 1-million US dollars (756,000 euros).

        "generated_story": "Six Slovak paragliders released on suspicion of spying in Iran Six Slovaks have been released by the Iranian authorities after eight years behind bars. The arrests came after a series of arrests in the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Iran. Six of the men, aged between 25 and 60, were arrested in May in connection with the alleged spying of Iranian-American spy Amir Hekmati in 2011. They were accused of espionage in 2009 and 2010, when they fled to Iran, according to a court document released in Slovakia on Sunday. Two of them were charged with espionage, while the other two were found guilty and sentenced to seven years in prison. A third was released after the court found them guilty of conspiracy to commit espionage and money laundering, the document said. \"The charges against the two men were not proven in court, and they were released without bail,\" said Slovakia's foreign minister, Vladislav Frigo, in a statement. Fico, who was arrested on May 24, said the charges were politically motivated and that he was not involved in any wrongdoing. He added that the arrests were \"in no way related to the activities of any individual or group of individuals.\" The charges stem from a 2009 incident in which a man and a woman were allegedly kidnapped by Iranian agents and tortured in an Iranian prison camp. In the case, they are suspected of having been in contact with Iran's intelligence agency, which is also known as the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). The men are believed to have fled the country in 2010 and are thought to be on their way back to Slovakia. Their arrest came as a result of a police investigation into allegations that they had been spying for the CIA and were planning to carry out an attack on the US embassy in New York. Slovakia has denied any involvement in this case and said it would cooperate fully with authorities in their investigation."

        "target": "French presidential debate does little to woo undecided voters This year's French presidential race is perhaps the most closely watched election in recent history. Many voters are still undecided, including those in the Paris caf\u00e9 where DW's Jake Cigainero saw the latest TV debate. Just over two weeks ahead of the first round of voting in France's presidential election, all 11 candidates met for the second televised debate of the campaign. It was the first time in the history of French elections that the entire official ballot shared a television stage. This race for the Elysee is perhaps the most closely watched election in the history of the Fifth Republic in view of conservative candidate Francois Fillon's embezzlement charges, the deterioration of the left, political amateur Emmanuel Macron's surprise surge to the top, and the rise of Marine Le Pen's National Front. With so much media attention on the five main candidates, Tuesday's debate felt almost like a consolation for the six other candidates rarely in the spotlight. For French voters watching the televised debate at Cafe des Phares on Place de la Bastille, the saturated stage kept the candidates from detailed discussion of pressing issues. For those who are still undecided, the debate did little to bring them closer to choosing their pick for president. Vincent Couronne, a researcher, said it was good to see candidates who don't get as much media attention. However, 11 candidates at once for the political spectator was overkill. \"It wasn't very interesting. It's just one position after another. There's no real debate. It's not like when it was just five candidates.\" Boredom all round Charlotte Theuvenin and her friends, all students in their early 20s, tuned out early on from boredom and exasperation. \"It was too flat and too hypocritical. Fillon and Le Pen play with our money, then say they did nothing and that they are good for our country,\" she said. As though addressing the candidates in front of her on the TV screen, she added, \"How dare you talk about being president when you use our money for your own interests.\" Le Pen had come under fire over accusations that she misused public funds to pay bodyguards as parliamentary assistants. Francois Fillon of Les Republicains, meanwhile, is under investigation for allegedly paying family members more than 1 million euros ($1.1 million) for government work they never carried out. Frequently casting a blank stare at his opponents, Fillon also seemed bored, or at least more subdued compared to the first debate. Couronne said, \"Fillon seems to be not there. Probably because he knows all the small candidates can attack him on the criminal offenses he's accused of.\" Debate watchers cited Europe as the most important issue of this election, with many fearing Le Pen's promise to tear France out of the European Union in a so-called Frexit. Though no one at the cafe vocally supported Le Pen's plan, several acknowledged the EU is a pressure point for France. \"France's place in Europe in relation to Germany is a very important issue,\" said student Thibault Cirier. \"The general problem is France has lost its influence at the European level over the years, and that needs to be remedied, because France is one of the founders of Europe and should have a strong place in the union. The EU is also important for cohesion and to have a strong position internationally.\" Caf\u00e9 viewers say no to Le Pen Cirier was initially excited by Macron when he launched his campaign, but ultimately decided there was no substance. Now he says he will probably vote for far-left candidate Jean-Luc Melenchon.

Maybe Hamon,\" Taspinar said hesitating. \"I'm still undecided, because there's Melenchon.\" Another viewer, Marie Dubois, said that although she really liked Melenchon, she had definitively decided on Macron. \"Melenchon has a way of putting humanity in politics and giving hope,\" she said. \"But Macron is the only possible candidate.\" With polls putting Le Pen and Macron in the second round on May 7, the undecided voters at this Paris cafe said they were certain which candidate they would not for vote for in that scenario. \"Definitely Macron. There is no way I am going to vote for Le Pen,\" Theuvenin said. \"I will never vote for that woman or Front National, no matter who is running against them in the second round.\" Tuesday was the final debate for Macron and Melenchon, two of the crowd-pleasers among the candidates.

        "generated_story": "Le Pen's Le Pen: No, No and No? French President Emmanuel Macron has called for a \"Frexit\" of France and the European Union. The French president is expected to announce his decision on May 7. Macron's National Front party is set to hold a referendum on the EU's membership on June 7, with a majority of voters casting their ballots in favor of the far-right candidate. French Prime Minister Francois Fillon is due to take part in the referendum, which is scheduled to be held on April 23. France's president, Macron, is widely seen as the frontrunner for the French presidency, and his party's presidential candidate, Marine le Pen, has said that he would like to see France join the bloc. \"I think France is going to have to make a decision,\" Macron said at a press conference in Paris on Tuesday, referring to France as \"the Fifth Republic.\" \"France is not the only country in Europe that has to decide whether or not it wants to participate in a frexit,\" he said, adding that France would be the first country to do so. But Macron is also seeking to win over voters in France, who have traditionally voted for his conservative party, the Front National (FN), which has traditionally been more pro-European than the center-left. In a speech delivered in front of a packed crowd of thousands of supporters of Macron at the Elysee Palace, French Foreign Minister Jean-Luc Melenchon said he was \"very, very happy\" with the outcome of his election. He also said France should be able to keep its EU membership in place, as long as it doesn't interfere with other EU member states, such as Spain, Portugal, Italy, Greece, Spain and Portugal. However, he added, \"We are not ready to give up on France. We want France to remain a part of Europe.\" The FN's candidate for French presidential elections, Thibault Cirier, said the party would continue to support Macron in his bid for re-election, despite the fact that the country's economy is suffering from a lack of growth in recent years. On the other hand, France has been struggling to find a way to get its economy back on track after years of stagnation and stagnation. That's not to say that Macron and Macron will not work together, but that they will be working together to achieve a common goal: a return to the old European model of economic growth and prosperity. And that's something that is important to both the FN and France in particular. It's also important for Macron to stay in touch with his supporters in Brussels and Paris, where he is seeking a second term in office."

And the news was good -- most of the numbers were down compared to the preceding year. Germany's streets were never particularly dangerous, but according to the Interior Ministry, they are now safer than at any time since statistics have been collected. Reported criminal offenses on the whole dropped by 1.4 percent over 2005 -- to a total of just over 6.3 million. \"The statistics show reductions in crime among children, adolescents and teenagers, as well as adults,\" said Sch\u00e4uble. He added that criminality among foreigners living in Germany also fell, saying that this development reflected Germany's efforts to integrate non-Germans. Drugs offenses were down 7.8 percent, followed by theft and street crime, which both declined by four percent or more. Youth violence Vandalism, on the other hand, was up 5.9 percent. Fraud rose slightly, as did violent crime -- among young people by an alarming 4.5 percent. Berlin Interior Minister Erhart K\u00f6rting said that was part of a decade-long trend in Germany. \"As many experts have pointed out,\" K\u00f6rting said, \"the potential for violence in society is increasing.\" The head of the German Police Officers' Union Konrad Freiberg also said those figures showed that German society was not truly getting safer.

        "target": "All or nothing for Bayern in Champions final Bayern Munich have one last chance to salvage a season that has otherwise been marked by their inability to beat Borussia Dortmund: a win against Chelsea in the Champions League final at their home stadium. All season long, Bayern Munich have been consumed with achieving one goal: reaching the final of the Champions League, held at their own Allianz Arena in Munich, and raising the trophy in front of their home fans. After finishing a distant second place to Dortmund in the Bundesliga and dismally losing to them 5-2 in the German Cup final, Bayern Munich are in a must-win situation Saturday against Chelsea. A loss would be the final straw in a disappointing season for a team that can't stand second place. A win for Bayern would mean redemption, to some extent, for their shortcomings in the league. Key players were rested down the stretch in the Bundesliga, especially before the two legs of Bayern's European semifinal against Real Madrid. That was an indication that Bayern had given up on the league and put all their eggs in one basket, hoping for a big payoff with the Champions League title. The same can be said for the German Cup final against Dortmund: true, Bayern essentially beat themselves by making mistake after mistake, but Bayern could, if they win Saturday, wipe the slate clean. Saving the season Win this match, and all will be forgiven in Munich. Lose, and it will be Bayern's second straight season without a piece of hardware, not to mention the heartbreak of losing the biggest match at Allianz Arena since it opened in 2005. \"We must not even think about [losing],\" said Bayern's Franck Ribery on Thursday. \"If we win the Champions League, then we can forget about not winning the league or the cup, nobody will care about that.\" Bayern are a team that thrives under pressure, and the high stakes of this match will be good for them. Chelsea are a team that showed in their semifinal upset of Barcelona that they can rise to a challenge, even if that challenge is simply holding on against a superior opponent. \"We are not the favorites of the game, we are playing away,\" Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech said on Thursday. \"It is very rare when you have the home team playing in the home stadium, using the home dressing room, so I think the advantage goes to Bayern Munich because of that. But we know we have a chance and we will fight for it.\" But this match will come down to the team that can better take advantage of holes that have been blown in each team's defense due to injuries and suspensions. Filling the gaps Between the two sides, seven starting players will miss out on the final. Chelsea saw Raul Meireles, Ramires, and Branislav Ivanovic each get their third yellow card in the second leg against Barcelona, and captain John Terry was given a straight red. Terry and Ivanovic are fixtures on Chelsea's backline, which was already at half-strength due to hamstring injuries suffered by Gary Cahill and David Luiz. Chelsea coach Roberto di Matteo hopes those two are fit enough for the final, since Chelsea will need all the help they can get in the back. For Bayern, David Alaba and Holger Badstuber - both defenders - and Luiz Gustavo, a defensive midfielder, are also suspended for picking up three yellow cards. The impact of the suspensions will hit Chelsea the most. In addition to a weakened back line, Meireles and Ramires are mainstays on offense, supporting strikers Didier Drogba or Fernando Torres. With Ramires out, Drogba could start as striker, with Torres moving to the wing. At any rate, there is more uncertainty in The Blues' lineup than there is in Bayern's, who will be able to rely on striker Mario Gomez and the dynamic-duo of Arjen Robben and Ribery on the wings as they have all season. Most of the question marks will still be defensive for both teams, but to think that this is an indication of a high-scoring affair on Saturday would be a discredit to both team's last lines of defense. Between the posts Neither side would be competing in the final if it wasn't for the heroics of the teams' keepers. Cech defended against wave after wave of attacks from Barcelona in the semifinal for Chelsea, and Manuel Neuer showed nerves of steel in Bayern's penalty shootout in the final leg against Real Madrid, blocking penalties from Madrid stars Cristiano Ronaldo and Kaka. Chelsea's best shot will be to come out of the gate at a sprint and gain an early advantage against Bayern, who will be doing everything they can to keep their long-cultivated dream-final in their control. Otherwise, Bayern's determination to salvage their season may be enough to carry them through to the trophy ceremony - at home, just like they planned it.

The Bundesliga's top two teams are set to face each other in Saturday's final. The German Cup final will be played at the Allianz Arena in Munich on Saturday, with the first leg of the final set for the German capital. Bayern have already secured a spot in next year's competition with Barcelona, and they will have to wait until the last possible moment to see if they can make it through to the next round. That's what the Germans have been waiting for. They have a lot of work to do, but they don't have much time to think about it. In the end, it's all up to Bayern to decide whether or not they want to go on and win the competition. It's not a question of whether they're going to be able to win it all, as they've been doing all season. \"I think we'll see how it goes,\" said Branislav Ivanovic, who has been linked with Bayern for a number of years, adding that he's \"very happy\" with his team-mates' performances in recent years. He's also been impressed by the way they have responded to Cristiano Ronaldo's return from a broken leg. But he'll be back in action in a few weeks' time. His return could be crucial for Bayern's quest to reach the semifinals in Germany, where they face the likes of Manchester United, Manchester City and Barcelona. After a disappointing first half, Bayern are looking to bounce back with a win in their last four matches. Coach Manuel Neuer has said that the club will look to strengthen its squad for next season's European competition, which begins in mid-July. Last season, the Bundesliga champions had a difficult time finding a way out of their first-leg tie in 2005, when they lost 3-1 to Barcelona in extra time at Old Trafford. At the same time, they had to make up for that loss by winning the league title in 2006. Now they'll try to get back into the top four. And that's something that will take a while to happen. For now, though, things are going according to plan. There's no way to know for sure what will happen in this final, because it will not be decided by how many games the team can win. What can Bayern do? Well, that depends on how well they do with their players and how good they are in terms of playing. If they play well, then they should be playing well. With that in mind, there's a good chance that they could get through the second leg and the third leg on Sunday. On the other hand, if Bayern can't do that, what's the point? That would be a very difficult task for them to overcome? They've got to come up with something better than what they did last time out, so they need to work hard and get the job done. This time around, their best players are on the field, not just in front of them. Not only will they get to play against the best teams in Europe but also in Spain, Portugal, Spain and Italy. Can they win this game? What do you think? Can you imagine what it'll take to beat Barcelona? Is there a team that can do it? Who can you trust? How will you feel about that? I think you'll find out after the match? You'll never know until you see the results of this match. You won't be surprised if you're watching it on TV or on a big screen."

        "target": "Heidi hits the Big Screen Heidi, the world famous girl from the Swiss Alps who first appeared in a novel 121 years ago, has hit the big screen in a fresh look. A century after the death of Heidi inventor Johanna Spyri, the lovable Alpine heroine is being portrayed in a new film which replaces grassy slopes and mountainous range with city skyscrapers and city streets. The $ 3.5 million \"Heidi\", funded by the Z\u00fcrich-based film company Vega and directed by German film maker Markus Imboden, is to be launched in Germany on Thursday. The making of the film was one of the highlights of a past year of events including exhibitions, lectures and fireworks celebrating the July 7 2001 centenary of the death of Spyri, whose novel \"Heidi\" sold 20 million copies and has been translated in 50 languages worldwide. It is thought to be one of the most successful books of all times. The book has inspired 17 films, including Shirley Temple\u2019s Oscar winning portrayal of Heidi in 1937 and a Japanese cartoon series. Imboden\u2019s remake is the 18th \"Heidi\" film. Blue hair in Berlin According to Vega, \"the film was transmitted to today\u2019s world without losing sight of the original novel\". But Imboden\u2019s new movie is far from the charming original, with its rosy-cheeked, curly-headed Heidi, delicate Clara and goat-tending shepherd Peter\u2019s frail old grandmother. In the first film, Heidi, who lives happily with her grandfather in a tiny hut in the Swiss Alps is plucked from her contented life by her Aunt Dete to live in a stiff, rich family in the bustling metropolis, Frankfurt. Heidi becomes so home-sick, she starts to sleepwalk and is eventually sent home. But not before she causes confusion in the otherwise prim household and brings laughter in the life of the disabled and homely, Clara. The Heidi in the latest film has blue hair, surfs the net and roams the streets of Berlin. Friend and shepherd Peter sheds his rustic pastimes and whizzes down streets on his mountainbike. Clara is not the weak, lame young girl of the Spyri novel, but a moody Britney Spears wannabe. Aunt Dete is a modern-day stylist living fashionably in the German capital. The new surroundings are a far cry from the tranquil days of cow milking, goat- tending and flower-plucking in the verdant meadows of the Swiss Alps. Transforming the Heidi myth According to a Berlin daily, the remake is a \"refreshing Heidi\", adding that the script writers had managed to transform the Heidi \"myth\" into an independent, self-assured girl and not into a \"transfigured mountain heroine\". However, it is just this portrait of a naive and charming alpine heroine that has made Heidi so popular all over the world. Heidi has become a well-known Swiss brand worldwide. Some 60,000 tourists \u2013 half from Japan \u2013 are said to visit the picturesque wine-growing village in Graubuenden, which boasts the original Heidi House and other Heidi related attractions such as winding mountain trails and pastures. Imboden\u2019s film, which is to be launched in Germany on Thursday, will also open elsewhere in Europe, and may reach fans in Japan and South Korea too. Whether Imboden\u2019s blue-haired, computer savvy Heidi will charm her Asian viewers, however, remains to be seen.",

        "target": "Rethinking the term 'honor killing' The murder of 28-year-old Samia Shahid comes less than two weeks after Qandeel Baloch was killed by her brother. The media was quick to report them as \"honor killings.\" We have to rethink that term, writes Gouri Sharma. When news broke that Samia Shahid, a British-Pakistani woman, had been found dead while visiting relatives in Pakistan at the end of July, mainstream media outlets were quick to report it as an honor killing. It was the second time in two weeks that the media had reported a killing of a woman this way - the first being the murder of Pakistani social media star Qandeel Baloch. There are strong similarities between the cases. Both were murdered in places where they would have felt they were at their safest - in their family homes. It's likely they knew their killers - in Baloch's case, her brother has admitted to strangling her, and Shahid's father and cousin have already been questioned. And as more reports emerge about Shahid's death, it's clear that both were killed because they didn't behave in a way deemed acceptable in a conservative, patriarchal society. 'Deeply offensive' term The debate around terminology in \"honor killings\" isn't new, and after Baloch's murder there were members of the media - such as ABC Australia journalist Juanita Phillips - who decided against using the term, calling it \"deeply offensive\" and referring to it as a \"family killing\" instead. And there are outlets, like the Guardian, that already use inverted commas with the word honor. But some commentators argue that more needs to happen if media consumers are to gain a better understanding of the problem. \"I think an important step for the media would be to refuse to give weight to the term 'honor crimes,'\" said UK-based freelance journalist Shehnaz Khan. \"While it is imperative to highlight that these crimes and murders stem from the roots of misogyny and therefore a false sense of 'honor,' there is absolutely nothing but'shame' within them, as murder is nothing but dishonorable.\" \"The word 'honor' can sometimes carry an almost positive connotation that we are inclined to automatically accept just because it's not happening to us, when the reality is, this a huge problem affecting thousands of girls and women across the world,\" she added. Naming the issue But this isn't a view shared by all journalists. Ruby Hamad, a writer at Australia's Daily Life newspaper, said that the first step in dealing with the issue is naming it. \"There are some deeply patriarchal societies that still limit women's freedom according to old tribal concepts of honor, where, unfairly, the behavior of women reflect on their entire family,\" Hamad said. \"By naming these 'honor killings,' we are acknowledging the role that this misogynistic concept of honor plays, not only in the murders themselves but in these entire societies, and how it entraps both men and women.\" Through the eyes of the perpetrator? There are other issues with the term though. Some have argued that by framing it as such, media outlets are showing the crime through the eyes of the perpetrator - and not through the victim - as they should. And with such cases regularly hitting the headlines, framing is important. The United Nations estimates that around 5,000 women - predominantly from Asia and the Middle East - are killed annually in honor-related crimes, a figure that women's advocacy groups say is closer to 20,000 worldwide. This raises an important cultural element for the media to consider - how far does the term play into cultural stereotypes? \"When honor is considered the most important thing in life, then all family members become expendable,\" Hamad said. \"The collective outweighs the rights of the individual. Does this feed into cultural stereotypes? Perhaps. But that doesn't mean we should pretend that this cultural context isn't there.\" Looking for answers - and alternatives There have been many alternatives put forward by women's advocacy groups, including hate crime, misogynistic murder, femicide and shame killings. But which one should we pick? Al Jazeera for one has decided which one they won't use. \"We are always updating our style guidelines to convey a deeper and more authentic understanding of world affairs. Recent events in Pakistan ignited a healthy debate in Al Jazeera on the term 'honor killings' in particular. Our editors are currently studying alternatives to the term, but'misogynistic murder' is not one of them,\" said an Al Jazeera spokesperson. Terminology in the media matters, and for murders as complex as these, it's the media's responsibility to find a name that better fits the crime. Only then will it become easier to work towards a solution.",

        "target": "Myanmar Junta Announces Amnesty The junta in Myanmar, also known as Burma, announced an amnesty for more than 7,000 prisoners on Friday, including a few political detainees. The amnesty came on the 21st anniversary of the brutal crackdown of a student-led pro-democracy movement in 1988 and the subsequent seizure of power by the current junta. Journalists were invited to Yangon\u2019s notorious Insein prison on Friday as the authorities released the first batch of prisoners. At least 600 inmates were freed as part of an amnesty for over 7,000 inmates nationwide. Among those released in Yangon were two journalists and 25 political prisoners -- rights groups say this is only 1 percent of the total number of political prisoners held by the military regime. Maung Zarni, a research fellow at the London School of Economics, was \u201chappy for the prisoners who were part of the release\u201d. \u201cThis is a very positive personal development and I am happy they have been released but we need to understand that the junta is using the prisoners\u2019 release as a public relations exercise. It is the 21st anniversary of the military coup so they are using this as a way to pacify political discontent in the country.\u201d Amnesty comes ahead of next year\u2019s polls Myanmar's director general of prisons, Zaw Win, said that the prisoners had been freed so they could take part in next year's polls. In recent months, rights activists, pro-democracy activists and Western countries have cast doubt on the credibility of the planned elections as many key political activists are still in detention. This includes pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who recently began a new 18-month period of house arrest after being found guilty of violating her house arrest order in a widely condemned trial. \u201cThe whole Suu kyi trial is rather unlawful,\u201d said Zarni. \u201cBecause the country does not have an independent judiciary, the judges are just puppets who dance to the tune of the top leadership.\u201d Junta is holding on tightly In 1990, Suu Kyi\u2019s National League for Democracy won Myanmar\u2019s last general election by a landslide. But the junta never recognised the results and has since tightened its control over the country. The 2008 constitution, which was drafted and approved by the military generals, which guarantees the army 25 percent of parliamentary seats, is yet another sign of its desire to consolidate power. \u201cThe military is going to be in power for a long time,\u201d warns Zarni, \u201cbecause they have got control of all the political and economic institutions in the country as well as the entire state of Burma. So with or without elections, this is likely to remain the same.\u201d New Democratic Party formed Meanwhile, a new political party has been formed in Myanmar. The Democratic Party is headed by Mya Than Than Nu, who is the daughter of the country\u2019s first democratically-elected prime minister, U Nu. The party has proposed a power-sharing deal with the military, which would give 40 percent of power to politicians and 60 percent to the military rulers. Harn Yawnghwe, the director of the Brussels-based Euro-Burma Office, doubts the new party stands a chance: \u201cIt is possible that they they would be able to get some votes. But it is not likely, even if they were able to contest the elections freely, that they will be able to form a new government because the military is not prepared to let any party rule.\u201d Democrats should exploit elections He thinks the only way out for the democratic forces in Myanmar is to use the upcoming elections wisely and \u201cto take part in them even if they are against them. I think we have to look at the elections as a process which will lead to democracy -- maybe in few more years.\u201d The National League for Democracy has indicated that it will not take part in the polls unless all Myanmar\u2019s political prisoners, including Suu Kyi, are released. Suu Kyi\u2019s lawyers have filed an appeal against the extension of her house arrest and the court is expected to give a ruling on October 2. But few are hopeful that the junta will amnesty her anytime soon. Author: Disha Uppal Editor: Anne Thomas",

Zaw Win, a member of the New Democratic Party, said on Friday that his party, the party of former military ruler Aung San Suu Kyi and his wife, Mya Than Nu, were released from prison on October 2, 2008. \"We are calling on the government to release all political detainees who have committed crimes against humanity,\" said Harn Yawnghwe, an analyst at the London School of Economics in London. He added that the ruling party was also considering releasing more than 1,000 people who had been convicted of crimes committed during the 1990s, including murder, rape, torture and attempted murder. The new regime, which has been in power since 1990, is known as the NLD. According to a report by the International Criminal Court (ICC) in 2008, it was the first time that a political prisoner was freed from jail in Myanmar since the end of a military coup in 1990. Former military leader U Nu was arrested in 1988 and sentenced to life in prison. His wife and two children were also released on July 2 after a court found them guilty of participating in a failed coup attempt in 1989. They were later released under the terms of an amnesty accord signed by former President U Nuri al-Nawah, who fled to the United States after the military seized power in 1991. In a statement released Friday, Amnesty International said it would continue to work closely with the new government, but that it had yet to make a decision on whether or not it should release the detainees. It also said that there would be no further release for those who were found guilty. \u201cWe will continue our work,\u201d the organization said."

The UN's environment agency has called for an urgent roll-back on harmful substances and fossil fuels. In its report \"Healthy Environment, Health People,\" the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), the World Health Organization and several other environment organizations said that, in 2012, an estimated 12.6 million deaths were attributable to deteriorating environment conditions. The largest numbers of deaths took place in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific regions, followed by sub-Saharan Africa, where around a quarter of deaths were likely caused byair pollution, chemicals, climate change and a lack of access to sanitation. \"By depleting the ecological infrastructure of our planet and increasing our pollution footprint, we incur an ever-growing cost in terms of human health and well-being,\" said UNEP Executive Director Achim Steiner. He added that humanity's life support systems had been compromised by globalization and powerful economic interests. The report was released during UN climate talks in the German city of Bonn which are drawing up rules pertaining to the Paris agreement, which seeks to lower carbon emissions. The document suggested that several drivers were responsible for the threat to human health, including ecosystem disruption, climate change, inequality, unhealthy and wasteful lifestyles, along with unsustainable consumption and production. Worsening effects UNEP estimated that an extra 250,000 deaths could occur each year between 2030 and 2050 as a result of climate change, leading to malnutrition, malaria, diarrhea and heat stress. Between them air pollution and a lack of access to clean water and sanitation cause almost 8 million premature deaths each year. Environmental impacts are responsible for the deaths of more than one quarter of all children under the age of five, the report states. UNEP called for governments to act to remove harmful substances from working environments, reduce the use of carbon fuels and rely instead on renewable energy, and change lifestyles to allow a more sustainable use of the world's resources. The report also called for a bigger investment to protect the planet's natural ecosystem. UNEP predicted a further increase in emerging zoonotic diseases (spread between animals and humans), and called on developing countries, in particular, to prioritize prevention methods. \"Never before have so many animals been kept by so many people - and never before have so many opportunities existed for pathogens to pass through the biophysical environment and wild animals to livestock and people,\" the report warned.",

The WHO says the number of children dying from climate-related diseases is likely to rise by a quarter between 2030 and 2050. According to a UN report released on Thursday, the death rate for children aged five and under is estimated to be between 1.5 and 2.6 percent. UN Environment Program Director Achim Steiner told the UN news agency that \"a quarter\" of all children under the age of five have died from the effects of environmental damage. \"This is the highest level of human mortality since the end of World War II,\" he said, adding that it was \"unacceptable\" that children and young people were suffering from severe health problems because of their exposure to toxic substances. He added that the problem is not just in the developing world, but also in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific, where children are exposed to harmful substances such as mercury, arsenic, lead, mercury and chromium, which can lead to cancer and other forms of cancer. In addition to the deaths, there is also a rise in cancer among children, he added, saying that more children than adults have been diagnosed with the disease as a result of poor nutrition and high levels of tobacco use. This is despite the fact that many children in developing countries, particularly in Asia, are now living in high-risk conditions, according to UN figures. More than one-third of those children who die of severe environmental diseases are in poor health, said the United Nations Environment Programme, a non-governmental organization (NGO). The UN said in a statement that this was a \"significant increase in mortality\" and that there had been an \"increase in human health and well-being\" in recent years."

The minister added that the cease-fire could be extended depending on the response from Yemen's Shiite Houthi rebels. Al-Jubeir said he hoped the Iran-backed rebels would \"come to their senses\" and agree to the truce. He urged them to stop fighting. \"We hope the Houthis will come to their senses and realize the interests of Yemen and the Yemeni people should be the top priority for everyone,\" he said. It is unclear whether the Houthis would reciprocate the Saudi gesture. \"The cease-fire will end should Houthis or their allies not live up to the agreement - this is a chance for the Houthis to show that they care about their people and they care about the Yemen people,\" the Saudi foreign minister emphasized. At this point, US Secretary of State John Kerry said anyone who cared about Yemeni people \"should take clear notice of the fact that a human catastrophe is building,\" adding that a cease-fire was \"not peace\" and that all parties must find a political solution to end the conflict. Kerry urged all sides to hold talks immediately. Saudi ultimatum Hours before the cease-fire announcement, Saudi Arabia declared a Houthi stronghold along its southern border a \"military target,\" giving an ultimatum to the residents to leave the area, Saudi state-run TV reported. Lately, the northern Yemeni province of Saada has become a battleground for the Shiite rebels and the Saud-led coalition forces as the Houthis carried out border attacks on nearby Saudi cities. More than 50 airstrikes hit Saada overnight and in the early hours of Friday morning, Yemeni officials said. A Saudi-led coalition of Arab states launched an air campaign against the Houthis on March 26. Riyadh accuses Tehran of backing the rebels, who have made significant territorial gains in the impoverished Middle Eastern country, capturing the capital Sanaa and ousting internationally recognized President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, who fled Yemen back in March. The Sunni Gulf states are wary of Iran's increasing influence in the region, and they see the Houthis' advance in Yemen as a move that threatens their regional and geopolitical interests. Over 1,200 people have been killed in Yemen since the start of the Saudi campaign, according to the United Nations. shs/bw (AFP, dpa, Reuters, AP)",

But the results were not immediately clear. DW's Kitty Logan reported Sunday evening that the Ukrainian president had lost the first round of parliamentary elections in nearly a decade, and the second round on June 15 was expected to be held later this year in Kyiv. A poll conducted by independent news agency dpa showed the former prime minister with a slight lead in opinion polls, ahead of a runoff election scheduled to take place in mid-July. According to the exit poll, the winner would have been chosen by a vote of 1.5 million people. However, it is unclear how many of those voters will be able to cast their ballot. In an interview with DW, former Ukrainian Prime Minister and presidential candidate Andrzej Medvedev said he would not run for re-election. He also said that he was not interested in running for a third term in office. Medivka, however, did not rule out a run-off, saying that she would seek a second term as president. She said she was \"very happy\" with the result, adding that there was a \"clear majority\" for her to run again. Author: kl/kms (dpa, Reuters)"

The 71-year-old cyclist was freed Monday after being arrested on suspicion of drug possession in connection with the 2016 Tokyo Games. He was due to appear in court in Dublin on 10 August, where he is expected to face charges of possession of drugs and money laundering. \"I was released from prison on Monday,\" he said in a statement released by the Olympic Council of Ireland (OCI) on the condition that he would not be extradited to the United States. A spokesman for the European Olympic Committee (EOC) said the cyclist had not been charged with any crime and that the charges against him were \"without merit.\" \"He was not charged,\" the spokesman said, adding that \"it is not a crime for him to be released without bail,\" referring to a plea deal in which he agreed to cooperate with prosecutors in their investigation into the alleged drug use of a woman at the Tokyo Olympic Games in 2016. In addition to his bail plea, he was also ordered to pay a fine of 1.5 million euros ($1.6 million) and face up to four years in prison if found guilty of any other crime, according to an official statement from Ireland's Olympic council of the Ex-Euro Olympic, which is responsible for organizing the 2020 Olympics in Brazil. Ireland is the only European country with an Olympic quota of more than 435,000 athletes. It is also the first country to host a major international sporting event since the 2008 London Games, when it was held in London. Hickey, who was born in Ireland, was one of only a handful of athletes to have competed in international competition since his father's death three months ago. At the time of his arrest he had been working as a coach at a sports club in Limerick. His father, a former Olympic cyclist, had also been a member of that club's board of directors, but he has since retired from the sport. On Monday, the IOC released him on a $1 million bail, and he will be allowed to return to Ireland after serving his time in jail for a number of years."

Twenty years later, relations between Libya and Europe have done an about-face. The Berlin disco \"La Belle\" was packed as usual on the night of April 5, 1986. Among its guests were many US soldiers, who were certainly not thinking of politics, the Middle East or strained relations between the United States and Libya. But reality caught up with them: a bomb detonated near the dance floor that night, killing two Americans and a Turkish woman. Over 200 people were injured. A Berlin court ruled that Libya and its intelligence services were responsible for the bombing. In 2001, following a nearly four-year long trial, the judges convicted a Libyan diplomat and three others to prison sentences between 12 and 14 years. The big oil-exporting country in the meantime was busy working on its reputation. Already in the 1990s, Tripoli began striving to improve its relations to the European Union. Financial reparation opened the door to Europe In 2004, the Gaddafi International Foundation for Charity Associations and the legal representatives of the German La Belle victims settled on $35 million in compensation. This opened the door to Europe. Just a few weeks later, Germany's chancellor at the time, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, visited Moammar Gadhafi in a traditional Bedouin tent outside of Tripoli. Britain's Prime Minister Tony Blair also paid Gadhafi a visit. A few months earlier, in April 2004, the European Union had welcomed the Libyan leader to Brussels. It was Gadhafi's first official visit to Europe in 15 years. Bernd Westphal, the German ambassador to Libya, said bilateral relations had been through difficult times. \"The German Embassy in Tripoli today is working for a quick return to the liveliness of close relations between Germany and Libya,\" Westphal said. \"We want to build on our traditional friendship with Libya and we want to strengthen the political, economic and cultural cooperation between our two countries and peoples.\" Business interests booming in Libya In the past few years, Libya has moved from being the supporter of international terrorism to an attractive economic partner for the West. European business representatives have been increasingly knocking on Libya's door. Even the United States is showing increased interest in the northern African nation. Washington is pleased that Libya announced at the end of 2003 that it would discontinue its efforts to develop and produce weapons of mass destruction. Libya's ambassador to Germany, Said Abdulaati, said political and economic relations between Libya and Germany were \"excellent.\" Libya is one of Germany's strongest trading partners in northern Africa. Last year, Germany exported goods to Libya worth 657.7 million euros ($805.7 million), according to the German Federal Statistics Office. \"The economy is the driving power in German-Libyan relations,\" said Abdulaati in an interview with the Arab-German association for trade and industry. But Germany isn't the only European country making deals in Libya. France last month signed an accord with Libya on peaceful nuclear research. \"This accord represents a qualitative leap in relations between the two countries and proves that Libya has transformed its weapons of mass destruction into constructive weapons,\" Public Works Minister Maatuk Maatuk said at the signing ceremony in March. \"We are telling the world that we are moving towards the development of Libyan nuclear technology for peaceful purposes.\" This week, the Netherlands' Economics Minister Laurens Jan Brinkhorst will visit Libya to negotiate gas and oil agreements. It will be the first high-level visit by a Dutch official since Gadhafi took power in 1969.",

In the past few years, Libya has become one of the world's most important trading partners. Today, however, it is not just the EU that is changing its tune on Libya. It is also the first time that the Libyan government has made a concerted effort to improve relations between the two countries. The Libyan regime, which was founded on April 5, 1986 by Moammar Gadhafi, is now the largest trading partner in Europe, with a total of 657.7 million euros ($805 million) in assets. That's a lot of money for a country that was supposed to be a stable, stable and prosperous country, but which has fallen into disrepair since the end of World War II. At the same time, the Gaddafi International Foundation for Charity Associations (La Belle), a German-based charity organization, was set up in Tripoli in April 2004. Since then it has expanded to include a number of other countries, including Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Russia, China, Japan, South Korea, Turkey and even the US. \"We are very happy with Libya,\" said Bernd Westphal, president of La Belle's board of directors, in an interview with German news magazine Der Spiegel. He said the organization's mission was \"to build bridges between Libya and Europe,\" and that \"the Libyan people are the ones who are going to have to make the most of this opportunity.\" The German ambassador to Libya, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, said he was pleased to see that Libya was becoming a \"very stable country.\" \"I am happy that we are able to work together in this way,\" he said, adding that he hoped the German government would continue to support Libya in its efforts to build a strong and stable state. But he added that it would be difficult for Libya to achieve this goal without the help of Europe's financial and political institutions."

The Social Democrats (SPD) and Christian Democrats (CDU) have ruled the small northern city-state of Bremen in a coalition for the past 12 years. But after winning state elections on Sunday with 36.8 percent, the SPD is now flirting with the idea of ditching their previous coalition partners to rule together with the Greens, who made their best-ever showing in a German state poll with 16.4 percent. Bremen's state SPD leadership is to hold talks later on Wednesday with the CDU, which polled 25.7 percent. After an SPD meeting in Bremen, Mayor Jens B\u00f6hrnsen made the first signal he could be favoring the Greens. He said that during the campaign he had deliberately abstained from mentioning the possibility of a renewed CDU coalition because \"after 12 years it shouldn't automatically be continued.\" Bremen's acting head of government and CDU member Thomas R\u00f6wekamp, however, warned against an SPD-Green coalition. \"The majority of people don't want a red-green experiment, but a continuation of the grand coalition,\" he said. Both the SPD and CDU conceded heavy losses in the election, which showed a swing towards the Greens and the Left Party, which scored an unexpected 8.4 percent to win representation in a western German state legislature for the first time in its brief history. Block reforms? If Bremen's SPD decide in favor of the Greens, this would affect the ability of Chancellor Angela Merkel's grand coalition of CDU and SPD to push ahead with reforms requiring constitutional changes, such as stage two of Germany's urgently needed federalism reform. The federal Bundesrat, which is made up of state cabinet members, has to approve the majority of legislative bills passed by the lower chamber, the Bundestag, before they become law. Also, any proposed constitutional changes require two-thirds of all votes in order to be passed by the Bundesrat. The CDU and SPD currently hold 47 of the Bundesrat's 69 seats, which is one seat more than the necessary two-thirds majority. But without Bremen, the number held by the grand coalition would fall to 44 seats, meaning they would need the cooperation of one of the small opposition parties for any constitutional changes. Internal strife Earlier in the week, Chancellor Merkel called for unity within her ruling left-right coalition after the losses in Bremen set the stage for more infighting between the two parties. Merkel also warned the SPD against moving to the left after it lost some five percent points. The chancellor said the outcome showed the SPD had made a mistake by attacking the coalition and campaigning on promises of a minimum wage, which she believes will hamper efforts to fight unemployment of just under 10 percent. \"The result showed that this strategy did not pay off,\" Merkel told a press conference.",

The new pact, including an artillery buffer zone, was a move to strengthen a peace plan signed earlier this month, also in Minsk. However, Breedlove said violence levels in Ukraine in recent days were as high as prior to the earlier ceasefire. \"The ceasefire is still there in name, but what is happening on the ground is quite a different story,\" Breedlove said, adding that Russian forces were still operating in Ukraine, although he could not pinpoint how many. \"The fluidity of movement of Russian forces and Russian-backed forces back and forth across that border makes it almost impossible to understand the numbers,\" he said. A convoy from Russia consisting of about 170 trucks arrived in Ukraine on Saturday, with a reported cargo of humanitarian aid. Previous aid convoys sent from Russia were met with outrage in Kyiv, as it was suspected they may have been used to provide support to the pro-Moscow separatists in eastern Ukraine.

The move follows a political protest at the first such match. In a statement released on Friday, the German football association (DFB) announced that the games would be rescheduled for 2018 and that talks would take place between them and their Chinese counterparts in order explore how to move forward. \"To the regret of all parties involved, the project has not received the broad approval that had been expected,\" the DFB said. \"In fact, the project was used by a handful of spectators to send messages that were considered hurtful by the Chinese team, officials, the Chinese Football Association's support staff and Chinese spectators.\" Protests in opening match The first of the arranged matches, against TSV Schott Mainz of the fourth-tier Regionalliga S\u00fcdwest was interrupted midway through the first half when the Chinese players left the field because a small group of activists had unfurled Tibetan flags. The team later returned to the field after the flags had been taken down, before succumbing to a 3-0 defeat. On Monday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry strongly criticized the protest. Initially, it had been thought that the Chinese side would play in the Regionalliga S\u00fcdwest - a regional division of Germany's fourth tier which has only 19 teams but the plan was revised so the matches would just be friendlies. This followed an agreement signed in 2016 between the German FA and the Chinese government to help boost the sport in the Asian country, where the Bundesliga is increasingly popular. Financial boost not enough to soothe concerns Despite the financial boost for the clubs \u2013 TSV Schott Mainz were reportedly paid a fee of \u20ac15,000 ($17.800) for last weekend's game \u2013 the move hasn't proved entirely popular with German fans, many of whom see it as just another example of commercial interests trumping sporting concerns. But the protests, and potential for further disruption, seem to be behind the cancellations - the DFB said both federations were aware of \"substantial evidence of further escalation,\" FSV Frankfurt, who were due to host the Chinese side on Saturday, said earlier this week that they would not ban protests despite an angry response to last week's incident from Beijing. \"We will not back a single centimeter off the basic rights our our democracy, including those relating to freedom of speech,\" FSV Frankfurt President Michael G\u00f6rner said in an interview with the Stuttgarter Nachrichten and Stuttgarter Zeitung newspapers. His words echoed those of DFB vice-president Ronny Zimmerman, who said that the games should be played \"within the framework of freedom of expression.\" The fixtures that have been abandoned include games against Wormatia Worms and Bundesliga club Hoffenheim's reserves. mp/pfd (dpa, SID)",

German auto club ADAC says costs associated with owning a car have risen more than 40 percent since 1995. In 2010, German car owners had to pay a high price for their mobility, according to ADAC, which cited record-high fuel prices as the major cost factor. \"For drivers, 2010 will go down in history as the most costly year ever,\" ADAC said in a statement. High taxes The cost of acquiring and operating a car has risen 42 percent since 1995, compared to a 24 percent increase in the general cost of living. Due to tax increases and higher production costs, fuel prices soared 86 percent over the 15-year period. In 2010 alone, the average price for a liter of super gasoline was more than 1.40 euros ($1.84) - the highest the average price ever. According to ADAC, urban singles spent an average of 3,340 euros on their cars in 2000. Five years later, that figure had jumped to 3,900 euros. By the end of 2010, their expenses reached 4,380 euros, or 1,000 euros more than a decade earlier. Driving is also pricey for four-person families with two cars. According to the automobile club, their annual costs have risen 30 percent over the past 10 years from 5,940 euros to 7,740 euros. Taxes account for the lion's share of gasoline and diesel prices. The German government's mineral oil and value added taxes account for nearly 88 cents of the 1.35-euro price of a liter of fuel. Low toll revenue While the German government reaps more revenue year for year from vehicle-related taxes, income generated by its highway toll for trucks is expected to fall this year for the first time since the haulage charges were introduced in 2005.

        "generated_story": "German Auto Clubs Costliest Year Ever The most expensive year ever for German auto clubs has been the end of 2010, according to figures released by the German Automobile Clubs Association (ADAC) on Thursday. The car club, ADAC, reported that it spent 4.3 billion euros ($4.2 billion) in 2010 alone, the most costly year in the history of German car clubs. \"In 2009, we spent 3,340 euros (4,380 euros) at the wheel of a car,\" the group said in a statement released on its website. It also said that the cost of the car had risen to 5,940 euros from 4,740 euros a year earlier. This was a significant increase from the previous year, when the club was founded in 1995. Last year's figures came in at a record high, with a total of 6.4 billion euro ($7.740 billion), making it the second-richest year on record. In the past 10 years, German automobile clubs have spent an average of 4 percent of their revenues on cars, trucks, buses and other equipment. They have also spent a lot of money on equipment, particularly for the new models, which are expected to be introduced this year. A decade earlier, in 2000, they spent nearly 88 cents a wheel on a new model car. Now, it's almost impossible to find a model that is as expensive as the one that was built in 2005. For the first time since 1995, car dealerships in Germany have been able to sell their cars for as little as 1.35-euro ($1.84) a month. Since then, however, their sales have fallen by more than 30 percent, and they are now on track for a 10-percent drop in sales. That's a big drop from their previous record of 5.9 percent in 2009. But the decline in car sales is not just due to the downturn in demand for new cars. Auto clubs are also suffering from a lack of interest in new technology, as well as high interest rates for older cars that are no longer in use. As a result, auto club owners have had to cut back on spending on new equipment and equipment in order to keep up with demand. And that's not a good sign for car owners, who have to spend a fortune to get their car on the road again. At the same time, there's also the fact that many of them don't have the money to buy new ones, such as a Mercedes-Benz, a BMW or an Audi. What's more, most of these cars are still in production, so they're not going to make it to production any time soon. There's still a long way to go in terms of production costs, but the average price of new vehicles has dropped by almost 80 percent since the beginning of 2005, making them more expensive than they were a decade ago. With the exception of BMW and Audi, BMW, Mercedes and Lexus, this is still the cheapest car ever made. However, that doesn't necessarily mean that they can't make up for it in other areas, like the automotive industry. According to a recent report by German newspaper D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany's largest car dealership, Daimler AG, is now the world's third-biggest carmaker, behind only Volkswagen and Ford."

But now they should take care that Great Britain does not move further away from Europe, writes Birgit Maass. If only they had done it out of full conviction. If they at least believed that they could really benefit their country by withdrawing from the EU. But many of the parliamentarians whose vote will finally set Brexit on its wayhave voted against their hearts, as well as their minds. It was a vote against their minds, because the withdrawal from the EU will almost certainly, at least on a short to medium term basis, have negative repercussions for the British economy. And it was a vote against their hearts, because for many, a view of the future, divorced from Brussels and increasingly reliant on an unpredictable US President Donald Trump, is somewhat alarming. In recent days, many members of parliament have described it as \"a catastrophe.\" No vote \"against the will of the people.\" Of course there are \"Brexiteers\" who believe that a Britain independent of Brussels will be able to return to its former greatness, once it is no longer held back by the \"Little Europeans.\" But they are in the minority - the majority of parliamentarians already declared their support for remaining in the EU during the referendum campaign. Yet despite this, Theresa May's government was able to push its legislative proposal through the House of Commons without any great difficulty. The predominant view, also amongst members of the two leading parties, is that to hinder Brexit and to fail to support the government in its endeavors to do so, would be to go \"against the will of the people.\" Anti-EU newspapers have targeted Brexit opponents. And those who have publically come out in support of the EU have had to reckon with death threats. The at times passionate debate in the lower house, that went on over several days, was a temporary highlight in this European tragedy, which in the worst case could contribute to the continent disintegrating into individual sovereign states. Don't be intimidated The British public supports the hard-line position taken by Prime Minister May in withdrawing from the common market. Polls are showing that her strategy is gaining increased support. There is no turning back now. The British are now looking for clarity on the repercussions of their withdrawal from the EU. They want the negotiations with the EU to start as soon as possible. It was an historical misjudgement by David Cameron that he could win the referendum. Most of the members of the lower house believed the then-prime minister and voted to hold a referendum. But now they can no longer stop Brexit. But they should not let themselves be intimidated by party discipline, nor the leading Brexiteers, nor by voter impatience. Over the next two years they should use every chance they can to influence the withdrawal process. May announced that although they are leaving the European Union, they will not be moving away from Europe. The parliamentarians must now hold her to her word. Have something to say?

        "generated_story": "Brexit vote is not a referendum against the will of the people The British people have voted to leave the European Union. The referendum on the future relationship between the UK and the EU has been called by the British government. It is the first time that the country has voted in favor of an EU membership referendum. That vote was held in the House of Commons on Thursday, 24 hours after the referendum was called. \"The people of this country have spoken,\" said Birgit Maass, a member of parliament from the pro-Brexit Brexiteer group, the anti-EU group Anti-European Union (AUP), which is opposed to the idea of leaving the bloc, and which opposes the concept of a free trade agreement with other EU countries. A referendum would be a vote of no confidence for the government of Prime Minister Theresa May, who has said she will not accept the terms of any deal with the 27-member bloc. She has also said that she won't accept a no-deal Brexit, which would leave Britain without a single EU member state for two years after Brexit. But she has not ruled out the possibility of another referendum, she said in an interview with The Daily Telegraph. In the interview, May said: \"I am not going to accept any kind of deal that doesn't work for us. I will be voting against it.\" She also called for a \"no-confidence vote\" in parliament, saying that it would not be enough for her to win the confidence of her own party's majority of MPs. May's plan is to hold a special election next year to elect a new prime minister and to form a government that will have the power to set the tone for Britain's future relations with its European neighbors. However, it is unlikely that May will win a general election in a year's time, as she faces the prospect of losing her majority if she does not get the result she wants. This is a very different scenario from what she is proposing in her speech to parliament. After all, there is no such thing as a 'no' vote. There are no \"yes\" votes in this election, but there are a lot of people who would like to see a change in government, such as the new government in Brussels, or the president in Washington, D.C.

        "generated_story": "Klaus Staeck Artist and Publisher of \"No Detox Water\" has published a book on the subject. The book is based on his experiences in the field of water treatment. It's a collection of short stories, essays, interviews, and photos. \"I've always wanted to write about water, but I didn't know how to do it. I was always interested in water. Now I'm here to tell you about it,\" said Klaus, who is also the author of the book. He's also a writer and publisher of a number of other books on water and water-related topics, such as water conservation, energy efficiency and climate change. His latest book, \"Northeast Water,\" is set to be published in early 2018. Klaus said he'd like to share his work with other artists and publishers, as well as with others who are working on their own projects. In the meantime, he's looking forward to publishing a new edition of his latest work, which will be available in late 2018 and early 2019. Author: Klaus Stadeck \"no detox water\" is a self-proclaimed \"water expert\" who has a reputation for being a water expert and is known for his ability to predict the weather and how it will affect the water supply in his home town of Z\u00fcrich, near the German border, where he lives with his wife, daughter and three children. According to Klaus' website, the project is aimed at improving water quality in areas where there is currently no reliable source of drinking water for people with chronic health problems. This is especially true for those who live in rural areas and who don't have access to reliable sources of fresh water that can be used to clean up their homes and businesses. There are a lot of factors that contribute to this, Klaus says. For example, there's the fact that it's very difficult to get water out of your home without having to go to the emergency room. And then there are the environmental factors which can lead to an adverse effect on a person's health and well-being. That's why, in Klaus's case, it would be a good idea to start a magazine with a focus on environmental issues, rather than on issues that affect people's lives and livelihoods. So far, that's been the case with Klaus and his team. They've been working hard on this project for a long time and they're very pleased with the results so far. One of their main goals is to make sure that people are aware of what's going on in their home country. To do that, they have to understand that their water is not contaminated and that they are not drinking the same water as they should be drinking. But that doesn't mean that you're not going to drink it, because you can't use it in your own home. What's more important is that the environment is clean and clean, so that everyone is able to enjoy the benefits of that clean water,\" Klaus told the magazine's editors. However, this isn't enough for the average person who lives in a house with no water in it and has no idea what to expect from the outside world. As Klaus pointed out in an interview with \"The New York Times\" in 2013, a large part of this is due to a lack of awareness about the dangers that water poses to people and their health. Not only is it a waste of human life but it also affects the health of our planet and our environment as a whole. If you want to know more about what is happening in our world, you'll need to ask yourself, what are you doing? What do you think? Do you have any idea how much water you are drinking? Is it safe to use this water? Does it have a negative impact on your health? Did you know that your water has been contaminated? Are you drinking enough? If so, then you've done your research. You've got to take a look at the facts and figures that are out there. How does it affect your drinking habits? I think it depends on how you feel about your environment and what you do with your body temperature and your diet. Does that make you a better person? You know what I mean? Well, I would say that we're all very happy with that. We're happy to see that Klaus is doing a great job at his own business and we've had a very good job in this area. At the very least, we'll be doing our best to improve the quality of life for all of us here at home and in other areas, including our homes, our schools and workplaces and the lives of people who work here? We'll see what we can do to help you get the information you need? Can you tell us? How can you make a difference? And how can we make the most of it? The answer to that question is up to you? Let me know! I'd love to hear from you! You can tell me! We'd be surprised if you haven't read the article. Read more: \"NO DETOX"

        "target": "A Brief History of the Seaside Holiday These days, millions take seaside holidays for granted as one of life's pleasures. But 200 years ago, a dip in the sea was more a test of courage. Hardly anyone could swim. As late as the 18th century, many Europeans still thought of the sea as the realm of Satan: storm-tossed and inhabited by terrifying monsters. \"Unlike the mountains, the coasts were terra incognita as a holiday spot,\" says Manfred B\u00e4tje, director of the Bade-Museum on the North Sea island of Norderney. Anyone who set foot in the water was \"stepping into the unknown\". Brighton showed the way That only began to change after the British aristocracy discovered the healing power of salt water. As early as 1780, Brighton, England's biggest and oldest seaside resort, was a bustling spa. Philosopher and physicist Georg Christoph Lichtenberg (1742-1799) of G\u00f6ttingen gave Germans the starting signal with his 1793 essay \"Why doesn't Germany have any large public seaside resorts?\" In it, he called for the creation of a resort in Cuxhaven on the North Sea. He received support from the most notable German physician of the time, the Prussian king's court physician, Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland. But things turned out somewhat differently. Germany's first seaside resort was indeed built in September, 1793, but in Heiligendamm on the Baltic Sea. Four years later, permission was granted for construction of Germany's first resort on the North Sea, on Norderney. \"For the first bathing season on July and August of 1800, only around 250 guests turned up. Now, the nearly 6000 residents host a good 530,000 bathers annually, plus around 230,000 day-trippers,\" B\u00e4tje reels off the figures. Romanticist inspiration In the 19th century, the landscapes of Caspar David Friedrich, such as his famous Chalk Cliffs on R\u00fcgen (1818), gave seaside holidays added impetus. From then on, the sea was no longer a voracious beast. From the shore, the cultivated, modern European contemplated the vast melancholy of the deep. \"The calm sea became an embodiment of unspecified yearning, the waves an expression of vitality and dynamism,\" soliloquizes museum director B\u00e4tje. But the journey to the sea long remained an arduous, time-consuming one. It took the mail coach a good thirty hours to cover the distance from Hamburg to the North Frisian town of Aurich over bumpy, muddy roads. The express cab from Bremen only took about 16 hours to reach the East Frisian town of Norden - including six changes of horses along the way. \"It wasn't comfortable,\" explains B\u00e4tje. Not until the introduction of seaside tourist steamers out of Hamburg and Bremen to the islands and the expansion of the railways did the journey become easier. Strict bathing rules At first, it was primarily the well-to-do bourgeois and nobility who were able to afford a seaside holiday. Victorian-era society is known for its extreme prudishness, and the beach was not exempt. Bathing machines were essentially changing cabins on wheels that could be rolled into the surf. The sexes were kept strictly separated. Wet swimsuits could not be allowed to cling, thus revealing the body's contours. Women sported baggy flannel garments with bloomers underneath that swiftly became waterlogged to where the bather was risking her life. Hardly anyone really knew how to swim anyway. \"Most bathers wouldn't stay in the water any more than two minutes, often just seconds at a time. The English had a rule: 'Three dips and out',\" quips archivist Manfred B\u00e4tje, whose Bade-Museum is housed in a building for a former wave pool, just a few steps from Norderney's Weststrand, where, during the summer months, vacationers sunbathe in wicker beach chairs and on blankets, cooled by a salty sea breeze. Sunbathing first came in style early in the 20th century, and the first true swimsuits were produced in the United States. \"Starting in 1919, today's bathing culture gradually began to take shape,\" B\u00e4tje looks back. At the same time, ideals of beauty were in flux - such as the attitude towards tan skin, which had long been regarded as a mark of farmers and manual laborers. B\u00e4tje: \"People were still cultivating their genteel pallors.\" Water, Waves, Wellness Today, the sun worshipers are the devout masses, and seaside holidays are their pilgrimages. The North Sea resorts alone count some 12.9 million overnight stays annually. Health is once again a primary concern: sea air, sea water, sea salts and the algaes and mud used in",

        "target": "Threat of the Punjabi Taliban is growing Deutsche Welle talks to Pakistani political expert Hasan Askari Rizvi about the growing ties between militants in northwest Pakistan and Punjab province. At least four gunmen disguised in police uniforms raided a hospital in Pakistan's eastern city of Lahore on Monday night, claiming at least five lives. Local officials said the gunmen were trying to free a militant, who was being treated there after being captured during attacks on two mosques last Friday. The police said the gunfight at Jinnah Hospital had lasted around 45 minutes but the gunmen had managed to flee. Friday's twin attacks on the minority Ahmadi community left more than 90 people dead. They were claimed by a group, which identified itself as the Punjabi wing of the Taliban. Deutsche Welle spoke to political expert Hasan Askari Rizvi in Lahore, where there has been a wave of violence in recent days. DW: Who are the \"Punjabi Taliban\"? It is a kind of a pejorative term, which includes a host of groups. Initially in Punjab, you had two types of militancy: One, the groups that focussed mainly on Indian-administered Kashmir and there were other types of groups that focussed on Pakistan. Those were the sectarian groups targeting mainly the Shias, and there were some Shia groups targeting the Sunni leadership. Over the years a lot of factions have broken away from these groups and these small entities are functioning more or less autonomously. They have trainings in the tribal areas because these are secured for them and certain parts are not under Pakistani control so these groups go there. They operate with the Pakistani Taliban based in tribal areas against the Pakistani troops in the region. They also have an autonomous agenda, which they pursue in Punjab, as they have been doing in the past days. These groups also play host or are a kind of a local link to Taliban suicide bombers who come into the main part of Pakistan from the tribal areas (let's say to Punjab). If they have to target some place, they park themselves with these Punjab groups, and then do it. All these factions and groups that have broken away from traditional militant groups and are functioning in close collaboration with tribal area Taliban are often described as the \"Punjabi Taliban\". Why do you think these militants are resurfacing now? They have always existed here and there and generally the trend is that they undertake a couple of operations, one after the other. Then the government comes in and takes action against them. Then they just disappear or become sleeping groups and suddenly after a couple of months they resurface. That's the standard pattern. The last major incident in Lahore was in the first week of March. Then there was nothing in April and now towards the end of May you have this kind of incident. Do you think the government should have taken stronger action against them? They should have but the problem is that the Punjab government has a kind of ambiguous approach and I think there is some element of denial within the leadership also. These groups also have some sympathy if not support at the societal level and that makes it difficult for the government to go against them openly. They need to work together and to emphasise to the people that they are terrorists. They use different names and Islam but actually their agenda is terrorism. Somehow the government of Punjab has been rather confused and ambiguous regarding these groups. Interview: Disha Uppal Editor: Anne Thomas",

The group, known as the \"Pakistani Taliban,\" is believed to be based in Pakistan's northwestern Punjab province of Punjab.

It is said that the Taliban have been gaining strength in Punjab, where the Pakistani government is based, and that they have a strong presence in large parts of the country. However, it is not clear how much of a threat is there. DW's Disha Uppal and Hasan Askari Rizvi spoke to DW in Lahore on Monday about the growing threat from the Pakistan Taliban, which they claim to control. \"The Taliban are a terrorist organization,\" said Uddin Ahmadi, a professor of political science at Punjab's Jinnah Hospital."

He was 45. The Catalan club announced the death of its former bench boss in a statement posted on its website on Friday. \"FC Barcelona is in immense mourning. Tito Vilanova has died at the age of 45. May he rest in peace,\" the statement said. Vilanova had first been diagnosed with a tumor in a saliva gland in November 2011, while he was an assistant to then-Barcelona head coach Pep Guardiola. He had been battling against recurring cancer ever since and had been admitted to a Barcelona hospital last week. He led Barca to the Primera Liga title last season, his only campaign as head coach, when the Catalans earned a record-tying 100 points. Last July he stepped down due to his ongoing health problems. Vilanova is survived by his wife and two children, including a son who now plays in Barcelona's youth academy. pfd/lw (AP, dpa, AFP)",
        "generated_story": "Barca midfielder Tito Vilanova dies in hospital after battle with cancer Catalan football coach Pep Guardiola announced on Friday that the 45-year-old midfielder had died from cancer. He had been battling cancer for more than a year. \"He was in a very difficult situation,\" Guardiola said at a news conference in Barcelona, adding that he was \"deeply saddened\" by the news. The Catalan national football team's top scorer in November 2011 was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer at the end of last season, according to a statement released by Barcelona's football federation. Vilavan, who was born in the city of Barcelona and now plays for FC Barcelona in Spain's Primera Liga, was one of the club's most successful players in recent years. His death came after a lengthy illness that left him unable to play football for a number of months. According to the statement, he had suffered a \"severe illness\" that required him to undergo chemotherapy and radiation treatments for several months before returning to Barcelona for the final time last month. In November last year, the Barcelona coach announced he would step down from his position as head coach of Barca after suffering a heart attack and a kidney failure. At the time of his death, Barcelona were in fourth place, behind only Real Madrid and Sevilla in second place. However, a medical examination showed that his condition was stable and he did not require further treatment. A medical report from the medical center said the cause of death was a combination of a stomach virus and cancer, which had spread to his liver and liver. It was not immediately clear if the diagnosis was related to an ongoing illness, or whether the cancer was caused by a drug overdose. Barcelona are currently in third place in La Liga with just one point from their last four games. They are on course to reach the top spot in next season's league, where they have a chance to qualify for next year's Copa del Rey final. Last season they were placed on the brink of relegation after losing their first-ever league match to Real Sociedad, in which they lost 3-1 to eventual winner Real Betis. After the loss of their previous two league games, they went on to win the league in their final two games in all competitions, with Barcelona coming on top of that with two wins and one draw. But the Catalan league is still in its early stages of recovery following a long period of illness. Guardiola has said he will not rule out the possibility of another comeback, but he is not ruling out a return to full-time coaching."
