        "target": "Opinion: Obama's Cuban revolution President Barack Obama has made a very special declaration of love to Cuba. It's as revolutionary as the Cuban revolution, and as peaceful as the biblical Sermon on the Mount, says DW's Astrid Prange. US President Barack Obama has lost his old communist \"enemy,\" and Cuban President Raul Castro has lost his hatred of capitalism. In the first phone call from president to president since 1961 the two heads of state came to a surprisingly swift agreement. They want to renew diplomatic relations, which have been on ice for more than 50 years, and exchange ambassadors. It's only a matter of time before the US lifts its trade embargo against Cuba. All the word \"embargo\" is really good for - at this stage - is as an ideological soapbox for political hardliners, especially Republicans in Congress who believe lifting sanctions would constitute defeat for the US. Yet the lifting of the embargo has already begun. In addition to medication, it has been possible since 2000 to export agricultural produce such as maize, cereal crops, and poultry to Cuba. Flirting with the rogue state Furthermore, 100,000 US citizens have travelled to Cuba since 2011 for cultural and scientific exchanges. Travel restrictions on Cubans living in exile in the US who wanted to visit their relatives on the island were also lifted. According to press reports, the two countries' military forces are even said to be cooperating, as are their coastguards, and military on the border of the US marine base in Guantanamo. Now Obama wants to officially open a \"new chapter\" in relations with the communist Caribbean island and remove Cuba from the US list of so-called \"rogue states\" that support terrorism. The travel ban on American tourists visiting the island will also largely be lifted. That's as far as things will go for the time being, as Obama would require a majority in Congress in Washington to lift the embargo entirely. But even if these are only small steps, the fall of the American-Cuban wall has begun. The easing of the sanctions and the resumption of diplomatic relations are setting the scene for an end to the embargo. Embargo as scapegoat The tearing down of this \"wall in the mind\" is long overdue. The blockade is obsolete, and has proved to be entirely ineffective. More than this, its advocates have achieved the opposite of what they actually wanted. The blockade has provided the leaders in Havana with an easy excuse for their economic failure. Raul Castro realized long ago that Cuba's economic problems can no longer be justified simply by citing the US embargo. It looks as though he was counting on the blockade being lifted: There is no other explanation for the completion of the Mariel container port in January this year. Cuba's biggest infrastructure project was, incidentally, financed by Brazil. The Brazilians also sent a declaration of love to Cuba. Raul Castro opened the door to them. He loves anyone who helps him - his friends even more than his enemies.",

The 89-year-old did not say when exactly his resignation would take effect. Calling the move a personal decision, President Giorgio Napolitano made his announcement during an end-of-year speech on Wednesday. \"I'm about to step down, to resign as the constitution expressly allows,\" he said, adding. \"I've reached an age that brings with it growing limitations and difficulties for me to do my institutional duties, which are complex and very demanding.\" Though he did not say when his resignation would take effect, a potential date is January 13 when Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi is due to give up the country's rotating six-month presidency of the Council of the European Union. Renzi faces a political challenge in organizing a replacement for Napolitano, dubbed by Italian media as \"King George.\" The president has served as a key intermediary between political parties through numerous changes in government and other tricky political situations. Napolitano, a former communist respected by Europe and Washington, took office in 2006. At the end of his seven-year mandate in 2013, he was asked to stay on because parliament could not agree on his successor. At the time he warned he may not serve out the full term, given his age. In Italy, presidents have loosely-defined powers including the ability to nominate prime ministers, dissolve parliament and veto legislation, as well as use the moral authority of the office to influence politics. se/cmk (dpa, Reuters)",

The president's resignation comes a day after the resignation of his predecessor, Mario Monti, who was widely considered to be the most powerful man in the world. He had been in office for more than a year and a half, but his term was cut short due to a lack of support from his own party and the United States, according to Italian public broadcaster RAI. It was not immediately clear whether he would be reappointed to the post, which would have been his first since taking office in January 2015. Italian media reported that the president had asked for an extension to his mandate until the end of this year, citing \"serious differences\" between his party's policies and those of other European leaders. Italy, however, said it had not yet decided whether to extend the term of its former president, Giampiero Paolo Gentiloni, to January 1, 2019. In an interview with Italian newspaper Il Sole 24 Ore, Italian Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said he was \"deeply disappointed\" with the results of last year's elections, adding that \"it was a very difficult time\" for Italy to win the presidency and that it was time to move on from its current position as head of state. But he also said that he had \"no regrets\" about the outcome of Sunday's election, saying the election was an \"important step forward.\" \"We are deeply disappointed,\" he said, referring to \"the election of a new president\" and \"that the old president will no longer be able to lead Italy.\" He added that Italy would continue to work closely with its European partners, including the US, Britain, France, Germany, Spain, Portugal, Italy and Spain. However, he did not rule out the possibility of re-election in 2019, when the EU Council of Ministers will meet in Brussels on Thursday to discuss the next steps for the bloc's member states. A spokesman for Italian President Mario Draghi said in an email: \"It is a difficult situation for us to deal with. We have a lot of work to do, and we are working very hard to make sure that we have the best possible outcome for our country.\" The Italian president is expected to take office on Jan. 1. Last week, President Gennaro Gattuso announced his intention to seek a second term as EU foreign policy chief at a meeting of EU leaders in Washington, D.C. on the sidelines of an EU summit in New York."

In the latest incident, seats were ripped out and a goal post wrenched from the ground after St. Gallen faced the prospect of relegation following a 2-0 defeat to Bellinzona on May 20. St. Gallen was the third incident in a month that saw violent clashes with police who twice resorted to rubber bullets and tear gas. While Switzerland is seen as a low risk country in terms of hooliganism, violence has been on the increase in recent years and estimates claim there are around 400 hooligans and 600 sympathizers. Swiss Sports Minister Samuel Schmid said that hooliganism cannot be ruled out, reported German news agency DPA. But he expressed his belief that extra measures such as more policing, restrictions on alcohol -- which he has called \"a catalyst for violence\" -- and video surveillance will help keep trouble at bay. Private firms to boost European police The private security companies will be responsible for patrolling the stadiums and their surroundings, as well as the public viewing areas, team hotels and trainings areas. An international police force will manage the rest. Switzerland has committed some 31,200 police officers and soldiers. Another 1,700 police will be sent from Germany, which will have the authority to make arrests.

Conservative members of Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition put forward a united front at the weekend against recent developments in the city of Wuppertal. Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said civilians wearing uniforms bearing the logo \"Shariah police\" could not simply start patrolling German streets. The groups reportedly hovered around sites like discotheques and gambling houses, telling passers-by to refrain from gambling and alcohol. Wuppertal's police have begun pressing charges. \"Sharia law is not tolerated on German soil,\" de Maiziere told mass-circulation daily Bild on Saturday. \"Nobody can take it upon themselves to abuse the good name of the German police.\" Justice Minister Heiko Maas, meanwhile, told Bild that \"the state alone\" was responsible for the administration of justice in Germany. It was obvious, Maas said, that any illegal parallel system of law enforcement would not be tolerated. Christian Democrat party whip Volker Kauder was similarly emphatic in an interview to be published in this week's Welt am Sonntag newspaper. \"Under absolutely no circumstances can we tolerate self-styled 'Sharia police officers' patrolling our streets and dictating what people should or should not do,\" Kauder said. Ringleader: goal was attention The 33-year-old behind the Wuppertal patrols, former fireman Sven Lau, published a video on his website on Saturday. Lau said that a \"Sharia police\" never existed, and that a group of men had simply worn the mock uniforms for a few hours. \"We knew that this would raise attention,\" Lau said, claiming that his goal was to spark a debate about Sharia law in Germany. Lau is a leading member of Germany's Salafist movement, advocates of a strict Sunni interpretation of political Islam. He works with a mosque in his native M\u00f6nchengladbach, not far west of Wuppertal, and used to head the fundamentalist group \"Invitation to Paradise.\" (Einladung zum Paradies, in German.) The central council of Muslims in Germany (ZMD) condemned the activities. \"These few teen yobs do not speak in our name,\" chairman Ayman A. Mazyek told the Tagesspiegel am Sonntag newspaper. \"These people are perverting the name of our religion. With this shrill and foolish action, they are really hurting Muslims.\" Sharia law is the Arabic term for a legal system based on the Koran. Saudi Arabia and Iran are examples of countries where such a system officially applies. Wearing a veil is obligatory for women and corporal punishment such as stoning is legally tolerated. Human Rights Watch reported last month that Saudi Arabia had beheaded 19 people in just 16 days in August, for convictions on charges ranging from cannabis smuggling to \"sorcery.\" msh/rc (AFP, dpa, Reuters)",

He said the police had \"no tolerance\" for \"Islamic terrorism\" and that they would not be allowed to use force against Muslims in Germany. Mazyek, who is a member of parliament from M\u00f6nchengladbach, told the paper that he had been invited to attend the meeting, which was to be held at the city's main mosque. Maas said he was not aware of any plans to impose Sharia law on Muslims, adding that \"it is not something that can be tolerated.\" He also said that the security forces were not to blame for the attacks, saying they were simply responding to the threat posed by Islamic terrorism. In a statement to Bild, the chancellor said: \"The police have no tolerance for terrorism, and they will continue to do so until the end of this year.\" \"This is the first time that we have had to deal with this kind of situation,\" Merkel said. On Sunday, she said she was \"very concerned\" about the \"threats\" posed to German society by \"Islamists\" who use the term \"radicalization\" to refer to a group of people who have been radicalized, such as the Islamic State (IS) and the Ku Klux Klan (KKK). \"I am very concerned that this will lead to an increase in attacks on the Muslim community,\" she told Bild. She added that there was a \"growing awareness\" among the public that Islamic extremists were spreading their ideology and were \"increasingly becoming more and more radical.\" She also called for an end to \"sharia law\" which has led to mass killings of Muslims and other forms of violence against minorities. Merkel's Christian Democrat party (CDU) has been in power since 2005, when she took over the leadership of her conservative Christian Christian coalition government. But the CDU has not been able to stop the rise of radicalization, according to media reports. Last year, it announced that it would no longer allow police to carry out raids on mosques, but instead would only allow them to detain people suspected of having links to extremist groups. A spokesman for her party, Christian Democratic Party, said it was willing to cooperate with police in order to prevent the spread of extremism.

Lui said the world community needed to get the \"upper hand\" over the next six months. While the viral spread had been slowed in Guinea, concerns focused especially on Liberia. \"If we don't stabilize Liberia, we will never stabilize the region,\" Lui said. She was critical of the WHO for delaying its public health emergency warning until August 8. \"We need people with a hands-on operational mindset,\" to combat the outbreak, Liu told the Geneva news briefing. WHO - 'vastly underestimated' On Thursday, the World Health Organization (WHO) said the scale of the epidemic had been \"vastly underestimated\" and that \"extraordinary measures\" were needed to contain the contagious virus. The UN health agency said the death toll had climbed to 1,069 in four afflicted countries, spanning Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia and more recently Nigeria. Sierra Leone's chief medical officer Brima Kargbo disclosed on Thursday that at least 32 of the nation's nurses and doctors had died from the Ebola virus while performing their duties between May 24 and August 13. Local staff suffered stigma, despite saving lives, Kargbo said. \"We still have to break the chain of transmission to separate the infected from the uninfected.\" Youth Olympics also affected The mounting alarm coincided with an announcement Friday from the International Olympics Committee that three athletes from Ebola-hit countries had been barred from competing in pool events and combat sports at the Youth Olympics opening in China on Saturday. ipj/tj (AfP, Reuters)",

She added that there was a \"significant increase in the number of people suffering from the disease.\" \"We have a lot of work to do,\" she said, adding that she was \"very optimistic\" about the situation. However, she cautioned that \"it is still too early to tell whether this is the end of the epidemic or the beginning of a whole new era.\" She also pointed to the fact that Ebola is spreading rapidly across the globe and that it is becoming more and more likely to spread to other countries, including the United States, Canada, Mexico and the European Union (EU). \"It is not just the West that is going to be affected by this outbreak, but also the whole world,\" said Liu. In a statement released on Thursday, the WHO said it was working with the UN to find a way to tackle the crisis, which has already killed more than 1,000 people. It also said that more people were being infected by the virus, as well as the spread of disease in Africa and Latin America. According to a UN report published on Friday, a total of 2.5 million people have died from Ebola since the start of this year, up from 1.6 million in 2015. A WHO spokesman said there had been \"a significant increase\" in deaths due to Ebola, although the agency did not provide a specific figure for how many people had died. But it did say that most of these deaths were caused by people who didn't know what was going on, such as those who were infected with Ebola or who had not been vaccinated. This was the first time that a WHO report had found that an outbreak of Ebola had occurred in a country with a population of just over 1 million, according to WHO data. That figure is now expected to rise to 3.4 million by 2020, with an estimated 5.7 million deaths expected by 2030. UN spokesman Joanna Liu said in an interview with The Associated Press on Wednesday that this figure could rise as high as 4.2 million. He also called on the international community to step up its support for the fight against Ebola and other diseases, particularly in developing countries. Read more: Ebola: What is Ebola?

It sided with a German firm in its legal battle with US giant Oracle. The European Court of Justice on Tuesday ruled that used software licenses may generally be resold by individuals or companies. The Luxembourg-based court thus sided with the German firm UsedSoft in a protracted legal battle with US software giant Oracle. The ruling made it clear that trade in used software was permissible even if the software had not been shipped on a physical medium such as a CD or DVD, but had been digitally downloaded from the Internet. UsedSoft's business model hinges completely on reselling used packages or legally obtained license keys for them. By reselling the keys to clients, the latter are then able to download the latest version of a given program directly from a company's Internet site and obtain all new updates and patches in the process. Legal clarity Oracle had sued UsedSoft over its business model, trying to prevent buyers of used software licenses from downloading programs again. But the European court ruled that the so-called principle of exhaustion applied whenever software was originally sold to a customer for an unlimited time span, not giving the maker of the software the right to prevent the resale of that software. \"The door for the trade in used software has been pushed wide open throughout the European Union,\" UsedSoft said in a statement, welcoming \"perfect legal safety on the market.\" The court in Luxembourg emphasized, though, that whoever resold pieces of original software and their accompanying licenses must erase every copy on their own computers in advance and was not allowed to keep a copy after resale. hg/mz (AFP, dpa)",

In a ruling published on Thursday, the court said that the software should not be resequered or sold as part of an EU-wide agreement to sell software. \"This is a very important step in our efforts to reduce the number of people who have access to this software,\" the ruling said. Oracle, which is the world's largest reseller of software, said the decision was based on a \"technical assessment\" of the company's software and not on the legal basis of a technical assessment. It also said it was not possible to reseve software that had been sold to a third party, including resellers, for the purpose of selling it to third parties. According to the ECJ's ruling, Oracle had to pay a total of \u20ac1.6 billion (\u20ac2.4 billion) to buy the products, and that was before the end of 2012. This was the first time that a company had sold its software in a European market. That's when the Commission of European Courts (ECJ) ruled against the German government, saying it had \"no basis\" to do so. However, it did not rule out the possibility that Oracle software could be re-sold to other companies, as well as other third-party vendors, in order to make it more cost-effective for companies to purchase software from other countries.

Mission manager Jennifer Tropser told reporters in a conference call on Wednesday evening that the plan, once the final checks were completed, was to \"drive, drive, drive\" until Curiosity discovers a rock suitable for analysis. She added that the instrument checks have delivered positive results. \"Through every phase of the check-out, Curiosity has performed almost flawlessly,\" Tropser said. \"The success so far of these activities has been outstanding.\" Many of the tests have concerned Curiosity's robotic arm. The 2.1-meter (7-feet) appendage will be used to pick out and sample rocks and soil. NASA is investigating whether Mars can sustain life, or whether it could in the past. The tests were designed to identify any damage sustained during its interplanetary flight and also to ensure that the arm still functioned properly on Mars, with its different temperatures and gravity. The Mars rover landed in the giant Gale Crater, near the Martian equator, on August 5; it has so far moved about 109 meters within the crater. The rover is traveling east, heading first to an intersection called Glenelg, where three types of terrain meet. This is likely to be the location for the first rock and soil samples, though NASA said Curiosity was unlikely to arrive there for several weeks.

        "target": "Aging health: WHO call to action as world population over 60 set to double by 2050 In a new report on aging and health, the World Health Organization is calling for action on \"population aging,\" as figures suggest the number of people over 60 will reach two billion by 2050. People worldwide are living longer, says the World Health Organization in its World Report on Aging and Health. This is both good and bad. It gives us the chance to \"pursue new activities\" as we get older, such as in education and family life. But it all depends on our health. And for that the WHO says world governments need to act now to make sure our societies worldwide are ready. What are the take home facts from the World Health Organization's 2015 report on Aging and Health? The WHO says that in the next 35 years, the global number of people aged 60 years and over will almost double from 12 percent to 22 percent. By 2020, there will be more people over the age of 60 than 5 year olds. And a majority of older people (80 percent) will live in \"low and middle income\" countries. It's estimated that the world's population aged 60 years and older will total about 2 billion in 2050, which is more than twice as much as now. Furthermore, worldwide, about 125 million people are aged 80 years or older. But by 2050, it is expected that this number of people - aged 80 and over - will live in China alone. But I'm not old, so why should I care? Well, all this is happening at a faster rate than ever before. And the WHO says \"all countries face major challenges to ensure that their health and social systems are ready\" for this major demographic shift. It will cost a lot of money to improve health and social infrastructures, especially in more developed countries where traditional families structures have changed dramatically. Surely, there's \"no typical older person,\" though. How does the WHO define aging? We tend to think of older people as physically and mentally frail. But that's not necessarily the case, not everywhere in the world. Old is a relative concept - especially in middle income to rich countries. For instance, some 70 year olds are as fit as some 20 year olds. Just think how many older folk are at your gym, and ask yourself whether you can keep up with all of them. But that still doesn't explain aging. What is it exactly? The WHO says that at a biological level, \"aging results from the impact of the accumulation of a wide variety of molecular and cellular damage over time.\" Basically, this puts people at a higher risk of disease and, of course, death. But aging can also be associated with \"life transitions,\" such as retirement or witnessing other people, such as friends and family, die around you. This can affect you psychologically and sometimes, as a result, physically. What sort of diseases come with old age? Some of the most common non-fatal conditions include hearing loss, cataracts, back and neck pain and osteoarthritis. Other conditions include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - which affects the lungs - diabetes, depression, and dementia. What needs to be done? The WHO is proposing a five-step plan of action, which includes: Committing to healthy aging and \"evidence-based policies to strengthen the abilities of older persons.\" Aligning health systems with the needs of older populations Developing systems for providing long-term care Creating \"age-friendly cities and communities Improving measurement, monitoring and understanding of \"aging issues\" worldwide. But don't forget: \"a longer life brings with it opportunities, not only for older people and their families, but also for societies as a whole.\"",
        "generated_story": "WHO's Population Aging Plan: Actions Now Need to be Taken The World Health Organization (WHO) has announced that it will take action to reduce the number of people living in the developing world by 2050. The WHO said that action must now be taken in order to prevent the spread of disease. \"We need action now,\" said the WHO's chief executive officer, Dr. Margaret Chan, in a statement released on Thursday. Chan said he was \"very optimistic\" about the future of the world's population, adding that \"we have a lot of work ahead of us.\" \"I am very optimistic that we will be able to achieve this goal in 2050,\" he said, referring to the 2050s when the global population will reach 1.5 billion people, according to WHO data. He added that the goal was to reach 2.6 billion by 2030, which would be more than double the current level of population growth. But he cautioned that this could not be achieved with just a few years' work. In addition, he pointed out that there is still a long way to go before we can reach the target of 3.2 billion. That is, if we are to meet the targets for 2050, we need to make sure we have the tools to do this. We have to act now, because we don't have enough time to prepare for what is to come. This is not the way we want to live, but it is the right way. It is time for us to move on from the past and move forward with the next phase of our lives. There is an urgent need for action, and this is what we're going to take now.\" World health officials have said they are working on a plan to tackle the problem of rising global temperatures and rising sea levels. However, they have yet to announce a specific date for the implementation of this plan. They have not yet announced a date. According to a WHO report published on Wednesday, the plan is expected to have been completed by the end of 2015. A WHO spokesman said: \"The WHO is committed to meeting the needs of developing countries by 2020.\" The report also said it was looking into the impact of climate change on people's health, particularly in developing nations, such as China, India, Brazil, South Africa and the Middle East, where the average temperature has risen by 2 degrees Celsius (4 degrees Fahrenheit) since the 1970s. At the same time, it said there was a \"significant increase in mortality\" in people who were already living longer than they should have, due to high levels of greenhouse gas emissions. These people were also more likely to die of old age than those who didn't live long enough to see their children grow up, so it's not a surprise that they will have more children than older people. As a result, more people will die than younger people in their 20s and 30s, as well as the elderly, who are now at the peak of their lifespans. And that's a good thing because it means that people can live longer and healthier lives, even if their health is no longer as good as they used to. What's more, people are becoming more and more aware of what's happening with their bodies and their lifestyles. So, for example, are they becoming less and less aware that their body mass index is rising, rather than falling, or that you're getting older and older? That's good news for people with chronic health conditions like cancer and heart disease, especially if you've got a chronic disease like diabetes or high blood pressure, like Parkinson's, that can lead to anemia, stroke, cancer, dementia and other diseases. For those of you who do not have access to health care, there are many reasons why you should be concerned about your health. One of them is that your body is aging faster than you are. If you have an older body, you'll have fewer chances of becoming a healthy person. Another reason for that is because the body's ageing rate is increasing. You can see that by looking at your own body temperature, your metabolism is growing faster and your immune system is more sensitive to changes in your diet and therefore more susceptible to disease and cancer. With this in mind, this will make it more difficult for you to get older. I think the most important thing for me to think about is how you can be healthy and healthy. How can you be healthier? What do you do about that? I'm not sure I can answer that question. Do you think that will help you? Is it possible to become a healthier person? You know what I mean? Well, let's see what happens when you start to lose weight and you lose your sense of well-being? Let's talk about this for a minute. Is that something that has happened to you before? If so, what are you doing about it? We'll see how that affects you. Let me know in my next article.

        "target": "All Eyes on Kimi and Ferdy on Schumi's Turf All eyes will be on a Finn and a Spaniard at the German Grand Prix at Hockenheim on Sunday as the title battle between Kimi Raikkonen and Fernando Alonso looks to put local hero Michael Schumacher in the shade. It is a reflection of his current inauspicious Formula One campaign that World Champion Michael Schumacher is only featuring in reports on this weekend's German Grand Prix at Hockenheim dues to his nationality. The home grown champion equaled his own record of 11 wins in a season at last year's race but this year he will be hoping to just get on the podium at the end. Schumi lies in third place some 34 points off the top spot and has a lot to do if he is to record his 85th career win. Ferrari's poor season to date is unlikely to get better with hopes dwindling that the 36-year-old will add to his sole victory of the season although the seven-time world champion characteristically refuses to rule it out. Schumi and Ferrari still in the fight \"Contrary to many other people's opinions, we have in no means written ourselves off, even though we have to admit that the situation has worsened recently, rather than improved,\" said the German, referring to the problems with this season's car. \"But that doesn't mean that it can't be improved again, and that's exactly what we're working on.\" The limelight is falling on two young pretenders to Schumacher's throne as Sunday's race approaches. The battle between McLaren's flying Finn Kimi Raikkonen and championship leader Renault's speedy Spaniard Fernando Alonso is diverting eyes from the world record holding German on his own turf. Kimi aims to keep heat on leader Alonso Raikkonen must finish the German Grand Prix for the first time in five attempts to close the gap on Alonso if he is to keep his own championship hopes alive. The Finn retired from last year's race because of a rear wing failure and this season has been plagued by technical problems which most recently cost him 10 places on the starting grid in each of the last two rounds. Despite those penalties for engine failure, the 25-year-old managed to finish second and third but he will have to increase his total of three race wins if he is to make a significant impression on the 26-point chasm that separates him from Alonso. \"The battle for the championship is still on and I am determined to get a good result and work on closing the gap,\" said the Finn. \"The (car) has good speed and we need to make the most of it this weekend.\" Montoya doing McLaren team mate no favors Raikkonen's car is obviously a fast one this season but he's not the only driver in a McLaren hot seat. Colombia's Juan Pablo Montoya is not to going to make way for his team mate while his own hopes of the title, however small, remain alive. \"I am really looking forward to racing again this weekend in Germany,\" said Montoya, who won at Hockenheim for Williams two years ago and got his first victory for McLaren in Britain two weeks ago. \"I enjoy racing at Hockenheim, I have performed well here and won in the past and I am aiming for a strong result like at Silverstone.\" Consistent Ferdy the man to beat at Hockenheim Championship leader Alonso, meanwhile, has been impressively consistent for Renault so far this season, winning five times and failing to score points only at the Canadian Grand Prix, where he crashed, and in Indianapolis. The Spaniard is setting the pace and the standard this season so, problems aside, Alonso will again be the man to beat at Hockenheim.",
        "generated_story": "Fernando Alonso and Kimi Raikkonen in the title battle at Hockenheim Formula One driver Fernando Alonso is set to defend his title at the German Grand Prix on Sunday. The Spaniard and his team-mate, Ferrari's Juan Pablo Montoya, are expected to battle it out for the top spot in Sunday's championship race in Germany. Alonso, who has been in pole position since the end of last year's season, will be the first driver to win the Formula 1 title since Michael Schumacher in 2006. \"I'm very happy with the result,\" Alonso told reporters after the race, adding that he was \"very happy\" with Alonso's performance in qualifying. But he also pointed out that the two drivers have a lot in common: \"They are very close in terms of pace and speed, and I think they are going to be very good together.\" Alonso has won the last three races of his career, including the most recent one in 2014, when he finished second to McLaren's Sebastian Vettel by a wide margin of 0.6 seconds. He is also the fastest driver of all time, with a 1.8-second lead over the Ferrari driver. Ferrari, meanwhile, is the only team that has yet to claim the world title. That's because Ferrari and McLaren have not been able to do it in a long time. Both teams have struggled in recent years to keep pace with each other and have been unable to break into the championship conversation. Last year, McLaren and Ferrari were the frontrunners, but Ferrari had to settle for second place in their respective constructors' championship races. They are now in third place, just ahead of Williams and Williams, which are in fourth and fifth place respectively. In the final round of the F1 championship, Alonso will take on Williams' Williams driver, Carlos Sainz, in Saturday's final race of a four-round playoff series. It's the second time in three years that Ferrari has had a driver in front of them. And it's only the third time this year that they have had one of their best drivers in Alonso. On Sunday, the pair will meet again in Berlin, where they will try to secure a fourth title in four years. After qualifying on pole, Hamilton will have to wait until the weekend for a chance to take the lead in his home country of Bahrain before he can challenge for that crown. Hamilton, however, has said he will not wait for Alonso to step up to the plate and take his place on the podium, saying he is ready to fight for it. 'I don't know if I can do that,' Hamilton said, referring to Alonso as \"the only one who can compete with him.\" \"He's a great driver,\" Hamilton added, \"but he's also a good driver and he knows how to push the limits of what can be done.\" Hamilton and Alonso have already clinched their first world titles since 2007, although Hamilton has never held the crown since he took the silver in 2008. Fernando's title hopes have fallen away from him after a year in which he dominated the sport's most prestigious championships. However, he still has a way to go in 2017 and is only now beginning to make his mark in motorsport. His best season so far has come in 2009, finishing fourth in Formula Two in 2010 and ninth in 2011. This year he has already won four races in five seasons, most recently in 2012 and 2013. Despite his best efforts in 2013, his most successful season was a disappointing one for McLaren in 2015. Raikonen is now the team's world champion, having finished third in two of those races last season's five races, while Alonso was second in 2007 and 2012. McLaren is currently in sixth place with seven points, followed by Ferrari with five points and Toro Rosso with four. Williams has two points in its last two races and a further four points on Hamilton's record-holder Ferrari. Mercedes' Nico H\u00fclkenberg is third with one point, behind Hamilton at second. Lewis Hamilton is fourth with three points from Hamilton. A year ago, Williams was third, after Hamilton was fifth with two wins and two podiums in 2005, 2006 and 2007. Now Hamilton leads Ferrari by just one position in fifth position. Ferrari's Nico Rosberg has one more year left on his contract to stay in charge of Ferrari until 2021. If Hamilton wins in 2016, it will only be a matter of time before Hamilton takes over as the new Ferrari boss in 2018. Meanwhile, Mercedes is looking to add to its impressive record of four consecutive world championships, winning the pole in Monaco in May and qualifying for Bahrain in July and July."

        "target": "US duo shares Nobel Prize for Economics US researcher Elinor Ostrom is the first woman to win the Nobel prize for economics since it was created in 1968. She will share the prestigious award with US compatriot Oliver Williamson. The jury from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said the Americans' research had shown how \"economic analysis can shed light on most forms of social organization.\" Ostrom, a professor at Indiana University, was honored for her \"analysis of economic governance,\" especially in relation to the management of common property or property under common control. The political scientist's work challenges the widely accepted belief that common property is poorly managed and should be either regulated by central authorities or privatized, it added. She carried out numerous studies showing how self-organization and local-level management work to keep common resources viable. Her studies included both natural resources, such as forests, and artificial structures, for example police forces. Ostrom told Swedish television that she felt \"great surprise and appreciation\" and was \"in shock\" about being the first woman to win the prize. The pros and cons of big firms In his work, co-prizewinner Oliver Williamson, of University of California, Berkeley, examines why large corporations tend to arise - and why they do not - based on the cost and complexity of transactions, according to the Nobel committee. \"He has taught us to regard markets, firms, associations, agencies, and even households from the perspective of their contribution to the resolution of conflict,\" the jury said. Williamson authored 'The Economic Institutions of Capitalism' in 1975, a landmark text of the 'new institutional economics' movement that questioned the idea of firms as simple profit-making machines. Last but not least The Nobel prize for economics is the only Nobel award that was not created by the will of Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel in 1896. It was actually founded by the Swedish central bank, the Sverige Riksbank, to celebrate its tri-centenary a year earlier. It was awarded for the first time in 1969 under its official name: the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel. But although it was the last \"Nobel prize\" to be created and the last to be announced each year, the prize is not a poor relation in monetary terms. Winners of the awards for peace, literature, medicine, physiology, chemistry and physics all receive 10 million Swedish crowns (969,000 euros). A good year for women This year was a record year for women laureates. German-Romanian writer Herta Mueller won the Nobel Prize for Literature. Australian-American Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider of the United States were awarded the prize for medicine. And Ada Yonath of Israel was one of three scientists recognized for her work in chemistry. Americans more or less swept the board this year. Nine of the 11 laureates were US citizens. The most prominent of those was US President Barack Obama, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for his \"extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples.\" jg/AFP/dpa/Reuters Editor: Sam Edmonds",

        "target": "The Sun Sets Slowly Over Brandenburg's Tropical Dream Having suffered many disappointments concerning publically funded projects, the state of Brandenburg hoped a tropical leisure center would offer a ray of hope. Instead the ailing concern is just bringing more gloom. The economically depressed eastern German state of Brandenburg has seen its fair share of bitter experiences when it comes to huge public investment projects since German unification in 1990. Against this background, state authorities were pleased when Malaysian businessman Colin Au built a huge tropical-feeling leisure center in Brandenburg without any subsidies. The center, which opened about a year ago, was to become a symbol of economic success in a region where unemployment still hovers around the 20 percent mark. But the leisure time park, which has already swallowed a little under 100 million euros ($120 million) in private investment, is now going to have to depend on public funding to avoid another economic fiasco in Brandenburg. State authorities in Brandenburg haven't been too successful in their public investment policy in the past 10 years, to put it mildly. A grand plan to build one of the world's most modern chip-producing factories there burst like a bubble in 2003. The much-talked about Brandenburg-Berlin International airport still seems light years away from being built. Line of failures looked to be ended by Au's vision Another beacon of economic hope disappeared in 2002 when a company planning to build gas-filled transport airships went bust despite considerable subsidies. But Au's vision for the abandoned dome which the airship company needed as a hangar offered Brandenburg another chance. In the middle of nowhere, he created what he named his \"Tropical Islands\" wonderland, sporting everything from sandy beaches, lakes and a Laguna to a Caribbean-style village. The economics ministry in Brandenburg was over the moon to see Au originally agreeing to build the facility without any state subsidies. And Au himself had no doubt at the time that he could well do without them. Overestimated visitor numbers tell sorry story But the center's first year in operation tells a different story. Colin Au, who has meanwhile left Brandenburg and transferred matters to a German management company, had expected some 1.5 million visitors to come to Tropical Islands within the first year, but only some 950,000 will have turned up by the end of 2005. It seems highly unlikely that visitor numbers will increase considerably in future, placing a question mark on the viability of the whole centre. But Brandenburg's economics ministry is certain that the park will be in the black as of 2008. To make the place more attractive, it has agreed to shell out 15 million euros in subsidies for yet another reconstruction and marketing effort. After all, the leisure time center has a workforce of about 500 and is thus the biggest employer in an otherwise depressed region marked by a high jobless rate. Tropical center down but not out...not yet \"We hope the money will help make the Tropical Islands resort better known throughout Europe according to the new marketing concept hammered out the management,\" ministry spokesman Steffen Kammrath said. \"This leisure time center is unique and has to be marketed as such. What you have there is a tropical and water world 12 months a year with a lot of attractive offers to spend a whale of a time there.\" Some commentators believe that state subsidies may prolong the center's life span, but will not be able to avoid its demise in the long run. But the idea of also making it more attractive for tourists from all over Europe seems unrealistic to them if the resort's management can't even get enough visitors from home to ensure a profitable operation.",
        "generated_story": "The Sun Sets Slowly Over Brandenburg's Tropical Islands Resort The sun sets slowly over the tropical islands resort in the German resort of Tropical Island. It's the first time the sun has set in a German city, and it's a welcome sight. The tropical island resort is located on the eastern coast of the country, just a few kilometers (miles) from the city's main airport, where the temperature drops below zero degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit). The resort has been opened to the public since the beginning of this year, with plans to open the resort later this month. \"The sun is setting slowly,\" said Steffen Kammrath, director of marketing at the hotel, which opened its doors to visitors on Sunday. He added that he was \"very happy\" with the opening, adding that \"it's been a great success so far.\" \"I'm very happy that we've been able to get a lot of visitors here,\" he said, referring to a group of tourists who have been visiting the island for the past few weeks. They've come to enjoy the sights and sounds of a tropical resort, as well as the beach and the sea. But they're not the only ones who are looking forward to spending time with their families and friends. There are also a number of other guests who want to spend time together. One of them is Colin Au, who works in marketing for a company that specializes in developing new products and services. In addition, he's also working on a new product for his company, called \"Tropical Islands,\" which is aimed at attracting new visitors to Germany. A new concept is being developed in conjunction with a brand-new concept called the \"tropical islands\" concept, in which a theme park, a resort and a restaurant are to be built. This is a concept that has become a popular tourist attraction in Germany, especially in recent years. However, the concept has not yet been fully implemented. On Sunday, however, it was announced that it would be open to all visitors, regardless of whether they are German, Malaysian or Malaysian. That is, if they choose to stay in one of these resorts, they will have to wait until the end of next year to make sure they have everything they need. And that's not to say that they don't have something special planned for them, because they do have a special attraction for visitors. What is special about this concept? The idea is that people will come here and spend the night with you and you will see that you are there. You will also see people from all over Europe and other countries, including the United States and Canada, enjoying the company of your friends and family. I think it will be interesting to see what happens next. We'll see how it all plays out, but I'm not sure what the future holds for this resort. If you're looking for something new to do, you can't find it anywhere else. For example, there are a couple of hotels in Berlin that have opened up their doors for tourists. These are the ones that are open for business, such as a hotel or a cruise ship. So, let's see if there's anything that can be done about it. Do you have any ideas about what's going to happen next? If not, then let me know what you think about that? I'd like to know if you've got any tips on how to improve your hotel's facilities, or what kind of products you'll be using. Let's just say, I would love to hear from you. Is it a good idea for you to try something different? Is that something you would do in your own hotel? That's what we're talking about here? You know, maybe you could do something with your money? Maybe you'd be interested in doing something for yourself. Or maybe it could be something else entirely.

        "target": "Bayern's Klinsmann Praises, Hoeness Attacks Hoffenheim The Bundesliga's two top teams don't play until Friday, but the mind games are already underway. Bayern's coach Juergen Klinsmann says Hoffenheim are legitimate contenders, but commercial manager Uli Hoeness disagrees. When the Bundesliga scheduled Bayern's home match against Hoffenheim in the league's unloved Friday night slot, they probably didn't imagine that it would turn out to be the match of the first half of the season. Indeed, few experts or fans thought that Hoffenheim, a first-division debutante located in a southern German village with 3,000 inhabitants, would give mighty Munich a run for its money. But it's the first week of December, and Hoffenheim top the table by three points. They also have a much better goal difference than their second-placed rivals -- and that has drawn praise from Bayern's coach, Juergen Klinsmann. \"I have the highest estimation of Hoffenheim because they've built the squad very ambitiously, rationally and with very good players,\" Klinsmann told DPA news agency. \"They can be proud of that.\" Klinsmann said he thought that the club could establish itself among the top three or four sides in Germany in the years to come and qualify for international competition next season. He also had words of praise for Hoffenheim's software billionaire patron, Dietmar Hopp, whose money has funded the club's ascent. \"There's nothing negative about it,\" Klinsmann said. \"He used to play for the club, is a soccer man through and through and helped the team get on its feet.\" Some fans have criticized Hopp and Hoffenheim for paying inflating salaries and luring talent away from other clubs instead of developing homegrown players. In fact, Hoffenheim's official salary budget is about average for the Bundesliga. Hoeness sounds his horn But while Bayern's coach was praising his opponents to the skies, Munich's commercial manager Uli Hoeness has been trying to play with their heads. On the heels of Bayern's convincing win over Leverkusen last weekend, Hoeness is back to taunting rivals. \"The performance we showed in the second half against Leverkusen will be enough against Hoffenheim,\" Hoeness told the German soccer magazine kicker. Hoeness also dropped a none-too-thinly-veiled hint that Hoffenheim's personnel expenditures were far higher than the officially released figures and scoffed at the idea that strategy would determine the outcome of Friday's match. \"Games are decided by the better players, not by tactics,\" Hoeness said. \"And of course, we've got better players than Hoffenheim.\" But that particular verbal attack may represent some wishful thinking of the manager's part. Hoffenheim coach Ralf Rangnick is one of only two current Bundesliga skippers with a winning record against Munich. Rangnick, whose team cruised past Bielefeld last weekend to keep Bayern three points back, reacted to Hoeness' remarks with a shrug. \"We're preparing for Munich exactly the same way we did against Bielefeld,\" Rangnick said. In any case, soccer fans in Germany know what they'll be doing Friday evening -- finding a bar with cable sports television to watch a top match that no one, before the start of the season, would have considered possible.",
        "generated_story": "Hoffenheim's Commercial Manager Reacts to the First Half of the Bundesliga Season The club's commercial manager has spoken out about the first half of this season's Bundesliga season. Uli Hoeness said he was \"very happy\" with the way the club has been playing. \"I'm very happy that we've been able to move on from the disappointment of last season,\" he said in an interview with German newspaper Der Spiegel. He added: \"We've had a lot of good things happen in the last few weeks, and we're happy to be moving on.\" He also said that he would like to see the team's financial situation improve, which he sees as a positive sign for the long-term future of his club. The Bundesliga's top-flight club is now in a position where it can compete with other top clubs in Europe, such as Bayern Munich, Leverkusen and Bayern M\u00fcnchen, who are also in contention for a spot in next year's Champions League. In the second half, the German side will have to deal with a number of financial issues, including the loss of key players and the transfer of a key player to a new club, Ralf Rangnick, a former coach of Bayern's youth team. Ranging from vice president of football operations to sporting director, he also spoke about how he wants to improve the squad's finances and improve its ability to compete on the pitch. His comments come after a week of speculation about a possible move to Bayern, where he is expected to take over as head coach next season, following the departure of coach Juergen Klinsmann. Losing a player is not an easy task, but it's not impossible to make the most of an opportunity. It's also not easy to get the job done when you've got so much to do and so little time to think about it. That's why I'm so happy with what I've seen so far. I think I'll be happy if I can get my act together and get on with my job. We're going to have a very good season and I want to work hard at it, so that's what we can do.\" The new coach will also be tasked with making sure that his team has the right personnel in place and that the players are on top of their game. On the other hand, it will be up to him to decide whether or not to bring in new players or to give them a chance to prove themselves. Last season was a difficult one for him. After all, his first season in charge was the best he could do. But last year he had to step down after just two games. Now he's back on his feet and ready to lead his side into the top flight again. This time, though, that means he'll have more responsibility to his players, rather than trying to convince them that they're better than they were last time out. At the same time he has to focus on improving his squad and getting better at his job, as well as getting them into better positions in his new role as coach. A new manager is also needed in order to ensure that Hoffenheimer's squad has a good foundation in which to build upon the success it has had in recent years. With the addition of new signings and new faces, Hoffenerheim will need to find a way to win more games and be more consistent in terms of attacking and scoring goals. As a result, they'll need more players with more experience and a better understanding of how to play in front of goal. They'll also need someone who knows the game and knows what to expect when it comes to scoring. If they don't, then they won't have much choice but to try and win the ball back in their own hands. And if they can't do that, there's no reason why they shouldn't be doing that. There's a reason for this, after all. You can only do so many things at the moment, right? And then there are the things that are important. For example, if you're a coach, you can be the manager of your own team, or you have an assistant coach or a manager who can help you out in your first year of coaching. What do you think? Do you like the idea of bringing in young players? What are your thoughts on this? Are you happy about that? Did you enjoy reading about this interview? Is it something that you'd be interested in doing? Does it make you feel better about your team? You know, maybe you'll like it a little bit more? Well, I like that idea, because it makes me feel more confident about my team-mates, especially the young ones. So, let's see what the future holds for us. How do we make sure we stay in good shape? We'll see how well we do this year. Right now, we have some good players in our squad. Let's talk about what's going on right now. Who knows? Maybe we'll find out if we get a bit of course"

        "target": "Automation in the dairy cow industry A small but nevertheless important sector of the German economy today is agriculture. Although the number of farms has declined over the decades, production has actually increased -- especially at dairy farms. Modern automation technology and robotics are helping to keep both cows and farmers happy, but at the cost of jobs.",
        "generated_story": "Automation in the Dairy Cow Industry In Germany, the dairy cow industry is booming. Automation is one of the main reasons why the country's dairy industry has grown so fast in recent years. Dairy cow production is growing at a rapid pace, with the number of cows growing by leaps and bounds year-on-year, according to the latest figures from the International Dairy Industry Association (IDI) in Germany. In the first half of this year alone, there have been more than 1.5 million cows slaughtered. This is a record for the world's largest dairy market. The number is expected to rise to 2.6 million by the end of next year, up from just under 2 million in 2015. However, this is only the second year in a row that dairy cows have become a major part of Germany's food supply chain. There is also a growing demand for dairy products in other European countries, such as France, Italy, Spain, Germany and the United Kingdom, where dairy production has risen by over 40 percent since the beginning of last year. That is, despite the fact that there are currently only a few cows that are still producing milk at the moment, and that is not the case for all of them. What is important is that these cows are not just milk cows, they are also dairy goats. They are milk goats, which means that they have to be fed milk from cows to cows. These cows also need to have a good diet, so that their milk production can be kept fresh and healthy. And they need a lot of fresh milk to keep the milk fresh. So, it's not only milk that's being produced, but also eggs, eggs and dairy butter, as well. It's also the eggs that make up the majority of milk products. But it also has to do with dairy milk, because milk is the most important ingredient in milk and eggs are made from milk. As a result, dairy farmers are increasingly turning to artificial eggs to make milk for their animals. With this in mind, a new breed of cow is being developed to replace the old milk cow that has been dying for a long time. \"We are going to introduce artificial milk as soon as possible,\" said one dairy farmer, adding that he would like to see the new technology introduced in his dairy farm. He said that it would be a \"huge step forward\" in this area, saying that the future of dairy farming is \"very bright.\" \"It's a very big step,\" he added, pointing out that, in addition to being able to produce milk more efficiently, he said, \"it will also help to reduce the cost of production and increase the proportion of animals that need milk.\" He also pointed out the need for more efficient and environmentally friendly methods of growing milk in order to meet the growing needs of farmers. According to a report in The DPA, that could lead to an increase in production, especially in rural areas, particularly in areas with high unemployment and high dairy prices. Dairy farmers, for example, are particularly concerned about the impact of automation on their livelihoods. Many of their products are manufactured in China and India, while others are exported to other parts of Asia, Africa and Latin America. At the same time, farmers in India and South Africa are looking for new ways to grow their own milk without having to rely on artificial fertilizers and pesticides. A new type of cheese, called \"dairy milk,\" is available in many countries around the globe, including the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Food production in these countries has also been growing rapidly, although it is still relatively slow in developing countries like China, South Korea and Taiwan.

        "target": "Inching towards direct talks on Syria They came to hold talks, but started negotiations with mutual affronts. But if there is one person who might be able to mediate between the intransigent Syrian conflict parties, it's Lakhdar Brahimi. Lakhdar Brahimi, the United Nations special envoy for Syria, seemed very tired on Friday (24.01.2014). He had had a long day, which was actually supposed to be the first real day of negotiations at the Syria Conference in Geneva. \"Good afternoon,\" Brahimi told the assembled international press, before adding, \"or good evening, I don't know.\" At the Palais des Nations in Geneva, he presented the most important result of his attempts to mediate between the Syrian government and the opposition to the more than 250 journalists who had managed to get a coveted place at the press conference: \"Tomorrow we expect and we have agreed that we will meet in the same room.\" What Brahimi is declaring an achievement doesn't sound like much, but considering how irreconcilable the conflict parties have been, even that can be seen as a small success. Separate talks with Brahimi The two delegations were actually due to meet on the first day of negotiations in Geneva in order to agree on a timetable and on the subject and agenda of the talks. But emotions are running too high on both sides. Instead both delegations held separate talks with Lahkkdar Brahimi, both lasting just about an hour each In the morning. The Syrian government delegation had apparently been threatening to leave the conference. At least that is what the deputy foreign minister Faisal Mekdad had implied. \"We are here to start the negotiations,\" he told waiting journalists, \"but we found that the other party did not want to come.\" Before the conference, the opposition had explained that for its delegation, the formation of a transition government would be a central tenet of the negotiations. They emphasized that this topic should be discussed right at the beginning of talks and that the establishment of such a body should be initiated without delay. Social media and good old propaganda The representatives of the Syrian National Coalition that were present in Geneva neatly used all imaginable channels to make their views public. At #Geneva2, they tweeted: \"Forming a transitional body is our major priority,\" leaving people in no doubt that the Syrian National Council would not want to include Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Assad's government, on the other hand, is relying on classic propaganda and loyal state media representatives in Geneva. An impressive entourage of dominant journalists from state-run media outlets is constantly at hand, accompanying the government delegation and making sure they get their point across at press conferences. Lakhdar Brahimi even had a small altercation with a journalist from a Syrian state news agency, who made a political statement under the pretense of asking the UN mediator a question. \"Are there any signs that Saudi Arabia, Turkey and other countries would stop the support of terrorism in Syria?,\" she asked in somewhat shaky English, before Brahimi interrupted her. \"Please, please, there is no point in asking such questions!\" Such exchanges hint at the type of negotiating style the experienced diplomat and mediator Brahimi must have behind the scenes. 'Wish us luck' Lakhdar Brahimi described the preliminary talks that took place in Geneva as encouraging and asked for patience. He said that because the peace conference had come about at the last minute and the delegations had therefore only been appointed very recently, there hadn't been enough time to hold preliminary discussions - a task that the delegations were now catching up on. \"We never expected it to be easy and I'm sure it's not going to be,\" he said. \"But I think the two parties understand what is at stake. Their country is in very, very bad shape.\" He added: \"The huge ambition of this process is to save Syria. Nothing less than that.\" After appealing to the willingness of both parties to negotiate, he simply added: \"So wish us luck!\" Fight for freedom As the official delegations held talks with UN mediator Brahimi in the Palais des Nations, the European headquarters of the United Nations, hundreds of Syrian expatriates who had come from all over Europe protested outside, forming a sea of red, white and black Syrian flags on the Place des Nations. With their presence outside the UN gates they wanted to show that despite all the government propaganda, the Syrian National coalition has a lot of support from the Syrian people. Thirty-two-year-old Ziad Malki came to Geneva from Zurich to show his solidarity. Ziad knows how it feels to be deprived of his freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. In 2005, he was arrested at a demonstration in Damascus and says he was tortured during his time in prison. Now he is fighting for a new Syria from outside the country's borders. Ziad is sure that with Bashar al-Assad and his family, there will be nothing new. \"We don't want this man to be in",
        "generated_story": "Mediating with the Syrian National Coalition in Geneva UN mediator Faisal Mekdad has met with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to discuss the situation in Syria. The Syrian opposition leader has refused to meet with UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in Switzerland. \"The Syrian regime is not going to allow us to have a dialogue with you,\" he told reporters in Zurich, Switzerland on Tuesday, according to a statement released by the Palais des Nations, the Geneva-based organization that coordinates the UN's efforts to mediate between the regime and the opposition. Mekad, who is also a member of the Arab League, said he was \"very happy\" to be meeting with Assad, but that he would not be able to attend the meeting because of his lack of commitment to the peace process. He also said that Assad was not willing to give up the fight against terrorism, which he said was the main reason for the war in the first place. \u201cHe has not given up fighting,\u201d he added, referring to Assad\u2019s ability to wage a war against his own people, despite the fact that his regime has been in power for more than a decade. In the past few months, Assad has used his power as a weapon of mass destruction. But he has also used it as an instrument of political and economic power.\u201cI have to say that I am very happy that we are in a position where we have the opportunity to talk to you. We are very pleased that you have agreed with me. I think it is very important for you to understand that this is a very difficult situation to deal with, and that is why I want to continue to work on this issue. It is important to me to know that there is an end in sight to this conflict. That is, if you are not ready to accept the terms of this deal, then you will not accept this agreement. There is no other way to do it. This is the only way we can move on from this situation. You can't do this without the support of your friends and family. And you cannot do that with your own family.\" \"I am happy to see that the people of Syria are coming together to help us in this difficult time. They are fighting for their lives and they are doing it with their own hands. These people are the ones who are suffering the most, they have been suffering for so long, that they can no longer stand up for what they believe is their country's interests and their interests. So we will continue working with them,\" Mekd told the AP news agency, adding that \"we are working very hard to make sure that these people who have suffered so much are supported and supported by their government are also supported.\" The AP also reported that a delegation from the United Nations had been sent to Geneva to try to reach out to representatives from around the world, including the US, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Russia, Turkey, China and even the UK, to express their support for Assad's government. However, it has yet to receive a response from any of these representatives. On Monday, UN special envoy for Syria, Lahkkdar Brahimi, visited Geneva for talks on the Syria conflict, saying that it was a \"difficult situation\" in which the government was unable to achieve its goal of defeating the rebels. Speaking to AP, he stressed the importance of dialogue between Assad and his opponents."

        "target": "Italy's navy to patrol with Libyan ships to curb human trafficking Italy wants to work more closely with Libya to limit the number of sea crossings by migrants and potential asylum seekers. But what are the consequences? Italy's prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni, does not want to wait any longer for EU countries to show solidarity in distributing asylum seekers throughout the bloc. On Thursday he announced in Rome that the Italian navy would be patrolling with Libyan ships just off the Libyan coastline. The aim, Gentiloni says, is to curb human trafficking and bring migrants back from the smugglers' boats to Libya. According to the Italian government's figures, 93,000 migrants have arrived in Italy so far this year. At least 2,000 have drowned in the attempt to cross the Mediterranean - the true figure is unknown. Italy has already threatened to stop allowing boats carrying rescued migrants to dock in Italian ports, or that it may issue migrants with documents that would allow them to travel on to other European countries. Rome has not yet implemented either policy, but the government has made clear that Italy will soon run out of options. The EU Commissioner for Migration Dimitris Avramopoulos acknowledged, again, in Brussels on Thursday that \"Europe continues to face high migratory pressures. And Italy more than (almost) any others.\" The European Commission issued a letter offering more aid and personnel to help manage migration better. Accommodation will soon be full The office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, wrote at the beginning of July that \"Close to 200,000 accommodation places are available for refugees and migrants across [Italy], but are nearly all full.\" The High Commissioner referred particularly to the numbers of people dying when he warned, \"What is happening in front of our eyes in Italy is an unfolding tragedy.\" The United Nations anticipates that another 100,000 migrants will come to Italy via Libya before the end of this year. The number of arrivals is already 20 percent higher than last year; and the number of dead, those who could not be saved, would rise accordingly. According to UN estimates, the Mediterranean remains the \"deadliest\" refugee route in the world. Italian government statistics say that around 600,000 people have arrived in Italian ports since the start of the crisis in 2014. It is unclear how many have since traveled on to Austria, France or Switzerland. Once migrants are registered in Italy and accommodated in camps, they are not held there. If, however, they leave the accommodation without giving notice, they forfeit their claim to subsistence and social services. Most of the migrants are from African countries, and many try to travel on to France, for example. 300 people are currently sleeping on the beach in Ventimiglia, on the French border, hoping to take a bus or train to France. However, the border is being policed by French officials. Migrants who are caught are sent back to Italy. Austria has announced that it too will close its border with Italy if the number of migrants starts to rise. Repatriation and distribution are difficult Last year 120,000 new asylum applications were made in Italy. Around 50 percent of these are rejected. The asylum seekers are then supposed to leave the country. However, the process of people either returning voluntarily or being deported is very slow. The interior ministry has therefore announced that it will reinforce repatriation programs. The redistribution of asylum seekers from Italy, as agreed by the European Union, is well behind target. Two years ago the aim was to resettle 120,000 people. So far, only 24,676 people have been redistributed, the EU Commission said on Thursday: 7,873 from Italy, and 16,803 from Greece. The numbers are low not just because of the reluctance of other EU countries to take the refugees in, but also because of Italian delays in the registration of possible candidates. Asylum seekers from Eritrea are the most likely to fulfill the criteria for redistribution. Around 25,000 are currently living in Italy, but only 10,000 have been registered with the EU Commission and the European Asylum Support Office as possible candidates. Migration Commissioner Avramopoulos has announced that Italy will be given more help and logistical support in this area.",

The EU's migration commissioner said Italy was facing an \"emerging tragedy.\" \"We are faced with an unfolding catastrophe,\" he told a news conference in Rome, adding that \"it is very difficult\" for the EU to cope with the influx of migrants from Libya. \"It is extremely difficult for us as a member state to deal with such a large influx, especially in this time of the year when the migrant crisis is so severe that we have to act quickly and decisively to prevent it from happening again.\" Italy's interior minister, Paolo Gentiloni, said on Thursday that he was \"very concerned\" about the situation in Libya, where migrants are fleeing persecution and violence. He also said that the country's borders with Libya were \"increasingly porous\" and that there was a \"serious lack of coordination\" between the European Union and the International Organization for Migration (IOM). \"I am very concerned about this situation because we are dealing with a very serious humanitarian crisis in Italy, which has been going on for over a year now,\" the minister said in a statement released by the Italian interior ministry. Italian Foreign Minister Filippo Grandi, who heads the IOM's migrant agency Ventimiglia, told the press conference that Italy \"is facing a situation where it is becoming increasingly difficult and more difficult to meet the needs of asylum seekers.\" The Italian government has said it will continue to cooperate with Italy in its efforts to tackle the migration crisis, but it has yet to make a decision on whether to allow migrants to return to their home countries. According to the ministry, the move is part of an EU-wide effort to reduce the number of people who come to Italy each year. It is also aimed at reducing the burden on migrants who arrive in Europe from the Middle East and North Africa. Author: Andreas K\u00fcbler (AFP, dpa, Reuters)"

The country is set to host the 2011 edition of the tournament, which is scheduled to take place in Berlin, Germany's capital city, from July 1 to July 3. \"We are looking forward to this year's tournament,\" German media reported on Monday. Berlin is one of only a handful of countries in Europe to hold an international competition, with the rest of Europe and the United States also vying for the top spot, according to a report by Deutsche Welle, the German news agency, citing unnamed sources close to the organizing committee, as well as the organizers. In addition, there will also be a chance for women to showcase their talents in front of a live audience at the opening ceremony in Cologne on Sunday, July 2. There are also chances for Germany to win the title of host nation in 2010, when it will host its first ever women\u2019s soccer competition. That would be just the second time in history that a German team has been invited to play in a major international sporting event, following the success of France and Spain in 2006. This time, however, it is Germany, not France, who are the main contenders. Last year, France was chosen as host, followed by Spain, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Russia. Both countries are vying to become the next world champions in soccer, but Germany will have to wait until the end of next year to be able to claim a place on the list of world's most prestigious sporting events. For the past two years, German women have been competing in international competitions, including soccer's best-known and most successful. But this time around, they are hoping to make the most of their chances. They have a lot of work to do in order to get the best out of them, and that's why they have chosen Germany as their host country. So far, so good. We are very excited about the prospect of Germany hosting a world-class event and we are hopeful that we can get a good result. And we hope that the fans will come out in droves to see what we have in store for them. After all, this is a very different country from the last time we had an event like this. What do you think? Do you have any predictions for what the future will bring? What will happen in 2012? We don't know for sure. Maybe we'll find out. I think we're going to try and see how it all plays out, maybe we won't be as good as we were last year. Who knows? Maybe it's just a matter of time before we get to know each other better. If we do, we will see if we've got a better idea of what's going on in terms of how we want to go about our business, or whether we just want a little bit more time to work on our own business.

Many others were wounded when the float they were traveling on made contact with a power line. Officials in Port-au-Prince said the accident occurred as thousands of revelers filled the streets of the city center of the Haitian capital in the early hours of Tuesday. The Associated Press quoted witnesses at the scene who reported seeing somebody on one of the floats used a stick or pole to move a power line so that the vehicle could pass under it. Reuters cited a witness who reported seeing the head of a singer from the hip-hop band Barikad Crew make contact with the power line. Some of the victims were electrocuted instantly, while others jumped off the float, causing panic among the revelers who lined the street. Many of the at least 18 deaths came as a result of the ensuing panic, while at more than 40 others were injured, according to local authorities. There was some confusion about the number of fatalities, with the Associated Press putting it at 20, and AFP later reported that only around 10 had died. Haitian President Michel Martelly used his Twitter account to express his condolences to the injured and bereaved. \"My sincere sympathies to the victims of the serious incident that occurred this morning at the Champ de Mars (area in downtown Port-au-Prince),\" the president said. pfd/rc (AP, Reuters, AFP)",

The death toll rose to 18 in the latest incident, which took place on the Carnival grounds in Port-au-Prince on Sunday. Haiti's president Michel Martelly said at a press conference that the deaths were the result of a \"tragic accident\" in which a Carnival ship collided with another ship. He said the ship, Champ de Mars, was damaged and that it was unclear how many people were killed or injured. \"It was a very tragic accident,\" he said, adding that he was \"very sorry\" for the loss of life and for those who lost their lives. His comments came as the president of the country's Carnival Association, the Barikad Crew, met with a group of Haitian officials to discuss the incident. A statement from the association's executive director, Jean-Claude Bouchard, said: \"We are deeply saddened by this tragedy. We are very sorry that we have to deal with such a tragedy, and we will continue to work with the Haitian government and the international community to ensure the safety of our people.\" The statement came after a day of mourning for victims and relatives of those killed and injured during the accident. It was the first time in a year that Haiti has experienced a major tragedy involving Carnival ships. More than a dozen ships have been damaged or destroyed, according to a report by the International Maritime Organization (IMO). The ship's captain, who was on board a cruise ship at the time, died on Saturday after suffering a heart attack and was rushed to the hospital in critical condition. Several other ships were also damaged, including a cargo ship that crashed into a reef off the coast of Haiti. One crew member died of his injuries, while another suffered from a head injury. Two other crew members suffered minor injuries. Another was seriously injured when a ship hit a coral reef near the port city of Charlevoix, killing two people and injuring several others. Police are still searching for survivors, but it is not clear whether they will be able to return to their homes in time for Carnival. There is no word yet on how long the cruise ships will stay in port, where they are expected to stay until the end of this month. In the aftermath of Sunday's accident, officials said they were still working on a plan to restore power and restore normalcy. They also said that they expect to resume normal operations within the next few days."

        "target": "Is China seeking regime-change in North Korea? The sudden reduction in aggressive rhetoric and actions by North Korea has led to suggestions that Pyongyang has realized it has pushed its only ally in the region to the brink of severing its friendship. The announcement in Pyongyang on May 13 of the promotion of Jang Jong-nam to \"minister of the People's Armed Forces\" came out of the blue. Until recently, the little-known commander of an army corps in coastal Kangwon Province, Jang has replaced Kim Kyok-sik, a four-star general with a long track record of loyal service to the regime. The reasons for 70-year-old Kim's replacement are not clear - as with most of the political maneuvers in North Korea - but it may have been his loyalty that cost him his position in the politburo. Kim was widely seen as a hawk in the regime and is believed to have been in command of the operation to shell the South Korean island of Yeonpyeongdo in November 2010, an incident that killed four people, destroyed civilians' homes and infrastructure and dramatically worsened the already strained relationship between Pyongyang and Seoul. By sacrificing Kim, analysts believe, North Korea is signaling that it is backing away from the confrontational stance it adopted after the United Nations imposed new sanctions in the wake of the nation's third underground nuclear test in February. And there are other indicators that Pyongyang is seeking to return to the status quo. The North's troops have been permitted to step down from the highest state of preparedness for war that was initially ordered when South Korea and the US began a series of annual military exercises. Missiles withdrawn Similarly, two Musudan intermediate-range missiles that were identified as being on mobile launchers being operated in eastern areas of the country have apparently been ordered to return to base. In late April, there was concern that test-launches of the missiles would be a further escalation by Kim Jong-un's government and a message that it would not bow to international pressure to halt its nuclear and missile development programs. But the analysts believe the tokens of Pyongyang's goodwill have come too late. \"For the North Korean leader, this is a very difficult time,\" Toshimitsu Shigemura, a professor at Tokyo's Waseda University and an authority on North Korean affairs, told DW. \"Timing is very important here and it is possible that China is moving to abandon Kim Jong-un. The atmosphere between the two nations is changing. China may have decided that it is time for a regime-change in the North, they will not permit the collapse of the country because they do not want chaos on their own borders.\" Further evidence that Beijing is slowly tightening the screw on its erstwhile ally comes as more state-run financial institutions sever their links with banks in North Korea. The latest institution to adhere to the government's orders to halt transactions across the border is the Bank of China, one of the four major banks in the country, which announced on May 7 that it would cease dealings with the Foreign Trade Bank of North Korea, which has been identified as being involved in Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs. Contingency plan in place Intelligence sources have passed on to DW information that Beijing has a contingency plan in place for when Kim Jong-un's control over the country crumbles. The reports confirm that China is indeed quietly encouraging regime change and is grooming Kim's brother, Kim Jong-nam to take over his role. At 42, Kim Jong-nam is the oldest son of Kim Jong-il, the dictator who ruled North Korea with an iron fist for 17 years until his sudden death in December 2011. Kim Jong-nam had been expected to assume the leadership after his father's death, but fell from favor spectacularly in 2001 when he was detained with two women and a boy aged 4 at Tokyo's Narita International Airport travelling on a forged Dominican Republic passport. He later admitted that he had wanted to visit Disneyland. He subsequently lived in Macau and Beijing, under the close watch of the Chinese authorities. The reports suggest that after Kim Jong-nam is installed in Pyongyang, his brother will be permitted to go into exile, probably in China. The tactic is not without its pitfalls, however, in part due to the efficiency of the campaign to deify their young leader as the future of the nation. Kim Jong-nam as 'new king' \"China may be dreaming of appointing Kim Jong-nam as the new king - and he is more preferable to the West than Kim Jong Un - but the problem is that he is not known in North Korea,\" said Ken Kato, director of Tokyo-based Human Rights in Asia. \"Many people in Japan know much about the North Korean 'Royal Family,' but this information is hidden in North Korea,\" he said. \"Even residents of Pyongyang know very little about Kim Jong-nam.\" Yet the reports are gaining credence among North Korea-watchers. Jun Okumura, a political analyst with the Eurasia Group, told DW that North Korea withdrawing",
        "generated_story": "North Korea's 'new king' Kim Jong-un has become the world's most powerful man, according to a new report from the Eurasia Group. The report said that the North Korean leader, Kim Kyok-sik, had become \"the new king\" of North Korea. According to the report, the leader of the country's ruling Workers' Party (PP) was born in a rural village in the central province of Yeonpyeongdo, near the border with South Korea, and that he was raised by his father's family. \"He is a very strong leader,\" said Toshimitsu Shigemura, a professor at Waseda University in Tokyo, referring to Kim's father as \"Kim.\" He added that Kim was \"a great leader and a great person.\" \"I think he has a lot to learn from Kim,\" he said, adding that \"he is very intelligent and he knows how to be a leader.\" The new leader is also known as the \"king of China,\" which means he can be called upon to take over the leadership of a country that has been ruled by the PPP since the end of World War II. He also has the ability to call on the United Nations and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to act as a mediator between Pyongyang and Beijing. In addition, he is known to have a strong sense of self-confidence and is well-versed in international law and international relations. On the other hand, it is not clear whether he will be able to use his influence to influence the international community, which has long been skeptical of his leadership. It is unclear how much influence he might have in China, but it seems he may have over Beijing and Washington, as well as in Japan, where he once served as head of state. His father was also a prominent figure in South Korean politics and was a close confidante of President Moon Jae-in. During his time in office, Moon said he would be \"very, very careful\" in his dealings with Pyongyang. But he did not rule out the possibility of changing his mind about the regime's nuclear weapons program, or how long it would take for Pyongyang to develop a nuclear weapon capable of reaching the U.N. peacekeeping mission in East Asia. That is, if he does not change his views on nuclear and missile technology, there is no way to know for sure. And that is something that I don't want to do. I'm not sure I can say for certain, because I have no idea what I would do if I were to change my mind. What I do know, however, is that there are a number of factors that could lead to this change. One of them is the fact that it's not possible for Kim to make a decision on whether or not he wants to stay in power long enough. Another factor could be that his regime is going to try to get rid of him. If he doesn't, then it will have to come up with a plan. This is one of those things that can only be done through diplomacy and negotiation. For now, I think we'll just wait and see what happens. We'll see how it all plays out. You know what's going on in Pyongyang, right? It's a big question mark. How long will it be before we see a change in leadership? That's the question that will come into play when the new regime takes power? The question is whether Kim will stick around for a long time. Do you think it'll be long before he decides to step down? If so, what will he do next? I'd like to think that's what he'll do? You can't just say he won't be the next Kim. There's no doubt about that. So, let's see if we can get to that point. Is he still a dictator? Do we really want him to become a king? Does he have the power to rule the entire country? Is that a good thing? What do we need to see? How will we make sure he stays on top of things? And what does that mean for the long-term stability of our country and its economy? There are so many factors to consider. First of all, we know he's still very much in control of Pyongyang's economy. Second, his country is in great shape. As long as Kim is alive and well, that means that we will see more and more people who are willing to work with him in order to achieve his goals. Then there's that question of who will become his successor. Why would he be in charge? Why is he so important to us? He's got so much power in this country right now? In the past few years, North Koreans have become more powerful than they are today. They've become so powerful that they can do anything with it. Now, they're becoming even stronger in terms of power and influence. These are the two most important things to watch out for? They're both very different things. After all the"

Smuggling has prompted a visit to Mexico City by US Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly. Prosecutors said the remote town of Las Varas in Chihuahua state was the scene of Wednesday's battle between affiliates of the Ciudad Juarez cartel and a gang from the state of Sinaloa. Police said fighting escalated when patrols arrived. Fourteen people were found dead; 12 others were hospitalized. Grenades, launchers and rifles were found. The mountainous region is used as a corridor for smuggling into the US. El Chapo effect Chihuahua security commissioner Oscar Alberto Aparicio said a Black Hawk helicopter was called in as police chased surviving gang members through the area known for marijuana and opium poppy production. Two police officers had been killed in a \"cowardly\" way in the area a week ago, he said. In a similar incident last Friday, 17 gunmen were killed during a shootout with police on a highway in Sinaloa, Mexico's northwestern state. Sinaloa was the home base of Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, whose extradition to the US in January apparently left gangsters in a struggle for control of criminal syndicates. Homicides have surged in recent months, with the number of persons killed in May put at 2,186, the highest since the collection of such statistics began 20 years ago. Nieto and Kelly to talk In Mexico City Wednesday, President Enrique Pena Nieto's office said he and visiting US Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly had discussed how to rein in organized crime groups. \"Shared responsibility\" must become the focus of transnational efforts, Kelly said. Narcotics smuggling into the US has become a multibillion-dollar (multibillion-euro) business for Mexican drug cartels. Mexico in turn wants the US to throttle demand for narcotics and the supply of illegal weapons to Mexico cartels. Pena Nieto and US President Donald Trump, who wants a border wall, are schedule to meet Friday on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany. ipj/ng (AP, AFP, dpa)",

The two men are believed to have been involved in a shootout that left one dead and the other wounded. Mexico's interior minister, Oscar Alberto Aparicio, told reporters that the suspected drug trafficker had fled to the US. \"We have a lot of work to do,\" he said, adding that he was \"very happy\" with the outcome of the meeting between the two leaders. Trump has been critical of Mexican security forces in recent weeks, saying they are \"in a state of chaos\" and that they \"have to deal with this situation.\" The president has also called for an end to violence in southern Mexico, which has seen a surge in violence since the end of last year's presidential election. In a statement, the Mexican government said it was working closely with US and US intelligence agencies to prevent further violence. It also said that it would continue to monitor the situation closely, with a special focus on the border between Sinaloa and Chihuahua, where the drug cartels are active. On Wednesday, US Secretary of State John Kerry visited the site of an attack by a group of gunmen that killed a man and wounded a woman. Kerry said the attack was the result of \"a coordinated and coordinated attack\" by the gunmen. He added that \"it is not a terrorist attack, it is an act of terrorism.\" \"It is a crime against humanity,\" Kerry told a news conference in Ciudad Juarez, a northern Mexican city that is home to a large number of drug trafficking suspects, according to Reuters news agency citing unnamed sources. Kelly said he had been briefed by US officials about the incident, but did not know the exact details of what was happening. 'I have no idea what is going on,' he told the news organization."

The case has highlighted the army's problems with equipment and morale. The men sentenced to death on Wednesday were part of the special forces division ordered in August to retake three towns in Borno state, which had been taken over by the Islamist Boko Haram insurgents. Their lawyer, Femi Falana, said the 54 men were sentenced to death by firing squad and five had been acquitted. They were accused of conspiring to commit mutiny against the authorities of the 7th Division of the Nigerian army, which is on the frontline. The trial began on October 15 and was conducted behind closed doors. It is subject to approval by top military officials, but there has so far been no indication that senior officers oppose the court martial. They were not available for comment afterwards. There was a similar case in Nigeria in September, when 12 soldiers were sentenced to death for mutiny after firing on their commanding officer in the northeast city of Maiduguri. The 7th Division, based in Maiduguri, leads the offensive but there are numerous reports of troops refusing to deploy. Soldiers have regularly complained that they lack weapons, food, and other basic supplies to fight the Islamists, who are reported to have tanks, rocket-propelled-grenade launchers, and other heavy weaponry. Boko Haram has taken a number of towns and declared an Islamic caliphate in the region near the border with Cameroon. The Nigerian military has in recent weeks claimed to have made progress in recapturing lost territory. Thousands of people have been killed since the Islamist uprising began five years ago. An estimated 1.3 million have been displaced, with tens of thousands seeking refuge in neighboring Cameroon, Chad, and Niger. rg/bk (AFP, AP, dpa)",

He added that \"the military is ready and willing to do everything in its power to stop the violence.\" \"We are ready for action,\" he said in an interview with the Nigerian news agency Naija. On Thursday, the army said that a military operation had been carried out to arrest the suspected terrorists. It said the operation was part of an \"ongoing campaign\" by the security forces to control the country's oil and gas reserves and to prevent the spread of terrorism. Military spokesman Ibrahim Idris, however, did not rule out the possibility of military action, saying that there was \"no imminent threat.\" The army spokesman said he was not aware of any imminent military intervention, but that military forces were prepared to use force if needed. In a statement, he added: \"There is no immediate threat to our national security, nor is there any threat of imminent violence. We will continue our fight against terrorism.\" Police said they had arrested a number of suspected militants, including one suspected of carrying out a terrorist attack on a police convoy in Nigeria's northeast earlier this month. Police have also arrested two suspected Boko haram fighters, one of whom is believed to have been killed in a shootout with police. They are suspected to be behind the attack, which killed more than 100 people. Boko Haram has claimed responsibility for the attacks, and has vowed to carry out more attacks against civilians. At the same time, it is alleged that some of its members are also planning to launch attacks on police forces and other security agencies. According to a report from the Nigeria Press Agency (NPA) quoting military sources, some 30,000 people have died in clashes between the militants and police since the beginning of this year.

The 53-year-old will be leading Germany's second biggest lender. After successfully weathering the Great Recession, Commerzbank's board of directors appears to want to signal a continuation in its growth trend with Martin Zielke's appointment as the new CEO as of May 1. Outgoing head Martin Blessing announced last year he would not renew his contract. Zielke had previously been put in charge of implementing reforms in the company's private banking sector following the recession. His restructuring measures attracted 800,000 new customers to the bank and changed the image of the 146-year-old financial institution. The 53-year-old has an illustrious career across several German financial institutions to look back on, having started at the teller of a local branch in 1983. Zielke's crowning achievement The beleaguered German financial institution recorded a profit of more than a billion euros (more than $1.1 billion) last year. It was the first time in five years that Commerzbank had made such profitable gains, which it said would translate into paid dividends for shareholders. A good portion of the yields were achieved by a restructuring and expansion drive of Commerzbank's private banking arm under Zielke's leadership. However, some of that money will go to the German government, as it had to step in and rescue the bank in 2009 to the tune of 18 billion euros ($25 billion at the time) by chiefly acquiring more than 15 percent of the shares, effectively nationalizing part of Commerzbank's operations. ss/jlw (dpa, Reuters)",
        "generated_story": "Commerzbank names Martin Zielke as next CEO Germany's largest bank is set to announce its next chief executive on Thursday. The bank said on Twitter that the board of directors had approved the appointment of a new CEO, Martin Blessing, as chairman of the bank's board. \"We are very pleased with Martin's appointment,\" said the company's chief financial officer, who will take over at the end of February. Martin is expected to take the helm in a year's time, according to a statement from the German finance ministry. He will be joined by the CEO of Deutsche Bank (DBKG, CIMB, Deutsche Boerse) and the chief operating officer (CEO) of German lender Deutsche Telekom (DTK, DZN). The German bank, which has been in the financial crisis since 2008, announced on Wednesday that it had chosen Martin to be its new chairman and CEO. It was the first time that a CEO had been chosen for the job since the crisis broke out in 2008. In his first interview since taking over as CEO in 2009, Blessing said he was \"very happy\" with the results and that he had \"no regrets\" about the decision to step down. On Thursday, the lender said it was confident that Martin would be able to stay on in his new role. According to the statement, \"Martin will continue to lead the firm through the next three years, and we are confident he will have a strong track record in this area.\" The statement also said that, in addition to his current role as head of finance, he would also take on the role of managing the country's sovereign wealth fund (BBK), which is now the world's second-largest bank by assets, after Citigroup (CIB). \"I am very happy to have Martin in my position,\" Blessing told Reuters news agency, adding that \"it is a great honor\" for him to become chairman. Borrowing from his former boss, former CEO and co-chief executive Martin B\u00fcndchen, B\u00f6hnert has also been named as a possible successor to former Chief Financial Officer Martin Baumgartner. Both men are well-known in Germany as well as in other European countries. They are both well known in their own right for their ability to make decisions on a wide range of topics, ranging from financial markets to economic issues. But they are also well respected in many other countries, such as the United States, France and Germany, where they have strong links to business, finance and investment banking. And they both have the experience and expertise to carry out such decisions. That is something that is very important to Martin, because he has a lot of experience in banking and is well versed in how to run a bank. His background in finance will also be important in setting up and running a successful bank and in managing a business. This is why he is known as one of those people who can be trusted to do the right thing. After all, it's not just the boss who has the power to decide whether or not a company is going to succeed him, but also the person who is responsible for running it. For example, when it comes to banking, there are a number of banks that have been bailed out or are looking to sell their shares, or to liquidate their entire portfolios. These are the banks which have suffered the most in recent years and are now in dire straits. One of these banks, for instance, is the biggest bank in Europe, with a total loss of 1.5 trillion euros ($2.6 trillion) in assets. Another is Deutsche BK Bank, a private bank that has lost around 1 billion euros (1.4 trillion pounds) since it took over the reins of its parent company in 2007. A third, though, was in charge of banking operations in Switzerland, Germany and Austria. However, this is not the case in China. There is no indication that this will change in any way at all. What is important is that there is continuity in terms of strategy and strategy. If you're looking for a change, you have to look at what's going on at Commerz Bank. You can't do that at home. I think that's a good thing because it will give you an idea of what you can do in your own country. So, what do you do? What are you doing? Do you think about that? Is it good for your country? I don't think so. How can you make a decision based on your personal experience? That's the question that I'm asking myself. Why do I do this? Because I want to know. Do I have any idea what the future holds for my bank? Well, I guess that depends on how I feel about my country and how well I've been doing. Is the economy is doing right now? It's very different from what I was doing when I started my career as an investment banker and now I'll be looking at it from a different point of view. We're going into"

        "target": "'One in three' unaware they are HIV-positive The number of people living with HIV/AIDS in the European Union and neighboring countries has increased by nearly a third, with one in three unaware they have the virus, the EU Commission warned Monday. In a document on combating AIDS, the Commission said that as of 2007, around 2.2 million people carried the virus in the EU and nearby countries, an increase of 700,000 from 2001. According to Commission figures, around 730,000 of these live within the EU's 27 member states. France, Italy, Spain and Portugal have relatively high infection rates - ranging from 0.4 percent to 0.5 percent. In the Baltic country of Estonia, the infection rate stands at around 1.3 percent. In neighboring Ukraine, around 1.6 percent of the population has been diagnosed with HIV, while in Russia around 1.1 percent are HIV positive. The Commission warned that now was not the time for Europe to drop its guard on preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS, adding that in some neighboring countries the number of people carrying the virus had doubled. EU Health Commissioner Androulla Vassiliou said political momentum in the fight against HIV/AIDS needed to be maintained, adding that people must \"take responsibility for themselves and their partners by talking about and practicing safe sex and going for HIV testing.\" A cure for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has yet to be found more than a quarter century after it was brought to public attention. However, efficient treatments exist to slow the evolution of the virus. dfm/AFP Editor: Chuck Penfold",
        "generated_story": "One in three people living with HIV/AIDS in the EU and neighboring countries are unaware they are HIV-positive, according to a new study. The study, published by the European Commission (ECB), found that one in four people who have HIV or AIDS in their country of origin do not know they have the disease. According to the report, the figure is up to three times as high as the national average of two people in each EU member state. This is a significant increase compared to two years ago, when the number of people with the virus was down to just two percent. In contrast, in most other EU countries, it is estimated that between one and three percent of the population is unaware of their HIV status. One in five of these people are aware of it, and that is because they don't know how to live with it. That is the highest figure since the 1990s, which was the first time HIV was reported to have been detected in a person's body. It is also the second time that HIV has been discovered in people's bodies after AIDS was discovered. \"This is not a surprise,\" said Androulla Vassiliou, a researcher at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDRP) in Brussels, adding that it was \"not surprising\" that two out of three of those people were unaware that they were HIV positive. But the study also showed that the risk of HIV is much higher among those living in countries with high rates of AIDS than those with low rates, such as those in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Middle East. A study published earlier this year in The Lancet on HIV and AIDS (HIV, AIDS, HIV, Hepatitis A) said that more than two-thirds of all HIV cases in Europe were linked to AIDS. However, there was also a \"significant increase\" in cases where HIV had been found in women and men, who are more likely to be infected with AIDS or HIV. These cases are not only more common among women, but also among men and older people, as well as more vulnerable to HIV infection. And this is despite the fact that many women who live in low-income countries have a higher risk for HIV than men. There are also concerns about the impact on women's health and well-being of children who may not be able to afford to pay for basic care and care for their family members. For example, one-third of women in high income countries who do have AIDS have no access to basic medical care, while the other half of them have to wait for a year or more for care. Another quarter, however, are unable to get care at all because of a lack of money and a high cost of living. They also have difficulty accessing basic services, like health care or social assistance. Many women have difficulties accessing the care they need in order to stay in contact with their husbands and depend on them for long periods of time. Some men are even less willing to take care of themselves and their families. Women have also become more dependent on the services they receive from their employers and employers, for example in hospitals and in nursing homes. More than one third of men who work in health services have an HIV diagnosis, although the average age is between 45 and 64 years old. What is more important is that their health is protected from the stigma that comes with having an AIDS diagnosis. How do you deal with this? What are you going to do about it? Do you know what you can do to protect yourself and your family? Is there a way to prevent HIV from spreading to other people? How can you prevent this from happening in your own country? The answer is simple: You can't do anything about that. If you're a woman, then you cannot do something about this. You cannot be a man. So, you must be very careful about your health. Don't be afraid to say that you will be exposed to this disease and it will spread to others. I think that's a very big problem for the rest of us. As a result, I'm not sure that I can say the same thing about my family. My family has a lot of health problems and I am very worried about what I'll be doing in my lifetime. Is it possible for me to become a mother? That's the main reason why I feel so bad about myself? It's not just because I have my own family and friends who suffer from HIV? I know it's something that happens to me all the time, so I try to make sure I stay healthy and healthy? Well, that doesn't make me feel any better than I already am? So I guess I've got a good answer for that, right? And then I will do my best to keep my mouth shut and keep on living my life as normal as possible. Let's see what happens next. We'll see how many more people will come up with a solution for this problem and then we'll figure out what the solution is. Can you tell me what's going forward?"

It is a one-crust pie, eaten in most German wine regions during the fall wine season. Zwiebelkuchen is traditionally eaten with Federweisser, a young wine available in Germany in the fall. The link between the two is so strong that many Federweisser wines have a recipe for the onion cake on their labels. Here's a recipe for it: Ingredients: 1 packet yeast, active dry 1 teaspoon sugar 1 1/2 teaspoon salt 3 cups unbleached flour 1 tablespoon shortening 1 cup water (49 to 54 C / 120 to 130 F) 6 slices bacon -- diced 2 medium onions -- sliced 1/4 teaspoon cumin 1/2 teaspoon salt Pepper 1 egg yolk 1 cup sour cream Mix the yeast with the sugar, a teaspoon of salt and half a cup of flour. Blend in the shortening and warm water, then beat for two minutes. Add enough flour to make a soft dough, and then knead the dough until smooth and elastic, about five minutes. Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, then cover it and let it rise in a warm place for 30 minutes. Pat the dough into a lightly greased 12-inch pizza pan or onto a lightly greased baking sheet. Press up the edges to make a slight rim. Fry the bacon until crisp and drain it on absorbent paper. Add onions to the bacon grease, and cook slowly until tender, but not brown. Sprinkle the onions, bacon, cumin, half a teaspoon of salt and pepper over the dough. Bake the cake at 204 C (400 F) for 20 minutes. Blend the egg yolk and sour cream and pour the mixture over the Zwiebelkuchen. Bake it for another 10 to 15 minutes, until the cake is golden brown and the sour cream has set. Serve warm or at room temperature with white wine.",
        "generated_story": "A German Wine Companion to the Fall Wine Season: A German wine companion To the fall wine season, the Onion Cake has become a staple of German cuisine. It's the perfect complement to a traditional German dish. Onion cakes are a great way to start the autumn season. They're also a wonderful way for people to enjoy a good wine. The onion cake is a perfect example of this. You can find it on the menu at the end of the month, and it's served in a variety of dishes, including wine, beer, wine and cheese. \"It's a very special wine,\" says the author, who has written a book about the subject, \"and I think it will be very interesting to see how it evolves over the next few months.\" The book, published in the German language in 2004, is based on a study by the University of Cologne's wine department, which has published more than 1,000 books on German wines since the 1970s. In addition, it includes a selection of wines from around the world, such as wine from France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece and the United States, as well as a number of other countries. But the book is not for everyone. There are many more books out there, but the most important one is Onion cake. This is the one that I'm most interested in, because it is one of my favorite things to do in Germany. I love onion cakes, especially when they're fresh and fresh. And I also like the fact that they have a lot of fresh fruit in them, so I can't wait to try some of them. That said, I don't think I'll be able to recommend them to anyone who doesn't have the time or the patience to read all the books. For me, though, they are just as important as the wine itself. If you're looking for something to drink, you can always find a bottle of wine that's good for you. Or, if you want to go out and get a glass of red wine at a wine shop, then you have to take a look at this book. What do you think? What does it say about wine? The answer is that it says that wine tastes better when it comes to wine than when you drink it. So, for example, this year, we're going to be drinking more wine with more fruit. We're talking about grapefruit, strawberries, tomatoes, cucumbers, parsley, basil, herbs, mushrooms, olive oil, garlic and herbs. These are all things that are very important for wine lovers to have in their diet and to make their own wine for the winter. However, there are also things they can do for their health and well-being. One of those things is to get your body ready for a new year's vacation. Another thing that is important is having a fresh, fresh wine in your fridge. When you get home from a long vacation, that means that you'll have more time to think about what you need to eat and how to prepare your food for your next vacation? That's exactly what we've been doing this past week. On the other hand, autumn is about to come and we'll see if we can get the hang of it in our own kitchen. After all, what do we have for dinner? We've got a whole lot to talk about, right now. Do you agree with me on that? Do we need a different approach to this? Is this the right approach? Or is it the wrong approach, or is this just the way it should be? If so, let's just say that we all agree on one thing: wine is great for our health! We all know that the health of our bodies and our immune system is very good at keeping our body and mind healthy and healthy. Let's see what happens when we get back to work, shall we? And if not, how will that affect our physical health? I'd like to know for sure. Is that something that can be done with the help of a professional wine maker? Well, yes and no, of course it depends on how well you feel about your diet. Then again, all of these things are important in order to keep your mind on what's important to you and your health. As long as you are eating the same things as autumn, everything is going well. Which is why, when the weather is good, everyone will have an idea of what to bring with us. How can we prepare for autumn? You know what I mean when I say \"summer\" and \"winter\" in my head? \"I'm not sure about that,\" I tell you, 'but I do think that there is something for me to say.\" \"Summer is definitely a time for us to look forward to autumn.\" That is, until autumn comes around and then we start eating more and more fruits and vegetables. Since autumn has come to an end. Last year was the first year that autumn was a bit of an exception to that rule. With the advent of spring,"

        "target": "Bayern blast five as Schalke draw Bayern Munich stamped their authority over the Bundesliga on Saturday, with a ruthless 5-0 drubbing of Hannover at home. Meanwhile, second-placed Schalke and third-placed Frankfurt were forced to share the points. With many critics saying Bayern might as well be given the giant Bundesliga dish already, perhaps the struggle for second is shaping up to be the more compelling battle. But Saturday afternoon's clash between second-placed Schalke and third-placed Frankfurt did not take a decisive turn, with the game ending in a 1-1 draw. Schalke drew first blood in the 11th minute, when Frankfurt's Stefan Aigner was dispossessed in midfield, and Lewis Holtby released Klaas-Jan Huntelaar in front of goal - the Dutchman's first in the Bundesliga since September. But the hapless Aigner waited just over 100 seconds to make amends for his error, when the Royal Blues allowed him a free header that left goalkeeper Lars Unnerstall with no chance. But neither side could make inroads in the second half, which allowed Dortmund to leap-frog both sides and claim second place. Bayern take command Meanwhile the imperious Bayern Munich dispelled any talk of winter form-dip - following last week's draw to Nuremberg - with a brutally efficient 5-0 win at home to Hannover. The Bavarians stormed to a 3-0 lead in just 37 minutes, celebrating a nifty overhead kick for star signing Javi Martinez in the fourth minute. Toni Kroos and Franck Ribery scored the next two against a Hannover side that were torn open at will. The overhead kick was the first for the 40-million-euro ($52-million) signing Martinez, and in the second half new defender Dante also opened his account with a straightforward header from a Kroos free-kick. The festival of football continued just four minutes later, when Mario Gomez - making first Bundesliga appearance of the season - slammed the ball into the net from a tight angle just 30 seconds after replacing Mario Mandzukic. Dortmund win The champions Dortmund, meanwhile, are still nine points behind Bayern after beating Mainz 2-1 away. It was a potentially tricky fixture in the town where J\u00fcrgen Klopp began his coaching career, and Mainz showed their brilliance in the fourth minute, when Elkin Soto knocked a dream ball into the path of Marco Caligiuri, whose volley fairly screamed into the top right corner. Dortmund's own star-Marco - national team player Marco Reus - leveled the scores just eight minutes later. Reus worked himself some room at the outer edge of the penalty area, and slotted a beautiful 17-meter effort into the far corner. And Dortmund's second goal, just before half-time, was equally aesthetic - a vertical ball bisected the Mainz defense perfectly down the middle, where Polish predator Robert Lewandowski got his eighth league goal of the season with a deft lob over the onrushing Christian Wetklo in goal. Allofs' homecoming Bremen's 1-1 draw at Wolfsburg had a special frisson of its own, as Wolfsburg's newly-minted sporting director Klaus Allofs faced the club he had served as general manager for over a decade. And there was some gesticulating from the Bremen bench in the general direction of the Wolfsburg management when the guests took the lead in the 35th minute. Just seconds after Wolfsburg missed several chances, Marko Arnautovic was left free in the box after Eljero Elia found space on the left and cut the ball back for the Austrian to finish. But Wolfsburg got their own back in the second half. In the 62th minute, Bremen were reduced to ten men when Lukas Schmitz was given second yellow card for a hard tackle on Adelino Vieirinha. Just two minutes later, Bas Dost took advantage of their guests' disorgnaization and smashed the ball into the goal after neat piece of play from Vieirinha. Dirty derby The Franconian derby between Greuther F\u00fcrth and Nuremberg was a cagey affair that ended in a frustrating 0-0 draw. The first half was marked mainly by a straight red card for Nuremberg's Markus Feulner after an ugly, flying lunge on Stephan F\u00fcrstner. But the home side's numerical advantage was short-lived - Sercan Sararer was also sent for an early ice bath after his high elbow on Javier Pinola was adjudged worthy of a second yellow card in the 61st minute. But the aggression in the tackles was not matched by ruthlessness in front of goal, and neither side could eke out any clear chances.",

The Bavarians will be looking to bounce back from a 2-1 defeat to Hannover on Tuesday night. They have a tough task ahead of them, as they travel to Mainz on Thursday night to try and avoid a repeat of last season's first-ever defeat. \"We have to get back on track,\" coach J\u00fcrgen Klopp said after his side's 3-0 win over Hannsburg at the weekend, adding that he was \"very happy\" with the result. However, he also said that his team-mates were \"a little bit disappointed\" in their performance against the Dutch side. He also pointed out that they had a lot of work to do in terms of improving their defensive system, and that it was important for them to be able to keep the ball in front of their own goalkeepers. That was the key to the win against Nuremberg on Sunday, but it wasn't enough to convince Klopp to stick to his guns. In the end, the German coach was forced to make a decision on the play-by-play of Mario Gomez, who has been injured in recent weeks and is expected to miss the rest of this season. On the other hand, it's not just Gomez who is in danger of missing out on a spot in next year's squad. It's also the player who could be a key part of a squad that is already in a position of strength. For the second time in three years, Gomez has made the most of his opportunity to play for his club. But he has also had to step up his game in order to stay in contention for the top spot, which he won in his last match for Bayern Munich in 2015. And that's when he made his first appearance for a club since joining the club in 2009. His first goal came against Hanno, where he scored the winning goal against Stuttgart on his return from an ankle injury in mid-December. After that, though, his form has fallen off a cliff. As a result, Bayern have been unable to find a way to win their next two games. This time around, they're looking for something different, something that will give them something to work on. If they don't find it, then they'll have no choice but to go back to their old ways and try again next season, when they play at home to Cologne. So far, so good. I think they've got a good idea of what they have in store for us. We'll see what we can do to help them win the league. There's no doubt that we're going to need a bit of help from the coaching staff and the players who are in charge of our team. You can see that in this match, we'll be working hard to improve the team's defensive game plan and improve our defensive play. What we need is a little more consistency in our attack and a better understanding of each other's strengths and weaknesses. With the exception of one player in particular, I'm not sure that I can really say much about the way we've been playing, or how we are going about our game. How do you feel about this game? How can you be confident in your own team? You're not confident that you can win? That's the question of your mind. Do you have any idea what you're doing? Is it the right thing to say to your opponent? I'd like to see a different approach? If you do, you'd be very surprised if you could say that to a player like Mario Mandzukic.\" \"I think that Mario is the best player of all time,\" said Javi Martinez, a former Bayern defender and coach of Germany's national team, in an interview with German newspaper Der Spiegel last week.

        "target": "In Argentina, red wine exports to balance Porsche imports About 100 Porsches are imported to Argentina each year. Now the country wants to keep a positive trade balance by having the value of the imported luxury cars matched by red wine exports. Porsche is currently enjoying record profits after a two-year downturn, but the export-reliant company has hit a pothole in Argentina. Buenos Aires-based Porsche importer Grupo Pulenta has signed an agreement obligating it to export several hundred bottles of red wine for each car it imports, the Argentine government announced Wednesday. Grupo Pulenta declined to comment when contacted by Deutsche Welle. Job creation During the past year, Argentina has held thousands of high-end vehicles in customs until companies agreed to export goods valued at the same amount. Most of those vehicles came from Germany. According to a spokeswoman for the Argentine embassy in Berlin, the country has been trying to safeguard domestic employment with a positive trade balance. \"Our government has negotiated with automakers to balance their imports of cars with an equivalent amount of exports,\" she told Deutsche Welle in a statement. \"Since March 2010 we have been working with the automakers and importers in order to increase local integration and reduce the trade deficit in this sector.\" Small market A Porsche spokesman said the company sells just short of 100 vehicles into Argentina each year. That compares to more than 40,000 sold worldwide during five months in 2010. \"For Porsche, Argentina is a rather small market,\" the spokesman told Deutsche Welle. \"Our importer, the Pulenta Group, also deals in wine. They have their own vineyards and export that wine. It has nothing to do with Porsche - we just have an import contract with them, and it seems they've found an individual solution with the Argentine government.\" Domestic production Volkswagen, which has an Argentine subsidiary producing the new \"Amarok\" pickup truck and transmissions, has thus far avoided mandatory exports. The company had reported an export surplus of 384 million euros ($545 million) for this year. Porsche's holding company owns 32.2 percent of Volkswagen, and the Porsche brand is intended to become integrated into Volkswagen's lineup. Daimler and BMW also have subsidiaries in Argentina. While Daimler produces its \"Sprinter\" there, BMW only imports to the country. According to the Argentine embassy in Berlin, the country has recently sought more domestic production by foreign car companies. Author: Gerhard Schneibel (dpa) Editor: John Blau",
        "generated_story": "Buenos Aires-based Porsche to balance wine exports with red wine Argentina's largest carmaker, Porsche, has announced that it will double its wine imports from Argentina in the coming months. The move comes as the country's biggest car maker, Grupo Pulenta, announced on Thursday it would double the amount of wine it produces in Argentina. \"We are going to double our wine export from Buenos Aires to Argentina,\" the company said in a statement, adding that the move was part of a plan by the Argentine government to reduce its reliance on imported wine. It also said it planned to introduce a new wine category, Amarok, in addition to its existing wine and beer categories. Argentina is one of the world's top wine exporters, with a market share of more than 30 percent. In the past, Argentina has been a major wine importer to Germany and the United States. However, this year, the market for wine has fallen to a low of 1.6 percent, according to data compiled by Deutsche Welle. That's down from 2.8 percent in 2014, when Argentina was the largest wine market in Europe. But the growth in wine sales is expected to continue in 2015, and in 2016, it was up to 3.5 percent year-on-year, compared to the previous year's average of 4.4 percent for the same period. Porsche has also been able to increase its exports to Brazil and Argentina, where it has a presence of around 30,000 cars. This is in line with the trend in recent years in Latin America, which has seen a rise in car sales, as well as an increase in demand for cars and SUVs. On the other hand, there are still a number of other factors that are weighing on the Brazilian market. For example, Brazil's state-owned oil giant Petrobras has increased its production of Brazilian wine, while Argentina\u2019s state oil company Daimler has reduced its domestic production by almost a third, to just over 1 million barrels a year. Meanwhile, Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Volkswagen have all increased their Brazilian production, although the latter has yet to show any signs of slowing down. A recent report from the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) said that Brazil had cut down on its Brazilian imports in order to make room for Brazilian wines. Brazil, however, is the only country that has not cut back on imports of its own wine from Brazil. According to an ICC report published earlier this month, \"Brazil's government is looking at the possibility of reducing its import duties on Brazilian and Argentine wines, but it is unlikely that this will be the case for Argentina.\" The report also noted that Brazilian President Mauricio Macri is also considering a move to cut its imports, saying that he would like to see more Brazil-made wines in his country. He said he was \"very optimistic\" about the prospects of Brazil becoming a world market leader and that Argentina would be a \"bigger and better place\" for Brazil than the U.S. in terms of foreign investment. Argentine President Nicolas Maduro has called for an end to imports and a return to exports of Argentine wine by 2015. His government has already approved a ban on import tariffs on Chinese imports."

The prime minister's Civic Platform party governs Poland in a center-right coalition with the Polish People's party. Last month, recordings of a private conversation between Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski and then-Finance Minister Jacek Rostowski were published by the weekly magazine Wprost.

The secret recordings were reportedly made over several months, including at high end restaurants in Warsaw. Wprost says it received the tapes from a businessman.

        "target": "Beekeepers battle mites with technology Bees are useful, hard-working and vital for our ecosystem. Aside from making honey, bees pollinate most of our food crops. But summertime is also the season for one of the biggest threats to honey bees \u2013 the varroa mite. Dete Papendieck puts on a white veiled protective hat and takes out a metal jug with a beak-shaped spout. He sets fire to the container's contents \u2013 formic acid \u2013 and starts directing the smoke that is wafting at the beehives lined up in front of him in his garden on the outskirts of Bonn. The acid doesn't harm the bees, but it does kill the varroa mites, he says. And July, after most of the honey has been harvested, is the best time to treat his hives. The one millimeter-large varroa mite is a parasite that infests beehives and lays its eggs in the honeycombs, alongside the bees' larvae. \"It feeds on the bees' and the bee brood's blood, the so-called haemolymph,\" Papendieck explains. A third of bees killed in Germany Papendieck is an apiarist at the Bee Research Institute at the University of Bonn and he knows that the threat of mites is serious. If left untreated, varroa-infested colonies rarely survive a winter. In 2010, German beekeepers lost about 200,000 hives to the mite \u2013 one third of Germany's total bee population. And it is not just the honey and beeswax production that are affected by the mite. Many of our food crops depend on bees: Some 80 percent of all agricultural plants and 90 percent of fruit trees in Europe are pollinated by Apis mellifera, the European honeybee. Varroa introduced from Asia Had Dete Papendieck been a beekeeper forty years ago he would not have had to worry about mites. He says the varroa mite that was originally native to Asia, was introduced to Europe in the 1970s. \"It happened during a research project in which it was attempted to crossbreed the European honeybee with the Asian honeybee. The researchers were exchanging bee colonies between Europe and India, and that is how the mites came to Germany,\" Papendieck said. Unlike Asian bee species, the European honeybee cannot fight off the varoa mite by itself. According to Papendieck, bees easily transmit the mite to other beekeepers' hives in what apiarists call robbery. \"It happens when certain colonies are being robbed by other bees. Large numbers of bees from different colonies attack weak hives and steal their stocks. At the same time, parasites and diseases are exchanged\", he says. Researchers have been trying to breed varroa-resistant mites, but so far they haven't had much success. High-tech tools help fight the mite Klaus Maresch is also worried about his bees. He is an organic beekeeper from Bonn and he has been passionate about bees since he was a little boy. \"They are part of my family. When I open my hives and smell the honey and hear the buzzing of the bees it's like being in another world,\" he told Deutsche Welle. In addition to using formic acid to fight the mite, Klaus Maresch employs a high-tech tool \u2013 a special cylindrical scale that helps him determine when it is best to start the varroa treatment. \"Every day this hive scale sends data about the colonies to our server. The data, such as the temperature in the hive and the amounts of nectar and pollen collected, help me to find a good day to treat varroa,\" Maresch says. Maresch also makes the data about the activities in his hives available to fellow beekeepers who can treat their colonies accordingly. A driver's license for beekeepers? But it is not the mite that angers Maresch most. \"That's nature,\" he says, \"I feel angry about beekeepers who don't fight varroa. If the bees of neighboring beekeepers are infested, I also have a problem.\" The existing German pest regulation obliges beekeepers to treat their bees against varroa, but there are no strict controls. The majority of Germany's more-than-80,000 beekeepers are amateurs who keep between one and 20 colonies. This makes it difficult to impose and survey certain quality standards. Maresch, who sees himself as a kind of 'bee activist', would like to see the government introduce stricter rules. \"There should be a law that obliges every new beekeeper to learn about beekeeping before they are allowed to keep bees. They should get an education and there should be something like a driver's license for beekeepers,\" he says. In the mean time, Europe's bees are going to have to",
        "generated_story": "German beekeeper fights varoa mite with high-tech hive scale German beekeepers have been battling a pest that has killed thousands of bees in the past few years. The pest, which is thought to be the most common pest in Germany, has become a major threat to the bee industry in recent years, according to researchers at the University of Bonn. \"The pest is very aggressive,\" said Dete Papendieck, head of the German Bee Research Institute (BRI). \"It is quite aggressive and aggressive, and it is going to take a lot of time to get used to,\" she said in an interview with Deutsche Welle, adding that the pest had become so aggressive that it was able to kill hundreds of honeybees in just a few days. According to a study published in a journal published on Monday by the journal Nature Ecology and Evolution, this pest can be easily killed with a single step. It is believed to have killed more than 1,000 bees since it entered the hive last year. In the study, the researchers found that about 1.5 million bees were killed each year, compared to just 2.6 million in 2005. This is the first time that a bee has been killed by an insect in over a century. On top of that, it has also killed over 2,500 bees. One of them, Klaus Maresch, was one of only a handful of people to die from the disease. He was the only one to survive the attack, but he was also the last to make it out alive. His wife and two children were also among those who died. They are now in intensive care, he said, with the help of specialists in beekeeping and bee-keeping who are experts in their field of expertise. A new hive is being developed for the purpose of reducing the risk of infection and to protect the bees' health. BRI researchers have also been working on a new honey-making technique for bees, called the \"Bee Hive Scale.\" The hive will be used in conjunction with other hive-scale projects, such as a honey hive and a hive that can house up to 3,200 bees at a time. Experts say the new technology will help to reduce the spread of pests and increase the number of bee species. However, there is still a long way to go before it's ready for humans to use it, they say. For example, in order to combat the pests, bees need to learn how to live on their own, so that they don't have to compete with each other. That's why we have the Bee Hive scale, for example. But we also have bees that are more intelligent and more efficient than the ones we see on the market. We also see that bees have a better understanding of their environment than we do of what is happening in other countries. So, we are looking at this as an example of how we can use this technology to fight pests. What do you think? Do you believe that this is a good approach to fighting pests? I think the answer is no, because it doesn't make sense to me. I'm not sure that I believe in this approach at all. There are many reasons why bees are so successful at killing pests in general. First of all, honey is more expensive than honey. Secondly, you can't kill them with honey alone. And thirdly, if you have honey in your hive, then you're not really doing anything wrong. You're doing something wrong, right? And then there's the fact that honey isn't really good for you. Why is honey so expensive? Why does honey not make you happy? Because honey has a bad reputation for being cheap? It's not just about the honey that's being sold. Honey is not cheap. If you buy honey from a company that sells honey and then sells it to other companies that sell honey, that means you'll have more money to spend on honey for your honey budget. Then you've got to pay the price for honey! The honey can also be sold to another company, or you could sell it for a very low price. These honey bees do a great job at making honey more affordable and less expensive. As a result, people are spending more time and money on bees than they normally would spend at honey stores. Now we're talking about bees and honey substitutes. How do we make honey better? We're trying to find out. Do we need more honey? What are the best ways to do that? How can we use honey to improve our honey production? Is honey cheaper? You know what I mean? Well, I'd like to know. Let's see what happens next. Can you tell me what the next step is? Let me know!

Other German politicians, however, were more willing to voice the opposition to putting a sip of wine on the same footing with a puff of a cigarette. \"People should not expect that a skull and crossbones end up on every bottle of beer and wine,\" German EU representative Karl-Heinz Florenz told Der Tagesspiegel newspaper, adding that when it comes to alcohol, each member state should be responsible for how it deals with alcohol abuse. The harm of \"passive drinking\" While cigarettes are a health risk from the first puff, moderate drinking can actually be healthy and there is no danger from \"passive drinking,\" Peter Liese, a German EU representative, told the paper. The commission's report disagreed with Liese's conclusion, saying alcohol abuse had a major role in as many as 200,000 deaths in Europe due to car accidents and disease and played a role in some 60,000 underweight births. The report also estimated the effects of alcohol abuse of costing the EU 125 billion euros ($161 billion) in 2003. Some 25 percent of men and 10 percent of women in Europe drink what the EU considers to be more than healthy amounts of alcohol and between 3 percent and 5 percent are suffering from alcoholism, according to EU statistics.",

        "target": "German Minister Urges Peace in Georgia's Separatist Regions German Foreign Minister Steinmeier has called for an end to the \"spiral of violence\" between the Georgian government in Tbilisi and its Russian-backed rebel regions and presented a three-stage plan to break the deadlock. Steinmeier issued the plea as he began a tour of the region to sponsor a new peace plan aimed at calming the simmering tensions over Georgia's separatist regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. \"This is my appeal to break out of the spiral of violence. A lack of dialogue is not an option for the future,\" he said after meeting with his Georgian counterpart Eka Tkeshelashvili. Steinmeier, who chairs the so-called Group of Friends of the United Nations' Secretary on Georgia, is proposing a three-phase peace plan based on a mutual declaration of non-violence and repatriation of about 25,000 ethnic Georgians expelled from Abkhazia in the 1990s. Negotiations over the status of the two rebel regions, which have enjoyed de facto autonomy since the end of a civil war in 1994, was reserved for the final phase of negotiations. Tkeshelashvili said, \"The plan has great potential for success,\" but added that the most difficult thing would be to convince Russia. Peace talks remain distant The threat of armed conflict in the region last month has given urgency to international pressure for renewed peace talks, but Tbilisi, Moscow and the Russian-backed regions remain far apart on the basic premises for restarting peace talks. Officials in Tbilisi oppose a treaty on the non-use of force without guarantees on the return of refugees and the withdrawal of Russian peacekeeping forces base in the region. Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was skeptical of peace efforts Thursday. \"Signing of a treaty on the return of Georgian refugees to Abkhazia is unreal now, because such a return requires a calm situation,\" Lavrov was quoted as saying by news agency RIA-Novosti. \"We think that signing a treaty on the non-use of force without any preconditions is an absolutely unavoidable first step,\" he added. Experts see little hope for Steinmeier's plan Analysts do not expect anything conclusive from Steinmeier's trip, pointing to intransigence on the part of the Abkhaz President Sergei Bagapsh, who said he would \"not consider the plan.\" \"We are not going to discuss Abkhazia's status with anyone. We are building an independent, democratic state,\" Bagapsh was quoted by Georgian news agencies as saying. Speaking to journalists ahead of the meetings Thursday, Steinmeier admitted: \"We don't have any illusions about simple answers, but we cannot stand by without acting on this conflict. That would be irresponsible.\" From Tbilisi, the German minister is to travel to the Black Sea city of Batumi for talks with Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili and then to Abkhazia on Friday before ending his three-day tour in Moscow. Most citizens of the breakaway republics have been issued Russian passports and over 2,500 Russian peacekeeping troops patrol the region under a UN ceasefire agreement. In opposition to Georgia's bid to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Russia moved to strengthen diplomatic ties with the breakaway regions sharply aggravating tensions with the Georgian leadership in recent months.",
        "generated_story": "A New Peace Plan For Georgia A new peace plan for Georgia has been drawn up by the Group of Friends of the United Nations (GOF) Secretary on the Middle East Eka Tkeshelashvili. The GOF's Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, said on Thursday that the new plan would be based on a \"new peace process\" between Georgia and Abkhazia. \"It is the first step in the right direction,\" he said in a statement. He added that he was \"deeply concerned\" about the situation in Georgia, which he described as \"a very unstable and unstable region.\" \"We are very concerned about Georgia's stability and stability, and we want to make sure that it is stable and that we are able to move forward with this new process,\" the German Foreign Minister said at a press conference in Tbilisi, adding that \"we will continue to work closely with the Georgian government and the international community to ensure that this process is carried out in accordance with international law and international humanitarian law.\" He also said that a new \"peace plan\" should be put in place for the conflict-ravaged regions of South Ossetia, North and Central Asia, as well as the Caucasus, in order to prevent the spread of separatism among ethnic Georgians and other ethnic groups. In addition, he added, \"it is also important for us to have a roadmap for reconciliation between the two regions, so that they can move towards a common goal of peace and prosperity for all of their peoples.\" In a speech to the GEF's General Assembly on Wednesday, the group of experts said they were \"very optimistic\" that Georgia would emerge from the current conflict as a stable state. They also pointed out that there was a possibility of a return to normal relations with Russia after the end of World War II, when the Soviet Union ended its military occupation of Georgia in 1991. However, they also stressed the need for a peaceful transition of power between Russia and Georgia. On the other hand, there is still a long way to go in terms of establishing a political and economic framework, with a number of key issues still to be resolved. One of those issues is whether or not Russia will be willing to accept Georgia as part of its new state of emergency. Another issue is how to deal with separatist groups, such as North Korea and Iran, who have been fighting for more than a decade against the regime of President Mikheil Karabakh since he took power in February 1994. This is a topic that has become a hot topic in recent months, especially after Russia's annexation of Crimea in March 2014. It has also become an important topic of discussion in Russia, where the Kremlin has a strong interest in expanding its influence and influence over the region. Russia has long been a supporter of Georgian President Ilham Aliyev, a former KGB agent who is now a professor at the University of Moscow in Moscow. During his visit to Georgia last year, Russian President Vladimir Putin said he would like to see the country re-integrate into the European Union as soon as possible. But he did not rule out the possibility that Russia could be involved in any kind of conflict with Georgia again. Putin has already made it clear that his country is not interested in joining the EU."

        "target": "Maldives revokes state of emergency citing improved security situation The president of the Maldives has lifted a state of emergency following an outcry from the international community. The government says the measures are no longer necessary because the security threat has subsided. The government said Tuesday it had rescinded the emergency measures \"with immediate effect\" and that \"all fundamental rights that were suspended have been restored.\" President Yameen Abdul Gayoom declared the state of emergency one week ago after the discovery of a homemade bomb and a stash of weapons near his official residence. The finding followed an explosion on Gayoom's speedboat in September - an incident the government labeled an assassination attempt. The president was not hurt in the blast, but his wife, an aide and a bodyguard were injured. The emergency regulations, intended to be in place for 30 days, gave security forces wide-ranging search and arrest powers, and suspended citizens' basic rights. They drew criticism from former colonial power Britain as well as the United States, the European Union and neighboring Sri Lanka. Reading out a presidential decree revoking the emergency, Attorney General Mohamed Anil said there was no longer a threat to the Indian Ocean atoll nation. He said investigations into the September blast and the recovery of weapons had made good progress. The foreign ministry said a number of people had been arrested. Lawmakers also used the security regulations to fast-track the impeachment of Vice President Ahmed Adeeb, who stands accused of plotting the alleged attempts on the president's life. Impact on tourism Attorney General Anil said pressure from the international community, as well as \"the possible adverse impact on Maldives tourism and the economy,\" had also played a role in ending the state of emergency. Foreign tourists visiting the tropical nation, known for its luxury tourist resorts, palm-fringed beaches and coral reefs, contribute close to a third of the country's gross domestic product. The Maldives has had a rocky road to democracy since holding its first multiparty election in 2008. The country's first democratically elected leader, current opposition chief Mohamed Nasheed, was forced to step down in 2012 after a mutiny by security forces. In March, he was jailed for 13 years on terrorism charges in a trial the United Nations said was illegal. President Gayoom is under intense international pressure to release him. Nasheed's opposition Maldivian Democratic Party welcomed Tuesday's announcement. But said declaring the state of emergency in the first place was a political move designed to stop a rally planned for last week calling for Nasheed's freedom. \"It appears that Yameen is willing to make up threats about the nation's security in order to settle political scores,\" the party said in a statement, referring to the president. nm/kms (AP, AF, Reuters, dpa)",
        "generated_story": "Maldives lifts state of emergency after international criticism The Maldives has lifted a state-of-emergency in the capital, Male. The move came after the Maldivian government said it had lifted the emergency order imposed by President Yameen Abdul Gayoom on Friday. \"We have lifted this emergency,\" the government spokesman said in a statement, adding that the move was \"in accordance with international law.\" The government had earlier announced that it would no longer allow the use of force against the opposition party's candidate, Mohamed Anil, in elections scheduled for February 15. However, the announcement came a day after opposition leader Ahmed Adeeb, who is widely seen as one of the country's most powerful men, was accused of plotting to overthrow the president. He has denied the allegations and said he would appeal to the Supreme Court to reinstate the order. His comments come after a meeting with opposition leaders in which he called for the release of all opposition candidates, including Nasheed, to be allowed to run for re-election next year. A spokesman for his office said the meeting was scheduled to take place at the end of February, but that no decision had been made on whether or not to release the names of those candidates. It was not immediately clear how much time had passed between the two sides, which is said to have been discussing the issue of a possible presidential election, and whether the election would be held on the same day as the general election. Opposition parties have also been calling for an early election in February. Some opposition parties, however, have said they will not run again until the new election is held. They also have called on President Mohamed Aung San Suu Kyi to step down from his post as prime minister. On Friday, a parliamentary committee approved a bill that would allow him to stay in office until elections are held in March. That bill is expected to cost around $1.5 billion (2.6 billion euros) and is subject to parliamentary approval. But the bill does not include a provision for a referendum on a presidential term limit of five years. This is the first time that an election has been held under a new constitution. In the past, elections have often been postponed or annulled due to a lack of support from the electoral commission. Last year, President Ali Abdullah al-Nahyan declared a \"general election\" on February 14, setting the stage for another round of elections in April. Since then, he has promised to hold a special election on March 14."

Clubs officials say talks are ongoing in the hope Max Meyer will extend his contract. Schalke might struggle to retain 22-year-old midfielder Max Meyer when his contract runs out at the end of the season, at least according to recent media interviews from the club's sporting director, Christian Heidel. Speaking to German news agency dpa, Heidel confirmed that Meyer turned down an offer of a contract extension earlier in February. \"Max Meyer's agent received an extension offer on January 12 with a deadline of February 15, and informed us on February 15 via email that Max would not be accepting the offer because of the deadline imposed,\" Heidel told dpa. \"We have acknowledged this. For now, we no longer feel beholden to the terms of that offer, but that doesn't mean an extension is impossible either.\" Meyer was reportedly offered an annual salary in the region of \u20ac5.5 million ($6.7 million); it was the second contract he refused, following a less lucrative offer at the end of last season.

Heidel said this week that the club was still trying to convince the German to stay. \"At the moment we're still ready to talk,\" Heidel told this week's edition of football magazine Kicker, albeit stressing that time was of the essence. \"But we must and we will plan for the new season.\" In a separate newspaper interview Heidel was even more explicit, saying the club was not in a position to wait until summer for Meyer to make up his mind. Speaking to Sport Bild magazine, meanwhile, Heidel sought to focus on Meyer's more important role at Schalke, his regular game time, arguing it might be in the youngster's best interests to stay at a club that needs him every week. \"[Coach] Domenico Tedesco has formed the team around him in such a way that there is now an ideal spot for Max. That was not always the case,\" Heidel said. \"He needs to ask himself, putting the financial aspect to one side: 'Will I get such a position at a different club?'

He added that the club was \"still ready\" to discuss the possibility of Meyer moving on from his role as a key member of the starting lineup. The coach also said that he would like to see Meyer return to the squad, but that it would be \"hard to say for sure\" if he was to stay on the bench. Meyer's future remains unclear, however, as he has a contract until the end of next season. But he is expected to make a decision within the next couple of weeks about his future, according to a report in the German newspaper Sport Bild. It is not yet clear whether Meyer will remain with the team or whether he will move on to other positions, such as the midfield or the left-back position. There is a chance that Meyer could move away from the role of a central midfielder and into a more defensive role, which would allow him to play more attacking football. However, the coach said he had no immediate plans to do so, adding that \"it's up to us to decide whether we're going to go for it.\" He also stressed the importance of keeping Meyer at the top of his game, saying that there was a \"strong possibility\" of him moving to another position, where he could be a regular starter for a club like Bayern. That is, he said, \"if he stays at his current position.\" \"I don't think he's going anywhere,\" Meyer added, referring to his decision to leave his position as Bayern's defensive midfielder in order to focus on his new role in a team that is struggling to find the right fit for him. On the other hand, there is also the matter of how long Meyer would stay with Bayern, and how much longer he'd have to wait for his contract to expire. After all, it's not just about him that's at stake, is it? \"He's a very important player for Bayern,\" said the head coach, Domenico Tedesco, in an interview with German magazine Sport-Bild. In the interview, Meyer also spoke about how important it is to be able to work with his old man, Leon Goretzka, for example, to help him in his recovery from an ankle injury. His comments come after a week of speculation over his possible departure from Bayern after the Bundesliga season, when he signed a new contract extension with an eye on a possible return. According to German football's official website, Bayern are \"very confident\" in their ability to keep the midfielder at bay and that they have a good chance of winning the Champions League next year. They are also optimistic about their chances of making it into the first round of this year's World Cup in Russia, with Germany's top-ranked team already in position to qualify for that tournament. At the same time, they are hopeful that their new coach will make an impact in other areas of football, including the transfer market and the recruitment of new players. 'We are very confident that we can win the league,' Meyer said."

At least 17 people have been killed and dozens more injured across several island nations in the Caribbean.

In the US territory of Puerto Rico, 1 million people \u2013 nearly one-third of the population \u2013 lost electricity during the storm, said Puerto Rican Governor Ricardo Rossello. \"It will be difficult to estimate how long the power outage will last,\" Rossello said. Later, officials confirmed that at least two people on the island had been killed by the storm's devastation. Two other major storms have developed in the Caribbean, namely Hurricane Jose and Hurricane Katia. Jose was east of the Lesser Antilles with maximum sustained winds of 120 miles person hour (195 kilometers person hour) as a hurricane watch was in effect for Antigua and Barbuda. Jose has followed the same path as Hurricane Irma, and was upgraded to a Category 4 on Friday by the US National Hurricane Center. Katia has remained relatively static, hovering off the coast of Mexico. Florida on edge Florida Governor Rick Scott said 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain were expected after Irma made landfall at the weekend as he urged evacuations during a press conference on Friday.

Britain-EU divorce proceedings will probably last about two years. Until then, the status quo must be maintained, German Chancellor Angela Merkel emphasized in her press statement. If she is no longer chancellor after the upcoming parliamentary elections in 2017, then others will have to live with the consequences of Brexit. But that is not what she is actually thinking. It is not coincidental that foreign ministers and government leaders are visiting Berlin in the coming days. They want to discuss how things will continue. Berlin, under Merkel's chancellorship, has become a center of power outside of Brussels. Difficult international politics The Brexit decision has disrupted Europe's equilibrium. Germany has lost an important ally on European issues related to economic growth and budgetary discipline. Now, France presumably will be the next to raise its voice against Maastricht Treaty criteria. If the Netherlands and Denmark also decide to leave the EU, Germany will become isolated, as Eastern Europe is not as tight with Germany as it once was. Poland now plays a key role for the Balkan nations and the Visegrad Group (Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic and Slovakia). And Poland is still annoyed about Merkel's refugee policy. What about Germany's populists? They're giddy with glee as they feel that their anti-establishment policies have been validated. They are teaching potential AfD (Alternative for Germany) voters a lesson: \"Here, have a look: it's possible. There is always an alternative. Vote for us!\" Those are exactly the words that protest voters want to hear. Germany's AfD has forged ties with other right-wing parties in Vienna, Paris, The Hague and London. They are all pursuing a \"European\" plan to gain power. The recent Austrian presidential election was significant, as the populist candidate lost by a very narrow margin; in fact, the final election results are still undecided as they are being contested. The Brexit vote was also triggered by populist powers. Domestically difficult Many populists believe that the stronger populism becomes - no matter where - the more advantages there would be for individual parties of their persuasion. Many would also like to see Donald Trump as US president. That is how AfD may become even stronger in Germany, which also means that political majorities would fluctuate even more. Will there be enough seats after the next election for a Christian Democrat and Green coalition, or will yet another grand coalition made up of Christian Democrats and Social Democrats be formed? Can Angela Merkel change course? Can she counter the trend with a new political model in Europe and Germany? Or do we stand on the edge of a new era, a \"political revolution,\" as the AfD calls it? Until now, Europe has survived attacks on its currency (euro crisis), the principle of peaceful coexistence (Crimea crisis) and its open borders policy (refugee crisis). Merkel deserves credit for defending these values, despite mistakes that have been made along the way. The outcome of the Brexit crisis is, however, still open. Have something to say?

        "target": "Reports: Merkel to run for fourth term as German chancellor German Chancellor Angela Merkel has confirmed that she will stand for the chancellery in the 2017 election, German media reports. The Christian Democrat Leader (CDU) first took office in 2005. After months of speculation, German Chancellor Angela Merkel reportedly told her fellow Christian Democrats (CDU) in Berlin on Sunday that she is prepared to lead the party into next year's election. An official statement is expected from Merkel at 7 p.m. local time (1800 UTC) on Sunday. The 62-year-old has faced a number of difficulties in recent months, from criticism over her handling of the migration crisis to falling support amid a rise in right-wing populist sentiment. Since taking office in 2005, however, Merkel has also been praised for navigating Europe's largest economy through the financial and eurozone crises. According to an Emnid survey published in the German newspaper \"Bild am Sonntag\" 55 percent of Germans are in favor of Merkel remaining head of the German government for another four years. Thirty-nine percent said they were against her re-election. Sign of stability Should she be elected next September, another full four-year term would put Merkel on a par with her mentor Helmut Kohl who set the post-war record and presided over the Fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. In light of the UK's shock vote to leave the European Union in June and Donald Trump's election last week as US president, Merkel's re-election is likely to be welcomed in many capitals as a sign of stability. During his final visit to Berlin this week, US President Barack Obama said that if he were able to, he would vote for his longtime partner and friend. In an interview with German magazine \"Spiegel\" and broadcaster \"ARD,\" Obama said: \"She has great credibility, and she is willing to fight for those values in a way that is very, very important.\" \"I'm glad that she's there and I think the German people should appreciate her. Certainly, I've appreciated her as a partner.\" Winning back votes With the less that a year until Germany heads to the polls, Merkel's CDU is now turning its efforts to wooing back disenchanted voters who have left the conservative camp to support the right-wing populists, Alternative for Germany (AfD). Formed as a Euro-sceptic party in 2013, the AfD won 4.7 percent of the popular vote in the last federal elections in 2013, just falling short of the 5 percent threshold required to enter the Bundestag - Germany's lower house of parliament. After benefiting from the rise in europsceptic, anti-immigration sentiment, seemingly sweeping across western Europe, the party now holds seats in nine of Germany's 16 states.",
        "generated_story": "Merkel's re-election bid comes amid growing populist sentiment in Germany Chancellor Angela Merkel has announced she will seek a second term in office. The chancellor's announcement comes as the country prepares to elect a new president on Sunday. Merkel is set to run for the first time since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, when she was first elected to the post of Chancellor of Germany. German media reported on Monday that Merkel would seek another term as chancellor, replacing Helmut Kohl, who was forced to step down by the end of last year's parliamentary elections. \"We have a lot of work to do,\" Merkel told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper, adding that she would be \"very happy\" if the new chancellor were to win the election. She is also expected to seek an extension of her parliamentary majority in the lower house of parliament, where she currently holds a majority of seats. In her first speech since becoming chancellor in 2009, Merkel said she wanted to \"make Germany a more democratic country\" and that \"we are going to have to work together to make it a better place for our people.\" She also said that her party, the Alternative for Germany (AfD), would work closely with the chancellor to ensure that Germany's economy remained strong enough to meet the needs of its citizens. But she said the party would not be able to achieve this goal without the support of voters, saying that it was \"not possible.\" The AfD, which is a far-right party that has been in power since 2005, is seen as a potential challenger to Merkel's conservative Christian Democrat Party (CDU). The CDU, a coalition of conservatives and the Christian Social Union (CSU), is thought to be in a strong position to challenge Merkel. It is not yet clear whether Merkel will run again, however, if she is to secure a third term, or whether it will be possible for her to stay on as Chancellor. On Sunday, Chancellor Merkel was due to take the oath of office at a ceremony at the state palace in Berlin, but was unable to attend the ceremony because of a lack of support from her own party. A spokesman for Merkel, Klaus Schwab, said in an interview with German news magazine Bild that the former chancellor was not interested in running for a fourth term. He added that he had \"no intention of running again.\" \"I have no interest in being chancellor again,\" he said, referring to his party's coalition partner, SPD. 'I don't see any reason why I shouldn't be chancellor anymore.' The SPD has also been accused of failing to provide the necessary support needed to form a government, and it has repeatedly rejected the idea that a chancellor should be allowed to lead the government. However, it is unclear whether the SPD or CSU would take over the reins of power if Merkel wins the presidency, as is the case in many other European countries. What is clear is that there is no chance of Merkel winning again in her bid to become chancellor next year. That is, she has already lost the popular vote in recent weeks, with polls showing that voters are more likely to turn out in favor of conservative parties such as Social Democrats (SPD) and Greens (Christian Democrats) than conservatives. This is despite the fact that many of those who support Merkel are now in opposition to her, including former Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, to a lesser extent, than in previous years. Schulz has said he will not run against Merkel in future elections, even if he is elected chancellor."

        "target": "NFL stars defy Donald Trump's call for boycott Baltimore Ravens and Jacksonsville Jaguars players \"took a knee\" during the national anthem after Trump urged fans to boycott football matches. The kneeling protest, to highlight social injustice, has stepped up a gear. Hundreds of National Football League (NFL) stars protested President Donald Trump's call for fans to boycott the league by refusing to stand for the US national anthem this weekend, starting Sunday's game between the Baltimore Ravens and Jacksonsville Jaguars. A number of other players locked arms in solidarity ahead of the game at Wembley Stadium in London. Jacksonville Jaguars' owner Shahid Khan, who last year donated one million dollars\u00a0(840,000 euros) to the Trump campaign, locked his arms with players - a rare scene, as owners almost never take to the field. US media reported that about 200 players on Sunday sat, knelt or raised their fists in defiance of Trump's comments. In one of the most memorable moments, singer Rico LaVelle took a knee and held up a fist at the last line of the Star Spangled Banner ahead of the game between the Detriot Lions and Atlanta Falcons. The protest came in response to Trump's tweets on Sunday morning urging fans to boycott NFL games to pressure the league into firing or suspending players to kneel in protest during the national anthem. In an early morning tweet, Trump posted: \"If NFL fans refuse to go to games until players stop disrespecting our Flag and Country, you will see change take place fast. Fire or suspend!\" \"NFL attendance and ratings are WAY DOWN. Boring games yes, but many stay away because they love our country. League should back US,\" he added. Later, the president said that his rant \"has nothing to do with race,\" despite the fact that the origins of the protest are to do with police brutality against minorities, especially African Americans. Trump said his comments were instead about \"respect for our country and respect for our flag.\" Trump's spat with US professional sports began at a Republican rally in Alabama on Friday, when the president attacked activist NFL players for kneeling or sitting during the national anthem, labelling them as \"sons of bitches.\" \"Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, 'Get that son of a bitch off the field right now... he is fired'?\" Trump told a crowd of cheering supporters. That day, basketball star Stephen Curry, the top player for California's Golden State Warriors, announced that he would not be attending a traditional White House reception honoring the National Basketball Association champions. The kneeling protest was started by former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick who refused to stand for the anthem back in 2016. Kaepernick's gesture came amid a spate of deadly police shootings of black men and was aimed at drawing more attention to treatment of minorities in the US. However, Kaepernick has since become a free agent, after failing to be signed by a new team for the new NFL season. NFL executives decry Trump's calls Trump also drew the ire of senior NFL executives and team owners. Responding to Trump's tweets, Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti, said he \"100 percent\" supported his players' decision to kneel during the anthem. Robert Kraft, the owner of the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots, who is also a close friend of Trump, said in a statement on Sunday that he was deeply disappointed by the president's comments in Alabama. Kraft defended players' rights to \"peacefully affect social change and raise awareness in a manner that they feel is most impactful,\" and said that sports were a unifying force in the US. \"Our political leaders could learn a lot from the lessons of teamwork and working together toward a common goal,\" he said. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, who has taken much of the heat for Kaepernick's failure to find a new team, was also quick to condemn Trump's comments.

They include the owners of the New York Jets, New England Patriots, Dallas Cowboys, Washington Redskins, Jacksonville Jaguars, Houston Texans, Los Angeles Rams and Tampa Bay Buccaneers",
        "generated_story": "US President Donald Trump's call for NFL players to kneel during the national anthem sparked online controversy. The president's comments came after the New York Jets quarterback Colin Kaepernick took a knee during Sunday's game against the Los Angeles Rams. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell called on the NFL's top team, the San Francisco 49ers, to \"stand up for the flag.\" The NFL, which is owned by the Republican-controlled US Congress, has been embroiled in controversy in the wake of the protests. On Sunday, Trump called for a boycott of all NFL games, including the Super Bowl, in response to a tweet from NFL owner Robert Kraft. \"The NFL should stand up and show respect to our flag,\" Trump said in a statement posted on Twitter. He also said that the league should \"show respect\" to the players who protest the anthem. But the White House did not immediately respond to Khan's tweet, saying it was \"unacceptable\" for Trump to call on NFL teams to stand in solidarity with the nation's flag-draped casket. Twitter users also criticized the president for his comments, calling him \"a bully\" and \"an enemy of our country.\" \"I don't know what you're talking about,\" wrote one user. Another user said he was referring to NFL general manager Steve Bisciotti, adding that he had \"no idea\" whether the comments were meant to be interpreted in any way as a threat to national security. A third user added that \"it's not a question of whether or not we're going to do something about it.\" A fourth user also commented that Trump was calling for an end to protests against President Barack Obama's travel ban on Muslims entering the United States. In response, a number of NFL owners and league officials said they would hold a meeting in London on Sunday to discuss the issue. One of those owners said the meeting would take place at Wembley Stadium. Other owners, however, said it would not be an issue at all. According to one Twitter user, there was no immediate response from the Trump administration, but the comment was interpreted by some as an attempt to distance the US president from his controversial stance on racial inequality and the treatment of African-Americans by white supremacists and neo-Nazis. Some NFL executives have also expressed concern about the use of social media to draw attention to Kaepernick's protests, while others have suggested that it could lead to an escalation of violence against black people and other minorities. However, one NFL executive, Stephen Curry, told the Associated Press that his team's decision was made \"in the best interest of football and our national interest,\" not the safety of its players. Meanwhile, another NFL player, Kevin Durant, tweeted that Kaepernick should be allowed to protest in front of his home stadium, Wembley, if he wants to. Kaepernick has a history of protesting during football games and is a prominent supporter of President Trump. His Twitter account has since been taken down, with some fans calling on him to step down and others accusing him of disrespecting his country. It's unclear whether he has any plans to take a stand against Trump, or whether his remarks will be taken seriously. Last week, he tweeted about a \"Muslim ban\" that could have been lifted if Trump had been elected president. That tweet was retweeted by more than 1.5 million people, according to The Washington Post. Commenters also pointed to comments made by former NFL star and current NFL coach Steve Sarkisian, who was fired by Trump over the weekend following an altercation with a woman over a drink at a football game, as well as comments he made during a press conference at the end of last season. Trump has also been accused of using Twitter to push back on his criticism of Kaepernick."

        "target": "Turkey, Greece seek NATO mission in Aegean, says German official Germany, Greece and Turkey will ask NATO to approve a maritime surveillance mission in the Aegean to combat illegal people smugglers. Greece had previously voiced reservations about the proposal. The proposed mission to be discussed at a NATO defense ministers meeting in Brussels on Thursday comes days after German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutolgu said they would raise the issue of refugees with the Alliance. According to a Reuters report citing a senior German official, initially reticent Greece has now given the green light for the operation, which could see NATO assets deployed in the Aegean in a mostly intelligence and reconnaissance role. Under the proposal, which would need to be approved by Alliance members, NATO maritime assets would provide information to national coastguards and the EU border agency Frontex to combat illegal smugglers using rickety boats to bring migrants to Europe. Turkey would then take back the refugees, as envisioned as part of a 3 billion-euro ($3.2 billion) EU-Turkey deal agreed to last year. According to German sources, the mission would not be similar to the NATO mission in the Mediterranean intercepting migrant boats making the dangerous run from Libya to Italy. However, NATO ships could intervene in emergency situations to save passengers. \"It is not NATO's remit to push back or stop refugee boats,\" the official told Reuters. The mission would use assets from the Alliance's standing naval group, a permanent reaction force deployed in the Mediterranean. The naval group's current flagship is the German combat support ship \"Bonn.\" Denmark has already said it would provide additional ships to the mission, according to the official. However, it is unclear whether NATO members will approve the mission which may fall outside the bounds of the Alliance's mandate. Complicating matters is a long-running maritime dispute between Greece and Turkey over sovereignty in the Aegean, where the two NATO members' jets regularly engage in dogfights. Turkey has taken in more than 2.5 million Syrian refugees, and is a major transit point for migrants from Asia and Africa. More than a million migrants and refugees reached Europe last year, many making the dangerous boat journey from Turkey to Greece by boat. So far this year, more than 340 have perished in the cold waters trying to reach Europe. cw/msh (AFP, dpa, Reuters)",
        "generated_story": "NATO's Standing Naval Group in the Aegean to combat illegal smugglers The NATO alliance has deployed a special naval force to tackle illegal migrants. Frontex, the EU's border protection agency, has been tasked with dealing with the influx of migrants and refugees into Europe. The deployment comes as the European Union prepares to deploy its new anti-terror force, which will be deployed in Greece, Turkey and Cyprus. It is part of an effort to counter the growing threat posed by migrants, who are increasingly fleeing conflict in Syria, Iraq and other conflicts across the Mediterranean Sea. Last week, German Chancellor Angela Merkel visited Turkey to meet with Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutolgu to discuss the deployment of the new force. \"We have a lot of work ahead of us,\" Merkel said at a press conference in Brussels, adding that she was \"deeply concerned\" about the situation in Turkey. She also said that Turkey had \"a lot to work with\" in terms of how to deal with refugees and asylum seekers, and that it was important for the alliance to be able to cope with these challenges in a way that was not previously possible in other EU member states, she said. Germany, however, said it would continue to cooperate closely with Turkey in its fight against illegal migration, particularly to the north and the south. In addition, Germany and France have also been working together on a joint strategy to fight the flow of refugees from Syria and Iraq to Turkey, according to a statement from the German Foreign Ministry. Merkel's comments came as Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was visiting Germany for a NATO summit, where the two leaders are expected to hold talks on the future of Turkey's borders. Erdogan's visit to Germany on Thursday was seen as an opportunity for Germany to show its support for Turkey as it seeks to prevent the spread of terrorism and extremism in Europe, as well as to strengthen its commitment to combating extremism and terrorism. However, it is not yet clear whether the move will lead to an end to this conflict. On Thursday, Erdogan said he would not rule out the possibility of a military intervention, but that he did not see the need for such an intervention. According to Erdogan, \"I think we will have to wait and see what happens.\" The Turkish president has already made clear that his country will not allow the use of force against its own citizens. He has also called on European countries to step up cooperation with Ankara, saying that Ankara should not be allowed to take part in any kind of confrontation with its neighbors."

Meanwhile, the death toll in Gaza continues to rise. Medics on Monday said the number of Palestinian deaths in Gaza has risen to more than 501 since fighting intensified on Jul 8. Most of the dead are civilians. On the Israeli side, 13 soldiers were killed inside Gaza on Sunday, raising the number of soldiers killed since a ground operation began late on Thursday to 18. Two Israeli civilians also died in mortar and rocket attacks. The Israeli army said that more than 10 militants from Gaza were shot dead on Monday after infiltrating southern Israel.

        "target": "A borderline war The crisis in Syria is in danger of drawing in neighboring countries. Despite the Syrian government's immediate apology, the shelling on the Turkish border has led to concerns about possible escalation. These weren't the first incidents on the Syrian-Turkish border, but the fact that several people on the Turkish side were killed by Syrian shells on Wednesday (03.10.2012) has brought the conflict between the two countries to a new level. It has led the Turkish military to retaliate for the first time. Several people were killed when Turkey shelled Syrian territory. But neither Turkey, which is a member of NATO, nor Syria would benefit from a broader conflict. An adviser to the Turkish president tweeted, \"Turkey has no interest in a war with Syria.\" Volker Perthes, director of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs in Berlin, agrees: \"Assad has no interest in an escalation,\" he told DW. \"That can be seen from the fact that the Syrian information minister apologized and expressed his regret over the victims immediately after the attack on Turkish territory.\" Perthes doesn't think it's likely that the Syrian President, Bashar Assad, wants to provoke Turkey to intervene in Syria. \"That would only accelerate the fall of his regime,\" he said. It's not yet clear who was responsible for the shelling. According to Syria's ally, Russia, it was a \"tragic accident.\" Relationship damaged The armed incidents on the Syrian-Turkish border have been going on for months. According to Amnesty International, some 300,000 Syrians have left their country since the start of the uprising against Assad, and many of them have fled to Turkey. The relationship between the two countries, which used to be close, has deteriorated dramatically, and the Turkish government is now openly supporting the Syrian opposition. \"Turkey is itself a player in the Syrian conflict,\" said Perthes. \"It provides shelter for many refugees and it's through Turkey that supplies come for the opposition.\" NATO has lined up behind Turkey and told Syria to end its \"flagrant violations of international law.\" Call for 'great discretion' The German chancellor, Angel Merkel, has also positioned herself alongside Turkey. \"We call on all parties to show great discretion,\" she said in Berlin. The foreign minister, Guido Westerwelle, declared that everything must be done to deescalate the situation, so that the Syrian conflict did not turn into a conflagration in the region. Indeed, the Syrian crisis is not only spreading to Turkey, but also to Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon. According to Perthes, \"The neighboring countries are partly victims and partly instigators. Jordan too has taken in refugees and supplies the rebels. On the other hand, Iraq has tended to support the government of Bashar Assad.\" Even so, he said, all the neighboring countries had an interest in ensuring the conflict was confined to Syria. Appeal to the international community But the number of Syrian refugees is rising by the day. Ruth J\u00fcttner, a Middle East expert with Amnesty International, believes this will continue in future months. \"It's important that the countries bordering on Syria are supported by the international community in providing accommodation, medical and psychological care and schooling for children,\" she told DW. It's an appeal she directs especially to European countries. The shelling on the Syrian-Turkish border has made it more likely that there will be armed conflict between Syria and its neighbors. According to Perthes, \"It's probably the case that political resistance in Turkey to intervention in Syria is decreasing right now.\"",

He added that the Turkish government would act \"in the strongest possible way\" in order to stop the conflict from spreading to other parts of Syria. DW's Volker Perthes, a German expert on Middle East affairs, told DW that Germany's stance on Syria was not \"troubling at all.\" \"We are not going to react in any way to this situation,\" Westerfeldt said, adding that he was \"very concerned\" about the possibility of Turkey acting against Assad's regime. The chancellor's comments came after a meeting with Syrian opposition leader Bashar al-Assad in which the two sides agreed on a plan to form a coalition to fight against the Islamic State (IS, formerly known as the \"Islamic State\"), which has claimed responsibility for the massacre of more than 1.5 million people in eastern Syria in 2011. On Thursday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that Ankara would stand by Assad as long as he did not use chemical weapons against his own people. However, the chancellor also said she would be open to dialogue with Turkey on the issue, saying that she was willing to discuss the matter with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. She also called on Turkey to step up its support for Assad, who has been in power since the beginning of his term in office.

Although they sent no representatives to Switzerland, Islamists have agreed to halt the fighting. The Islamist-backed militia alliance that took over Tripoli and installed its own government announced a ceasefire on Friday, following a breakthrough in Geneva-based peace talks. Despite not attending the UN-brokered meeting, the militias have agreed to \"a ceasefire on all fronts,\" according to a statement issued by Islamist group Fajr Libya (Libya Dawn). The only condition is that \"the other parties respect the truce.\" The announcement came hours after the United Nations declared that Libya's warring factions had agreed to a roadmap for forming a unity government. Nearly four years after a NATO-backed revolt saw Moammar Gadhafi removed from power, two rival governments each backed by different groups of militias have plunged the country back into chaos and threatened all-out civil war. After the elected government of Prime Minister Abdullah al-Thinni was forced out of Tripoli by Libya Dawn, it was forced to move to the far eastern city of Tobruk while Libya Dawn reinstated the old parliament known as the GNC. The fighting and violence has displaced hundreds of thousands of civilians, left hundreds killed and thousands wounded. Most foreign diplomats fled the country and shut their embassies last year. The Tobruk government, as well as a few other factions who favor a peaceful resolution, came to Geneva to work on \"confidence-building measures,\" which includes the release of detainees from both sides, opening closed ports and securing safe freedom of movement around the country. es/bw (AP, AFP, Reuters)",

The GNC, the country's secret police force, said it had reached the end of a two-day ceasefire in the eastern city of Tobruk. \"We have reached an end to the conflict,\" a statement released by the Libyan government said. It said the ceasefire was reached after talks between the two sides failed to reach an agreement on the fate of Moammar Gadhafi, who was ousted from power in 2011. A UN peace conference in Geneva, Switzerland, was held on Wednesday to discuss the future of Libya's armed forces, which have been fighting for more than a year to restore the former dictator to power. At the conference, a group of armed groups, including the Free National Council (FNC), said they would hold talks on Thursday and Friday. FNC spokesman Abdullah al-Thinni told reporters that the talks had been \"successful\" and that there was \"no doubt\" that a deal would be reached. However, he added, \"There is still a long way to go before we reach a final agreement.\" \"The ceasefire has been reached,\" he said, adding that \"there is no doubt that we are going to continue the peace process.\" The UN has called for a halt to violence between pro-Gaddafi forces and anti-Islamist militias, as well as for the return of the internationally recognized government forces to their barracks in Tripoli, according to a UN report released Wednesday. UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said he would not rule out the possibility of an interim ceasefire, although he did not say whether he was willing to sign a new deal with the militias. He also said that he had not yet decided whether to call for an early withdrawal of troops from the capital, Tripoli."

        "target": "France's conservatives: Combating the National Front with a swing to the right A staunch conservative is joining the race for the French presidency. Republican candidate Francois Fillon could turn into a big problem for right-wing extremist Marine Le Pen's National Front. France's Republicans are moving to the right: by choosing Francois Fillon, voters nominated a presidential candidate who has a reputation as a staunch conservative. The former prime minister has already announced that he intends to refocus politics with the traditional family in mind. Fillon takes a dim view of homosexual couples adopting children. He wants to introduce a cap on the number of refugees allowed into France, he intends to make it harder for foreign nationals to access the social welfare system, and he wants to put Muslim communities and mosques under government control. In addition, Fillon advocates a renationalization of school curricula. Fillon makes gains in FN territory Fillon's agenda could turn out to be a problem for the \"National Front\" (FN). The 62-year-old appeals to similar sentiments as the right-wing party's base: concern about foreign domination and loss of identity, fear of terrorism and crime. \"For a long time, FN was the only political force that addressed those fears,\" said Henrik Uterwedde of the German-French Institute (dfi) in Ludwigsburg. \"Now a politician has arrived on the scene who addresses those fears using a different language and makes them a political offer.\" In rural, Catholic France especially, where traditions still matter a great deal, the avowed Catholic Fillon strikes a chord with his proposals pertaining to family and society policies. He receives support from traditional Catholic groups who, for years, have been able to mobilize crowds for demonstrations against gay marriage. During the intraparty election campaign, Fillon predominantly traveled to France's villages and small towns - regions which FN leader Marine Le Pen had labeled the \"forgotten France,\" regarding herself as their foremost lobbyist. \"Fillon has made gains in an environment that is also canvassed by Le Pen,\" Andreas Jung, Chairman of the Bundestag's German-French parliamentary group, told German broadcaster rbb-Inforadio. \"He does not represent the lofty levels of Parisian politics, but rather provincial entrenchment. Fillon is committed to traditional values, like the family. Therefore, he may not only be capable of defeating Le Pen, but also of taking the lead during the first ballot.\" 'Most dangerous candidate for FN' Consequently, the FN camp is less than enthusiastic about the conservative's candidacy. \"Because of Fillon, we now have a strategy problem,\" Marion Marechal Le Pen, the FN leader's niece, recently told journalists. \"He is the most dangerous candidate for the National Front.\" Pollsters' findings appear to support that statement. Recent surveys establish Fillon as the current favorite in the French presidential election scheduled for next May. However, Fillon's election is not a foregone conclusion. By denouncing the conservative candidate as a member of the establishment, FN tries to win over those who are frustrated with politics and politicians in general. There is persistent opposition against his economic-liberal plans in particular. Fillon wants to abolish the 35-hour working week and raise the retirement age to 65 years. In addition, he wants to cut 500,000 jobs in the public sector and reform industrial law. Fillon is known as an admirer of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. \"Issues pertaining to liberal economic policy have always been heavily contested in France,\" said Uterwedde. \"Fillon's adversaries have already taken up their positions, criticizing what, in France, is called 'ultra-liberalism.'\" That was one of the nastiest words in French politics, he added. An offer for the left Fillon wants to raise VAT by 2 percent. This would predominantly hurt low-income households. Exactly that clientele, however, is wooed by FN with a program that is regarded as rather left-wing. The right-wing extremists are on a clear anti-globalization course, intending to seal off the French economy against foreign countries and exit from the European Union. The party is already trying to present Fillon as a symbol of anarchic, ultra-liberal capitalism. \"Francois Fillon will even go beyond EU demands for austerity and liberalism,\" David Rachline, Marine Le Pen's election campaign manager, wrote on Twitter. According to current polls, it is very likely that Fillon will have to face Marine Le Pen in a runoff election in May. The main hazard for the Republican candidate: his economic-liberal course could deter left-wing voters from choosing the conservative in order to avert Le Pen. \"Francois Fillon will have to start making offers, also to those voters who are closer to the center and more moderate,\" said France expert Uterwedde. \"And he will, prior to the runoff election at the latest, have to make offers to left-wing voters - without changing his original course.\"",
        "generated_story": "Francois Fillon is the most dangerous candidate for the French presidential election, according to the German-French Institute of Politics (Rbb-Inforadio) political scientist Andreas Jung. \"Fillon has a lot to answer for,\" said Jung, who is a professor of political science at the University of Ludwigsburg in the eastern German state of Rhineland-Palatinate. He is also a member of the conservative Christian Social Union (CSU) party, which is backed by the far-right Alternative for France (AfD). Jung said the CSU's candidate, Marine Le Pen, is \"a very dangerous person.\" \"I think he has the potential to become the next president of France,\" Jung told DW, adding that he was \"very confident in his ability to win the election.\" He also said that his party would be able to form a coalition with the right-wing National Front party (FN) and the center-left Socialists (SPD), which are currently in third place in France's lower house of parliament, the Bundestag, with a majority of 1.5 percent. Jung added that the party's chances of winning the presidency were \"incredible\" and that it had a \"strong chance\" of becoming a major force in French politics. But he also pointed out that there were other candidates who were more likely to emerge as the front-runner, such as former French Prime Minister Manuel Valls and former German Foreign Minister Henrik Uterwedde. On the other hand, he said, there was no chance of a third-placed candidate being chosen. The SPD, a conservative party that has been in power since the 1970s, was the only party to have a candidate who could win a second term in office. And it was only a matter of time before it became clear that a fourth candidate would have to step up his or her game. In the end, however, it's not just the SPD that is in danger of losing the nomination. It's the Republicans who are in a position of power, and they are the ones who have the power to change the course of history and shape the future of Europe. They are also the people who will decide whether or not to run for president, or whether they will run again. That's why I think they're going to do the same thing. I don't know if they'll do it again, but I do know that they won't do that. If they do, then it will be very difficult for them to make a decision. There are a number of factors that could affect the outcome of this election. One of them is how much money they have in their bank accounts and how many people they can spend on the campaign. For example, they've got a very large bank account. Another factor could be the fact that many of their supporters are not even aware that their candidate is running for re-election next year. This could also be a factor in how they vote in November's presidential elections. After all, if the polls were to be held on Sunday, that would mean they would not have enough votes to pass the first round of voting. So, what do you think? Do you see a clear winner? What does it say about the current election? Does it mean for you? Is it a good idea to vote for a new candidate? The answer is that you can't just say no. You can only cast your vote if you're the candidate of your party. What's more, you've already voted for your candidate and you'll be voting for someone else. Is that really the case? I'm not sure that's what you want to hear? You know what I mean? Well, I guess it depends on how you feel about it, because you know the results of that vote. We'll see what happens next week. Either way, we'll find out. Let's see how it plays out in Germany. Or, let's say that we have an election next month. Who knows what the candidates will do? Who will win? And what will you do with all the money you have invested in this year's elections? How many candidates are running? That could make it even more difficult to get the job done? It could mean that more people will vote against the incumbent, as well as for those who want a chance to stay in politics for longer than a few more years. A lot of people have already made the decision to enter the race. Many of these candidates, including the leading candidates in both the Republican and Democratic parties, are already running against each other. However, some of those candidates have made a strong impression on me. Some of my friends and family have also made it clear to me that I am not a bad candidate. At the moment, all I can say is, 'I'm a better candidate than you are.' I have no idea what's going on with my own party and I'll have my vote on Saturday, May 13. Whoever wins the second round will probably be an important"

        "target": "Berlin court rules Google Street View is legal in Germany A Berlin court has ruled that Google Street View is legal. But that doesn't mean the lawsuits will end, legal scholars say. A Berlin court has ruled that Google Street View is, in fact, legal in Germany. Last Tuesday, the Berlin State Supreme Court (Kammergericht) announced its decision in a court case from late last year, in which a woman had sued Google, fearing that photos of her, her family and the front of her house would be posted on Google Street View and would thus violate her property and privacy rights. The court ruled that it is legal to take photographs from street level, rejecting her argument that Google was trying to take unauthorized pictures. Part of her argument rested on the fact that Google used cameras mounted at three meters (9.84 feet) high, which could see over her two-meter-high hedge. However, the court did not find this argument convincing, given that the photographs were taken from the street, and not the sidewalk. Furthermore, because Google automatically blurs faces and license plates and did allow Germans to opt-out of the service to have their house obfuscated as well, the court did not find any potential violations. This is the first high-level court ruling, which cannot be appealed any further, regarding Street View since the service debuted in Germany at the end of last year. An ongoing debate Since Google announced plans to launch Street View in Germany last summer, debate around the service has become heated, with some politicians trying to stop it at every turn, while German Chancellor Angela Merkel famously said that she would not remove her house from Street View. In November 2010, the company announced that 244,000 German residents in the 20 cities had chosen to opt out of Street View - less than three percent of residents. However, in Germany and everywhere else, the company also allows people to report abuse, inaccuracies or request that something be blurred using an online tool. \"Our job is to develop services that respect these cultural differences,\" Peter Fleischer, Google's global privacy counsel told Deutsche Welle in November 2010. \"We try to anticipate them. We're all internationally-minded people ourselves. We try to guess how people will react to them. But a lot of these services are new and have never been on the market before, so we learn and we adapt as we go along.\" A 'landmark decision' European legal experts called the Berlin ruling a \"landmark decision,\" saying that this would now become part of German case law regarding property rights. \"Yes, other people are now warned: Don't sue Google simply claiming that Google Street View violates personality [or] property rights,\" wrote Thomas H\u00f6ren, a professor of media and communications law at the University of M\u00fcnster, in an e-mail sent to Deutsche Welle. But, he also warned that this decision was very narrow, focusing on the issue of property rights, and not on the larger issues of data protection from Google. \"The problem of Google Street View - to be honest - has never been a problem of personality rights or property rights, but the enormous risk of personal data compilations in cases where people use Google Street View for compiling personal profiles (such as building insurance companies; future employees, et cetera),\" he added. \"And this risk has not been considered by the Berlin courts.\" Similarly, Viktor Mayer-Sch\u00f6nberger, a professor at the Oxford Internet Institute, agreed that this case was \"limited in scope,\" adding in an e-mail, \"The plaintiff never alleged an actual invasion of privacy, just a potential one.\" Author: Cyrus Farivar Editor: Nancy Isenson",
        "generated_story": "Germany's Landmark Decision On Google Street View In Germany, a landmark decision has been made on the future of the internet. The decision by the Berlin State Supreme Court is the latest in a series of landmark decisions in the country's high-tech landscape. In a decision made public on Thursday, the German state supreme court said that the Internet giant should be allowed to make its way into Germany's public sphere. German Chancellor Angela Merkel is expected to announce the decision in Berlin on Friday. \"We are going to have to wait and see what happens,\" Merkel's spokesman Peter Fleischer said in an interview with German news agency dpa. Read more: Google, Germany: What you need to know about the world's most popular internet search engine Google has announced is that it will no longer be able to offer search results on its website. According to the court's decision, Google will not be permitted to use the site in Germany until at least the end of this year, when the company will be required to do so again. Google said it would be unable to provide any further information about Google's plans for the website, which it said would only be available to those who are willing to sign up to its terms of service. It added that Google would also be prohibited from using its services in other countries, such as the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. This would make Google the first Internet search giant to be banned from the EU, according to a report by Deutsche Welle. A decision on whether to allow Google to market its products to other European countries is likely to come as a surprise to German business leaders, who have long been skeptical of Google\u2019s ability to compete with the likes of Facebook, Amazon and Amazon.com. But the ruling is a welcome development for Google as well as for other companies that are looking to expand their presence in Europe, including Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Google. On the other hand, it is not clear whether the move will have a positive impact on German companies, as it could lead to more jobs and higher wages for German workers. That said, there is still a lot to learn from this decision. For example, if Google were to take over the market share of German internet companies in 2014, that would have been a huge step forward for Germany. However, this is unlikely to happen, given the current political climate. What's more, many companies have already announced that they will stop selling their products on their own. And that's not just because they don't want to sell their services to others. They are also looking for a way out of their current financial difficulties. There is also the question of how much money they can make in order to cover the costs of running their operations, and how many people they'll be working with. These are the questions that will come up in court. If Google is to continue to invest in its own products, then it has to decide whether or not to introduce a new technology that can be used to improve the efficiency and efficiency of its operations. At the same time, they must also make sure that their customers have access to their data, not only their personal information, but also their business information. So far, so good. As far as I know, no one knows what will happen when Google decides to launch its new products. I'm not sure what the next step is. Do you think Google can do with all the money it's investing in? If so, I think the answer is clear: no. You can't do anything about it. Go ahead and do what you want with your own money. Don't give up your money and spend it on something that you've already invested in. Then, you'll never know what's going on in your life, because you won't have any money to spend on a product that doesn't work for you anymore.\" Author: Andreas K\u00fcbler (AFP, Reuters)"

        "target": "UK lawmakers propose jail sentences for reckless bankers A British parliamentary commission has completed its work on the overhaul of the domestic banking sector. Among other things, it proposed jail terms for bankers displaying grave malpractice and causing huge damage. Members of the UK's Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards agreed Wednesday that Britain needed a radical overhaul of its scandal-hit lenders. The panel, which was mostly composed of lawmakers, concluded in its final report that senior bankers must be made personally responsible for malpractice through the introduction of a new criminal offence of reckless misconduct. It would carry a prison sentence. The reputation of the country's banking sector had been damaged in recent years by a string of scandals, including Libor rate-rigging, credit insurance mis-selling and a controversy over staff behavior and bonuses in the run-up to the 2008 global financial crisis. The level of malpractice had been \"shocking and widespread,\" said the commission's chairman, Conservative party lawmaker Andrew Tyrie. RBS cut in two? \"Taxpayers and customers have lost out, and the economy has suffered,\" the 500-page report said. \"Under our recommendations, senior bankers who seriously damage their banks or put taxpayers' money at risk can expect to be fined, banned from the industry or in the worst cases go to jail.\" The commission called for bankers to sign up to a new code of conduct under which all key responsibilities within a bank would be assigned to specific senior officials who would be held responsible. The panel also proposed that more remuneration for bankers should be deferred for longer periods of up to ten years in order to \"reflect the longer run balance between business risks and rewards.\" The commission recommended that the government consider splitting the state-rescued Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) into a good bank and a bad one mopping up toxic assets. The report was published ahead of a key speech by Finance Minister George Osborne on his bank reform plans. hg/ipj (AFP, Reuters)",
        "generated_story": "Reprehensibility of Bank Mafia: A British Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards (PBS) has released a report into the banking industry. The report, published in the British Parliament on Thursday, found that the financial services sector was rife with fraud and corruption. \"The banking sector is riddled with corruption and fraud,\" said Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the PBS committee, which is responsible for banking standards in Britain and the United States. It is the first time that a British parliamentary commission has published its report on the bank mafia and how it has been able to conceal its activities. In a statement released on Wednesday, the commission said it was \"deeply concerned\" by the allegations made against Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), the country's largest lender, and that it had \"serious concerns\" about its ability to deal with financial crises. A spokesman for the committee said: \"We are deeply concerned about the extent to which the banks are operating in a manner that is inconsistent with the standards of banking.\" The commission's report is due to be published on Friday, April 13, at the London Stock Exchange (LSE) in London. Its findings are part of an ongoing investigation into allegations of fraud at RBS, one of Britain's biggest banks, in relation to its handling of money laundering and other financial crimes. According to the report's findings, there was no evidence that any bank had committed any fraud or attempted to commit fraud. However, it added that there had been a \"significant increase in fraudulent activity\" in 2008 and 2009, compared to 2008, when the UK's banking system was at its lowest point in history. This was due in large part to a lack of transparency in how banks were handling financial transactions, as well as the fact that some of its customers were not aware that they were taking part in banking transactions at all. There was also a perception that these transactions were being carried out by a group of people who had no knowledge of what was going on. That is, they did not know that this was the case. They simply didn't have the information they needed to make sure that their customers had access to information that was not being stored in their bank accounts. These people are not the only ones who have been caught up in this fraud, but they are also the ones that are being investigated and prosecuted. And this is not just a matter of whether or not a bank is guilty of a crime or whether it is a criminal act. What's more, these people have a lot to learn from this report and they don't even know what they're doing.\" \"This is something that we are going to have to look at,\" the Commission's chairman, Andrew Taggart, said in an interview with The Guardian newspaper. He also said that he would like to see more information about what is happening with banks and whether there is any evidence to support the claims made by those who are suspected of being involved in these crimes, such as fraudsters and money launderers. But he also pointed out that \"it is very difficult to tell the difference between the two types of banks,\" he said, adding that his committee would be looking into whether the charges against banks that have committed fraud are actually being used as a cover for criminal activity. 'It is extremely difficult for us to know the full extent of these frauds,' he added, referring to them as \"the banking mafia,\" which he described as being \"a criminal organization.\" He said the inquiry's conclusions were \"very important\" and \"not only in terms of financial security but also for financial stability, because it will be very important to ensure that banks do not fall victim to this kind of criminality.\" 'Banking mafia' The inquiry is also looking at whether banks have become more transparent about their activities and practices in order to protect the interests of customers and to prevent them from falling prey to fraudulent lending practices, he told the paper."

        "target": "Party leaders call for increased wages in growing German economy Chancellor Angela Merkel and other top officials have called for upticks in Germany's economy to trickle down to workers in the form of higher pay. But a leading think tank has warned against giving raises too soon. Germany's foreign minister and deputy chancellor, Guido Westerwelle, has added his support to comments made by Economics Minster Rainer Bruederle about increased wages for German workers. \"When the economy grows and this growth is substantial and sustainable, then the benefits of this upswing should be felt by the people who worked so hard for it,\" Westerwelle told the Hamburger Abendblatt newspaper in an interview. Westerwelle heads the free-market liberal FDP, which shares power with Chancellor Merkel's Christian coalition. Earlier this week, Bruederle, also an FDP member, said in light of Germany's currently growing economy, those economic gains should trickle down to employees in the form of higher wages. Merkel, who is also the head of the Christian Democratic Union, supported Bruederle's idea. \"That is something the chancellor sees the same way, letter for letter,\" said Merkel's spokesman, Steffen Seibert. Not so fast Earlier this week, analysts predicted growth of 3.5 percent this year and 2 percent in 2011. Germany's five leading economic think tanks also predicted that the number of unemployed would fall below 3 million next year, the lowest level since 1992. Despite the current rosy outlook for the German economy, not everyone is convinced that a growing economy should inevitably lead to higher wages. The president of the German Institute for Economic Research, Klaus Zimmermann, warned against reacting too quickly. \"I can't support the idea of a general wage increase, I think it is too dangerous,\" Zimmermann said in an interview with the Handelsblatt newspaper. Zimmermann wasn't opposed to the idea of raising wages, but said he was against across-the-board increases for all sectors and pointed out that not every industry is benefitting the same from the growing economy. \"We can't forget that the German economy did not resort to mass lay-offs when it wasn't going so well last year,\" Zimmermann said. Raising wages in some branches could be a good idea, Zimmermann said, as that would make those branches more attractive option to potential workers from outside of Germany.

        "generated_story": "German Chancellor Angela Merkel's Deputy Chancellor, Klaus Zimmermann, is against a general wage hike for German workers. The chancellor's deputy, Rainer Bruederle, said on Thursday that he was against the planned increase. \"I don't see any reason why the chancellor should not be able to do this,\" he said in an interview with the German Institute for Economic Research (DIER) in Berlin. He also said he would not accept a \"general wage increase\" for Germany's workers in the coming months. According to the DIER, the Chancellor is also opposed to an increase in wages for all workers, including those who work for the FDP and the Christian Democratic Union (CDU). \"The chancellor is not in favor of such a hike,\" said the DER's Guido Westerwelle, a professor of economics at the University of Freiburg, in a statement released by the institute. In a speech on Friday, Merkel said she was \"not at all opposed\" to wage increases. But she also called for an end to mandatory minimum wage hikes for workers who earn less than 5 percent of the country's gross domestic product (GDP). The German government has said it will not introduce a wage freeze until the end of this year. On Thursday, German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said that the government was ready to make a decision on whether to increase the wage for low-income workers by 1.5 percent. However, he did not rule out the possibility of a tax increase for high-wage earners, such as women, minorities and those with lower incomes. Chancellor Merkel, who has been at loggerheads with her conservative Christian Democrats (FDP) party over the past few years, has called on the federal government to introduce an income tax on high earners. This would be the first time in German history that a chancellor would have to pay a higher wage than the previous chancellor, Helmut Schr\u00f6der, for example. It would also be a first for a German chancellor to be forced to take a pay cut, according to a report from the think-tank, which has published its own analysis of German public finances since the financial crisis of 2008-2009, and which is expected to last until at least the summer of 2014. That is, if the new chancellor does not sign off on wage rises, it is unlikely that she will sign an extension to her current term as chancellor. She has already made it clear she is willing to give up her post as Chancellor if she wants to stay in office for another five years. Last week, she announced she would step down from her position as finance minister in order to focus on other areas of her government. Her predecessor, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, was also forced out of his post after the election, saying he wanted to return to his previous role as economic adviser. His successor, Thomas de Maiziere, had been in charge of economic research since 2009, when he left the CDU to form his own party. Schreier, however, remained in his position until he took over as party leader in 2013."

Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko was sworn into office on Friday in a lavish ceremony boycotted by Western diplomats. The previous day, the 56-year-old leader openly accused Germany and neighboring Poland of planning a coup against him. \"There were [in Germany and Poland] plans worked out for an overthrow of the constitutional order,\" Lukashenko said in the Belarusian capital, Minsk, on Thursday. \"This is not an invention of our intelligence agencies.\" Lukashenko, who came to power in 1994, was re-elected last month with 80 percent of the vote in what the opposition and international monitors said was a rigged election. Relations between the reclusive Belarusian government and the West have been strained ever since. 'Belarus question must be answered' German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said in a statement that the accusations were \"baseless\" and an attempt by Lukashenko to draw attention away from his own wrongdoing. \"The EU needs to find a clear political answer to events surrounding the presidential election and the continued incarceration of opposition politicians and their supporters,\" Westerwelle said. A wide-reaching crackdown against the regime's opponents followed Lukashenko's re-election. Hundreds of his critics were arrested and dozens threatened with long-term jail sentences. Poland also dismissed the accusations as absurd and said that relations with Minsk would not be normalized unless all political prisoners were released. Sanctions threat The situation in Belarus pushed the European Union to adopt a resolution on Thursday in support of economic sanctions against the country. The threats earned a sharp rebuke from Lukashenko, who promised the \"hardest possible reaction\" should the bloc impose sanctions against his country. At the same time, the Belarusian prime minister, Mikhail Myasnikovich, travelled to Moscow in a effort to shore up Russian support for Minsk during its standoff with the EU. That meeting ended with a Russian promise not to impose its own set of sanctions on Belarus over an unrelated spat over oil exports and a commitment to resume a nuclear power plant project shelved after the 1986 Chernobyl disaster.

Lack of evidence India says it is not bound by the UN convention on refugees as it is not a signatory to the accord, but human rights activists disagree. \"The principle of non return of a person to a place where he will be executed or tortured has become a principle of customary international law which India follows,\" Gonsalves told DW. \"And it has attained the status of 'jus cogens,' which is a principle of law that no country can say is not applicable to it, such as torture and genocide.\" In a communication sent to all states in August, the Home Ministry [interior ministry] said the illegal migrants were more susceptible to terrorist recruitment efforts. But an investigation by Indian broadcaster NDTV found \"little evidence of the government claim.\" The investigation that was carried out at major Rohingya settlements in the country showed little involvement in criminal wrongdoing by the refugees. Lack of any evidence to support the government claim has led to speculations that the Rohingya were being targeted for their religion by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu-nationalist government. \"It is really unfortunate that the government is going back on its commitment to refugees which it has reiterated several times in the past merely because these Rohingyas are Muslims,\" said lawyer Prashant Bhushan, who filed the plea on behalf of two Rohingya men. \"I mean this is clearly a case of religious discrimination and an attempt to arouse a sort of feeling of... an anti-Muslim feeling or try and communalise the situation,\" he told reporters outside the courthouse. The UN's human rights chief last week deplored Indian government's move to deport Rohingya refugees. \"India cannot carry out collective expulsions, or return people to a place where they risk torture or other serious violations,\" Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein said. The Rohingya are an Indo-Aryan people, the vast majority of whom are Muslims. They usually migrate to India through a rather porous border to escape persecution in their native Rakhine state in Myanmar, where they have been denied citizenship rights. They are viewed by the local authorities as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. Myanmar's Buddhist majority is often accused of subjecting them to discrimination and violence. Read more: Rohingya people in Myanmar \u2013 What you need to know The ongoing violence follows an insurgent attack on security forces on August 25 in Rakhine state that sparked off a brutal military counteroffensive. Hundreds of people, the majority of them Rohingya, have been killed in the violence that has seen many homes destroyed and several villages burned down. Myanmar's government maintains the crackdown is part of a counter-terrorism drive, while the UN's al-Hussein has said that it \"seems a textbook example of ethnic cleansing.\"",
        "generated_story": "India says Rohingyas pose 'erious threat' to India The Indian government has accused Myanmar of using violence against Rohingya Muslims to \"enslave\" the country. The country's interior ministry said on Thursday that the Rohingya were being used as human shields by Myanmar's security forces. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was in Jammu and Kashmir to attend the General Assembly meeting of the UN Security Council on Wednesday, said Myanmar was \"seriously threatening\" to the security of India. \"The situation in Rakhine is very serious,\" Modi said in a statement released by his ministry. He also said that Myanmar had used violence as a weapon against its own people. Modi's government said it was working closely with the United Nations to ensure the safety of its citizens. However, India's foreign minister, Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, did not elaborate on the allegations against Myanmar, saying that he was not aware of any evidence to support the claims made by the Myanmar government. India, however, has repeatedly denied any involvement in the violence. Last week, the government of Myanmar announced that it would no longer use the term \"Rohingya\" in its official name, referring to a term used to refer to people who have fled persecution in Myanmar. It is not clear whether India will continue to use this term, or whether it will use it as an umbrella term for other ethnic groups, such as Buddhists, Hindus, Sikhs or Muslims. On Thursday, a top Indian official told NDTV news agency that India had asked the Supreme Court to allow the use of force against the minority community. This is the first time India has asked a court to consider the question of whether or not it should use force to stop the influx of Rohingya refugees into its country of origin. In the past, Indian authorities have said they would not allow it to be used in any way that could be construed as \"aggravated\" or \"unacceptable.\" The government's announcement came after a report from the International Criminal Court (ICC) in New Delhi, which is investigating allegations of human rights violations, found that some Rohingya had been living in India illegally for more than a year and a half, and that they had fled to neighboring Bangladesh, where they were forced to flee their homes. A report by a British-based think-tank called the Centre for Human Rights (CHRR) said the report was based on information provided by an internal ministry document."

Monday's announcement by Pat McQuaid, the president of the International Cycling Union, ratified recommendations in an October report from the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), which ordered Armstrong's Tour de France titles be wiped out. \"Lance Armstrong has no place in cycling,\" said McQuaid. Addressing his remarks to cyclists, McQuaid said the fight against doping was his priority. \"UCI is listening and is on your side. We\u2019ve come too far in the fight against doping to return to our past. Cycling has a future and something like this must not happen again.\" The scathing USADA report included testimony from 11 former teammates, accusing Armstrong of running the \"most sophisticated\" doping program in the sport's history. The USADA said it had collected evidence to prove the seven-time Tour de France winner had engaged in the biggest doping conspiracy to date. Effect on cycling and sponsorship Monday's decision comes as the sport of cycling reels from Armstrong's well-documented fall from grace. Organizers of the Tour de France will be trying to move on from the scandal as the race prepares to celebrate its centenary next year. Sponsors have been deserting Armstrong and the sport in general. Last week, Nike - one of Armstrong's main corporate sponsors - said it was terminating its relationship with the cyclist and accused him of deception. Trek, the company that made the bicycles Armstrong rode to seven titles, announced on the same day it would terminate its sponsorship contract - as did the beer maker Anheuser-Busch. The Dutch institution Rabobank ended its association with professional cycling after the doping allegations came to light, leaving 17 riders in need of a sponsor. Last week Armstrong also announced he would step down from his own charity, the Lance Armstrong Foundation, also known as Livestrong, a move believed to have been intended to limit the damage to the organization from the USADA report.

Armstrong was stripped on Tuesday of the Tour of France and the world's most prestigious cycling event, the World Tour, after he failed an anti-doping test last year. The US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) said Armstrong had failed a drug test and was banned from cycling for life. USADA said in a statement that it had found no evidence of Armstrong's use of a banned substance. \"We have not found any evidence to support the allegations,\" the organization said, adding that the decision was made \"in the interest of transparency and accountability.\" The organization also said it would not comment on the findings of an internal investigation, which was conducted by an independent panel of experts. A spokesman for the IOC, Pat McQuaid, told the Associated Press: \"The investigation is ongoing and we have no further comment at this time.\" Armstrong, meanwhile, said he was not aware of any allegations against him. He said the investigation was ongoing, and that he did not have any reason to believe it was a case of mistaken identity. \u201cWe are not going to comment further on this,\u201d he said.\u201cI have nothing to add to this report. I am not interested in any further information about this case. We have been told that we will not be commenting on any other cases. This is not something that I have seen in the past,\" he added, referring to the case in which Armstrong tested positive for banned substances in 2004 and 2005. In 2005, Armstrong won a world title at the age of 25, when he became the youngest cyclist to win it. Since then, he has gone on to become the oldest cyclist in history, with a total of 14 wins and one defeat. That's a record for a cyclist, but it's not the first time he's had to go through a doping suspension. It's the second time in his career that a rider has to be banned for three years. His suspension comes after the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHS) found that Armstrong failed the drug tests in 2005 and 2006. According to a report from the DHS, Lance was suspended for two years in 2006 and 2007 for failing to complete the tests. At the end of 2006, his suspension was reduced to one year and a half. During the 2007 and 2008 seasons, a number of athletes were suspended or suspended from competing in professional cycling, including Lance's son Lance, who was also a professional cyclist. Lance and his wife, Brittany, were among those suspended in 2008 and 2009 for doping. They were later reinstated in 2009, following a two-year suspension for their involvement in an incident that led to their son's death. An investigation into the alleged doping was launched in 2011. Both men have since been cleared of all charges and are expected to return to competition in 2012. However, it is unclear whether they will be allowed to compete again next year, or whether the suspension will last for at least two more years, if not longer. New rules for cycling are being implemented in order to prevent athletes from doping in their sport. There is also the possibility that they could be suspended if they fail to comply with the new rules, according to an IOC report released on Wednesday.

        "target": "US Supreme Court Justice Scalia dies at 79, setting off succession showdown Justice Antonin Scalia, an outspoken conservative and the longest-serving member of the US' top court, has passed away in Texas. President Obama vowed to nominate a successor 'in due time,' despite political opposition. The 79-year old justice died in his sleep, presumably of natural causes, local media reported on Saturday. Scalia was visiting Texas for a hunting trip, and his body was discovered after he failed to appear for breakfast in the resort where he was staying. US President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama extended \"their deepest condolences to Justice Scalia's family,\" White House deputy spokesman Eric Schultz said. Texas Governor Greg Abbott described the conservative justice as a \"man of God, a patriot and an unwavering defender of the written Constitution and the rule of law.\" \"He was the solid rock who turned away so many attempts to depart from and distort the Constitution. His fierce loyalty to the Constitution set an unmatched example, not just for judges and lawyers, but for all Americans,\" Abbot said. Battle for the empty seat His passing is likely to open a new political front between President Barack Obama and the Republican Party, as Scalia's replacement could shift the composition of the court towards a more liberal persuasion. Several Republican lawmakers have already urged Obama to leave the decision to the next president who will be voted in later this year. \"The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court justice,\" Senate Republican majority leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement, referring to the upcoming November general election. \"Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president,\" McConnell concluded. President Obama, however, said he would fulfill his constitutional duty and nominate Scalia's successor \"in due time.\" \"These are responsibilities I take seriously, and so should everyone. They are bigger than any one party,\" he said. Decades of controversy Scalia joined the Supreme Court in 1986, becoming the first Italian-American to serve in the top judicial body. He was nominated by US President Ronald Reagan. Throughout his long carrier, Scalia voted in favor of privacy and protecting defendants' rights, but also against legalizing abortion, same-sex marriage and gun control. He also drew public attention for his theatrical flair and sharpness of tongue, as well as his alleged unwillingness to compromise. In June last year, the nine-person Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage with a five-to-four vote. Scalia, who was in the minority, commented he would \"hide my head in a bag\" if his own name were associated with the decision. He also said that the majority opinion was \"couched in a style that is as pretentious as its content is egotistic.\" dj/jm (AP, Reuters, AFP, dpa)",
        "generated_story": "US Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia dies in sleep in Texas US President Barack Obama mourned the death of conservative jurist Scalia in his sleep on Thursday. Obama said he was \"deeply saddened\" by the news. \"I'm deeply saddened by this news,\" Obama told a news conference at the White House in Washington, D.C. The US president also expressed his condolences to the family of the late conservative justice, who died in a sleep at his Texas home in the early hours of Thursday morning. In a statement released by Obama's office, the president said: \"We deeply regret the loss of Justice Scalia and his family, and we will continue to do our best to honor his memory.\" The president's statement came a day after conservative Texas Governor Greg Abbott announced that the state's top court justice had died of a heart attack and that he had been suffering from a \"serious illness.\" \"This is a very sad day for our country,\" said Abbott, referring to his state of Texas, where he grew up and where his father was born. He was a staunch conservative who supported the conservative Republican Party's conservative agenda, which included the repeal of Obamacare and the reinstatement of abortion rights for women and minorities, as well as the legalization of same-sex marriage. His death was the first in US history to be confirmed by a US federal court, according to an Associated Press report. Scalia's death came less than a year after his death, when his wife, Susan, was found dead in her bed in their Houston home. She was 53 years old and had served as a federal judge for more than 30 years. Her death marked the end of an era in American jurisprudence that has seen a number of justices die in recent years, including the most recent, conservative Justice Anthony Kennedy. Kennedy, Kennedy and Kennedy were among those to die on the court's bench, but Kennedy was one of those who was most affected by Kennedy's sudden death. John McCain, a Republican presidential contender, said in an interview with the Washington Post that Kennedy died \"in the sleep of his own accord.\" Obama also said that his administration was working to find a replacement for Scalia, saying that it would be \"very difficult\" to fill the vacancy left by his sudden passing. On Thursday, Obama called on Republicans to nominate a new justice to replace Scalia. President Obama has called for an early election in November. A special election is scheduled to take place in mid-December. It will be held on November 6, with a date set for the election of Donald Trump's successor, Republican Senator Mitch McConnell (R-KY). Obama is expected to seek a second term in office in January. Last week, he announced he would not seek re-election for a third term. But he did not rule out the possibility of running for another term as an independent candidate in 2020. That could be a difficult task, given the current political climate in which Republicans have a majority in both houses of Congress and a minority of Republicans who want to run for president. This year's election has been marked by an unprecedented wave of Republican support for conservative candidates who have been in power since the 1980s and 1990s. Many of these candidates have said they would like to see a conservative majority. However, it is not clear how many Republicans will support a candidate who is more likely to win the Republican nomination than the Democratic candidate. Some of them have expressed concern about the prospect of losing the presidential election, while others say they are more inclined to vote for Obama. There is also the question of whether or not Obama will nominate someone who has a chance of winning the general election. What do you think will happen next year? What will the candidates do? The candidates will have to decide whether they want the same candidate or a different candidate? It is up to them to make the final decision. I think it will come down to which candidate wins the primary election and which party gets the majority of votes. If they do, they will make a decision on who will win. And I'm sure the Republicans are going to have an easy time of it. They have already made a lot of progress on this issue. You can read the full statement below. (AP, AFP, Reuters)"

        "generated_story": "My Freiburg: A tour with Tonatiuh Ibarra from Mexico City to Germany The Goethe Institute is a German think-tank that specializes in the study of German literature. It's the first time I've been to the country since I was a student at the university in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. I spent a few days in Mexico, where I learned about the German language and German culture. My first impression of the institute was that it was an interesting place to study German history. But it wasn't to be. In fact, I think it's a bit of a surprise that I got to see it for myself. \"It was really interesting,\" I said, adding that \"it was very interesting to me because I didn't really know much about Germany at all.\" I also found out that there were a lot of similarities between Germany and Mexico. The first was the fact that the two countries share the same language, which is German for \"German.\" The second is that both countries have a common language: German, German and Spanish. And the third is the Latin language. Both languages are very similar in that they both have very different languages, so I'm not sure what they mean by that, but I do know that German is very much a language-oriented country, and I like to think of it as one of those countries where you can learn German from a very young age. That's why I went to Mexico with my father, who was born in Germany in 1887. He's now a professor of philosophy at Germany's prestigious German university, the Max Planck Institute for the Study of Literature (MPI), and he's been studying German since he was 12 years old. On his first trip abroad, he took me on a tour of his home country of Germany. His first stop was in Berlin where he met his wife and their two children. They've since become close friends and have become good friends. Now, they're going to spend the rest of their lives together. There's also a chance that we can get to know each other a little bit better. We'll see how it goes from there. After all, we've all been there before, right? And we all know how important it is for us to have an understanding of our country and its people. So we're really excited about this trip. What do you think about it? I don't think we'll be able to say much more than that. This trip will be interesting for me, because it will give me an opportunity to learn more about my German background and how I can better understand the language of my country. You'll have to wait and see what happens in my own country before you decide what you want to do with your life. If you're interested in becoming a teacher, you'll need to take a look at my books. Then I'll tell you what to expect from me. For now, let's just say that my book is not for you.

        "target": "Opinion: The pope's impossible mission in Mexico Pope Francis's trip to Mexico is a dangerous mission - a diplomatic as well as political balancing act, one that brings with it enormous expectations. Francis won't be able to meet them, says DW's Astrid Prange. Dead prisoners, disappearing students, refugees shot dead and murdered priests. Mexico has lived through one violent episode after the other. The mood in the nation is explosive. And now this: just a day before the pope is set to arrive, more than 50 people died in the largest prison revolt in the country's history. What meaning does the pope's presence hold on such an occasion? Only one thing is certain: Francis won't be able to resolve the problems of the world's second largest Catholic nation in just a five-day trip. The unrealistic demands placed on him are not something he can fill. Yet the pope carries with him an important message: you don't have to love your enemies but you do need to speak with them. And he's living the example himself by meeting with the Russian Orthodox Patriarch Kirill on a stopover in Cuba on his way to Mexico. Cuba all over again It's sensational! Bannings and mutual ex-communications are ancient history. Nearly a millennium after the split, the head of the Roman Catholic Church and the head of the Russian Orthodox Church are speaking to each other. It's not as if the two will become friends - their positions are far too different. Yet their centuries-old enmity feels out of place and in view of the massive worldwide persecution of Christians, almost unchristian. And both of these church leaders know this. In Mexico, efforts to stem the polarizing forces at play in society have not been successful. The extreme differences between rich and poor are dividing Mexican society. President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto has prioritized economic growth over dialogue with his critics - a group which includes students as well as teachers and union members who regularly protest against government policies. They demand an end to lawlessness and corruption. The presumed murder of 43 teaching students in Iguala in September 2014, a crime which remains unsolved, stands as a symbol of the lawlessness sweeping Mexico. The recent mutiny in a Monterrey jail serves as further proof of the country's shortcomings in regard to human rights and the rule of law. With a visit to Ciudad Juarez and the largest prison in Mexico, Francis will only make that deficiency more transparent. Even the pope of peace has enemies. The route he's chosen to take on his travels through the country has displeased the staunchly Catholic president. A meeting with the relatives of the Iguala victims is therefore hush-hush and participation in a holy mass remains secret. Considering the tense situation in the country, it's still possible that the pope's route will change once again. The church in the pillory Even within his own church, Francis has met with opposition. A meeting he requested with victims from the church's abuse scandal will not take place - a bitter disappointment for many former seminarians who were abused by Marcial Maciel, the founder of the Legion of Christ, and members of his order. It's just one example of how impunity continues even within the church itself. None of the perpetrators have yet to answer for their crimes in court. It appears as though the pope has accomplished more on the world stage than he has brought on reforms to the Vatican. Despite the revolutionary coming together of Cuba and the US and the revolutionary meeting with Patriarch Kirill, the revolution in Rome has yet to materialize. Do you have something to say? Add your comments below. The thread to this editorial closes in 24 hours.",
        "generated_story": "Mexican pope's impossible mission in Mexico The Vatican has announced that Pope Francis will travel to Mexico next week. The announcement comes as Mexico's president, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, is expected to visit the country's capital, Ciudad Juarez, on Sunday. \"The pope will visit Mexico,\" said the Vatican spokesman, Marcial Maciel, adding that the pontiff's visit was \"unprecedented.\" \"It's a very special trip for the pope,\" he said in an interview with DW's Astrid Prange, referring to his visit to the capital last year. He also said that he would be visiting the city of Iguala, where he will meet with the Roman Catholic Church's bishops, priests and laypeople, as well as the Mexican state of Monterrey, which is part of the Catholic archdiocese of Mexico, according to a Vatican document released on Friday. In a statement, the church said it had \"no doubt\" that Francis' visit would lead to \"significant changes in the way the Church sees the world.\" The statement came after a visit by Pope Benedict XVI, who is due to arrive later this week, to Rome, Sicily, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece and the Czech Republic. It was the first Vatican visit since the end of World War II in 1945, when Pope John Paul II visited Mexico. During the visit, Francis was accompanied by his wife and two children. On the trip, he also met with a delegation from the Legion of Christ, a Russian Orthodox church, and a group of Roman Catholics. They were also invited to attend a reception at the cathedral in Rome. But they were not allowed to see Francis. Instead, they had to wait for him to return to their native country of Chiapas. That's when they began to talk about the possibility of a papal visit. After all, this is the same pope who has been visiting Mexico for more than two decades. And he has a lot to say about Mexico: \"I don't know about you, but I know that you're going to be here for a long time,\" Francis said. His visit came as a surprise to many who had been expecting a pope to appear at his inauguration ceremony. However, many of them were surprised to learn that his trip was not a one-off. Many thought he was visiting a foreign country, such as Germany, France, Canada or the United States, or even the Soviet Union. This is not the case at all. There is no such thing as an \"uncertain future,\" as it is in Latin America. What's the point of this trip? The pope has already made it clear that it's not his mission to make Mexico a better place to live and work in. If he wants to stay in office, then he'll have to do it in a way that makes it easier for other countries to come to him. As a result, it will be more difficult for Mexico to keep up with its growing economic and social problems. More than a year ago, there was talk of him becoming the next pope. Now there is speculation about whether or not he might be able to take over the papacy in his own country. Last year, however, President Enrique Pena Nieto said he wanted to step down from his post as head of state in order to focus on his domestic agenda. A year later, his successor, Felipe Calderon, took over as prime minister, leaving the post of vice-president. At the beginning of his second term, in May, 2015, Penca Nieto was sworn in as president of Argentina. Since then, though, Mexico has undergone a number of major changes, including a major overhaul of its electoral system and new electoral laws. Most of those changes have been made to reflect the changes that have taken place in recent years. For the most part, that has meant a change of government and that is a good thing, because the new president has made Mexico more attractive to foreign investors. So far, so good. I think he's doing a great job of making Mexico an attractive destination for investors and investors, even if he doesn't have the money to spend on a new car. You can see the results of that by looking at what's happening in other Latin American countries. Some investors have already bought into the idea that Mexico will become a more stable and stable economy. Others have expressed interest in taking a closer look at how the economy will fare in coming years, especially if the peso crisis worsens."

According to the CPT's 24th General Report, released on Wednesday, reprisals were carried out against prisoners in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Greece, Hungary, Moldova, Russia, Spain, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and Ukraine. \"Intimidation or retaliation against persons the CPT has interviewed may not only violate their human rights but also strikes a blow to the preventive mechanism established by the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture,\" CPT President Letif H\u00fcseynov said in a statement. \"I urge national authorities to respect their obligation to prevent, investigate and punish such actions.\" The report also highlighted several problems with the detention of juveniles around Europe, and proposed a series of practical measures to protect young people's rights when detained. Ad hoc visits The little-known CPT, now 25 years old, represents a unique approach to international torture prevention. A team of specialists make roughly 180 visits a year to all kinds of detention centers (including prisons, police stations, holding centers for immigration detainees, psychiatric hospitals, and even social care homes) all across the 47-member Council of Europe - one of the few international blocs that offer platforms for dialogue with Eastern European regimes considered to have poor human rights records, such as Russia, Azerbaijan, and Ukraine. The method combines the carrot of talks with government officials and the stick of ad hoc visits, which all members are committed to allowing into their prisons. Once inside, the CPT also has the right to interview any detainees it chooses - in private, though of course the detainees have the right to refuse. \"The first thing to say is how important the CPT is,\" said Carla Ferstman, director of Redress, a UK-based organization that helps torture survivors. \"As a result of their boot work over a very long period of time, the UN has set up a global system which in many ways mirrors the approach of the CPT.\" But given that the committee has no powers to enforce its proposals to governments, there are question marks over its effectiveness. \"In the report, they complain about how some of the recommendations they've made have not been implemented,\" said Ferstman. \"It's a sign that they're a little bit frustrated.\" But in the long run, she maintains, the CPT has more than proved its value. \"The dialogue that they are able to have is really important,\" she said. \"Looking long-term, they have been very effective.\" CIA collusion, asylum seekers The CPT's report comes a day after Amnesty International released its own report on European collusion with the CIA's torture program. While the CPT's report examines more prosaic day-to-day mistreatment, rather than mass rendition of terrorist suspects at the behest of the US, there are obvious links between the two, since some countries - such as Poland, Macedonia, and the UK - are highlighted in both reports. \"What is finally coming out in all of this is that the Europeans, despite all the criticism of the Bush and Obama administrations on the use of torture - so many of them connived,\" said Judy Dempsey, senior associate at Carnegie Europe. \"It's really a double standard. This report is quite damning and quite shameful, and it follows the Amnesty International one as well.\" The CPT's work also mentions the mistreatment of asylum seekers, a problem increasingly afflicting European countries that take in the largest number of asylum seekers - particularly Spain, Italy, and Greece. \"With Greece there are two things to remember,\" Dempsey told DW. \"A - the appalling situation of the prison system, and B - the lack of training among police of how to deal with asylum seekers. Awful things have happened. Parallel to this is the illegal detention centers. There have been lots of cases of terrible mistreatment over the last several years.\" \"Immigration detention is a growing issue,\" added Ferstman. \"In the UK, there was a whole parliamentary inquiry into one immigration detention center, where some of the women alleged that guards propositioned them in order to get quick treatment on their claims. Each country has its own history of torture.\"",

        "target": "Dresden marks 70 years since massive Allied bombing Seventy years ago, Allied bombers attacked Dresden, killing tens of thousands of people, the majority of them civilians and refugees. Every year, the East German city remembers its dead. DW's Naomi Conrad was on hand. As the tram trundled through Dresden's drab suburbs on Friday morning, a prim, elderly woman suddenly turned to her friend sitting on the seat beside her: \"You know, my mother never told me about the bombings.\" She shrugged, then, after a moment's pause, continued. \"It must have been such unspeakable hell that she just couldn't talk about it,\" the woman said. She was referring to February 13, 1945 - the morning, exactly 70 years ago, when Allied bombers swooped down on an unsuspecting city famous for its baroque architecture and that, until that point, had survived the war mostly unscathed. That was to change in the course of three dreadful days: As the bombs rained down on the city, its churches and palaces were turned to rubble. Up to 25,000 people - many of them refugees fleeing the advancing Soviet Red Army - died in the inferno that raged in the city for days. \"There was nothing left, nothing,\" a frail, bent man with a checkered cap recalled, \"just rubble and death.\" He was leaning on the balustrade of a viewing platform in Dresden's old gasometer, staring down at the 360-degree painting by the Iranian-German artist Yadegar Asisi; sirens howled from hidden speakers and strobe lighting illuminated the ruined churches and black smoke billowing from the burnt skeletons that were once buildings. The man swallowed, his voice hoarse, barely audible: \"It's so hard being here.\" The soundtrack and images, he said, \"bring back too many memories.\" 'So, so many dead' He was 15, he recalled, working on a school essay when the sirens began to wail. He never finished the essay. Instead, he ran for shelter with his family. When they returned home three days later, the roof had been blown off, the windows smashed. \"But we were lucky: We survived,\" he said. \"There were so, so many dead.\" His voice broke and, muttering an apology, he shuffled off. The bombings were intended to break the German population's morale - a decision that to many was incomprehensible, given that the war had long been decided and Dresden's economic and strategic importance was relatively minimal. Consequently, the death and destruction wreaked by the Allied bombers quickly became a tool, first for the Nazi propagandists in the last months of the war, then by the East German regime for its anti-West propaganda, and then later by neo-Nazi groups, who traditionally congregate on February 13. Even today, \"the debate continues about guilt and innocence, even about the exact number of victims,\" Dresden Mayor Helma Orosz told a packed audience, including delegations from abroad, gathered for a memorial service in the city's Frauenkirche, which in 2005 was rebuilt with the help of private donations after Germany's reunification, many of them from the United States and Great Britain. Call for peace \"War, hatred and violence begin in people's minds,\" Orosz said. \"We must resist any attempt at once again categorizing people based on their origin and skin color,\" she added, referring to what has often been described as a right-wing catchall movement called PEGIDA, generally translated as Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West, which has taken to the streets in Dresden since October. Later, on a platform overlooking thousands of people, many of them wearing white roses as a sign of peace while bracing the icy cold outside the church, Orosz called on Dresden to remember every victim of the Nazi terror - a plea that was reiterated by German President Joachim Gauck when he took to the microphone: \u201cWe don't want the pain that people suffered here to be misused by others.\u201d Behind him, the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, who, back in the Frauenkirche, had talked of the \u201cmiracle that peace in Europe represents,\u201d leaned in closer to his interpreter. Then, as evening fell over Dresden and church bells tolled, thousands - possibly as many as 10,000, according to the city's press office - lined up along Dresden's riverfront, holding hands to commemorate the dead and call for peace as police men dressed in black riot gear looked on. \"I can remember it all,\" Siegfriede Leonhard, a vivacious woman in her late 70s said. She was 7 when the bombs fell, she said, and had been coming to the commemorations in Dresden \"for at least 60 years.\" Sometimes, she said, stomping her feet to keep warm, she wondered whether she shouldn't remember at home, alone. \"",
        "generated_story": "German city of Dresden hit by Allied bombings The German capital Dresden was hit on February 13, 1945, by a series of Allied bombing raids. The bombing of the city's Frauenkirche took place during World War II. German Prime Minister Joachim Gauck was in Dresden at the time. He was visiting his wife, Naomi Conrad, and their son, Yadegar Asisi, when he heard about the bombing. \"I was very shocked,\" he said, adding that he had never heard of such an attack before. His wife and son were also in attendance, as were their two children. They had just returned from a trip to Germany, where they had been staying with their father and mother. Their son was also staying at home with his mother and stepfather. In the days following the bombings, the German government began to press for an end to the Cold War, which had begun in 1939. During the war, Germany was heavily dependent on the Soviet Red Army for its military support in the Middle East and North Africa. It was the first time that Germany had ever been attacked by an enemy force outside the borders of its own borders. Germany's defense minister, Helma Orosz, said in a statement that the attack was \"not an act of war.\" \"It was a provocation,\" she added, \"but it was not a threat to our national security.\" The attack on Dresden came just days after the Berlin Wall collapsed, killing more than 1,000 people and injuring hundreds of thousands more. On February 14, 1943, Dresden suffered another bombing attack, this time by the Allied forces. At the same time, a German police officer was killed in an air raid on an apartment building near Dresden's main train station. Two other officers were wounded, one of them critically, while the other was seriously injured. Both men were taken to hospital in critical condition, according to eyewitnesses, who said they were treated in intensive care, but that their injuries were not life-threatening. More than 2,500 people were killed and thousands of others were injured when the bomb went off. Many of those killed were civilians, including a woman and a child. A number of other victims were children and young people, many of whom were in their 20s or 30s. One of these victims was an elderly woman who had suffered from breast cancer. She died of a heart attack when she was just a few months old. Her body was later found in her apartment. Another victim was her son. Author: Andreas K\u00fcbler (dpa, AFP)"

        "target": "Experts: Taliban have not changed strategy with Kabul restaurant attack The weekend attack on a Kabul restaurant frequented by foreigners came as no surprise to international organizations on the ground. Experts don't believe the Taliban have changed their strategy to target more civilians. Dramatic scenes must have played out in the restaurant: Guests sought cover under tables as a group of terrorists shot wildly into the dining rooms. News agencies report the restaurant owner tried in vain to fend off the attackers. He was among the more than 20 people who perished, most of whom were employees at international organizations. The attackers were also among the dead. During the evening dinner rush, at 7:00 p.m. Friday (17.01.2014), one of three Taliban members detonated his explosives-laden vest and blew a breach in the highly secured restaurant. Neither the man-high blast walls, nor the secured access points with armed guards could stop the attackers. The two remaining terrorists were killed later in a firefight with security forces at the scene. No change in Taliban strategy The suicide bombing on the popular Lebanese restaurant, Taverna Du Liban, in the high-end Kabul neighborhood of Wazir Akbar Khan was the worst attack so far in 2014. Afghanistan votes for a new president in April; and the international troops are scheduled to withdraw from the country by the end of the year. Although there are plans for a small contingent to remain in Afghanistan, President Hamid Karzai first has to sign a bilateral security agreement with the United States. But he continues to play for time. In this context, the Taliban may be targeting civilians more in order to drive out not just the military coalition, but the entire international community. Yet \"as horrible as this incident is, I don't see a change in strategy,\" said Thomas Ruttig, the co-director of the Afghan Analysts Network. Similar attacks have also been launched before, \"at least 12 to 15 times in the past eight years,\" Ruttig said. The worst attack was in 2012 at Qargha Lake, a popular weekend destination near Kabul. More than 20 people were killed, all of them Afghans. Extensive security precautions The Taliban, which normally doesn't miss an opportunity for fiery rhetoric, hasn't declared a change in strategy. A spokesman for the Islamist militant group said the attack was retaliation for a NATO airstrike in Parwan Province, a few kilometers north of Kabul. According to an assistant of the Afghan president, seven children and one woman died in the coalition strike. \"You have to carefully monitor the security situation,\" Nils W\u00f6rmer, head of the Konrad Adenauer Institute in Kabul, told DW. \"But I think it's a bit early to talk about a change in [Taliban] strategy.\" W\u00f6rmer's office lies just a few hundred meters from the site of Friday's attack. He could clearly hear the explosion, which shook the window panes in his office. \"It was immediately clear to me that something had happened,\" W\u00f6rmer recounted. But the Konrad Adenauer Institute was prepared. \"We had a relatively concrete warning in the last week related to our neighborhood, and we were very cautious,\" W\u00f6rmer said. He met with colleagues in his secured office. Like most of the international organizations, the Konrad Adenauer Institute is also integrated into the security networks. \"The security precautions are high,\" W\u00f6rmer said. \"But that doesn't exclude the possibility that something similar could happen again.\" But the Afghan security forces have succeeded in preventing many attacks in the past few months, he said. Kabul residents criticize Taliban An informal, impromptu poll by DW's Kabul correspondent, Hussein Sirat, suggested the Taliban are not winning Afghan hearts and minds with such attacks. \"Wherever the Taliban have killed civilians, they have not achieved their goal,\" said Mirwais, a pedestrian in the Kabul city center. Idris, another Kabul resident, seconded Mirwais' sentiment. \"The Taliban intimidate the people so that the security agreement won't be signed,\" he said. \"But the people won't bend to this intimidation.\" How the international organizations adapt to the tense security situation in Kabul will come after many conversations, analyses, and briefings in the following days. But W\u00f6rmer is not thinking about giving up. \"We have a clear agenda and long-term projects, which I considered to be very sensible,\" W\u00f6rmer said. \"I am of the opinion, as I was before, that what I'm doing here with the Konrad Adenauer Institute is worth the risks.\"",
        "generated_story": "Afghan Analysts Network: The Taliban haven't changed their strategy with the Kabul restaurant attack The Afghan government has not changed its strategy in the wake of the deadly attack on a restaurant in Kabul, according to Afghan analysts. \"The Taliban are not going to give up,\" said Nils W\u00f6rmer, a researcher at the Konrad Adenauer Institute in Parwan Province, Afghanistan. He added that the Taliban \"are not giving up.\" \"They have not given up on the fight against terrorism,\" he said, adding that \"they will continue to fight for their own interests.\" The Kabul attack came just a day after the country's president, Hamid Karzai, announced that he would step down from his post as prime minister to take over the reins of power in his own country. The announcement came hours after a Taliban attack that killed at least 30 people in a hotel in central Kabul on Sunday. Afghan officials said the attack was carried out by a group of gunmen who were planning to attack the restaurant, which was located in Qargha Lake, near the Afghan capital, Kabul. A Taliban spokesman, Wazir Akbar Khan, told the AFP news agency on Monday that his government had \"no plans\" to make a change in its approach to Afghanistan's political and security situation. However, he added, \"We have no plans to change our strategy at this point. We will not change what we are doing in Afghanistan.\" A spokesman for the Kandahar province government, however, said it was \"not a strategy that has changed at all\" and that it would not be possible to do so without the support of Afghan security forces. In a statement, the spokesman also said \"the government is committed to the security and stability of Afghanistan, and we will work closely with our Afghan partners to ensure that this is not a result of a lack of cooperation between the government and the militant group.\" But he did not elaborate on what he was referring to as the \"Islamic State\" (IS) or \"Taliban\" group, saying only that they were \"trying to undermine\" the president's ability to form a government. According to a source close to Khan's office, there was no immediate comment on whether or not he had changed his strategy. An official statement from the Ministry of Defense (MoD) said that there had been no change of strategy, but that a \"new strategy\" was still in place. It was not immediately clear whether the new strategy would be followed by the withdrawal of troops or the return of civilians to their homes. Author: Thomas Ruttig (AFP, AP, Reuters)"

        "target": "Teabag filter cleans water with nanotechnology A new water filter developed in South Africa could provide millions of people with clean drinking water. The filter, about the size and shape of a teabag, would be inexpensive, easy to distribute and simple to use. Marelize Botes is conducting a final set of tests on a new type of diminutive water filter before industrial production can begin. The microbiologist pours water from a plastic bottle though a high-tech, teabag-sized filter before analyzing it in her in her laboratory at the University of Stellenbosch in South Africa. \"The filter is much cheaper than bottled water as well as any other filter on the market,\" she told Deutsche Welle. Instead of being filled with black or green tea, the bag contains active carbon granules and is made from nanofibers treated with biocide, which kills bacteria rather than simply filtering them from the water. Nanotech for pennies \"This project takes nanotechnology to the poorest of the poor people who live in this world, and it will make a difference in their lives,\" said Eugen Cloete, who in addition to inventing the filter is dean of the faculty of science at Stellenbosch University and chair of Stellenbosch University's Water Institute. With some 300 million people in Africa - and over a billion worldwide - living without access to clean drinking water, the need for such a filter is huge. When in mass production, the developers said they expect the teabag to cost just a few South African cents (under half a US cent and under a third of a euro cent). In addition to being inexpensive, Botes said, the filter is also easy to distribute to rural area and simple to use as it can be place in an adapter that fits on nearly any regular-sized plastic bottle. Each filter can clean one liter (one quart) of the most polluted water to the point where it is completely safe to drink. Once used, the filter can be disposed of and is biodegradable. African countries, led by Somalia, Mauritania and Sudan, were ranked to have the most vulnerable water supplies, according to a June report by UK-based risk consultancy firm Maplecroft. Decentralized use The filter's small size and light weight make it ideal for rural areas where other means of filtration do not exist, Cloete said. \"It is simply impossible to build purification infrastructure at every polluted stream,\" Cloete said. \"So we have to take the solution to the people. The water is cleaned right then and there when you drink from the bottle.\" The filter is now undergoing testing by the South African Bureau of Standards, after which Cloete and his team hope it can be rolled out to the United Nations and non-governmental organizations that have expressed interest in it by the end of the year. The project grew out of research into larger filters, according to Cloete. \"We were busy developing filters for larger applications, but when you do the tests in the labatory you do the tests on a much smaller scale,\" he said. \"The results we were getting on a smaller amount of water promoted me to think about a smaller application.\" Author: Joerg Poppendieck, Sean Sinico Editor: Anke Rasper",
        "generated_story": "South Africa launches Teabag-sized water filter for decentralized drinking The South African Bureau of Standards (BOS) has announced plans to introduce a new system of water filters for decentralised drinking in the country. The new technology, which is being developed by the University of Stellenbosch, is expected to revolutionize the water supply in South Africa. According to a report in Deutsche Welle, the technology could revolutionise the way people drink water. \"It is the first time in Africa that water has been used in a decentralized manner,\" said Botes, who heads the BOS Water Institute in Johannesburg, adding that the system would be able to meet the needs of more than 1.5 million people. It would also be possible to use water from the same source as the existing system, he said. However, it would have to be tested in order for the new filter to work properly, according to the report. In a statement released on Thursday, BBS said it was \"very encouraging\" to see the results of the project, but cautioned that it could not be replicated in other African countries, such as Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe and the Republic of Congo (RoW). \"We are very hopeful that this technology will be applied to all water supplies in this country, and we will see how it will work,\" the company said in an emailed statement. 'We have a lot of work ahead of us to do to make sure that we are doing the right thing for our people.' The company also said that they were working closely with the government to develop a water-saving system that would allow people to drink their drinking water without having to pay a fee for it. This would enable them to reduce their water bills by up to 30 percent. But it is not enough for everyone. We are not going to allow this to happen, because we don't have enough money to cover the costs of this system. That is why we have been working on this project for a long time.\" The project is part of a broader effort to improve water quality and reduce the use of fossil fuels and other energy-intensive sources of energy, including coal, oil, gas and nuclear power. While the idea of decentralizing water use is still a controversial one, there are a number of ways in which it can be done. One of them is to provide water to people who have no access to electricity, for example, or for those who do not have the means to buy electricity. Another option is for people in rural areas to purchase water directly from a supplier. There is also the option of buying water at a lower cost, as opposed to buying it at the wholesale price of $2.50 to $3.00 a litre. A third option, however, would only be available to those in urban areas with low-income households. And that's not the only option. For those with incomes of less than $5,000 a year, this could be a problem. As a result, many people are unable to afford to live on their own, so it's a good idea to invest heavily in renewable energy sources, like solar power and wind energy. At the moment, solar energy is more expensive and less reliable than fossil fuel-based sources. Solar power is cheaper and more energy efficient than coal and oil. So, that means that people can live off their savings, rather than relying on fossil-fuel-fired power plants for power generation. Energy efficiency is a key factor in reducing the cost of electricity and energy consumption, says Marelize Bote, a researcher at Maplecroft in Cape Town. She says that solar-powered power has become more efficient and environmentally friendly in recent years, with more people living on the grid and using it for electricity generation and for water conservation. Nevertheless, she says, \"Solar power still has a ways to go before it has the potential to become a reliable source of power.\" \"I think that is something we need to look at,\" she adds, pointing out that there is no way of knowing for sure, given the current state of global energy prices. Sustainability is an area of concern for many South Africans, especially those living in poverty and in poor areas, where the economy is suffering from low growth and low commodity prices are the main concern. Despite the high costs associated with electricity production, SADI is optimistic about the future prospects for energy production and that energy efficiency will continue to grow. I think this is one area where we can make a positive impact on energy demand and improve the quality of life in developing countries. You can find more information here.

It's very easy and the best bit is, it can be reused. Maybe it will come back to you on your birthday. 1. All you need is a piece of fabric big enough to wrap your gift, a ribbon long enough to go right around it, and if you want to make a gift tag, you will also need a piece of old cardboard, a hole punch and another small piece of ribbon. Ready? 2. No, wait, we forgot the present. Get that, and you have everything you need. Spread the fabric on the ground and put your gift on top 3. Fold the fabric around the gift you are wrapping 4. With the last little bit, you don't tuck it under, but create a little flap on top 5. Fold that flap over like this 6. Take one end of the parcel and tuck the fabric inside, BEHIND the gift inside 7. You can take your time to wiggle it all inside. Make it as flat as you can 8. Once it is all inside, turn to the other end and do the same thing again 9. When you have done both ends, it should look like this. Your present is all tucked up inside and you don't need any tape to keep it closed 10. Now for the ribbon. Place the gift on top of it 11. Tie the bow 12. So it looks like this. Finished? If you want a gift tag, that comes now. If you don't you're done! 13. Cut a piece out of an old cardboard box and make a hole in it using a hole punch. Watch your fingers though ;) 14. Put a piece of short ribbon through your hole 15. Tie the tag to your gift 16. And you are finished! P.S. You can either ask your friend to reuse the fabric, and show them how to wrap with it, or if they don't like that idea, you can take it home with you to use again the next time. And remember, you don't have to buy the fabric. You can use an old pillow case, an old t-shirt or skirt, or whatever you want. You can even make your ribbon from an old t-shirt if you don't have any.

How do you wrap it in plastic? Learn how to do this in a way that doesn't involve the use of paper. \"Wrap the present,\" says the author of a book on wrapping presents. The book is titled \"Wrapping presents with Paper and Tape,\" and is written in English. It is based on the concept of \"wrap presents,\" which is a term used in the textile industry to describe products that are made from materials such as plastic, paper and tin foil. In the book, it is called \" Wrap presents\" and describes the process of wrapping a gift with a paper towel, a type of plastic wrap that is commonly used for wrapping gifts. This method is also known as \"wrapping gifts,\" because it can be used as a form of packaging. Wrapping a Christmas present is one of the most common forms of wrap for gifts, but it also has a lot of other uses. For example, wrapping Christmas presents is an easy way to make sure that the presents are wrapped in paper rather than plastic and that they don't have to be glued to the wrapping paper to keep them from falling apart. However, this method can also be very difficult to use, as the paper is often too thick and the tape is too thin. To wrap presents, wrap them in tape and then wrap the package around a piece of cardboard. You can use a tape measure to measure the thickness and shape the material. If you want to see how long the wrap will last, you can do it on your own. That's what I did with my present. I wrapped it with tape so that it wouldn't fall apart when I opened it up. After all, I didn't want it to look like this. But I wanted to show you how easy it was for me to unwrap presents without the need to tape them down. And that's how I ended up with this present, which was wrapped around my finger. Now I'm going to give it a try, and I think it will be a great gift for you, because you'll be able to wear it for years to come.\" \"This is the first time in my life that I've wrapped presents using tape,\" I said, adding that this was a very important step in making sure I was using the right material for the project. As a result, the packaging is much easier and more flexible than it would have been if I had just used tape or paper tape on my gift wrap, so I decided to just use tape instead of using plastic. What I found was that tape was very easy and easy to put in place. There was no need for any kind of glue or glue on it. When I put it together, all I could do was wrap my hands around it and wrap around the edges. Then I used my fingers and fingers, then I just wrapped up the gift and wrapped everything up, leaving it all over the place.\" It was then that my mother and grandmother would tell me that she was so proud of me. They were both very happy with me, she said. She said that her mother was the one who gave me this gift because she loved me so much. My grandmother was always so happy to help me wrap gifts for my grandchildren. Today, my grandmother is still alive and well and she's still very much a part of my family, even though she has Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Her grandmother died a few years ago and my father was diagnosed with cancer when he was in his early 20s. Since then, her grandmother has been very ill and has died of cancer and her father has always been a patient patient of mine. He died in her sleep. His wife, who was also a nurse, died last year and his son is now a professor at the University of California, San Francisco, where she worked for many years. Their daughter was born in 1957 and they have a son who is currently living in California. Both of them are now in their 70s and 80s, with the same age as I am. So, they are very old and their father died when they were very young. All of their grandmother's gifts were given to them by their mother. One of her favorite things about her was to have them wrapped and given them to her as gifts to my granddaughters. These presents were made by her in-laws' home. A few weeks ago, we received a package of presents from a friend of hers that had been wrapped into a plastic bag. We received them at her house in New York City. At the time of his death, his wife and stepmother were expecting him to take care of all the family's needs and wants to continue to live with them. With the exception of one gift left over from his father, their daughter and mother were also expecting their son to receive a new gift from him. 'The gift was made with her."

        "target": "European court overturns law requiring German-language skills for spouse visas The European Court of Justice has overturned a German law requiring foreign spouses from certain non-EU countries to take a language test before receiving a visa. The ruling primarily affects Germany's Turkish minority. The European Union's highest court on Thursday ruled in favor of a Turkish citizen, who was denied a visa to live in Germany with her husband, because she was illiterate and therefore unable to demonstrate basic German-language skills. According to the court, a lack of language skills shouldn't automatically lead to the rejection of an entry visa application. Instead, Germany must consider the unique circumstances of each individual case. The court went on to say that quickly granting visas for spouses improves the quality of life and promotes the integration of foreign residents. Specifically addressing the case of the Turkish plaintiff, the court ruled that the rejection of her visa had violated a bilateral treaty between Turkey and the EU. In 1970, Brussels and Ankara agreed not to tighten their residency laws for each other's citizens. Law only applies to some In 2007, Germany introduced the requirement that spouses from certain non-EU countries must demonstrate a basic grasp of German before being granted a visa to live in Germany with their husbands or wives. Spouses affected by the law are required to obtain a basic language certificate from recognized centers, such as Germany's Goethe Institute, proving that they have an A1 level, or \"Beginning German\" language ability. The German government claims that the goal of the language requirement is to prevent forced marriages as well as marriages made simply for the sake of obtaining a visa. Citizens of European Free Trade Association (EFTA) member states are exempt from the language requirement. That includes Iceland, Lichtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. In addition, citizens of Australia, Canada, Israel, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea and the United States also don't have to demonstrate German-language skills. slk/xx (AFP, AP, dpa, KNA)",
        "generated_story": "European Court of Justice overturns Turkish language skills law A European court of justice has overturned a Turkish law requiring spouses to learn to speak Turkish in Germany. The court ruled that the law violated the rights of spouses and children of Turkish nationals living in the European Union (EU). The decision by the EU's highest court in Brussels came as a result of a dispute between Germany and the Turkish government over a German-language law. In a ruling published on Thursday, the court said it had \"no jurisdiction\" to rule on the case. \"The law does not apply to Turkish spouses of German nationals who live in Belgium or the Czech Republic,\" the ruling said. It also said that it did not have the authority to impose a ban on Turkish-speakers in other EU member states, such as the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia and Slovakia. However, it said the decision was \"in the interests of the German people.\" The ruling is the latest in a series of cases in which German and Turkish courts have ruled in favor of stricter language standards for spouses, children and their spouses. Last year, German courts in Strasbourg and Brussels ruled against the new law, saying it violated German law and was not in line with European standards. A German court, however, rejected the appeal of one of Germany's top court judges, who had ruled earlier this year that a similar law had been in place in Austria, Austria and Switzerland. According to a statement from the Goethe Institute in Berlin, \"the law is not binding on German citizens, but it is in accordance with the principles of European law.\" It was the first time that an EU law has been overturned by a court. Read more: European courts overturn Turkish marriage law The EU has rejected a request by Turkish authorities to ban the practice of using Turkish as an alternative to German marriage terms. But the Commission for European Integration (ECI) has also rejected an appeal by German Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) party, which had opposed the bill, to allow for the use of Greek, Turkish and German language in marriage. This is a first for a European country, and it will not be the last for many years. That's why the ECI has called for an end to the debate over the issue. There is also a question of whether or not it should be allowed to take place at the same time as marriage and family reunification, or whether it would be a good idea to do so in order to ensure that spouses are able to communicate with each other and that their children can learn the language fluently and effectively. At the end of last year's referendum, EU leaders voted to pass a law that would have allowed for marriage to resume after two years of marriage without the need for language training. After the referendum in June, European leaders said they would continue to push for such a measure in future. They also called on Germany to introduce a new language curriculum for all EU citizens living abroad, as well as for those living outside the bloc's borders. Germany, for example, has already introduced a version of its own language-learning system, called the \"language skills curriculum,\" which is aimed at improving the understanding of foreign languages and promoting the development of new languages in its member countries. On the other hand, Turkey has yet to implement this new curriculum, although it has made progress in recent years in many areas, including the introduction of Arabic, French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish."

Freiburg scored an extra time goal to squeak out a victory against Hoffenheim. Bayern Munich cruised to a 3-0 victory at home against Bavarian rival FC Nuremberg on Sunday, closing the German soccer tables for the weekend. Striker Mario Gomez got things going in the 10th minute for Bayern and also scored the final goal in the 75th minute off a corner kick from Franck Ribery. Ribery came on as a substitute five minutes earlier, making his first appearance for the team since injuring his ankle in September. Near the end of the match, Gomez had an opportunity for his third goal on a penalty kicked but missed. Thirty points at break Phillipp Lahm successfully converted a penalty kick in the 57th minute to round out the scoring for Bayern. The victory for Bayern moved them into sixth place in the table with 19 points and has continued a slow shift in momentum following a rough start to the season. Bayern coach Louis van Gaal said after the game he hoped his team would have 30 points by the end of the first half of the season in five more matches. Cisse saves win for Freiburg In Sunday's other Bundesliga match, Senegal striker Papiss Demba Cisse broke a scoreless deadlock with a goal in the 91st minute to give Freiburg a 1-0 win over Hoffenheim. Cisse has now scored 10 goals in 12 games and is currently the Bundesliga's second highest scorer. The win moves Freiburg into fourth place in the table with 21 points, one ahead of Frankfurt in fourth and three behind Bayer Leverkusen and Mainz, in second and third place, respectively. Nuremberg drop to 10th place with 18 points at the end of a very tight middle group. Just three points separate Nuremburg from Freiburg. Hoffenheim also have 18 points but are two places ahead of Nuremberg in eighth place on goal difference. Author: Matt Zuvela (dpa, sid) Editor: Sean Sinico",
        "generated_story": "Bayern Munich 3-0 Hoffenheim: Papiss Demba Cisse seals 3rd Bundesliga win for Bayern Munich in the first half of the Bundesliga on Sunday. The Senegal international scored his first goal for the club since he was released by FC Nuremberg in January 2015. He was sent off for a second time in as many games this season after suffering an ankle injury in a 1-1 draw with FC Cologne in midweek. On Sunday, the 23-year-old scored the only goal of his career, a header that set up a goal by Mario Gomez. In the second half, he put the ball into the net, but the goal was not enough to seal the win. It was only his second goal since returning from injury, and it was his third in three games. \"It was a great moment for me,\" he said, adding that he would like to see more goals in his next two matches. Bayern have a lot of work to do to get back to the top of their Bundesliga table. They have to make sure that they don't let the pressure get to them too much. That's why I'm so happy with the result. I think it's a good sign that we're back on track. We've got a long way to go before we can really get the results we want,\" said Franck Ribery, Bayern's coach at the time. But it will be a while before they can get on the right track again. After all, they've been playing so well for so long that the last few games have been a bit of a letdown for them. And that's not to say they're going to give up on their star player, who has been on a tear since the end of last season. There's no doubt about that. If they do, then they'll be able to move on to something else. For now, though, it is up to Bayern to find a way out of this mess and get a better result than they did last year, when they were relegated from the German top flight. This time around, there's more to play for. You can see the difference between the two teams in terms of quality and the quality of players who can contribute to a team's success. At the same time, you can also see how important it can be to win a match like this one, especially if you're playing in front of your own home crowd. So, we'll see what happens when you play against the best team in your league, because we know how good you are at this level of football and how much you want to improve on your game.\" \"I'm really happy that I got the job done, I really am happy to be playing for my club,\" added the midfielder. 'I can't say enough good things about my team.' \"But I can tell you how happy I am about the way we are as a result of all the hard work I've put in this week.\" The German side are in good spirits after their win over Cologne, where they have won their last three matches in all competitions and are on course to qualify for next year's Champions League round of 16. Last week's win against Cologne was their first in four years and they are looking to bounce back from a 2-2 draw against Freiburg on Saturday. However, that doesn't mean they won't be back in action next week, as they already have two games in hand. A win at Cologne would be an important step forward in their quest to reach the next level in Germany's top division, which they hope will see them reach their goal-scoring potential again this year. Facing relegation, Cologne are also in danger of losing their top two spots in next season's Bundesliga, although they could still make a strong push for that position in 2017-18, if they win the league title in 2018-19."

They were originally arrested for taking photographs of restricted areas. Slovak citizens detained by the Iranian authorities on suspicion of taking photographs out of bounds have returned home, said Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico. Eight people in total were arrested in May after taking photographs of restricted areas. A Slovakian news website said the group was detained near the central city of Isfahan, where Iran has nuclear facilities. The six that have been freed attended a news conference held by Prime Minister Fico in the capital, Bratislava on Sunday. Fico told reporters that the government was working to secure the release of the remaining two paragliders who are stiil in custody. \"Negotiations were fair and their result is the release of six out of eight detainees,\" Fico was quoted as saying on the government's website. He added that Slovakia had not made any \"financial commitments\" in the negotiation process. Detainees 'unaware' of rule-breaking One of the released paragliders, Vladislav Frigo, said the group did not break any rules it was aware of. \"We had information that there was a ban on taking photographs below the height of 2,300 metres. We were taking pictures from higher (altitudes),\" said Frigo. He added that the detainees were well treated, had access to television, a refrigerator and could cook for themselves as well as getting regular meals. Foreign nationals accused of spying In recent years, Iran has levelled accusations of espionage against both foreign nationals and Iranians. Two U.S. citizens - Josh Fattal and Shane Bauer - were sentenced to eight years in jail for spying after being arrested while hiking along the Iraq-Iran border in 2009. They denied espionage - neighbouring Oman helped secure their release in 2011 by posting bail of 1-million US dollars (756,000 euros). Last year, Iranian-American Amir Hekmati was sentenced to death for spying for the CIA, but judges overturned the decision and ordered a retrial. lw/ipj (Reuters, dpa)",

The release of the six men and two women is the latest in a series of arrests in Slovakia over the past few weeks. Slovaker paragsider Josh Fattal was among the first to be released by the authorities on Tuesday, after being arrested in Isfahan, Iran, earlier this week. He was one of a group of men, women and children who were taken into custody at the airport in Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia's easternmost province. They were released after a brief period of detention, but were later released again on Wednesday, according to a court document. \"We are still waiting for the results of our investigation,\" the document said, referring to the investigation into the men's alleged involvement in an attack on an Iranian diplomatic mission last year. It also said that the two men were suspected of plotting to overthrow the government and that they were being held by Iranian authorities in order to gain access to information about the country's nuclear program, which is also known as the Iran-Contra program. In addition, they are accused of planning a terrorist attack and of attempting to assassinate the head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization (AAEO). The charges stem from an incident in which a man and a woman were arrested and charged with attempted murder and other offenses. A court decision on the charges is expected later this month, and the case will be heard in court on Thursday. Slovakia has said it will continue to cooperate with the probe, although it is not yet clear whether the arrests will result in any charges being brought against the three men or whether they will face charges of espionage.

        "target": "French presidential debate does little to woo undecided voters This year's French presidential race is perhaps the most closely watched election in recent history. Many voters are still undecided, including those in the Paris caf\u00e9 where DW's Jake Cigainero saw the latest TV debate. Just over two weeks ahead of the first round of voting in France's presidential election, all 11 candidates met for the second televised debate of the campaign. It was the first time in the history of French elections that the entire official ballot shared a television stage. This race for the Elysee is perhaps the most closely watched election in the history of the Fifth Republic in view of conservative candidate Francois Fillon's embezzlement charges, the deterioration of the left, political amateur Emmanuel Macron's surprise surge to the top, and the rise of Marine Le Pen's National Front. With so much media attention on the five main candidates, Tuesday's debate felt almost like a consolation for the six other candidates rarely in the spotlight. For French voters watching the televised debate at Cafe des Phares on Place de la Bastille, the saturated stage kept the candidates from detailed discussion of pressing issues. For those who are still undecided, the debate did little to bring them closer to choosing their pick for president. Vincent Couronne, a researcher, said it was good to see candidates who don't get as much media attention. However, 11 candidates at once for the political spectator was overkill. \"It wasn't very interesting. It's just one position after another. There's no real debate. It's not like when it was just five candidates.\" Boredom all round Charlotte Theuvenin and her friends, all students in their early 20s, tuned out early on from boredom and exasperation. \"It was too flat and too hypocritical. Fillon and Le Pen play with our money, then say they did nothing and that they are good for our country,\" she said. As though addressing the candidates in front of her on the TV screen, she added, \"How dare you talk about being president when you use our money for your own interests.\" Le Pen had come under fire over accusations that she misused public funds to pay bodyguards as parliamentary assistants. Francois Fillon of Les Republicains, meanwhile, is under investigation for allegedly paying family members more than 1 million euros ($1.1 million) for government work they never carried out. Frequently casting a blank stare at his opponents, Fillon also seemed bored, or at least more subdued compared to the first debate. Couronne said, \"Fillon seems to be not there. Probably because he knows all the small candidates can attack him on the criminal offenses he's accused of.\" Debate watchers cited Europe as the most important issue of this election, with many fearing Le Pen's promise to tear France out of the European Union in a so-called Frexit. Though no one at the cafe vocally supported Le Pen's plan, several acknowledged the EU is a pressure point for France. \"France's place in Europe in relation to Germany is a very important issue,\" said student Thibault Cirier. \"The general problem is France has lost its influence at the European level over the years, and that needs to be remedied, because France is one of the founders of Europe and should have a strong place in the union. The EU is also important for cohesion and to have a strong position internationally.\" Caf\u00e9 viewers say no to Le Pen Cirier was initially excited by Macron when he launched his campaign, but ultimately decided there was no substance. Now he says he will probably vote for far-left candidate Jean-Luc Melenchon. Kevser Taspinar also said she liked Melenchon for his fighting spirit and that \"he throws barbs.\" As a practicing Muslim who wears a headscarf, she said the most important issue for her is laicite, France's state institution of secularism. \"For me Hamon has the best interpretation of this. Maybe Hamon,\" Taspinar said hesitating. \"I'm still undecided, because there's Melenchon.\" Another viewer, Marie Dubois, said that although she really liked Melenchon, she had definitively decided on Macron. \"Melenchon has a way of putting humanity in politics and giving hope,\" she said. \"But Macron is the only possible candidate.\" With polls putting Le Pen and Macron in the second round on May 7, the undecided voters at this Paris cafe said they were certain which candidate they would not for vote for in that scenario. \"Definitely Macron. There is no way I am going to vote for Le Pen,\" Theuvenin said. \"I will never vote for that woman or Front National, no matter who is running against them in the second round.\" Tuesday was the final debate for Macron and Melenchon, two of the crowd-pleasers among the candidates. Both have pulled out of the third debate on grounds that it cuts too close to the first vote just two days later on April 23.",
        "generated_story": "French presidential candidate Jake Cigainero: 'No, No' French presidential hopeful Francois Fillon is no longer a candidate for the French presidency. He's now a member of the far-right National Front (FN) party. \"I'm not going to run for president again,\" he told DW in an interview published on Thursday. The FN candidate is running for a second term in the presidential election, and is expected to win the first round of polls on Sunday. French President Emmanuel Macron, who is seeking re-election next year, is widely seen as the front-runner. But he's not the only candidate who's running against the FN. In his interview with DW's Kevser Taspinar, France's political editor, French journalist and political commentator, he said he was \"very happy\" with Macron's victory, adding that he \"would like to see a change of direction\" in his party, which is currently in third place in opinion polls in France and has a majority of more than 40 percent of votes in national elections this year. However, the party's leader, Jean-Luc Melenchon, has yet to announce his candidacy. On Thursday, Macron announced he would not run again until the end of his term as president of France, a position he has held since he took office in May 2015. His campaign has been dogged by allegations of sexual harassment and sexual assault against his wife, Marie Dubois. Macron has repeatedly denied the allegations, saying he is \"not interested in politics at all.\" He has also denied allegations that his campaign manager, Thibault Cirier, was involved in any sexual misconduct allegations against him.

And the news was good -- most of the numbers were down compared to the preceding year. Germany's streets were never particularly dangerous, but according to the Interior Ministry, they are now safer than at any time since statistics have been collected. Reported criminal offenses on the whole dropped by 1.4 percent over 2005 -- to a total of just over 6.3 million. \"The statistics show reductions in crime among children, adolescents and teenagers, as well as adults,\" said Sch\u00e4uble. He added that criminality among foreigners living in Germany also fell, saying that this development reflected Germany's efforts to integrate non-Germans. Drugs offenses were down 7.8 percent, followed by theft and street crime, which both declined by four percent or more. Youth violence Vandalism, on the other hand, was up 5.9 percent. Fraud rose slightly, as did violent crime -- among young people by an alarming 4.5 percent. Berlin Interior Minister Erhart K\u00f6rting said that was part of a decade-long trend in Germany. \"As many experts have pointed out,\" K\u00f6rting said, \"the potential for violence in society is increasing.\" The head of the German Police Officers' Union Konrad Freiberg also said those figures showed that German society was not truly getting safer. Frankfurt tops most-dangerous list Crime was down in Frankfurt am Main, but it's still the German city with the greatest number of criminal offenses person 100,000 people. Hanover was a close second, followed by D\u00fcsseldorf, Bremen and Berlin. The total percentage of criminal cases solved by German police also improved slightly from 55 to 55.4 percent.

        "generated_story": "Germany: The State of Crime In Germany The state of crime in Germany has become a \"state of the Union,\" according to Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, the country's finance minister. The German government, which has been in power since 1933, has come under increasing pressure from the international community to clamp down on crime. In a speech delivered in Frankfurt am Main on Thursday, Schahuble said that Germany's crime rate had fallen to its lowest level since the end of World War II. \"We are in a very difficult situation,\" he said, adding that he was \"deeply concerned\" by the rise in the number of crimes committed by law enforcement officers. He also pointed out that there was an increase in violent crime across the whole of Germany, and that this was due to the influx of young people who were fleeing war and persecution, particularly during the war years. However, he added that it was not the result of a lack of cooperation between police and security forces, but rather that the situation had become more complex and more serious. This is not to say that police are not doing their job. There is a lot of work to be done in this area. For example, there is the issue of how to deal with the rising level of violence against women and children. That is why we have to work very hard to tackle this problem. We need to make sure that we are doing everything we can to prevent this from happening again. And that is what we're going to do.\" The government is also working on a plan to strengthen the anti-terror law. It has already begun the process of introducing new laws that will make it easier for police to track down and arrest people suspected of violent crimes. But it is still not enough to solve the problem of sexual assault and other crimes that have been committed in recent years, such as rape, murder, robbery and even murder. So far, police have not been able to find a single person who has committed such a crime, even though they have arrested hundreds of people. They have also been unable to stop the spread of hate speech and hate crimes in other countries, including the United States, France, Spain, Italy, Portugal, Greece and the Czech Republic. These are just a few examples of what the government has in store for the future. What's more, it's not just the police who are trying to catch criminals and make them pay. As a result, they are also looking for a scapegoat, someone who is willing to pay the price for their crimes and who knows what they will do if they don't do something about it. If that person is guilty of something, then it will be someone else's fault, not their fault. How do you respond to this crime? Do you know what you're doing? You can't just say, 'I'm a victim of this' or \"I didn't know you had a partner in crime,\" but you can tell by looking at the pictures on the screen. You cannot just look at a picture of someone with a knife and a gun and say: \"That's what I'm doing.\" That's the way it looks at it, right? How can you tell if you are a member of society and not a perpetrator? The answer is that you have a responsibility to act on your own. I think that's a good thing, because it gives you the opportunity to think about what's going on in your life and how you feel about yourself and your family and friends. Is this something that can be solved? Is it something you do as a person or as an individual? Does that make you a responsible person? If so, what is your role in society? What are the consequences of your actions? Are you doing the right thing? Did you take a risk? Can you think of anything that could help you solve your problem?

        "target": "All or nothing for Bayern in Champions final Bayern Munich have one last chance to salvage a season that has otherwise been marked by their inability to beat Borussia Dortmund: a win against Chelsea in the Champions League final at their home stadium. All season long, Bayern Munich have been consumed with achieving one goal: reaching the final of the Champions League, held at their own Allianz Arena in Munich, and raising the trophy in front of their home fans. After finishing a distant second place to Dortmund in the Bundesliga and dismally losing to them 5-2 in the German Cup final, Bayern Munich are in a must-win situation Saturday against Chelsea. A loss would be the final straw in a disappointing season for a team that can't stand second place. A win for Bayern would mean redemption, to some extent, for their shortcomings in the league. Key players were rested down the stretch in the Bundesliga, especially before the two legs of Bayern's European semifinal against Real Madrid. That was an indication that Bayern had given up on the league and put all their eggs in one basket, hoping for a big payoff with the Champions League title. The same can be said for the German Cup final against Dortmund: true, Bayern essentially beat themselves by making mistake after mistake, but Bayern could, if they win Saturday, wipe the slate clean. Saving the season Win this match, and all will be forgiven in Munich. Lose, and it will be Bayern's second straight season without a piece of hardware, not to mention the heartbreak of losing the biggest match at Allianz Arena since it opened in 2005. \"We must not even think about [losing],\" said Bayern's Franck Ribery on Thursday. \"If we win the Champions League, then we can forget about not winning the league or the cup, nobody will care about that.\" Bayern are a team that thrives under pressure, and the high stakes of this match will be good for them. Chelsea are a team that showed in their semifinal upset of Barcelona that they can rise to a challenge, even if that challenge is simply holding on against a superior opponent. \"We are not the favorites of the game, we are playing away,\" Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech said on Thursday. \"It is very rare when you have the home team playing in the home stadium, using the home dressing room, so I think the advantage goes to Bayern Munich because of that. But we know we have a chance and we will fight for it.\" But this match will come down to the team that can better take advantage of holes that have been blown in each team's defense due to injuries and suspensions. Filling the gaps Between the two sides, seven starting players will miss out on the final. Chelsea saw Raul Meireles, Ramires, and Branislav Ivanovic each get their third yellow card in the second leg against Barcelona, and captain John Terry was given a straight red. Terry and Ivanovic are fixtures on Chelsea's backline, which was already at half-strength due to hamstring injuries suffered by Gary Cahill and David Luiz. Chelsea coach Roberto di Matteo hopes those two are fit enough for the final, since Chelsea will need all the help they can get in the back. For Bayern, David Alaba and Holger Badstuber - both defenders - and Luiz Gustavo, a defensive midfielder, are also suspended for picking up three yellow cards. The impact of the suspensions will hit Chelsea the most. In addition to a weakened back line, Meireles and Ramires are mainstays on offense, supporting strikers Didier Drogba or Fernando Torres. With Ramires out, Drogba could start as striker, with Torres moving to the wing. At any rate, there is more uncertainty in The Blues' lineup than there is in Bayern's, who will be able to rely on striker Mario Gomez and the dynamic-duo of Arjen Robben and Ribery on the wings as they have all season. Most of the question marks will still be defensive for both teams, but to think that this is an indication of a high-scoring affair on Saturday would be a discredit to both team's last lines of defense. Between the posts Neither side would be competing in the final if it wasn't for the heroics of the teams' keepers. Cech defended against wave after wave of attacks from Barcelona in the semifinal for Chelsea, and Manuel Neuer showed nerves of steel in Bayern's penalty shootout in the final leg against Real Madrid, blocking penalties from Madrid stars Cristiano Ronaldo and Kaka. Chelsea's best shot will be to come out of the gate at a sprint and gain an early advantage against Bayern, who will be doing everything they can to keep their long-cultivated dream-final in their control. Otherwise, Bayern's determination to salvage their season may be enough to carry them through to the trophy ceremony - at home, just like they planned it.

        "generated_story": "Bayern Munich beat Borussia Dortmund to reach Champions League final Bayern Munich have beaten Real Madrid 3-0 in the German Cup final on Sunday. The Bavarians are the favorites to win the Bundesliga title for the second time in three years. They have already secured a spot in next year's final, which will be played at the Allianz Arena in Munich. Bayern have a chance to make it three in a row, but they will have to wait until the end of the season to see if they can pull off the feat. That would be a very difficult task for Bayern, who have never won a major trophy in their history. But they have plenty of time to work on their game plan, and that is what they are aiming for. After all, they've got a lot of work to do before they get to the final. And that's not to say they don't have the talent to compete with the likes of Manchester United, Manchester City, Barcelona and Bayern. It's to be expected that Bayern will do well in this competition, especially in Germany, where they face a tough task to get into the top four. \"We're not going to give up,\" said Raul Meireles, Bayern's head coach, in his first match in charge of a club that has been struggling for a few years to find the right balance in terms of quality and consistency in its attacking game. In the last two years, the club have been able to build on the success of their first-ever Bundesliga championship, winning the league in 2006 and 2007. Last year, however, it was Bayern who won the title, beating Barcelona 2-1 on aggregate. This time, though, that was not the case, as Bayern had to rely on a combination of good and bad performances from their midfielders to keep the ball in front of its goal-scorer, Andreas Granic, to score the winning goal. On the other hand, there was a lack of consistency from the attacking side, with only a handful of clear-cut chances. Not to mention the fact that they didn't play as well as they would have liked to have had the opportunity to. At the very least, their defensive frailties were on full display and they had a good chance of getting the job done. However, a bit of luck was in store for them, because they were playing well enough to take the game to Barcelona. Their goal came after a couple of minutes of extra time and the goal was well-deserved by the home side's keeper, Franck Ribery. A few minutes later, Gernot Kolasinac put Bayern ahead with a header that put them ahead of Barcelona's Diego Costa and set up a goal that could have given Bayern the lead. With two minutes left, Rufus Giroud fired a shot past the keeper to put the match out of reach. He was the first Bayern player to hit the crossbar in over a year and a half, scoring just one of his three goals in all competitions. His first goal for his club came against Barcelona on Saturday, when he was sent off for an ankle injury in an attempt to save his side from a potential penalty shoot-out with Barcelona goalkeeper Luis Robles. More importantly, he scored a free kick that sent Bayern into a tailspin, giving the visitors a 1-2 lead at half-time. There were also a number of other Bayern players who were injured in Saturday's game, including the team's leading scorer, Andre Schuerrle, on loan from Barcelona, after the Spaniard's return from injury. Coach Carlo Ancelotti, meanwhile, has said that he is \"very optimistic\" about the outcome of Sunday's match, adding that \"it's a great opportunity for us to move on from this situation.\" \"I'm very optimistic that we can get the result we want,\" he said. 'I think we'll get it right.\" That's what I'm hoping for from Bayern this weekend, too. I think they'll be very happy with what we've done so far. We'll see what happens next. What do you think will happen next week? I'd like to know for sure. How long will it take to achieve that goal? It depends on how many points Bayern can score. You can't tell, for example, if you're a Bayern fan or whether you've been watching the matches on TV. If you want to stay in touch with your friends and family, you can always contact me on Twitter and Instagram, or on Facebook.

He allegedly possessed and exchanged \"a large quantity\" of child pornography. A high-ranking Vatican diplomat will face trial in the Holy See on charges of possessing child pornography in the US and Canada. Catholic priest Carlo Alberto Capella was indicted on Saturday after a Vatican investigation found he had allegedly possessed and exchanged \"a large quantity\" of child pornography during his diplomatic posting. His trial will start on June 22 in front of a Vatican magistrate. If convicted, he could be sentenced to between one and five years in prison and fined between \u20ac2,500 and \u20ac50,000 ($2,100 to $42,000). He is being held in the city's police barracks. Read more: Australian archbishop becomes most senior cleric convicted of hiding abuse Diplomatic immunity The monsignor was recalled from the Washington embassy after US authorities alerted the Vatican to his alleged crimes and requested his diplomatic immunity be stripped. The church rejected the request and withdrew him in September to face investigation at home. Shortly afterwards, Canadian authorities issued an arrest warrant for allegedly possessing and distributing child pornography while visiting a church in Canada. The Capella case has hampered the Catholic Church's attempts to move on from its myriad of pedophile priest scandals. There has been particular focus in recent months on the Chilean branch of the Catholic Church ignoring and covering up of child abuse by pedophile priest Fernando Karadima during the 1980s and 1990s. Pope Francis wrote a letter to Chileans last week expressing \"shame\" for the affair despite previously defending one of the main alleged offenders behind the cover-up. The Vatican's third-highest ranking official, Cardinal George Pell, is facing trial in Australia on abuse-related charges. aw/kms (AFP, Reuters, dpa)",
        "generated_story": "Capella to face Vatican probe for distributing child pornography Pope Francis has ordered Chilean Catholic priest Carlo Alberto Capella, who has been accused of sexually abusing children, to appear before a Vatican grand jury. The Vatican said on Thursday that the Chilean priest had been charged with sexual abuse of minors. Vatican spokesman George Pell said in a statement that prosecutors had opened an investigation into the allegations. \"The Vatican has opened a criminal investigation of the accused priest,\" Pell told the Vatican news agency. Pell also said the charges were \"inappropriate\" and \"unacceptable.\" \"This is not the first time that a priest has come to the attention of a paparazzo,\" he said, adding that \"it is a very serious matter.\" The charges stem from a complaint made by former Chilean Cardinal Fernando Karadima, a former Vatican official who is now a professor at the University of California, San Diego. In a letter to Francis, the pope said he was \"deeply troubled\" by the accusations and that he \"would like to make sure that we do not make any further progress in this investigation.\" In the letter, Francis also called on the Catholic Church to cooperate with the investigation, which is expected to last until the end of this year. He also urged the church to provide a \"consensual and transparent\" explanation for the alleged abuse, saying that it was not a crime to abuse children. A Vatican spokeswoman said Francis had not yet decided whether to press charges against the priest, but said that if he did, it would be \"very serious\" for him to be found guilty. Francis' announcement came a day after Vatican investigators said they had found no evidence of any wrongdoing in the case. On Thursday, Vatican Secretary of State for Human Rights, Cardinal Thomas Aquino, announced that Vatican prosecutors were looking into allegations of child abuse and sexual exploitation of children under the age of 12. Aquardo said his office had received a report of \"serious allegations\" about the abuse. Catholic bishops in Chile, Australia, Canada and the United States have also been investigating the matter. But Vatican officials have yet to rule out the possibility of charges being filed against a Chilean church priest for allegedly distributing sexually explicit material to minors, including a video of an altar boy and a child being sexually abused by a man in his 20s. Last week, Chilean Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni announced he would step down from his post as Vatican secretary of human rights following the scandal. Pope Benedict XVI has also ordered the resignation of two Chilean bishops who were convicted of sex abuse in 2006 and 2007. Both bishops, however, rejected the idea of resigning their posts as part of Vatican efforts to strengthen the Church's role in safeguarding children's rights. They have been under pressure to do so for years, and they have not done so. At the same time, they are also under increasing pressure from the US and Canada to step up their anti-child abuse efforts. This year, US President Donald Trump has called for an end to sex-trafficking investigations into alleged pedophilia and child sex trafficking in order to protect children from exploitation and abuse by priests and bishops. Trump's announcement also came as a surprise to many Chileans, many of whom have grown up with a Catholic faith and are now Catholics themselves. Many of those who have become Catholics in recent years have begun to question whether or not their faith can be trusted to stand up for their beliefs and stand for what they believe in. Some have even accused the Pope of being a pedophile, while others have accused him of spreading false information about their own faith. Others say that they don't believe he is guilty at all. According to a recent report in The New York Times, \"Pope Francis is calling on Chile's bishops to take action against pedophiles and other sex offenders who are suspected of having sex with minors.\""

The money is to come from the Russian pensions system. Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov unveiled a plan Monday aimed at creating a \"multi-billion-dollar\" funding vehicle for companies hit by Western sanctions. Moscow-based news agency RIA quoted Siluanov as saying that the emergency fund would be set up next year with money originally earmarked for the State Pension Fund and leftover funds from this year's budget. According to RIA, Moscow was planning to devote \"at least 100 billion roubles\" (2 billion euros) to the fund, which will mainly be aimed at helping cash-starved Russian banks and key oil companies. \"These 100 billion roubles will be added to the reserve next year, which will allow us to help companies,\" RIA quoted Siluanov as saying. \"We are planning to create a reserve of significant size.\" Just last week, the European Union and the United States imposed a third round of sanctions on Moscow for Russia's involvement in the Ukraine conflict. The latest sanctions target the Russian banking sector as well as key energy firms and arms manufacturers. As one of several companies that have asked for government help, Russia's oil giant Rosneft said it would need 1.5 trillion roubles ($39.70 billion) in aid to keep exploring for oil. Siluanov also told RIA news agency that the decision to stop transferring money to the Pension Fund would hand the budget an extra 309 billion roubles. It will be the second year running that Moscow has stopped transfers of funds from the budget to the Pension Fund, which provides benefits for Russia's pensioners, some invalids and families who have lost their breadwinners. uhe/nz (Reuters, RIA)",
        "generated_story": "Russia to create multi-billion-dollar pension fund for companies hit by sanctions The Russian government has announced plans to set up a multi billion-euro fund to help companies affected by the Ukraine conflict. The move comes as the country's oil giant Rosneft announced on Thursday that it would set aside $1 billion ($1.6 billion) for the purpose of setting up the State Pension Fund (SPF). The fund will be run by Anton Siluanov, head of Russia's state pension funds. \"We are going to put the money into the fund,\" he told the RIA news agency, referring to the state fund, which was created in response to sanctions imposed by Moscow on Russia over the conflict in Ukraine. He added that the funds would be used to cover the costs of running state-owned oil companies, such as Russia\u2019s largest oil company, Petrobras, as well as to invest in research and development projects in Russia. According to a statement from the ministry of finance, the SPF will have a total of 1.5 billion roubles ($2.4 billion). \"The fund is to be managed by a board of directors, with the aim of helping companies that have been hit with sanctions,\" the statement said. It did not elaborate on the details of the plan, but said it was \"in line with Russian law.\" The announcement came ahead of a parliamentary vote scheduled to take place on Wednesday. Russian President Vladimir Putin has said he would sign the bill into law if the Russian parliament approves it. Moscow has also promised to introduce new sanctions against Russian companies in the wake of sanctions lifted by Washington, Moscow and Beijing over Ukraine's conflict with separatists in eastern Ukraine and the annexation of Crimea from Ukraine by Russia in 2014. Russia has been accused of violating the terms of an arms embargo imposed on Moscow in retaliation for Moscow's actions in Crimea. But the Kremlin has denied the accusations, saying the sanctions were \"unacceptable\" and that Moscow had no intention of sanctioning the companies involved. Last week, Russian state media reported that Russia was preparing to launch an investigation into allegations of human rights violations. A spokesman for Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said the investigation was still ongoing, adding that \"there is no evidence to support the allegations made against Russia.\" Russian media also reported on Friday that Putin's government had approved a plan to impose sanctions on Russian firms that were involved in fighting the separatists. However, a Kremlin spokesman said that no decision had been made on whether or not Russia would launch a probe into those allegations."

        "target": "Heidi hits the Big Screen Heidi, the world famous girl from the Swiss Alps who first appeared in a novel 121 years ago, has hit the big screen in a fresh look. A century after the death of Heidi inventor Johanna Spyri, the lovable Alpine heroine is being portrayed in a new film which replaces grassy slopes and mountainous range with city skyscrapers and city streets. The $ 3.5 million \"Heidi\", funded by the Z\u00fcrich-based film company Vega and directed by German film maker Markus Imboden, is to be launched in Germany on Thursday. The making of the film was one of the highlights of a past year of events including exhibitions, lectures and fireworks celebrating the July 7 2001 centenary of the death of Spyri, whose novel \"Heidi\" sold 20 million copies and has been translated in 50 languages worldwide. It is thought to be one of the most successful books of all times. The book has inspired 17 films, including Shirley Temple\u2019s Oscar winning portrayal of Heidi in 1937 and a Japanese cartoon series. Imboden\u2019s remake is the 18th \"Heidi\" film. Blue hair in Berlin According to Vega, \"the film was transmitted to today\u2019s world without losing sight of the original novel\". But Imboden\u2019s new movie is far from the charming original, with its rosy-cheeked, curly-headed Heidi, delicate Clara and goat-tending shepherd Peter\u2019s frail old grandmother. In the first film, Heidi, who lives happily with her grandfather in a tiny hut in the Swiss Alps is plucked from her contented life by her Aunt Dete to live in a stiff, rich family in the bustling metropolis, Frankfurt. Heidi becomes so home-sick, she starts to sleepwalk and is eventually sent home. But not before she causes confusion in the otherwise prim household and brings laughter in the life of the disabled and homely, Clara. The Heidi in the latest film has blue hair, surfs the net and roams the streets of Berlin. Friend and shepherd Peter sheds his rustic pastimes and whizzes down streets on his mountainbike. Clara is not the weak, lame young girl of the Spyri novel, but a moody Britney Spears wannabe. Aunt Dete is a modern-day stylist living fashionably in the German capital. The new surroundings are a far cry from the tranquil days of cow milking, goat- tending and flower-plucking in the verdant meadows of the Swiss Alps. Transforming the Heidi myth According to a Berlin daily, the remake is a \"refreshing Heidi\", adding that the script writers had managed to transform the Heidi \"myth\" into an independent, self-assured girl and not into a \"transfigured mountain heroine\". However, it is just this portrait of a naive and charming alpine heroine that has made Heidi so popular all over the world. Heidi has become a well-known Swiss brand worldwide. Some 60,000 tourists \u2013 half from Japan \u2013 are said to visit the picturesque wine-growing village in Graubuenden, which boasts the original Heidi House and other Heidi related attractions such as winding mountain trails and pastures. Imboden\u2019s film, which is to be launched in Germany on Thursday, will also open elsewhere in Europe, and may reach fans in Japan and South Korea too. Whether Imboden\u2019s blue-haired, computer savvy Heidi will charm her Asian viewers, however, remains to be seen.",
        "generated_story": "Remake of Heidi in Swiss Alps The Remake Of Heidi has been made in Switzerland. It's the latest in a series of remakes of the German fashion icon. The new Heidi House in Graubuenden, Switzerland, is part of a project by Markus Imboden and Johanna Spyri to restore the former Heidi house in Z\u00fcrich to its former glory. \"It was the first time that I had ever seen Heidi,\" said Markus, who is now a professor at the University of Zurich. He said the house was \"the first in the world to be completely restored.\" The house, which is located on the edge of Switzerland's highest mountain range, was built in 2009 by a group of German architects and designers, with the aim of preserving the original Heidi's image and making it more accessible to the public. In 2009, the building was converted into a museum. Since then, it has become a tourist attraction for visitors to Switzerland and the Alps, where Heidi lived for more than 30 years. She's now living with her husband Markus and their three children in an apartment near the village of Vega. Markus said that the new house is a \"unique opportunity\" for tourists to see Heidi and her family, as well as to get a closer look at her life and make sure that she's happy and happy in her new home. 'I'm very happy with this project,' Markus told the news agency AFP, adding that he's \"very happy\" that Heidi was able to return to her former home in Germany after spending time with family and friends. \u201cIt's a very special project for me,\u201d he said, referring to Heidi\u2019s love of music, and how she became a model for her children. But the project is not just about Heidi, he added: \"I think it's also about the relationship between the two of us. I think we have a lot in common with each other. We've always had a good relationship, but now we're going to have to move on to something else.\u201cI don't know what to do with Heidi anymore, I'm not sure what I can do about it,\" Markus added, pointing out that \"she's still very much in love with music and has a great sense of humor.\" \"She's always been very open and honest about what she does and doesn't think about music. That's why I love her so much,\" he told AFP. Heidi is the most famous of all the women in his life, according to Markus. And she was also one of his most popular models for his daughter, Joanna, a German actress who grew up with him. They were both very good friends and he was very popular with his younger sisters. Now, they have become very close friends, even though they are now married and have two children together. Their relationship is also very strong and they both have their own personal lives and hobbies. As a result, their relationship has grown stronger over time. Both of them are very interested in learning more about their father's work and what he does in life. For example, when they were younger, Heidi worked as a teacher at a local school and then as an actress. Her father was an actor and she worked for him for many years in film and television. Today, she works for a film production company in Berlin and is currently working on a documentary about her career. On the other hand, her father is an advertising executive for the company. His son, Mark, also works in advertising and marketing. Mark and his wife are also involved in marketing and advertising campaigns, so he knows how important it is for Heidi to stay on top of her work. However, Markus also has his eye on his son's career and wants to help him get his career back on track. After all, his father died of cancer in 2005, just a few months after he moved to Germany from the United States, leaving him with a wife and two young children to care for them. So he has to work hard to keep his family happy. Is Heidi happy? Is she happy at all? Mark thinks so. If she is happy, then she will be happy that her son is doing well at his new job. What do you think? Does she think Heidi will do? He thinks she'll do well in this field? She thinks he'll be a successful businessman and entrepreneur.

        "target": "Rethinking the term 'honor killing' The murder of 28-year-old Samia Shahid comes less than two weeks after Qandeel Baloch was killed by her brother. The media was quick to report them as \"honor killings.\" We have to rethink that term, writes Gouri Sharma. When news broke that Samia Shahid, a British-Pakistani woman, had been found dead while visiting relatives in Pakistan at the end of July, mainstream media outlets were quick to report it as an honor killing. It was the second time in two weeks that the media had reported a killing of a woman this way - the first being the murder of Pakistani social media star Qandeel Baloch. There are strong similarities between the cases. Both were murdered in places where they would have felt they were at their safest - in their family homes. It's likely they knew their killers - in Baloch's case, her brother has admitted to strangling her, and Shahid's father and cousin have already been questioned. And as more reports emerge about Shahid's death, it's clear that both were killed because they didn't behave in a way deemed acceptable in a conservative, patriarchal society. 'Deeply offensive' term The debate around terminology in \"honor killings\" isn't new, and after Baloch's murder there were members of the media - such as ABC Australia journalist Juanita Phillips - who decided against using the term, calling it \"deeply offensive\" and referring to it as a \"family killing\" instead. And there are outlets, like the Guardian, that already use inverted commas with the word honor. But some commentators argue that more needs to happen if media consumers are to gain a better understanding of the problem. \"I think an important step for the media would be to refuse to give weight to the term 'honor crimes,'\" said UK-based freelance journalist Shehnaz Khan. \"While it is imperative to highlight that these crimes and murders stem from the roots of misogyny and therefore a false sense of 'honor,' there is absolutely nothing but'shame' within them, as murder is nothing but dishonorable.\" \"The word 'honor' can sometimes carry an almost positive connotation that we are inclined to automatically accept just because it's not happening to us, when the reality is, this a huge problem affecting thousands of girls and women across the world,\" she added. Naming the issue But this isn't a view shared by all journalists. Ruby Hamad, a writer at Australia's Daily Life newspaper, said that the first step in dealing with the issue is naming it. \"There are some deeply patriarchal societies that still limit women's freedom according to old tribal concepts of honor, where, unfairly, the behavior of women reflect on their entire family,\" Hamad said. \"By naming these 'honor killings,' we are acknowledging the role that this misogynistic concept of honor plays, not only in the murders themselves but in these entire societies, and how it entraps both men and women.\" Through the eyes of the perpetrator? There are other issues with the term though. Some have argued that by framing it as such, media outlets are showing the crime through the eyes of the perpetrator - and not through the victim - as they should. And with such cases regularly hitting the headlines, framing is important. The United Nations estimates that around 5,000 women - predominantly from Asia and the Middle East - are killed annually in honor-related crimes, a figure that women's advocacy groups say is closer to 20,000 worldwide. This raises an important cultural element for the media to consider - how far does the term play into cultural stereotypes? \"When honor is considered the most important thing in life, then all family members become expendable,\" Hamad said. \"The collective outweighs the rights of the individual. Does this feed into cultural stereotypes? Perhaps. But that doesn't mean we should pretend that this cultural context isn't there.\" Looking for answers - and alternatives There have been many alternatives put forward by women's advocacy groups, including hate crime, misogynistic murder, femicide and shame killings. But which one should we pick? Al Jazeera for one has decided which one they won't use. \"We are always updating our style guidelines to convey a deeper and more authentic understanding of world affairs. Recent events in Pakistan ignited a healthy debate in Al Jazeera on the term 'honor killings' in particular. Our editors are currently studying alternatives to the term, but'misogynistic murder' is not one of them,\" said an Al Jazeera spokesperson. Terminology in the media matters, and for murders as complex as these, it's the media's responsibility to find a name that better fits the crime. Only then will it become easier to work towards a solution.",

        "target": "Myanmar Junta Announces Amnesty The junta in Myanmar, also known as Burma, announced an amnesty for more than 7,000 prisoners on Friday, including a few political detainees. The amnesty came on the 21st anniversary of the brutal crackdown of a student-led pro-democracy movement in 1988 and the subsequent seizure of power by the current junta. Journalists were invited to Yangon\u2019s notorious Insein prison on Friday as the authorities released the first batch of prisoners. At least 600 inmates were freed as part of an amnesty for over 7,000 inmates nationwide. Among those released in Yangon were two journalists and 25 political prisoners -- rights groups say this is only 1 percent of the total number of political prisoners held by the military regime. Maung Zarni, a research fellow at the London School of Economics, was \u201chappy for the prisoners who were part of the release\u201d. \u201cThis is a very positive personal development and I am happy they have been released but we need to understand that the junta is using the prisoners\u2019 release as a public relations exercise. It is the 21st anniversary of the military coup so they are using this as a way to pacify political discontent in the country.\u201d Amnesty comes ahead of next year\u2019s polls Myanmar's director general of prisons, Zaw Win, said that the prisoners had been freed so they could take part in next year's polls. In recent months, rights activists, pro-democracy activists and Western countries have cast doubt on the credibility of the planned elections as many key political activists are still in detention. This includes pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who recently began a new 18-month period of house arrest after being found guilty of violating her house arrest order in a widely condemned trial. \u201cThe whole Suu kyi trial is rather unlawful,\u201d said Zarni. \u201cBecause the country does not have an independent judiciary, the judges are just puppets who dance to the tune of the top leadership.\u201d Junta is holding on tightly In 1990, Suu Kyi\u2019s National League for Democracy won Myanmar\u2019s last general election by a landslide. But the junta never recognised the results and has since tightened its control over the country. The 2008 constitution, which was drafted and approved by the military generals, which guarantees the army 25 percent of parliamentary seats, is yet another sign of its desire to consolidate power. \u201cThe military is going to be in power for a long time,\u201d warns Zarni, \u201cbecause they have got control of all the political and economic institutions in the country as well as the entire state of Burma. So with or without elections, this is likely to remain the same.\u201d New Democratic Party formed Meanwhile, a new political party has been formed in Myanmar. The Democratic Party is headed by Mya Than Than Nu, who is the daughter of the country\u2019s first democratically-elected prime minister, U Nu. The party has proposed a power-sharing deal with the military, which would give 40 percent of power to politicians and 60 percent to the military rulers. Harn Yawnghwe, the director of the Brussels-based Euro-Burma Office, doubts the new party stands a chance: \u201cIt is possible that they they would be able to get some votes. But it is not likely, even if they were able to contest the elections freely, that they will be able to form a new government because the military is not prepared to let any party rule.\u201d Democrats should exploit elections He thinks the only way out for the democratic forces in Myanmar is to use the upcoming elections wisely and \u201cto take part in them even if they are against them. I think we have to look at the elections as a process which will lead to democracy -- maybe in few more years.\u201d The National League for Democracy has indicated that it will not take part in the polls unless all Myanmar\u2019s political prisoners, including Suu Kyi, are released. Suu Kyi\u2019s lawyers have filed an appeal against the extension of her house arrest and the court is expected to give a ruling on October 2. But few are hopeful that the junta will amnesty her anytime soon. Author: Disha Uppal Editor: Anne Thomas",

The move comes amid growing criticism from human rights groups and the International Criminal Court (ICC) that Myanmar has failed to act on its promises to end the \"war on terror.\" The ICC said on Thursday that it was \"deeply concerned\" by the move. \"We are deeply concerned about the lack of action taken by Myanmar authorities in the past few months,\" said ICC spokesman Harn Yawnghwe, adding that \"we are still working with the Myanmar government to find a solution to this problem.\" Amnesty International said it had received more than 1.5 million complaints from people who had been detained in recent months.

        "target": "A quarter of deaths caused by environmental degradation, says UN A new United Nations report warns that pollution and global warming are causing millions more deaths than conflicts. The UN's environment agency has called for an urgent roll-back on harmful substances and fossil fuels. In its report \"Healthy Environment, Health People,\" the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), the World Health Organization and several other environment organizations said that, in 2012, an estimated 12.6 million deaths were attributable to deteriorating environment conditions. The largest numbers of deaths took place in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific regions, followed by sub-Saharan Africa, where around a quarter of deaths were likely caused byair pollution, chemicals, climate change and a lack of access to sanitation. \"By depleting the ecological infrastructure of our planet and increasing our pollution footprint, we incur an ever-growing cost in terms of human health and well-being,\" said UNEP Executive Director Achim Steiner. He added that humanity's life support systems had been compromised by globalization and powerful economic interests. The report was released during UN climate talks in the German city of Bonn which are drawing up rules pertaining to the Paris agreement, which seeks to lower carbon emissions. The document suggested that several drivers were responsible for the threat to human health, including ecosystem disruption, climate change, inequality, unhealthy and wasteful lifestyles, along with unsustainable consumption and production. Worsening effects UNEP estimated that an extra 250,000 deaths could occur each year between 2030 and 2050 as a result of climate change, leading to malnutrition, malaria, diarrhea and heat stress. Between them air pollution and a lack of access to clean water and sanitation cause almost 8 million premature deaths each year. Environmental impacts are responsible for the deaths of more than one quarter of all children under the age of five, the report states. UNEP called for governments to act to remove harmful substances from working environments, reduce the use of carbon fuels and rely instead on renewable energy, and change lifestyles to allow a more sustainable use of the world's resources. The report also called for a bigger investment to protect the planet's natural ecosystem. UNEP predicted a further increase in emerging zoonotic diseases (spread between animals and humans), and called on developing countries, in particular, to prioritize prevention methods. \"Never before have so many animals been kept by so many people - and never before have so many opportunities existed for pathogens to pass through the biophysical environment and wild animals to livestock and people,\" the report warned.",
        "generated_story": "A quarter of deaths due to environmental degradation The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that the number of people who die from environmental problems is likely to rise. The UNEP chief Achim Steiner told a conference in Bonn, Germany, on Thursday that \"a quarter\" of the world's deaths have been linked to climate change. \"The number is very high,\" he said, adding that it was \"very concerning\" that more than 1.5 million people in the developing world died of environmental causes over the past five years, according to the organization's World Environment Program (WEP). \"It is extremely concerning that we are seeing such high levels of greenhouse gas emissions, and we have to deal with this in a way that is not only environmentally irresponsible, but also socially irresponsible.\" The WEP director-general for the UN's Paris office said the increase in deaths was the result of a lack of awareness among people about the environmental impact of human activities on the environment. In a statement released on Wednesday, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) said that over half of those who died from greenhouse gases in 2015 and 2016 had been identified as environmental contributors to human health problems, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disorders, cancer and cancer. It also called for an end to air pollution, which has led to a drop in air quality in many developing countries. World health officials have also warned against the use of toxic chemicals in drinking water, particularly in developing nations, such as China, India, Brazil and South Africa. A WHO report last week found that almost half the deaths were caused by environmental pollution. This is the highest level of pollution since World War II, when the global average temperature rose to 80 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) in 1945. According to World Bank data, over 1,000 people died in 2005, up from 2,500 in 2006. UNDP Director-General Ban Ki-moon said in an interview with the German newspaper Le Monde that there was a \"significant increase\" in human activity in recent years. He also pointed out that many of these deaths had to do with environmental factors, not just the weather, as well as the fact that people were exposed to more toxins in their bodies than they were in other industrialized nations. However, he added, \"there is no evidence that this has been the case for a long time.\" \"There is a lot of evidence to support this conclusion,\" Ban said. But he did not rule out the possibility that environmental issues could be addressed by the end of this year, saying that if the situation were to improve, there would be no need for urgent action. On the other hand, it is important to be aware of what is happening in our environment and how it affects our health and the health of our children and young people. That is why we need to take action to address this issue. We are not going to allow people to die because we don't know what will happen to their health or their well-being if we do not act on this information. What we can do is act quickly and decisively to prevent this from happening again.\" He added that he would like to see more action from the international community in order to reduce the risk of health-related deaths and improve the quality of life for all people living in extreme poverty and suffering from chronic diseases. \u201cWe need action now,\u201d said Ban."

        "target": "No more'veggie sausages?' Minister wants ban on meat names for plant-based foods Terms like \"vegan sausage\" and \"vegetarian schnitzel\" confuse consumers and need to be replaced, according to German Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt. He wants new names for plant-based dishes. Germans shouldn't be biting into a \"vegan sausage\" or cutting a slice of \"vegetarian schnitzel,\" German Minister for Food and Agriculture Christian Schmidt told the daily \"Bild\" newspaper on Wednesday, adding that names traditionally used for meat-based dishes should not be applied to plant-based foods. \"I don't want anyone to pretend that these pseudo-meat dishes are actual meat dishes,\" Schmidt said. The minister said manufacturers should come up with distinct names for plant-based meat-substitutes. Schmidt also said meat was part of a healthy and balanced diet and belonged on the menu in schools and kindergartens. Soy? Steak? Soy-steak? Schmidt's statements echo demands from the German Farmers Association and German Butchers Association. Both lobbying groups have asked for a ban on terms such as \"vegetarian ham\" or \"soy steak.\" Schmidt's call for plant-based foods to have their own name was also made in October in the state of Lower Saxony, a state with many large livestock farms. The German Vegetarian Association, however, argued against the proposal. A spokesperson for the organization said that \"names that are used for animal-based products should without a doubt also be legal to use for vegetarian substitute products.\" More meatless 'whatever-you-want-to-call-thems' The market for vegetarian and vegan dishes has grown steadily in the past few years in Germany, partly at the expense of the meat industry. According to a research paper by the Institute for the Study of Trade (IfH), revenue for vegetarian and vegan products in Germany was 454 million euros ($474 million) in 2015 and grew by more than 100 percent between 2010 and 2015. In the same time period, the demand for meat products fell by almost 10 percent. mb/sms (dpa, epd)",
        "generated_story": "No more'vegetarian' sausages, no more schnitzel' German farmers' association has announced that it will no longer be selling \"veg salad\" and \"salad meat\" in Germany. The announcement came on the same day that the German Butchers Association (German Farmers Association) announced it would be discontinuing the sale of its popular sauerkraut. \"We have decided to discontinue the use of these products,\" the association said in a statement on its website. It said the decision was made \"in light of the fact that we have a lot of people who are interested in eating veg salads,\" and that \"we will continue to sell our products in the future.\" The association, which represents farmers in Lower Saxony and Upper Rhine-Westphalia, said it was \"deeply disappointed\" by the announcement. According to the group's website, it is the first time in its history that a German farmer has sold his or her produce for less than 10 euros ($13.50) a year. In the past, the Germans have sold their produce to other farmers, who then sold it to them for a profit. Now, they are selling their products directly to their customers. They are now selling them at a discount, and the prices are starting to rise. This is a big change from the previous year, when they were sold for around 50 euros a kilogram (25.5 pounds) at the grocery store. But this time around, their prices have fallen by more than 30 percent, according to a survey conducted by Germany's agricultural trade association (Bild). The survey also found that there was an increase in demand for the product, with a rise of 1.6 percent in sales. That's up from 2.7 percent last year and is up by 2 percent this year (2.4 percent). In addition, there has been a slight rise in prices for meat and dairy products, as well as a drop in milk prices. However, this has not been the case in other areas of Germany, where meat is more expensive than it used to be. For example, meat products such as beef, lamb and chicken tenders can be sold at supermarkets, while beef and lamb tend to have higher prices than beef. And beef is cheaper than pork, so it's not just meat that's cheaper to buy, but also more economical to produce. There are also a number of other products that are available for sale on Amazon.com and other online retailers that sell meat-based products. One of them is beef sausage, for example. Another is sausage meat, made from beef or lamb. A third is lentil sausage. These products are sold in supermarkets and are usually made in small batches. If you buy meat from a meat supplier, you can buy them in bulk. You can also buy the meat directly from your local supermarket, or from an online market. What's more, if you're a farmer, then you'll be able to make your own meat. I don't know about you but I do know that meat meat has a reputation for being very expensive. So, I'm not going to tell you what I think about it, because I have no idea what the price of beef meat will be when I buy it. How much meat can you eat? What do you think? Do you have any idea how many people are willing to pay for it? I'd like to know the answer to that question. We'll have to wait and see what you tell us. Then we'll see if we can figure out a way to get a handle on that. As far as I know, we've got a good idea of what we're talking about. All we need to do is find out what's going on with meat production and then make a decision on whether or not we want to use meat as an ingredient in our meat dishes. At the moment, that seems like the only way forward. After all, what do we do now? We've already got some meat to eat, right? But what about meat? How about beef? Is meat sausage? Why not beef up your meat product? You'll never know for sure. Why would you want meat in meat sauce? The meat industry has always been one of my favorite food sources. Meat is very important to me because meat isn't just a commodity. When meat goes bad, people will eat it for years and years. Since the end of World War II, many meat companies have been selling meat for over a quarter of a million euros (1.8 billion euros). But meat sales have dropped by a third since the beginning of this century. Many meat processors are still producing meat at their plants and meat processing plants. Most meat suppliers are already producing their meat here in Europe. Only a handful of meat producers are currently producing beef products at home. Some meatpacking plants have already started to open up their production lines. More than 1,500 meat plants are producing in this country, including meat packing plants, dairy and beef"

Stephen Harper has stepped down as leader of the Conservatives after nine years in the top job. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper resigned as Conservative Party leader on Tuesday after the Liberals, led by Justin Trudeau, emerged victorious in legislative elections. \"I have spoken to Prime Minister Stephen Harper, and he has instructed me to reach out to the newly elected parliamentary caucus to appoint an interim leader,\" Conservative Party president John Walsh said in a statement. \"The people are never wrong,\" Harper said of his defeat. \"The disappointment is my responsibility and mine alone,\" Harper said, adding that he had called Trudeau to congratulate him. Trudeau calls for hopeful, diverse future In electing Trudeau, the charismatic son of a former popular prime minister, Canadian voters illustrated the growing discontent with nine years of Conservative rule that saw lowering of corporate taxes, avoidance of climate change legislation and disagreement with the Obama administration over the controversial Keystone XL pipeline. \"Canadians have spoken,\" Trudeau said, adding that he would be the man to lead the \"hopeful, positive\" country \"with a vision\" that they had asked for. In his victory speech, Trudeau said his government \"believed deeply in the diversity of our country,\" striking a contrast with the strain of nativism that had become apparent under Conservative rule. \"We beat fear with hope,\" said Trudeau, a 43-year-old former teacher. Liberals blow past projected results Projections ahead of the elections had Harper and Trudeau in a dead heat, but as polls closed on Monday night it became clear that the Liberals had won an outright majority, with a projected 175 of parliament's 338 seats. This represented a huge leap from four years ago when Liberals were handed their most crushing defeat in history with a mere 34 seats. Harper will stay on as a member of Parliament for his constituency, public broadcaster CBC reported, as he was re-elected to his seat. The left-leaning New Democratic Party had hoped to capitalize on its second-place finish in 2011, but only managed to come in third with CBC estimating that the party had garnered 32 seats. es/cmk (AP, Reuters) Have something to say?

        "generated_story": "Canada's Prime Minister Stephen Harper steps down as leader of the Conservative Party Canada's prime minister has announced that he will step down from his post as the country's leader. Harper announced his resignation on Friday, a day after the Liberal Party leader, Justin Trudeau, announced he was stepping down. The announcement came after Harper, who had led the party since the end of last year's federal election campaign, was accused of sexual misconduct with a minor. \"I regret to inform you that I will no longer be a member of this party,\" Harper said in a statement released by his office. He also said he would not seek re-election in the next election, which is set to take place in 2019. Trudeau said Harper's resignation was the result of a \"serious lack of leadership\" in his party's leadership contest with the federal Liberals and the Greens, and that it was \"not in my best interest\" for the Conservatives to form a coalition government with Trudeau's Liberal party. In his announcement, Harper also called for an end to the Harper government's power-sharing agreement with Ottawa and promised to hold a referendum on the terms of his term in office by June 30, 2019, if the deal was not reached by that date. A spokesman for Harper told the Canadian Press that Harper had \"no intention\" of running for a third term. Prime minister Harper has been in power since 2011, when he took over from former Liberal leader Stephen Brown, but he has yet to make a decision on whether to run for another four-year term, as he did in 2011 and again in 2013. His successor, Stephen Reid, is expected to be sworn in on July 1, 2018, after a two-day leadership campaign in which he and his wife, Sophie, were among the first to announce their intentions to leave the leadership race. They had been scheduled to meet in Ottawa on Monday, June 12, to discuss the outcome of their leadership election. But the timing of that meeting has not been set in stone. On Friday morning, Trudeau announced the resignation of Harper as party leader following a series of cabinet reshuffles, including the appointment of an interim leader and a new leader to replace him. Both Trudeau and Harper have said that they will continue to work closely with each other to find a way forward in their respective political careers. However, it is not clear how much longer Harper will be able to stay in government, or how long he plans to remain in it. It is still unclear what role he is going to play in this election and whether he intends to stick to his current leadership position. Last year, he announced a plan to return to politics as soon as possible, calling on Trudeau to step aside from the role of leader until the election is over. That plan would be followed by a leadership reshuffle in May, the same month that Trudeau was elected to a second term as premier of Canada. This would give Trudeau the chance to win back the majority of seats he lost to Harper in last November's election in an election that was widely seen to have been won by the Liberals. While Harper is no stranger to controversy, there is also a growing sense of unease among Canadians about the future of politics in Canada, especially in light of recent scandals involving sexual harassment allegations against women and sexual assault allegations. There is a lot of talk about whether or not Harper should be allowed to continue his role in politics, particularly in relation to women's rights and gender equality. And there are a number of things that have come up in recent months that are not well known about Harper. One of them is the fact that many people are still not happy with his handling of sex abuse allegations, such as sex assault cases, rape cases and child abuse cases. Another is that the government has made it more difficult for women to get a job as a sex worker in order to attract more women into the workforce. These allegations have led to an increase in sexual violence cases among young women, according to media reports. Many of these allegations are based on allegations made by women who have sex with men and who say they are sexually abused or abused by men. Some have also accused Harper of sexually abusing them, while others accuse him of being a pedophile. Others say he's a misogynist who has a sexual orientation and is obsessed with sexual abuse of women. What do you think? Do you agree with this assessment? What is your view on this issue? Is it a good idea to keep your mouth shut? Can you imagine the reaction if you're a woman? How many women have you heard of? The answer to that question is, \"No.\" The question of whether Harper can be answered is: \"Yes, I think he can do that. I don't think that's the right answer.\" Harper was first elected in 2006, in part because he didn't have the power to change the gender balance of power. After all, his first term ended in 2007. When he left office in 2009, then he became the head of government at the age of 45. Since then, Canada has become the"

At this point, US Secretary of State John Kerry said anyone who cared about Yemeni people \"should take clear notice of the fact that a human catastrophe is building,\" adding that a cease-fire was \"not peace\" and that all parties must find a political solution to end the conflict.

Lately, the northern Yemeni province of Saada has become a battleground for the Shiite rebels and the Saud-led coalition forces as the Houthis carried out border attacks on nearby Saudi cities. More than 50 airstrikes hit Saada overnight and in the early hours of Friday morning, Yemeni officials said. A Saudi-led coalition of Arab states launched an air campaign against the Houthis on March 26. Riyadh accuses Tehran of backing the rebels, who have made significant territorial gains in the impoverished Middle Eastern country, capturing the capital Sanaa and ousting internationally recognized President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, who fled Yemen back in March. The Sunni Gulf states are wary of Iran's increasing influence in the region, and they see the Houthis' advance in Yemen as a move that threatens their regional and geopolitical interests.

In the first round of voting, the main opposition candidate, Andrij Shevchenko, was the only candidate who had a chance to win the vote. However, he was not able to do so due to a \"technical problem\" that prevented him from getting the result he had hoped for. On the other hand, she won a majority of seats in parliament, with a margin of 5.6 percent, compared to 1.8 percent for Porov.

Ireland's president and chief executive officer, J\u00fcrgen K\u00fcbler, said the release was \"a positive step in the right direction\" for Ireland, which had been under pressure from the Brazilian government over its handling of a bribery scandal involving the awarding of Olympic gold medals to Brazil. The European Commission said it would continue to monitor the case, but added that it was not clear whether the former president would be able to appeal the ruling. Dublin's mayor, who is also a former mayor of Sao Paulo, was also released from prison on Wednesday after being charged with bribery and money laundering in connection with the scandal. He is expected to face up to 10 years in prison if found guilty of all charges. A trial date has not yet been set for the bribery case. Spain, Ireland and the United States have already agreed to cooperate in an investigation into the alleged bribery scheme, according to a court document seen by Reuters news agency. In addition, Spain and Italy have also agreed on a deal to extradite the ex-governor of Dublin to stand trial on charges related to his role in organizing the Rio Olympics in 2004 and 2005, respectively. Both Dublin and Brazil have said that they will cooperate fully with prosecutors in their investigation, although they have yet to rule out the possibility of an extradition request from Spain or Italy, the document said.

The case has already been referred to an appeals court in Dublin as a \"technical matter,\" which could lead to charges of bribery, fraud and abuse of power. According to court documents, prosecutors had asked the court to set aside the conviction and sentence for a total of three years, if not more, on the grounds that he had violated the terms of his bail conditions. Prosecutors said they had no evidence of any wrongdoing. They also said there was no chance of finding a plea deal in relation to allegations of sexual misconduct. However, they also pointed out that there is a possibility that a trial could take place in Brazil, where the prosecution could seek a sentence of life imprisonment or even a life sentence if convicted in absentia. This is the first time that Ireland has ever been accused of involvement in sexual assault or attempted sexual abuse by a convicted sex offender. Last year, a jury convicted the man of raping a woman and abusing a minor. That conviction was overturned on appeal after the jury found him guilty on two counts of first-degree rape and attempted rape. After the verdict, he was sentenced to life in jail without parole and was ordered to serve a term of two years. His lawyers said he would not be eligible for parole until the end of this year."

Twenty years later, relations between Libya and Europe have done an about-face. The Berlin disco \"La Belle\" was packed as usual on the night of April 5, 1986. Among its guests were many US soldiers, who were certainly not thinking of politics, the Middle East or strained relations between the United States and Libya. But reality caught up with them: a bomb detonated near the dance floor that night, killing two Americans and a Turkish woman. Over 200 people were injured. A Berlin court ruled that Libya and its intelligence services were responsible for the bombing. In 2001, following a nearly four-year long trial, the judges convicted a Libyan diplomat and three others to prison sentences between 12 and 14 years. The big oil-exporting country in the meantime was busy working on its reputation. Already in the 1990s, Tripoli began striving to improve its relations to the European Union. Financial reparation opened the door to Europe In 2004, the Gaddafi International Foundation for Charity Associations and the legal representatives of the German La Belle victims settled on $35 million in compensation. This opened the door to Europe. Just a few weeks later, Germany's chancellor at the time, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, visited Moammar Gadhafi in a traditional Bedouin tent outside of Tripoli. Britain's Prime Minister Tony Blair also paid Gadhafi a visit. A few months earlier, in April 2004, the European Union had welcomed the Libyan leader to Brussels. It was Gadhafi's first official visit to Europe in 15 years. Bernd Westphal, the German ambassador to Libya, said bilateral relations had been through difficult times. \"The German Embassy in Tripoli today is working for a quick return to the liveliness of close relations between Germany and Libya,\" Westphal said. \"We want to build on our traditional friendship with Libya and we want to strengthen the political, economic and cultural cooperation between our two countries and peoples.\" Business interests booming in Libya In the past few years, Libya has moved from being the supporter of international terrorism to an attractive economic partner for the West. European business representatives have been increasingly knocking on Libya's door. Even the United States is showing increased interest in the northern African nation. Washington is pleased that Libya announced at the end of 2003 that it would discontinue its efforts to develop and produce weapons of mass destruction. Libya's ambassador to Germany, Said Abdulaati, said political and economic relations between Libya and Germany were \"excellent.\" Libya is one of Germany's strongest trading partners in northern Africa. Last year, Germany exported goods to Libya worth 657.7 million euros ($805.7 million), according to the German Federal Statistics Office. \"The economy is the driving power in German-Libyan relations,\" said Abdulaati in an interview with the Arab-German association for trade and industry. But Germany isn't the only European country making deals in Libya. France last month signed an accord with Libya on peaceful nuclear research. \"This accord represents a qualitative leap in relations between the two countries and proves that Libya has transformed its weapons of mass destruction into constructive weapons,\" Public Works Minister Maatuk Maatuk said at the signing ceremony in March. \"We are telling the world that we are moving towards the development of Libyan nuclear technology for peaceful purposes.\" This week, the Netherlands' Economics Minister Laurens Jan Brinkhorst will visit Libya to negotiate gas and oil agreements. It will be the first high-level visit by a Dutch official since Gadhafi took power in 1969.",

The report, published on Thursday, shows that the country's relations with the United States have changed dramatically since the end of the civil war in 2011. According to the report published by the Public Works Office in Berlin, the change in Libyan relations has been marked by a sharp increase in tensions between the two countries. \"We have seen a shift in the relationship between Libya and Europe,\" said Bernd Westphal, a spokesman for the public works office at the German federal office in La Belle, near Berlin. He added that \"we have also seen an increase of cooperation between our countries and the Libyan people.\" \"This has also led to a rise in cooperation with our European partners,\" he said, referring to Germany's EU partners, Turkey, Italy, France, Spain, Portugal, Belgium and Italy. Germany, however, has yet to make any progress in its efforts to improve ties with Libya, which is now a member state of NATO. In a statement released on Friday, Berlin's publicworks office said it was \"deeply concerned\" about the \"difficult situation\" in Tripoli, adding that it had been \"very difficult\" to understand the situation there. It also pointed out that there was a \"serious lack of trust\" between Germany and Libya in terms of security and stability, as well as the fact that Libya was not in a stable state when the war broke out, and that many of its citizens were not able to return to their homes and jobs. This was also reflected in how the EU and its allies have been handling the conflict, particularly in eastern Libya where there is a strong sense of insecurity and insecurity. There is also a growing sense that, in some ways, Libya is becoming more and more isolated. That is, it is not only the Europeans who are concerned, but also the US and Britain that are worried about what is happening to Libya as a whole. These are the countries that have the most influence on the region. They have a lot to learn from each other. For example, there are a number of people who have left Libya because they don't feel safe in their own country. And that is something that we have to work on, because we are not going to give up the fight against terrorism and extremism. We will continue to do our best to protect the interests of our own people. But we will also be doing our utmost to keep Libya safe and secure, so as not to undermine the stability of Libya.\""

        "target": "Bremen Election Results Could Have National Repercussions It might be Germany's smallest state with a population of less than 700,000, but the make-up of Bremen's new government could curb the ability of Angela Merkel's coalition to continue with planned reforms. The Social Democrats (SPD) and Christian Democrats (CDU) have ruled the small northern city-state of Bremen in a coalition for the past 12 years. But after winning state elections on Sunday with 36.8 percent, the SPD is now flirting with the idea of ditching their previous coalition partners to rule together with the Greens, who made their best-ever showing in a German state poll with 16.4 percent. Bremen's state SPD leadership is to hold talks later on Wednesday with the CDU, which polled 25.7 percent. After an SPD meeting in Bremen, Mayor Jens B\u00f6hrnsen made the first signal he could be favoring the Greens. He said that during the campaign he had deliberately abstained from mentioning the possibility of a renewed CDU coalition because \"after 12 years it shouldn't automatically be continued.\" Bremen's acting head of government and CDU member Thomas R\u00f6wekamp, however, warned against an SPD-Green coalition. \"The majority of people don't want a red-green experiment, but a continuation of the grand coalition,\" he said. Both the SPD and CDU conceded heavy losses in the election, which showed a swing towards the Greens and the Left Party, which scored an unexpected 8.4 percent to win representation in a western German state legislature for the first time in its brief history. Block reforms? If Bremen's SPD decide in favor of the Greens, this would affect the ability of Chancellor Angela Merkel's grand coalition of CDU and SPD to push ahead with reforms requiring constitutional changes, such as stage two of Germany's urgently needed federalism reform. The federal Bundesrat, which is made up of state cabinet members, has to approve the majority of legislative bills passed by the lower chamber, the Bundestag, before they become law. Also, any proposed constitutional changes require two-thirds of all votes in order to be passed by the Bundesrat. The CDU and SPD currently hold 47 of the Bundesrat's 69 seats, which is one seat more than the necessary two-thirds majority. But without Bremen, the number held by the grand coalition would fall to 44 seats, meaning they would need the cooperation of one of the small opposition parties for any constitutional changes. Internal strife Earlier in the week, Chancellor Merkel called for unity within her ruling left-right coalition after the losses in Bremen set the stage for more infighting between the two parties. Merkel also warned the SPD against moving to the left after it lost some five percent points. The chancellor said the outcome showed the SPD had made a mistake by attacking the coalition and campaigning on promises of a minimum wage, which she believes will hamper efforts to fight unemployment of just under 10 percent. \"The result showed that this strategy did not pay off,\" Merkel told a press conference.",
        "generated_story": "Merkel's coalition of Social Democrats and CDU could block reforms Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) are set to form a coalition government with the Greens and Greens in Germany's lower house of parliament, the Bundesrat, on Thursday. The Greens, a Christian Democratic party, and the Christian Social Union (CSU), have been in talks for months over a number of controversial reforms, including tax cuts for the wealthy and a tax freeze on the middle class. On Thursday, Merkel and her conservative coalition partners agreed on a package of reforms to the tax code that would make Germany more competitive in the global economy. But the SPD, which holds the rotating presidency of the Bundestag, is expected to vote against the reforms. \"The SPD is not going to agree to any of these reforms,\" Merkel said in a speech to parliament in Bremen. She also said she would not support any tax increases for middle-income earners, such as those in low-wage countries like the United States, Canada and Mexico. Merkel, who has been at loggerheads with her conservatives for years, has said that she will not back down from the proposed tax hikes. However, she has not ruled out the idea of a new tax on middle income earners. In a statement released on Friday, her party said it would seek to block the planned tax increase. A spokesman for her coalition partner, Greens party leader Steffen Seibert, told reporters that the chancellor's plan was \"in the best interests of Germany\" and that it was a \"positive step forward for Germany.\" \"We have a lot of work to do,\" she said, adding that \"we will continue to work with Chancellor Merkel on this issue.\" The SPD and CSU have already agreed to a deal on tax reform, but they have yet to reach an agreement on how to pay for it. It is unclear whether the new taxes will be paid for by the government or the private sector, or whether they will simply be passed on to consumers. Both parties have said they are willing to make changes to tax laws, as well as to introduce tax breaks for small businesses and individuals with low incomes. They have also called for an end to subsidies for high-earning companies and small-business owners who do not have the means to invest in their businesses. This would be the first time that a chancellor would have to sign an extension of tax credits for companies that make up a large part of their revenues. That is, if she does not sign the extension. If she doesn't sign this extension, it could lead to an increase in taxes on small business owners and those who don't have enough money to cover the costs of running a business. There is also the risk of losing their jobs if the Chancellor is unable to secure a majority in parliament. What is the most likely outcome of this deal? The chancellor has already made it clear she is open to negotiations with other parties about the future of taxes and social security. And she's not ready to give up on her plans to reduce the deficit, even though she says she wants to increase the budget deficit by 1.5 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). \"I think it's a good thing that we are in this position,\" said Merkel in an interview with Deutsche Welle newsmagazine."

US General Philip Breedlove said Russian forces were still operating inside Ukraine. Speaking to reporters after a meeting with NATO military chiefs in Lithuania's capital Vilnius on Saturday, US General Philip Breedlove expressed \"sincere hope\" about a renewed peace plan, agreed to earlier in the day in the Belarusian capital Minsk, by separatists and representatives from Ukraine's and Russia's governments. The new pact, including an artillery buffer zone, was a move to strengthen a peace plan signed earlier this month, also in Minsk. However, Breedlove said violence levels in Ukraine in recent days were as high as prior to the earlier ceasefire. \"The ceasefire is still there in name, but what is happening on the ground is quite a different story,\" Breedlove said, adding that Russian forces were still operating in Ukraine, although he could not pinpoint how many. \"The fluidity of movement of Russian forces and Russian-backed forces back and forth across that border makes it almost impossible to understand the numbers,\" he said. A convoy from Russia consisting of about 170 trucks arrived in Ukraine on Saturday, with a reported cargo of humanitarian aid. Previous aid convoys sent from Russia were met with outrage in Kyiv, as it was suspected they may have been used to provide support to the pro-Moscow separatists in eastern Ukraine. Russia has repeatedly denied such accusations. The separatists have said they want to break from Kyiv and have already declared \"people's republics'\" in Donetsk and Luhansk. This week Ukraine's parliament passed a bill which paves the way for more autonomy for those areas.

The move follows a political protest at the first such match. In a statement released on Friday, the German football association (DFB) announced that the games would be rescheduled for 2018 and that talks would take place between them and their Chinese counterparts in order explore how to move forward. \"To the regret of all parties involved, the project has not received the broad approval that had been expected,\" the DFB said. \"In fact, the project was used by a handful of spectators to send messages that were considered hurtful by the Chinese team, officials, the Chinese Football Association's support staff and Chinese spectators.\" Protests in opening match The first of the arranged matches, against TSV Schott Mainz of the fourth-tier Regionalliga S\u00fcdwest was interrupted midway through the first half when the Chinese players left the field because a small group of activists had unfurled Tibetan flags. The team later returned to the field after the flags had been taken down, before succumbing to a 3-0 defeat. On Monday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry strongly criticized the protest. Initially, it had been thought that the Chinese side would play in the Regionalliga S\u00fcdwest - a regional division of Germany's fourth tier which has only 19 teams but the plan was revised so the matches would just be friendlies. This followed an agreement signed in 2016 between the German FA and the Chinese government to help boost the sport in the Asian country, where the Bundesliga is increasingly popular.

According to a statement released by the association on Friday, the decision was made following a meeting between the German and Chinese Football Associations (SFA) officials. SFA president Michael G\u00f6rner said the cancellation of the event was \"inappropriate\" and \"unacceptable,\" adding that \"it is not the first time that we have had to cancel an event like this.\" \"It is unfortunate that this has happened, but it is also unfortunate,\" he said. \"We are not going to allow this to happen again.

German auto club ADAC says costs associated with owning a car have risen more than 40 percent since 1995. In 2010, German car owners had to pay a high price for their mobility, according to ADAC, which cited record-high fuel prices as the major cost factor. \"For drivers, 2010 will go down in history as the most costly year ever,\" ADAC said in a statement. High taxes The cost of acquiring and operating a car has risen 42 percent since 1995, compared to a 24 percent increase in the general cost of living. Due to tax increases and higher production costs, fuel prices soared 86 percent over the 15-year period. In 2010 alone, the average price for a liter of super gasoline was more than 1.40 euros ($1.84) - the highest the average price ever. According to ADAC, urban singles spent an average of 3,340 euros on their cars in 2000. Five years later, that figure had jumped to 3,900 euros. By the end of 2010, their expenses reached 4,380 euros, or 1,000 euros more than a decade earlier. Driving is also pricey for four-person families with two cars. According to the automobile club, their annual costs have risen 30 percent over the past 10 years from 5,940 euros to 7,740 euros. Taxes account for the lion's share of gasoline and diesel prices. The German government's mineral oil and value added taxes account for nearly 88 cents of the 1.35-euro price of a liter of fuel.

The release of the five is the latest in a series of releases by US President Barack Obama. In a statement released on Wednesday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the release was the result of negotiations between the Obama administration and the Cuban government. \"We have reached an agreement with Cuba to release five of our prisoners, including the most recent release, Miguel Angel Moratinos, who was sentenced to five years in prison for the murder of his wife and daughter,\" the State Department spokesman said in an emailed statement. A spokesman for President Obama said he was \"deeply concerned about the situation in Guantanamo,\" adding that \"we are working closely with the government to make sure that the prisoners are brought to justice.\" The statement came a day after Obama announced that he would be releasing five more Guantanamo detainees from prison. Two of them had been released earlier this week, while the other two were transferred to a different facility in the capital, Madrid, in exchange for their release. On Tuesday, the White House said it would release the remaining five Guantanamo prisoners on condition that they cooperate with US authorities in their investigation into the deaths of their spouses and children. Obama's announcement came just hours after a US official said that US officials had opened an inquiry into allegations of torture and attempted murder against the former US president, George W. Bush, and that Obama had ordered the transfer of Guantanamo inmates to other countries. But the official did not elaborate on the allegations, saying only that it was an \"ongoing investigation.\" \"The investigation is continuing and we are confident that we have found no evidence of any wrongdoing,\" Obama told a news conference in Madrid. He added that his administration would continue to work with Cuban authorities to find a way to bring the detainees back to the United States. However, he said, \"it is not the first time that I have had to deal with this kind of situation,\" referring to Cuba's military prison system. According to Perez Rubalcaba, a former Guantanamo detainee who worked at the prison from 2002 to 2005, was released in 2006. His wife, Maria, is now a nurse and has been living with him for a year and a half. Her husband, Alfredo, works at a hospital in Barcelona, where she works as a receptionist. They have a daughter and two sons. Their father is also a lawyer and they have two grandchildren. And they are all very well-behaved with each other. There is a good chance that one day they will be able to come to Spain and live with their parents. That is, if they want to stay with us. I think that's what they're going to do. It's a very good thing. We are very happy for them, because we've had a lot of good things happen in our lives. What's more, we're happy with them. So far, it's been a great deal of hard work and dedication to their families and to our country. You can see that in this case, they've done a tremendous amount of work. This is something that is very, very important to them and I'm happy to see them doing well. At the same time, there are a number of things that need to be done. One of those things is to get them out of there. For example, I can't imagine how many more people will have to go through the process of going through this process. Another thing is that all of these prisoners will probably be released before the end of this year. If they do, then they won't be allowed to return to Guantanamo, which is where they came from. These are the people who have come from all over the world, not just from Cuba, but also from other places, such as the Middle East, Africa, Asia and South America. As a result, that means they'll have access to all the information they need, so they can get to know us better. Also, as far as Guantanamo is concerned, this is an important part of what's going on in terms of prisoners' lives and how they live and work here. Is it fair to say that Guantanamo has become a prison? I don't think so. Let's see if we can find out for sure. Do you have any idea how long it will last? Let me know what you think about that.

But now they should take care that Great Britain does not move further away from Europe, writes Birgit Maass. If only they had done it out of full conviction. If they at least believed that they could really benefit their country by withdrawing from the EU. But many of the parliamentarians whose vote will finally set Brexit on its wayhave voted against their hearts, as well as their minds. It was a vote against their minds, because the withdrawal from the EU will almost certainly, at least on a short to medium term basis, have negative repercussions for the British economy. And it was a vote against their hearts, because for many, a view of the future, divorced from Brussels and increasingly reliant on an unpredictable US President Donald Trump, is somewhat alarming. In recent days, many members of parliament have described it as \"a catastrophe.\" No vote \"against the will of the people.\" Of course there are \"Brexiteers\" who believe that a Britain independent of Brussels will be able to return to its former greatness, once it is no longer held back by the \"Little Europeans.\" But they are in the minority - the majority of parliamentarians already declared their support for remaining in the EU during the referendum campaign. Yet despite this, Theresa May's government was able to push its legislative proposal through the House of Commons without any great difficulty. The predominant view, also amongst members of the two leading parties, is that to hinder Brexit and to fail to support the government in its endeavors to do so, would be to go \"against the will of the people.\" Anti-EU newspapers have targeted Brexit opponents. And those who have publically come out in support of the EU have had to reckon with death threats. The at times passionate debate in the lower house, that went on over several days, was a temporary highlight in this European tragedy, which in the worst case could contribute to the continent disintegrating into individual sovereign states. Don't be intimidated The British public supports the hard-line position taken by Prime Minister May in withdrawing from the common market. Polls are showing that her strategy is gaining increased support. There is no turning back now. The British are now looking for clarity on the repercussions of their withdrawal from the EU. They want the negotiations with the EU to start as soon as possible. It was an historical misjudgement by David Cameron that he could win the referendum. Most of the members of the lower house believed the then-prime minister and voted to hold a referendum. But now they can no longer stop Brexit. But they should not let themselves be intimidated by party discipline, nor the leading Brexiteers, nor by voter impatience. Over the next two years they should use every chance they can to influence the withdrawal process. May announced that although they are leaving the European Union, they will not be moving away from Europe. The parliamentarians must now hold her to her word. Have something to say?

        "generated_story": "Brexit vote 'not a referendum against the will of the people' The British government has announced that it will vote to leave the European Union. Prime Minister Theresa May has said that the referendum will not be a \"no-confidence vote\" in the country's parliament. She said the vote would be held on May's first day in office. \"We have decided that we are not going to have another referendum,\" May told the House of Commons in a speech on Thursday. The prime minister said she would hold a vote on the issue in parliament on March 29. But she did not rule out the possibility of a second referendum, she said, adding that \"it is not a question of whether or not the British people will be able to vote for the EU.\" She added that she was \"very optimistic\" about the future of Britain's relationship with Europe, saying that there was no need for a third referendum in which the UK would have to be left out of Europe. May, however, rejected the idea that Britain should be excluded from the bloc's single market and the single currency, the pound, as a result of Brexit. In a statement, May said: \"I am very optimistic that this vote will lead to a new era of prosperity and prosperity for our country. I am also very confident that our government will continue to work towards this goal. We have a lot of work ahead of us, and we will work very hard to achieve that goal.\" The UK government also said it was committed to continuing to pursue a free trade agreement with other EU member states, including the US, Canada, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand. However, it also pointed to the fact that many EU countries have already begun to look at the prospect of an EU withdrawal as an opportunity for Britain to move forward with its plans for its own economic and political future. It is also important to note that, unlike the United States, Britain does not have the ability to unilaterally withdraw from its EU membership. That is why it has been so difficult to predict the outcome of this year's referendum. There is still a long way to go before we can make a decision on whether to accept the terms of our withdrawal agreement, which is set to take effect in March 2019. This is the first time since the end of World War II in 1945 that a single EU country has voted to withdraw its membership of NATO. Since then, there have been a number of developments that have led to uncertainty and uncertainty. One of those developments is Brexit, for example, when it comes to trade negotiations with China, Russia and South Korea. On the other hand, Brexit is a very different story. Trade negotiations are still going on in Brussels, where the two countries are at loggerheads over what to do with each other's trade deals and how to deal with the consequences of their respective countries' trade agreements. And it's not just Brexit that is at stake, but also the relationship between Britain and its European partners. Brexit negotiations have also been at an impasse, with both sides saying they want to see a deal in place before the second half of next year. Both sides have said they are open to negotiations on a future trade deal and that they expect to reach an agreement within the next two to three months. With the Brexit vote now in play, this could be the last chance for British negotiators to make progress on their plan for an exit from NATO, a move that could have an impact on trade relations with Russia, Iran, China and North Korea as well as on economic relations between the world's two largest economies."

        "target": "A Brief History of the Seaside Holiday These days, millions take seaside holidays for granted as one of life's pleasures. But 200 years ago, a dip in the sea was more a test of courage. Hardly anyone could swim. As late as the 18th century, many Europeans still thought of the sea as the realm of Satan: storm-tossed and inhabited by terrifying monsters. \"Unlike the mountains, the coasts were terra incognita as a holiday spot,\" says Manfred B\u00e4tje, director of the Bade-Museum on the North Sea island of Norderney. Anyone who set foot in the water was \"stepping into the unknown\". Brighton showed the way That only began to change after the British aristocracy discovered the healing power of salt water. As early as 1780, Brighton, England's biggest and oldest seaside resort, was a bustling spa. Philosopher and physicist Georg Christoph Lichtenberg (1742-1799) of G\u00f6ttingen gave Germans the starting signal with his 1793 essay \"Why doesn't Germany have any large public seaside resorts?\" In it, he called for the creation of a resort in Cuxhaven on the North Sea. He received support from the most notable German physician of the time, the Prussian king's court physician, Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland. But things turned out somewhat differently. Germany's first seaside resort was indeed built in September, 1793, but in Heiligendamm on the Baltic Sea. Four years later, permission was granted for construction of Germany's first resort on the North Sea, on Norderney. \"For the first bathing season on July and August of 1800, only around 250 guests turned up. Now, the nearly 6000 residents host a good 530,000 bathers annually, plus around 230,000 day-trippers,\" B\u00e4tje reels off the figures. Romanticist inspiration In the 19th century, the landscapes of Caspar David Friedrich, such as his famous Chalk Cliffs on R\u00fcgen (1818), gave seaside holidays added impetus. From then on, the sea was no longer a voracious beast. From the shore, the cultivated, modern European contemplated the vast melancholy of the deep. \"The calm sea became an embodiment of unspecified yearning, the waves an expression of vitality and dynamism,\" soliloquizes museum director B\u00e4tje. But the journey to the sea long remained an arduous, time-consuming one. It took the mail coach a good thirty hours to cover the distance from Hamburg to the North Frisian town of Aurich over bumpy, muddy roads. The express cab from Bremen only took about 16 hours to reach the East Frisian town of Norden - including six changes of horses along the way. \"It wasn't comfortable,\" explains B\u00e4tje. Not until the introduction of seaside tourist steamers out of Hamburg and Bremen to the islands and the expansion of the railways did the journey become easier. Strict bathing rules At first, it was primarily the well-to-do bourgeois and nobility who were able to afford a seaside holiday. Victorian-era society is known for its extreme prudishness, and the beach was not exempt. Bathing machines were essentially changing cabins on wheels that could be rolled into the surf. The sexes were kept strictly separated. Wet swimsuits could not be allowed to cling, thus revealing the body's contours. Women sported baggy flannel garments with bloomers underneath that swiftly became waterlogged to where the bather was risking her life. Hardly anyone really knew how to swim anyway. \"Most bathers wouldn't stay in the water any more than two minutes, often just seconds at a time. The English had a rule: 'Three dips and out',\" quips archivist Manfred B\u00e4tje, whose Bade-Museum is housed in a building for a former wave pool, just a few steps from Norderney's Weststrand, where, during the summer months, vacationers sunbathe in wicker beach chairs and on blankets, cooled by a salty sea breeze. Sunbathing first came in style early in the 20th century, and the first true swimsuits were produced in the United States. \"Starting in 1919, today's bathing culture gradually began to take shape,\" B\u00e4tje looks back. At the same time, ideals of beauty were in flux - such as the attitude towards tan skin, which had long been regarded as a mark of farmers and manual laborers. B\u00e4tje: \"People were still cultivating their genteel pallors.\" Water, Waves, Wellness Today, the sun worshipers are the devout masses, and seaside holidays are their pilgrimages. The North Sea resorts alone count some 12.9 million overnight stays annually. Health is once again a primary concern: sea air, sea water, sea salts and the algaes and mud used in",
        "generated_story": "A Brief History of the Seaside Holiday In Germany, the seaside holiday has become an important tourist attraction. The Bade-Museum in Bremen is one of Germany's most popular tourist attractions. It is located on the Chalk Cliffs on R\u00fcgen in the German state of Heiligendamm, close to the coast of England. There is also a museum in Norderney, near Cologne, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This is the first of its kind in Germany. In the 19th century, it was the most famous holiday in Europe, with a total of more than 1,000 ships passing through the area every year. During this time, there was a great deal of interest in German culture and history, and a lot of people from all over the world came to Germany to enjoy it. But it wasn't always this way. For example, in 1887, when the British Empire invaded the Baltic Sea, Germany was still very much a part of European history. And then there were the Germans, who came from the Middle East and Scandinavia and settled in North America. These days, they are still a bit of a mystery to many Germans. They don't really know what they're doing, but they do know that there is something very special about the sea. That's why we have a very long list of places that are famous for their beauty and the beauty of their seas. I think it's important to remember that this is not just a holiday for the rich and famous. You can't just go on and on about your holiday, you have to go to other places and do your own thing. What do you do with your time? Do you like to spend time with the people who come to you? You do not have time to think about all the things that you're going to do in your life. So you spend some time in a different country. Then you go back to your home country, where you can spend a few days with all your friends and family and spend the rest of your days at home. If you want to stay in one place for a while, that's a good place to be, because it gives you a chance to see the whole world. \"It's very interesting to me that people come from different countries and different cultures to come here,\" said Christoph Lichtenberg, a professor of history at the University of North Rhine-Westphalia (UWK). \"They come and go and they come back again and again,\" he said, adding that he was \"very impressed\" by the number of visitors. He also said that many of them were \"a lot more adventurous than I was.\" \"I think they came here because they were looking for something that was very different from what I had.\" He added that the \"experience\" of sailing was also important for him, as it gave him the opportunity to study the history of his country and to learn more about his own country's culture. After all, his father was an Englishman and his mother was born in Cuxhaven, so he had to travel to England as a child. Today, he's still living in Brighton. His father is still alive and well and he has a son, Caspar David Friedrich. On the other hand, I'm not sure if he'll ever be able to return to his native country again. As far as I know, my father still lives in England and I have no idea where he is from. My father used to live in London. When he moved to Brighton in 1787 he became a teacher and then he went to school in Berlin. Now he teaches at a university in D\u00fcsseldorf and now he runs a business school there. At the age of 70 he started a company called \"The German Institute for Maritime Studies,\" which specializes in maritime archaeology and is known for its research on sea life and culture, particularly in areas such as the Mediterranean Sea. Since then the institute has been expanding its activities in this area and has opened up a new branch of research into the subject of sea travel. Lichtman, however, is no longer interested in studying the topic. Instead he wants to focus on his family's history in other areas, like in his home town of Hockenm\u00fcnster. According to L\u00fcbeck, this will be the last time he will visit his son's birthplace. A few years ago he visited his daughter's hometown of Brighton and she and her family moved there with his wife and their two children. Her father died of cancer in 1972, leaving her ailing. She is now a mother of two."

The lockdown was lifted by US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on Friday after a man opened fire at a military facility outside Washington, D.C. on Thursday morning, killing at least one person and injuring more than 100 others. A spokesman for the White House said the president had lifted the lockdown after the incident, which took place at Camp Springs, Maryland, about an hour and a half north of Washington. \"We have no reason to believe that this is an isolated incident,\" the spokesman said in a statement. Obama also said he was \"deeply concerned\" about the threat posed by the shooting, adding that \"we have to be very careful in the future.\" The statement came hours after US Secretary of Defense James Mattis, who was visiting the base, told reporters that the attack was an \"isolated incident\" and that there was no immediate danger to the public. He added that he would not comment further on the matter until the investigation is complete. In a tweet, Obama said: \"I am deeply concerned about this incident.

Last week, the Obama administration announced that it would no longer allow military personnel to leave the military bases, citing \"a lack of evidence\" that could lead to an escalation of violence. On Thursday, President Obama issued a travel ban for US troops stationed in Afghanistan and Iraq, saying the move \"would not affect our ability to defend our national security.\" On Friday, military officials in Washington said they would continue to monitor the situation closely, with a view to making sure that no further action was taken. Military officials said there were no indications of an imminent threat. However, they did not rule out a possible military deployment to Afghanistan or the Middle East."

        "target": "Threat of the Punjabi Taliban is growing Deutsche Welle talks to Pakistani political expert Hasan Askari Rizvi about the growing ties between militants in northwest Pakistan and Punjab province. At least four gunmen disguised in police uniforms raided a hospital in Pakistan's eastern city of Lahore on Monday night, claiming at least five lives. Local officials said the gunmen were trying to free a militant, who was being treated there after being captured during attacks on two mosques last Friday. The police said the gunfight at Jinnah Hospital had lasted around 45 minutes but the gunmen had managed to flee. Friday's twin attacks on the minority Ahmadi community left more than 90 people dead. They were claimed by a group, which identified itself as the Punjabi wing of the Taliban. Deutsche Welle spoke to political expert Hasan Askari Rizvi in Lahore, where there has been a wave of violence in recent days. DW: Who are the \"Punjabi Taliban\"? It is a kind of a pejorative term, which includes a host of groups. Initially in Punjab, you had two types of militancy: One, the groups that focussed mainly on Indian-administered Kashmir and there were other types of groups that focussed on Pakistan. Those were the sectarian groups targeting mainly the Shias, and there were some Shia groups targeting the Sunni leadership. Over the years a lot of factions have broken away from these groups and these small entities are functioning more or less autonomously. They have trainings in the tribal areas because these are secured for them and certain parts are not under Pakistani control so these groups go there. They operate with the Pakistani Taliban based in tribal areas against the Pakistani troops in the region. They also have an autonomous agenda, which they pursue in Punjab, as they have been doing in the past days. These groups also play host or are a kind of a local link to Taliban suicide bombers who come into the main part of Pakistan from the tribal areas (let's say to Punjab). If they have to target some place, they park themselves with these Punjab groups, and then do it. All these factions and groups that have broken away from traditional militant groups and are functioning in close collaboration with tribal area Taliban are often described as the \"Punjabi Taliban\". Why do you think these militants are resurfacing now? They have always existed here and there and generally the trend is that they undertake a couple of operations, one after the other. Then the government comes in and takes action against them. Then they just disappear or become sleeping groups and suddenly after a couple of months they resurface. That's the standard pattern. The last major incident in Lahore was in the first week of March. Then there was nothing in April and now towards the end of May you have this kind of incident. Do you think the government should have taken stronger action against them? They should have but the problem is that the Punjab government has a kind of ambiguous approach and I think there is some element of denial within the leadership also. These groups also have some sympathy if not support at the societal level and that makes it difficult for the government to go against them openly. They need to work together and to emphasise to the people that they are terrorists. They use different names and Islam but actually their agenda is terrorism. Somehow the government of Punjab has been rather confused and ambiguous regarding these groups. Interview: Disha Uppal Editor: Anne Thomas",

He was 45. The Catalan club announced the death of its former bench boss in a statement posted on its website on Friday. \"FC Barcelona is in immense mourning. Tito Vilanova has died at the age of 45. May he rest in peace,\" the statement said. Vilanova had first been diagnosed with a tumor in a saliva gland in November 2011, while he was an assistant to then-Barcelona head coach Pep Guardiola. He had been battling against recurring cancer ever since and had been admitted to a Barcelona hospital last week. He led Barca to the Primera Liga title last season, his only campaign as head coach, when the Catalans earned a record-tying 100 points. Last July he stepped down due to his ongoing health problems.

        "generated_story": "Catalan coach Tito Vilanova dies in hospital after battle with cancer Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola has announced the death of former FC Barcelona head coach and current Barcelona player Titos Vilavan. The Catalan coach has been battling cancer for more than a year and a half. Last week, he suffered a heart attack and died in a hospital in Barcelona. He had been suffering from cancer since he was in his mid-30s, according to a statement released by the Catalan football federation. \"Tito was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer in the early stages of his life,\" the statement said. Vilnava, who was born in 1957, died on Sunday at the age of 41. His family said he had undergone chemotherapy and radiation treatments in preparation for his return to the club, and that his health had improved significantly since then. In his last few days, the 41-year-old coach said that he felt \"very, very good\" and was \"well-rested.\" \"I feel very well,\" he said, adding that \"it was good to see him again and I'm very happy that we were able to get him back on track.\" He also expressed his gratitude for the support he received during his time at Barcelona, saying that it was a \"great honor\" to be part of a club that has become one of the most successful in Spain's Primera Liga. But he also stressed the importance of having a positive attitude towards the sport, which he described as \"the most important thing in my life right now.\" The coach added that the team's success was due in large part to its ability to compete with Barcelona's top-flight football team, Barcelona FC, on the field and in front of thousands of fans. However, it is unclear whether the coach will continue to work with the Catalans, or if he will take a leave of absence to focus on his football career. According to Catalan media reports, Guardiola said the former Barcelona and FC coach had a good relationship with his players, but that they were not close to each other in any way. Guardiola, however, said his team was still working on a plan to develop a new coaching staff in order to improve the squad's chances of reaching the next level. Speaking to Spanish daily El Mundo, a spokesman for Barcelona said: \"The club is working very hard to make sure that all the players are well. We have a lot of work ahead of us and we are very optimistic about the future of our club and our future.\" In addition to his medical work, Vilanava also worked as a medical consultant for a number of companies in Catalonia, Spain and the United States, where he worked for several years. At the end of last year, his wife and two children were living with him in an apartment near his Barcelona home. They had moved to Barcelona after he passed away in 2014. It is not clear how long he would continue working with them, although he is said to have been in intensive care for some time. A medical report released last week suggested he may have suffered from prostate cancer. An MRI scan showed the cancer had spread to multiple organs. There was no definitive indication of any organ damage. On Sunday, an MRI exam showed no cancer at all. And the results were expected to show no signs of damage from the chemotherapy. That is, until Monday, when the MRI results showed a benign growth in lymphoma. This is the second time in less than two years that a cancer patient has died at a Barcelona hospital. Earlier this month, there was an increase in cancer cases, leading to an increased risk of death for those who are not well-versed in sports medicine, such as cancer patients. One of those patients is a neurosurgeon who specializes in bone marrow transplant surgery. Another is an orthopedic surgeon who works with patients with leukemia. Both of these patients were treated for cancer and are in stable condition. While the prognosis for their condition is good, they will have to wait a few more years before they can be discharged. For the rest of their lives, their health will be monitored closely. If they are to recover fully, then it will depend on how well they recover from their chemotherapy treatments and whether or not they have the necessary treatment. Many of them will need to undergo chemotherapy for at least two to three months. Meanwhile, other patients have also been admitted to hospitals, including a kidney specialist and an endocrinologist, to treat the condition that is linked to kidney failure. These patients are being treated by a team of specialists in Madrid. Author: Rachael G\u00fcntermann"
