        "target": "Opinion: Obama's Cuban revolution President Barack Obama has made a very special declaration of love to Cuba. It's as revolutionary as the Cuban revolution, and as peaceful as the biblical Sermon on the Mount, says DW's Astrid Prange. US President Barack Obama has lost his old communist \"enemy,\" and Cuban President Raul Castro has lost his hatred of capitalism. In the first phone call from president to president since 1961 the two heads of state came to a surprisingly swift agreement. They want to renew diplomatic relations, which have been on ice for more than 50 years, and exchange ambassadors. It's only a matter of time before the US lifts its trade embargo against Cuba. All the word \"embargo\" is really good for - at this stage - is as an ideological soapbox for political hardliners, especially Republicans in Congress who believe lifting sanctions would constitute defeat for the US. Yet the lifting of the embargo has already begun. In addition to medication, it has been possible since 2000 to export agricultural produce such as maize, cereal crops, and poultry to Cuba. Flirting with the rogue state Furthermore, 100,000 US citizens have travelled to Cuba since 2011 for cultural and scientific exchanges. Travel restrictions on Cubans living in exile in the US who wanted to visit their relatives on the island were also lifted. According to press reports, the two countries' military forces are even said to be cooperating, as are their coastguards, and military on the border of the US marine base in Guantanamo. Now Obama wants to officially open a \"new chapter\" in relations with the communist Caribbean island and remove Cuba from the US list of so-called \"rogue states\" that support terrorism. The travel ban on American tourists visiting the island will also largely be lifted. That's as far as things will go for the time being, as Obama would require a majority in Congress in Washington to lift the embargo entirely. But even if these are only small steps, the fall of the American-Cuban wall has begun. The easing of the sanctions and the resumption of diplomatic relations are setting the scene for an end to the embargo. Embargo as scapegoat The tearing down of this \"wall in the mind\" is long overdue. The blockade is obsolete, and has proved to be entirely ineffective. More than this, its advocates have achieved the opposite of what they actually wanted. The blockade has provided the leaders in Havana with an easy excuse for their economic failure. Raul Castro realized long ago that Cuba's economic problems can no longer be justified simply by citing the US embargo. It looks as though he was counting on the blockade being lifted: There is no other explanation for the completion of the Mariel container port in January this year. Cuba's biggest infrastructure project was, incidentally, financed by Brazil. The Brazilians also sent a declaration of love to Cuba. Raul Castro opened the door to them. He loves anyone who helps him - his friends even more than his enemies.",
        "generated_story": "Cuba: The Fall of the Wall in the Mind of President Barack Obama US President Obama has announced the end of Cuba's military prison system. The announcement comes just days after the Cuban government announced that it would close its main prison, the notorious Sermon on the Mount, in Cuba. Cuban President Raul Castro announced his decision to close the prison in 2011, just a few months after he took office. Obama's announcement came a day after his inauguration in a ceremony at the US embassy in Havana, where he was sworn in as US president. In a speech delivered in front of a packed house of Cuban Congressmen and women, Obama said that he would not allow the military to enter the country without a warrant. \"We are going to do everything in our power to protect our people,\" he said, adding that his administration would continue to fight for the rights of Cubans and their rights to self-determination. He also called for a \"total and complete end to the war on terrorism,\" which has killed more than 1.5 million people since it was established in 1961. US Congress, which is dominated by Republicans, voted in favor of closing the Guantanamo detention center in 2000. But the Obama administration has been unable to convince Congress to allow it to be used as a prison for dissidents and dissidents. Astrid Prange, a member of Congress from Brazil, told DW that the president's decision was \"in the best interests of our country\" and that \"the Cuban people have a right to know what is happening in their own country.\" The US has long been accused of using the detention facility for political purposes, but the accusations against Castro have been dismissed as \"baseless.\" \"The Cuban regime has always been a hostile country,\" said the former US ambassador to Cuba, who is now a professor of political science at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government in Washington, D.C."

        "target": "Italy's president Napolitano announces imminent resignation Citing his advanced age, Italy's President Giorgio Napolitano has announced his plan to resign. The 89-year-old did not say when exactly his resignation would take effect. Calling the move a personal decision, President Giorgio Napolitano made his announcement during an end-of-year speech on Wednesday. \"I'm about to step down, to resign as the constitution expressly allows,\" he said, adding. \"I've reached an age that brings with it growing limitations and difficulties for me to do my institutional duties, which are complex and very demanding.\" Though he did not say when his resignation would take effect, a potential date is January 13 when Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi is due to give up the country's rotating six-month presidency of the Council of the European Union. Renzi faces a political challenge in organizing a replacement for Napolitano, dubbed by Italian media as \"King George.\" The president has served as a key intermediary between political parties through numerous changes in government and other tricky political situations. Napolitano, a former communist respected by Europe and Washington, took office in 2006. At the end of his seven-year mandate in 2013, he was asked to stay on because parliament could not agree on his successor. At the time he warned he may not serve out the full term, given his age. In Italy, presidents have loosely-defined powers including the ability to nominate prime ministers, dissolve parliament and veto legislation, as well as use the moral authority of the office to influence politics. se/cmk (dpa, Reuters)",
        "generated_story": "Italy's Napolitano resigns as president Italy's president has resigned as prime minister, replacing Matteo Renzi. The resignation comes after months of speculation over whether the president would step down. Italian Prime Minister Giorgio Napoli announced his resignation on Wednesday, a day after he was named president of the European Union (EU) on January 13. \"I regret to inform you that I have accepted the resignation of my president,\" Napolano said in a statement released by his office. He had been in office since 2006, when the then-prime minister of Italy was elected to the post of president in 2006. His term ended in 2013, and he took office in January 2013. At the time, he served as the country's longest-serving president. During his tenure, the Italian government was one of only a handful of countries in the EU to have a president who was not a member of its executive body. In the months that followed, his term was reduced to four years, with the exception of a few months when he resigned in 2014. On the day of his ouster, Italy announced that it would no longer be able to nominate a new president until the end of this year. It was also the first time that a sitting president had taken the oath of office, after the elections of 2006 and 2007, without consulting the Council of Europe, which was set to be held in mid-January. Italy has been on the brink of bankruptcy for the past five years and has yet to make a decision on whether it will continue to do so. Last year, it was the United States that made the decision to step aside from the rotating presidency. Since then, however, Italian officials have said that they have not made any decisions about whether they will stay on or leave the position. They have also said they are not aware of any new appointments being made by the outgoing president, who is due to take over in February. A spokesman for Italy\u2019s foreign ministry said it had no immediate plans to change the constitution, but that the new constitution would be adopted in accordance with international law."

        "target": "Switzerland Calls on Private Security Firms for Euro 2008 In addition to enlisting foreign police during Euro 2008, Switzerland will also be bringing in private security personnel from Germany, reported a Swiss newspaper. \"We have to turn to about 500 private security personnel from Germany,\" Urs Stadler, spokesman for a security firm consortium told the Monday, May 26, edition of Swiss newspaper Tages Anzeiger. \"Most of them were already in operation during the World Cup two years ago, and have relevant experience,\" added Stadler from Prisec, a consortium made up of the companies Protectas and Securitas. The spokesman said more help was needed, but could not give exact numbers \"due to pending assignments.\" Recent soccer violence raises concern Swiss media has been questioning the security preparations for Euro 2008 after a spate of violence at recent games. In the latest incident, seats were ripped out and a goal post wrenched from the ground after St. Gallen faced the prospect of relegation following a 2-0 defeat to Bellinzona on May 20. St. Gallen was the third incident in a month that saw violent clashes with police who twice resorted to rubber bullets and tear gas. While Switzerland is seen as a low risk country in terms of hooliganism, violence has been on the increase in recent years and estimates claim there are around 400 hooligans and 600 sympathizers. Swiss Sports Minister Samuel Schmid said that hooliganism cannot be ruled out, reported German news agency DPA. But he expressed his belief that extra measures such as more policing, restrictions on alcohol -- which he has called \"a catalyst for violence\" -- and video surveillance will help keep trouble at bay. Private firms to boost European police The private security companies will be responsible for patrolling the stadiums and their surroundings, as well as the public viewing areas, team hotels and trainings areas. An international police force will manage the rest. Switzerland has committed some 31,200 police officers and soldiers. Another 1,700 police will be sent from Germany, which will have the authority to make arrests. France will offer the third largest contingent with 750 officers and Croatia, Poland, Sweden, Greece, Russia and Spain will also send reinforcements.",

Conservative members of Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition put forward a united front at the weekend against recent developments in the city of Wuppertal. Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said civilians wearing uniforms bearing the logo \"Shariah police\" could not simply start patrolling German streets. The groups reportedly hovered around sites like discotheques and gambling houses, telling passers-by to refrain from gambling and alcohol. Wuppertal's police have begun pressing charges. \"Sharia law is not tolerated on German soil,\" de Maiziere told mass-circulation daily Bild on Saturday. \"Nobody can take it upon themselves to abuse the good name of the German police.\" Justice Minister Heiko Maas, meanwhile, told Bild that \"the state alone\" was responsible for the administration of justice in Germany. It was obvious, Maas said, that any illegal parallel system of law enforcement would not be tolerated. Christian Democrat party whip Volker Kauder was similarly emphatic in an interview to be published in this week's Welt am Sonntag newspaper. \"Under absolutely no circumstances can we tolerate self-styled 'Sharia police officers' patrolling our streets and dictating what people should or should not do,\" Kauder said. Ringleader: goal was attention The 33-year-old behind the Wuppertal patrols, former fireman Sven Lau, published a video on his website on Saturday. Lau said that a \"Sharia police\" never existed, and that a group of men had simply worn the mock uniforms for a few hours. \"We knew that this would raise attention,\" Lau said, claiming that his goal was to spark a debate about Sharia law in Germany. Lau is a leading member of Germany's Salafist movement, advocates of a strict Sunni interpretation of political Islam. He works with a mosque in his native M\u00f6nchengladbach, not far west of Wuppertal, and used to head the fundamentalist group \"Invitation to Paradise.\" (Einladung zum Paradies, in German.) The central council of Muslims in Germany (ZMD) condemned the activities. \"These few teen yobs do not speak in our name,\" chairman Ayman A. Mazyek told the Tagesspiegel am Sonntag newspaper. \"These people are perverting the name of our religion. With this shrill and foolish action, they are really hurting Muslims.\" Sharia law is the Arabic term for a legal system based on the Koran. Saudi Arabia and Iran are examples of countries where such a system officially applies. Wearing a veil is obligatory for women and corporal punishment such as stoning is legally tolerated. Human Rights Watch reported last month that Saudi Arabia had beheaded 19 people in just 16 days in August, for convictions on charges ranging from cannabis smuggling to \"sorcery.\" msh/rc (AFP, dpa, Reuters)",

        "target": "MSF says Ebola 'fast,' medics 'facing war-like scenario' The medical charity MSF has warned that western Africa's Ebola crisis is \"moving faster\" than medics can cope with. Its warning follows a WHO admission that the epidemic requires \"extraordinary measures.\" The head of Medicins Sans Frontieres (MSF), Joanne Liu -- fresh from a visit to western Africa -- said in Geneva on Friday that more experts were needed in the hard-hit region. \"It is deteriorating faster, and moving faster, than we can respond to,\" Liu told reporters. \"Like in a war time, we have a total collapse of infrastructure,\" she added. Lui said the world community needed to get the \"upper hand\" over the next six months. While the viral spread had been slowed in Guinea, concerns focused especially on Liberia. \"If we don't stabilize Liberia, we will never stabilize the region,\" Lui said. She was critical of the WHO for delaying its public health emergency warning until August 8. \"We need people with a hands-on operational mindset,\" to combat the outbreak, Liu told the Geneva news briefing. WHO - 'vastly underestimated' On Thursday, the World Health Organization (WHO) said the scale of the epidemic had been \"vastly underestimated\" and that \"extraordinary measures\" were needed to contain the contagious virus. The UN health agency said the death toll had climbed to 1,069 in four afflicted countries, spanning Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia and more recently Nigeria. Sierra Leone's chief medical officer Brima Kargbo disclosed on Thursday that at least 32 of the nation's nurses and doctors had died from the Ebola virus while performing their duties between May 24 and August 13. Local staff suffered stigma, despite saving lives, Kargbo said. \"We still have to break the chain of transmission to separate the infected from the uninfected.\" Youth Olympics also affected The mounting alarm coincided with an announcement Friday from the International Olympics Committee that three athletes from Ebola-hit countries had been barred from competing in pool events and combat sports at the Youth Olympics opening in China on Saturday. ipj/tj (AfP, Reuters)",
        "generated_story": "World Health Organization warns Ebola crisis is'moving faster than it should be' The world's largest medical charity has warned that the Ebola outbreak in West Africa is moving faster and more rapidly than previously thought. The WHO said on Friday that it was \"impeding\" efforts to contain the spread of the virus, which has killed more than 2,000 people in the past two weeks. \"We are not moving fast enough,\" the WHO chief medical officer, Joanne Liu, told a news conference in Geneva. She said the outbreak was spreading rapidly in Sierra Leone, Liberia, Nigeria and Nigeria as well as in Nigeria, adding that there was a \"clear and present danger\" of spreading the disease to other countries, particularly in developing countries such as Nigeria. In a statement released Friday, the UN said it would continue to monitor the situation in all countries affected by the epidemic, including Liberia and the West African countries of Guinea. It also called on the international community to step up its support for the fight against Ebola and to provide medical assistance to those suffering from the illness. On Thursday, UN health chief Zeid Ra'ad al-Hodgabi urged the world to take action against the growing outbreak, saying it could lead to the death of hundreds of thousands of people across the globe. At the same time, he called for an end to Ebola's spread to all health services in Africa, especially in countries where it is more common than in other parts of Africa. According to a UN report released on May 24, a total of 1.4 million people died of Ebola in Guinea and Liberia during the first three months of this year, up from 1,500 in May, according to WHO data. That figure is expected to rise to 2.6 million by August 13, it said, as the number of deaths from Ebola rises to 3.5 million. A WHO spokesman told the AFP news agency on Thursday that \"there is a real danger that this outbreak is spreading quickly and that we are going to have to deal with it in a very, very big way.\" The UN also warned on Saturday that an outbreak of hemorrhagic fever in some countries is likely to continue until at least the end of August. There is also a risk that Ebola could spread even more quickly to people who are still in high-risk conditions."

It sided with a German firm in its legal battle with US giant Oracle. The European Court of Justice on Tuesday ruled that used software licenses may generally be resold by individuals or companies. The Luxembourg-based court thus sided with the German firm UsedSoft in a protracted legal battle with US software giant Oracle. The ruling made it clear that trade in used software was permissible even if the software had not been shipped on a physical medium such as a CD or DVD, but had been digitally downloaded from the Internet. UsedSoft's business model hinges completely on reselling used packages or legally obtained license keys for them. By reselling the keys to clients, the latter are then able to download the latest version of a given program directly from a company's Internet site and obtain all new updates and patches in the process. Legal clarity Oracle had sued UsedSoft over its business model, trying to prevent buyers of used software licenses from downloading programs again. But the European court ruled that the so-called principle of exhaustion applied whenever software was originally sold to a customer for an unlimited time span, not giving the maker of the software the right to prevent the resale of that software. \"The door for the trade in used software has been pushed wide open throughout the European Union,\" UsedSoft said in a statement, welcoming \"perfect legal safety on the market.\" The court in Luxembourg emphasized, though, that whoever resold pieces of original software and their accompanying licenses must erase every copy on their own computers in advance and was not allowed to keep a copy after resale. hg/mz (AFP, dpa)",

The court in Luxembourg ruled on Tuesday that software that is downloaded and stored in a computer is not liable for copyright infringement. A decision by the European Union's top court, which is part of the EU's anti-trust body, is the first of its kind in the bloc to rule on the legality of reselling software. In a decision published on its website Tuesday, the court said that the software can be downloaded without the user having to pay for it. \"This is an important step in protecting the rights of users,\" the ruling said. Earlier this month, a court had ruled in favor of a similar ruling by a US-based software giant, Oracle, in an appeal to European courts to prevent the sale of pirated software, including CD-ROMs, DVDs, CDs and DVDs. It also ruled against the US and other US companies that had downloaded software and used it to sell their products, such as DVDs and Blu-ray Discs. That ruling, however, was upheld by Luxembourg's lower court. Author: hg/mz (AFP, dpa)"

The Curiosity rover will soon re-start its sluggish search for signs of life. NASA's Mars rover, \"Curiosity,\" will wrap up a lengthy self-testing phase on Thursday, freeing it up to continue exploring the surface of the Red Planet. Mission manager Jennifer Tropser told reporters in a conference call on Wednesday evening that the plan, once the final checks were completed, was to \"drive, drive, drive\" until Curiosity discovers a rock suitable for analysis. She added that the instrument checks have delivered positive results. \"Through every phase of the check-out, Curiosity has performed almost flawlessly,\" Tropser said. \"The success so far of these activities has been outstanding.\" Many of the tests have concerned Curiosity's robotic arm. The 2.1-meter (7-feet) appendage will be used to pick out and sample rocks and soil. NASA is investigating whether Mars can sustain life, or whether it could in the past. The tests were designed to identify any damage sustained during its interplanetary flight and also to ensure that the arm still functioned properly on Mars, with its different temperatures and gravity. The Mars rover landed in the giant Gale Crater, near the Martian equator, on August 5; it has so far moved about 109 meters within the crater. The rover is traveling east, heading first to an intersection called Glenelg, where three types of terrain meet. This is likely to be the location for the first rock and soil samples, though NASA said Curiosity was unlikely to arrive there for several weeks. Curiosity's ultimate destination is the nearby Aeolis Mons or Mount Sharp, a 3-mile-high mound of rock rising out of the crater. Mount Sharp is about 4.3 miles (7 kilometers) away from Curiosity's landing site.

        "target": "Aging health: WHO call to action as world population over 60 set to double by 2050 In a new report on aging and health, the World Health Organization is calling for action on \"population aging,\" as figures suggest the number of people over 60 will reach two billion by 2050. People worldwide are living longer, says the World Health Organization in its World Report on Aging and Health. This is both good and bad. It gives us the chance to \"pursue new activities\" as we get older, such as in education and family life. But it all depends on our health. And for that the WHO says world governments need to act now to make sure our societies worldwide are ready. What are the take home facts from the World Health Organization's 2015 report on Aging and Health? The WHO says that in the next 35 years, the global number of people aged 60 years and over will almost double from 12 percent to 22 percent. By 2020, there will be more people over the age of 60 than 5 year olds. And a majority of older people (80 percent) will live in \"low and middle income\" countries. It's estimated that the world's population aged 60 years and older will total about 2 billion in 2050, which is more than twice as much as now. Furthermore, worldwide, about 125 million people are aged 80 years or older. But by 2050, it is expected that this number of people - aged 80 and over - will live in China alone. But I'm not old, so why should I care? Well, all this is happening at a faster rate than ever before. And the WHO says \"all countries face major challenges to ensure that their health and social systems are ready\" for this major demographic shift. It will cost a lot of money to improve health and social infrastructures, especially in more developed countries where traditional families structures have changed dramatically. Surely, there's \"no typical older person,\" though. How does the WHO define aging? We tend to think of older people as physically and mentally frail. But that's not necessarily the case, not everywhere in the world. Old is a relative concept - especially in middle income to rich countries. For instance, some 70 year olds are as fit as some 20 year olds. Just think how many older folk are at your gym, and ask yourself whether you can keep up with all of them. But that still doesn't explain aging. What is it exactly? The WHO says that at a biological level, \"aging results from the impact of the accumulation of a wide variety of molecular and cellular damage over time.\" Basically, this puts people at a higher risk of disease and, of course, death. But aging can also be associated with \"life transitions,\" such as retirement or witnessing other people, such as friends and family, die around you. This can affect you psychologically and sometimes, as a result, physically. What sort of diseases come with old age? Some of the most common non-fatal conditions include hearing loss, cataracts, back and neck pain and osteoarthritis. Other conditions include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - which affects the lungs - diabetes, depression, and dementia. What needs to be done? The WHO is proposing a five-step plan of action, which includes: Committing to healthy aging and \"evidence-based policies to strengthen the abilities of older persons.\" Aligning health systems with the needs of older populations Developing systems for providing long-term care Creating \"age-friendly cities and communities Improving measurement, monitoring and understanding of \"aging issues\" worldwide. But don't forget: \"a longer life brings with it opportunities, not only for older people and their families, but also for societies as a whole.\"",
        "generated_story": "The WHO's Population Aging Plan: Actions Now The World Health Organization (WHO) has released a new report on the world's population aging plan. The report, published in the latest edition of its annual health survey, predicts that by 2050, more people will be living longer than they were in 2015. According to the WHO, this is due to a combination of factors, such as the ageing of the population, the aging of older people, and the increasing number of people living in poverty. These factors have led to an increase in mortality among people aged 65 and older, as well as a rise in cancer rates among younger people. This is the result of an aging population that is expected to rise by 20 percent in 2050 compared to 2015, according to WHO figures. In addition, it is also expected that the country's ageing population will increase by 2.5 percent by 2020, compared with 1.6 percent for the previous year. \"We are going to have to take action now,\" the report said, adding that it will take time to fully implement the new plan, which aims to reduce the burden of disease and improve the quality of life for people with chronic diseases, including cancer, diabetes and heart disease, among others. It will also be more effective in reducing the risk of death from old age, particularly among those who are suffering from dementia, stroke, cancer and other forms of dementia. However, there is still a long way to go before the plan is ready to be implemented. There is a lot of work to do, but the most important thing is to make sure that we have a plan in place to meet the needs of our aging populations. That is why we are taking steps now to prepare for a future in which we will no longer be able to rely on our own health care systems. We are also taking action to prevent the spread of diseases that can lead to long-term health problems. And we need to ensure that our health systems are well-equipped to cope with the challenges of aging and to provide the necessary support for our ageing populations.\" The WHO said in a report released on Wednesday that \"the WHO is now looking at how we can adapt to this new world of ageing and health.\" It also said that there was a need for new strategies to combat the effects of age-related diseases. But it also pointed out that this was not the case for all the countries that are facing the same challenges. For example, China, for instance, has the highest mortality rate of any major industrialized country, while the United States and Europe have the lowest."

        "target": "All Eyes on Kimi and Ferdy on Schumi's Turf All eyes will be on a Finn and a Spaniard at the German Grand Prix at Hockenheim on Sunday as the title battle between Kimi Raikkonen and Fernando Alonso looks to put local hero Michael Schumacher in the shade. It is a reflection of his current inauspicious Formula One campaign that World Champion Michael Schumacher is only featuring in reports on this weekend's German Grand Prix at Hockenheim dues to his nationality. The home grown champion equaled his own record of 11 wins in a season at last year's race but this year he will be hoping to just get on the podium at the end. Schumi lies in third place some 34 points off the top spot and has a lot to do if he is to record his 85th career win. Ferrari's poor season to date is unlikely to get better with hopes dwindling that the 36-year-old will add to his sole victory of the season although the seven-time world champion characteristically refuses to rule it out. Schumi and Ferrari still in the fight \"Contrary to many other people's opinions, we have in no means written ourselves off, even though we have to admit that the situation has worsened recently, rather than improved,\" said the German, referring to the problems with this season's car. \"But that doesn't mean that it can't be improved again, and that's exactly what we're working on.\" The limelight is falling on two young pretenders to Schumacher's throne as Sunday's race approaches. The battle between McLaren's flying Finn Kimi Raikkonen and championship leader Renault's speedy Spaniard Fernando Alonso is diverting eyes from the world record holding German on his own turf. Kimi aims to keep heat on leader Alonso Raikkonen must finish the German Grand Prix for the first time in five attempts to close the gap on Alonso if he is to keep his own championship hopes alive. The Finn retired from last year's race because of a rear wing failure and this season has been plagued by technical problems which most recently cost him 10 places on the starting grid in each of the last two rounds. Despite those penalties for engine failure, the 25-year-old managed to finish second and third but he will have to increase his total of three race wins if he is to make a significant impression on the 26-point chasm that separates him from Alonso. \"The battle for the championship is still on and I am determined to get a good result and work on closing the gap,\" said the Finn. \"The (car) has good speed and we need to make the most of it this weekend.\" Montoya doing McLaren team mate no favors Raikkonen's car is obviously a fast one this season but he's not the only driver in a McLaren hot seat. Colombia's Juan Pablo Montoya is not to going to make way for his team mate while his own hopes of the title, however small, remain alive. \"I am really looking forward to racing again this weekend in Germany,\" said Montoya, who won at Hockenheim for Williams two years ago and got his first victory for McLaren in Britain two weeks ago. \"I enjoy racing at Hockenheim, I have performed well here and won in the past and I am aiming for a strong result like at Silverstone.\" Consistent Ferdy the man to beat at Hockenheim Championship leader Alonso, meanwhile, has been impressively consistent for Renault so far this season, winning five times and failing to score points only at the Canadian Grand Prix, where he crashed, and in Indianapolis. The Spaniard is setting the pace and the standard this season so, problems aside, Alonso will again be the man to beat at Hockenheim.",
        "generated_story": "Ferrari's Fernando Alonso and McLaren's Juan Pablo Montoya are battling for the German Grand Prix title at Hockenheim on Sunday. The two drivers are locked in a three-way battle to win the Formula One world championship. Ferrari's Michael Schumacher is in pole position ahead of his compatriot Alonso, but the Spaniard, who has won the last three races in the series, has been unable to break into the top 10. \"I don't know if I'm going to be able to do that,\" Alonso told reporters after Sunday's German GP, which was held at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya in southern Spain. Both drivers will be looking for their first victory of the season in Germany, where they will take on Williams, Ferrari, McLaren, Williams and Williams in their respective constructors' championship races next month. Alonso is the only driver to have won a world title in his career, and he is only the second driver in Formula 1 history to achieve that feat. He is also the oldest driver on the grid, with his father Carlos, a former Ferrari driver, racing for McLaren from 1991 to 1996. His father is a retired driver and his mother, his sister and sister-in-law, are also a racing driver. They have a son and a daughter, both of whom were born in Colombia. Their father was a factory driver for Ferrari and their mother worked as a saleswoman at a car dealership in Bremen, Germany. In his native country, the father of two is an engineer and the son of a sports car driver who works for Renault. On the other hand, he has a wife and two children and has no children. It is not his first time competing for a driver's title. Last year he was the world's most successful driver with a total of seven wins and five pole positions. This year, however, it was only his second win in as many races. That's not to say that he doesn't have the potential to make a name for himself in this sport. But he will have to work hard to get the job done in order to keep up with the demands of this year's world championships. And that's just the way the sport is going right now. There's a lot of pressure on him to stay on track and stay focused on his goal of becoming the World Champion. At the same time, there's always the possibility of him winning the title, even if it means losing it to the likes of McLaren or Ferrari. If he can't do it, then he'll be the first man to lose it. However, if he wins the championship, that would be a huge step forward for him and for his team-mates in terms of their ability to compete with each other. So far, so good. I think he's got a good handle on that. We'll see how he handles it in practice and in qualifying. After all, we've got to know him well enough to understand what he does in front of us. Can he win a race like this? Can we win one like that? If not, what do we do? What do you think? Do you have an answer for that?\" The question is, \"What is your answer to that question?\" But the answer is clear: \"It's up to you to answer it.\" That answer will depend on how you answer the question of whether or not you're willing to give up your car for another race or whether you want to take a chance on a new one."

        "target": "US duo shares Nobel Prize for Economics US researcher Elinor Ostrom is the first woman to win the Nobel prize for economics since it was created in 1968. She will share the prestigious award with US compatriot Oliver Williamson. The jury from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said the Americans' research had shown how \"economic analysis can shed light on most forms of social organization.\" Ostrom, a professor at Indiana University, was honored for her \"analysis of economic governance,\" especially in relation to the management of common property or property under common control. The political scientist's work challenges the widely accepted belief that common property is poorly managed and should be either regulated by central authorities or privatized, it added. She carried out numerous studies showing how self-organization and local-level management work to keep common resources viable. Her studies included both natural resources, such as forests, and artificial structures, for example police forces. Ostrom told Swedish television that she felt \"great surprise and appreciation\" and was \"in shock\" about being the first woman to win the prize. The pros and cons of big firms In his work, co-prizewinner Oliver Williamson, of University of California, Berkeley, examines why large corporations tend to arise - and why they do not - based on the cost and complexity of transactions, according to the Nobel committee. \"He has taught us to regard markets, firms, associations, agencies, and even households from the perspective of their contribution to the resolution of conflict,\" the jury said. Williamson authored 'The Economic Institutions of Capitalism' in 1975, a landmark text of the 'new institutional economics' movement that questioned the idea of firms as simple profit-making machines. Last but not least The Nobel prize for economics is the only Nobel award that was not created by the will of Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel in 1896. It was actually founded by the Swedish central bank, the Sverige Riksbank, to celebrate its tri-centenary a year earlier. It was awarded for the first time in 1969 under its official name: the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel. But although it was the last \"Nobel prize\" to be created and the last to be announced each year, the prize is not a poor relation in monetary terms. Winners of the awards for peace, literature, medicine, physiology, chemistry and physics all receive 10 million Swedish crowns (969,000 euros). A good year for women This year was a record year for women laureates. German-Romanian writer Herta Mueller won the Nobel Prize for Literature. Australian-American Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider of the United States were awarded the prize for medicine. And Ada Yonath of Israel was one of three scientists recognized for her work in chemistry. Americans more or less swept the board this year. Nine of the 11 laureates were US citizens. The most prominent of those was US President Barack Obama, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for his \"extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples.\" jg/AFP/dpa/Reuters Editor: Sam Edmonds",

She won the prize in 1968 for her work in economic sciences in memory of Nobel Prize winner Alfred Nobel. The prize was awarded to a Swedish woman in the 1970s and was given to her by the Swedish central bank, Sveriges Riksbank, in honor of the late Nobel laureate, who died in a car accident on the way to the hospital in California in 1969. In a ceremony marking the 50th anniversary of his death, the Stockholm-based bank announced that it would be giving away 10 million Swedish crowns (969,000 euros) to women who had worked for the bank for more than 30 years. \"This is the first time that a woman has been awarded a Nobel prize for economic science,\" a statement said. It also said that women had the right to vote in elections and that they should be able to cast their votes for candidates of all political persuasions.

        "target": "The Sun Sets Slowly Over Brandenburg's Tropical Dream Having suffered many disappointments concerning publically funded projects, the state of Brandenburg hoped a tropical leisure center would offer a ray of hope. Instead the ailing concern is just bringing more gloom. The economically depressed eastern German state of Brandenburg has seen its fair share of bitter experiences when it comes to huge public investment projects since German unification in 1990. Against this background, state authorities were pleased when Malaysian businessman Colin Au built a huge tropical-feeling leisure center in Brandenburg without any subsidies. The center, which opened about a year ago, was to become a symbol of economic success in a region where unemployment still hovers around the 20 percent mark. But the leisure time park, which has already swallowed a little under 100 million euros ($120 million) in private investment, is now going to have to depend on public funding to avoid another economic fiasco in Brandenburg. State authorities in Brandenburg haven't been too successful in their public investment policy in the past 10 years, to put it mildly. A grand plan to build one of the world's most modern chip-producing factories there burst like a bubble in 2003. The much-talked about Brandenburg-Berlin International airport still seems light years away from being built. Line of failures looked to be ended by Au's vision Another beacon of economic hope disappeared in 2002 when a company planning to build gas-filled transport airships went bust despite considerable subsidies. But Au's vision for the abandoned dome which the airship company needed as a hangar offered Brandenburg another chance. In the middle of nowhere, he created what he named his \"Tropical Islands\" wonderland, sporting everything from sandy beaches, lakes and a Laguna to a Caribbean-style village. The economics ministry in Brandenburg was over the moon to see Au originally agreeing to build the facility without any state subsidies. And Au himself had no doubt at the time that he could well do without them. Overestimated visitor numbers tell sorry story But the center's first year in operation tells a different story. Colin Au, who has meanwhile left Brandenburg and transferred matters to a German management company, had expected some 1.5 million visitors to come to Tropical Islands within the first year, but only some 950,000 will have turned up by the end of 2005. It seems highly unlikely that visitor numbers will increase considerably in future, placing a question mark on the viability of the whole centre. But Brandenburg's economics ministry is certain that the park will be in the black as of 2008. To make the place more attractive, it has agreed to shell out 15 million euros in subsidies for yet another reconstruction and marketing effort. After all, the leisure time center has a workforce of about 500 and is thus the biggest employer in an otherwise depressed region marked by a high jobless rate. Tropical center down but not out...not yet \"We hope the money will help make the Tropical Islands resort better known throughout Europe according to the new marketing concept hammered out the management,\" ministry spokesman Steffen Kammrath said. \"This leisure time center is unique and has to be marketed as such. What you have there is a tropical and water world 12 months a year with a lot of attractive offers to spend a whale of a time there.\" Some commentators believe that state subsidies may prolong the center's life span, but will not be able to avoid its demise in the long run. But the idea of also making it more attractive for tourists from all over Europe seems unrealistic to them if the resort's management can't even get enough visitors from home to ensure a profitable operation.",
        "generated_story": "The Sun Sets Slowly Over Brandenburg's Tropical Islands Resort The sun sets slowly over the tropical islands resort in the southern German state of southern Germany. The temperature is expected to drop to around 15 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) by the end of the day on Wednesday. A spokesman for the resort's owner, Colin Au, said the sun was setting slowly. \"The sun has set slowly,\" said Steffen Kammrath, the company's spokesman, adding that the temperature had dropped to below zero in 2005, and that it was \"very, very low.\" The resort is located on the island of Laguna, about 30 kilometers (25 miles) from the coast of Malaysia. It is the first of its kind in Germany to be built by a Malaysian businessman. In 2003, it opened to the public. Since then it has become a tourist attraction, with a total of 15 million euros ($120 million) spent on hotels, restaurants, bars, cafes and restaurants. At the same time, there have been a number of other developments, such as the construction of a new cruise ship and the opening of an airport at the beginning of this year. There are also plans to open a hotel in Malacca in 2008, which will serve as a base for a private jet to take off and land on a tropical island off the Malaya coast. This would be the second time in as many years that a resort has been opened in a German city. On the other hand, this is only the third time the city has opened its doors to visitors since 2002, when it became the world's second-largest airport, after Berlin's Heathrow airport. Both of these developments have led to an increase in tourist arrivals, as well as an influx of foreign tourists. Last year, more than 100,000 visitors were expected, according to a survey conducted by consultancy firm In a statement released on Tuesday, a spokesman said: \"We are pleased to announce that we have opened our first Tropical Island resort here in Berlin. We are looking forward to seeing what the future holds for this resort and for our guests,\" he said. However, he added that there was still \"a lot of work to do\" in terms of setting up the new resort. He also pointed out that, while it is still in operation, \"it will take some time to get used to it.\" \"It will be interesting to see what kind of people come in and out of it,\" the spokesman added, referring to people who have moved in from other European countries and who are interested in establishing a business there."

        "target": "Bayern's Klinsmann Praises, Hoeness Attacks Hoffenheim The Bundesliga's two top teams don't play until Friday, but the mind games are already underway. Bayern's coach Juergen Klinsmann says Hoffenheim are legitimate contenders, but commercial manager Uli Hoeness disagrees. When the Bundesliga scheduled Bayern's home match against Hoffenheim in the league's unloved Friday night slot, they probably didn't imagine that it would turn out to be the match of the first half of the season. Indeed, few experts or fans thought that Hoffenheim, a first-division debutante located in a southern German village with 3,000 inhabitants, would give mighty Munich a run for its money. But it's the first week of December, and Hoffenheim top the table by three points. They also have a much better goal difference than their second-placed rivals -- and that has drawn praise from Bayern's coach, Juergen Klinsmann. \"I have the highest estimation of Hoffenheim because they've built the squad very ambitiously, rationally and with very good players,\" Klinsmann told DPA news agency. \"They can be proud of that.\" Klinsmann said he thought that the club could establish itself among the top three or four sides in Germany in the years to come and qualify for international competition next season. He also had words of praise for Hoffenheim's software billionaire patron, Dietmar Hopp, whose money has funded the club's ascent. \"There's nothing negative about it,\" Klinsmann said. \"He used to play for the club, is a soccer man through and through and helped the team get on its feet.\" Some fans have criticized Hopp and Hoffenheim for paying inflating salaries and luring talent away from other clubs instead of developing homegrown players. In fact, Hoffenheim's official salary budget is about average for the Bundesliga. Hoeness sounds his horn But while Bayern's coach was praising his opponents to the skies, Munich's commercial manager Uli Hoeness has been trying to play with their heads. On the heels of Bayern's convincing win over Leverkusen last weekend, Hoeness is back to taunting rivals. \"The performance we showed in the second half against Leverkusen will be enough against Hoffenheim,\" Hoeness told the German soccer magazine kicker. Hoeness also dropped a none-too-thinly-veiled hint that Hoffenheim's personnel expenditures were far higher than the officially released figures and scoffed at the idea that strategy would determine the outcome of Friday's match. \"Games are decided by the better players, not by tactics,\" Hoeness said. \"And of course, we've got better players than Hoffenheim.\" But that particular verbal attack may represent some wishful thinking of the manager's part. Hoffenheim coach Ralf Rangnick is one of only two current Bundesliga skippers with a winning record against Munich. Rangnick, whose team cruised past Bielefeld last weekend to keep Bayern three points back, reacted to Hoeness' remarks with a shrug. \"We're preparing for Munich exactly the same way we did against Bielefeld,\" Rangnick said. In any case, soccer fans in Germany know what they'll be doing Friday evening -- finding a bar with cable sports television to watch a top match that no one, before the start of the season, would have considered possible.",
        "generated_story": "Hoffenheim's Commercial Manager Reacts to First Half of Bundesliga Season Hoeness has reacted to the first half of the Bundesliga season with a resounding \"yes\" and a \"no\" in the media. \"We are very happy with the way we have been playing this season,\" said Ralf Rangnick, the sporting director at the club's commercial manager. The German side have won three of their last four league games, including a 1-0 win over Leverkusen on Friday night, and are on course for their first league win since the end of December. But the mood in Munich has been somber, as the visitors have struggled to find a way back into the top-flight after a disappointing December in which they lost 2-1 at home to Bayern Munich and were beaten 3-2 in their opening league match. Ragsnick said he was \"very happy\" with his side's performance, adding that \"we have a lot of work to do,\" and that he would like to see the team improve on the form of last season, which saw them qualify for the Champions League last year. He also said that his club would be looking for a new coach to take over from Dietmar Hopp, who was fired by Bayern in December after failing to win a single match in his first season in charge. In a statement released Friday, he said: \"I am very pleased that we are in a good position to be able to get back on track in terms of our goalscoring record. We will continue to work hard to make sure that our players are ready to contribute to our success in this league season.\" The Bundesliga's top goal scorer has scored four goals in as many games in all competitions, with one of those goals coming against Bielefeld, a side that has struggled for form in recent weeks. Hoffenheimer's goalkeepers have also been on a tear, having conceded just one goal in four games. They have not conceded a goal since December, but they have conceded only three times in that time frame. On the pitch, they are playing in front of a home crowd of 1.5 million fans. That's a record for any club in Germany, let alone a club that's been relegated to a lower division for more than a decade. Last season's Bundesliga champions, Bayern, were relegated after losing to Borussia Dortmund last month. After a difficult start to their Bundesliga campaign, coach Juergen Klinsmann has come under increasing pressure to improve his defensive frailties, especially in light of recent defeats to Dortmund and Bayern. At the same time, his team are struggling to cope with an influx of young players who are expected to step up to full-time duties in January and February. This is not to say that they will not be back in action next season. However, there is no doubt that the squad will be bolstered by the arrival of new players. There is also the possibility that some of them could be brought in to fill the role of assistant coach. It's not a question of whether or not the coaching staff will have the time to prepare for that. If they do, it will probably be a matter of time before they can make a decision on whether they want to bring in new coaches or if they're going to stick with their old ones. For the most part, though, that will depend on their ability to adapt and adapt to new personnel and the new system that is being put in place in order to meet the demands of an increasingly demanding market. And that means that there will likely be more pressure on them to stay fit and ready for new challenges. As a result, this is a positive sign for both sides."

        "target": "Automation in the dairy cow industry A small but nevertheless important sector of the German economy today is agriculture. Although the number of farms has declined over the decades, production has actually increased -- especially at dairy farms. Modern automation technology and robotics are helping to keep both cows and farmers happy, but at the cost of jobs.",
        "generated_story": "Automation in the Dairy Cow Industry In the dairy cow industry, there is no shortage of automated cow products. But there are a few exceptions. Dairy cows in Germany have a lot of problems. The problem is that they don\u2019t have the right equipment. They have to rely on artificial cows to make their milk. This is a problem that is becoming more and more acute as the number of cows and dairy cows is increasing. There is also a lack of proper equipment for the production of dairy products, which is why the milk cows are becoming increasingly mechanized. That is, they are no longer able to produce milk from the cow's milk, but rather from cows' milk cartons. In addition to the need for new equipment, the demand for milk products has also risen. \"The milk cow has to be automated,\" said Dieter M\u00fcller, head of the German dairy industry. He said that in order to reduce the amount of milk produced, milk must be made from cow milk and then stored in a refrigerated container. However, he added that it is not possible to do this without the help of an artificial cow, and that this could lead to a reduction in milk production and therefore, to an increase in dairy product prices. And that, in turn, could result in higher milk prices and lower milk costs for dairy farmers, who are more likely to sell milk at a higher price than their competitors. So far, this has not been the case. It is only a matter of time before a new technology is being developed that will make milk more accessible to farmers and consumers. What is the future? What will be the next step in this process? The first step is to develop the technology. Then the second step would be to introduce the new cow-milk mix. Now, we will see how this will play out. We have already seen the results of this technology in other countries, such as China, India and the US, where it has been shown that milk is more expensive than milk in some countries. How will this affect milk farmers? There are many factors that contribute to this problem. For example, it will take a long time for farmers to realize the benefits of a milk-free milk product. These factors can be explained by the fact that cows have more milk than cows do. Also, cows need a better diet, so they need to learn how to grow their own milk to meet the demands of their customers. As a result, farmers are increasingly looking for alternatives to milk that has a high milk content. Some farmers have resorted to dairy milk as a substitute for eggs."

        "target": "Inching towards direct talks on Syria They came to hold talks, but started negotiations with mutual affronts. But if there is one person who might be able to mediate between the intransigent Syrian conflict parties, it's Lakhdar Brahimi. Lakhdar Brahimi, the United Nations special envoy for Syria, seemed very tired on Friday (24.01.2014). He had had a long day, which was actually supposed to be the first real day of negotiations at the Syria Conference in Geneva. \"Good afternoon,\" Brahimi told the assembled international press, before adding, \"or good evening, I don't know.\" At the Palais des Nations in Geneva, he presented the most important result of his attempts to mediate between the Syrian government and the opposition to the more than 250 journalists who had managed to get a coveted place at the press conference: \"Tomorrow we expect and we have agreed that we will meet in the same room.\" What Brahimi is declaring an achievement doesn't sound like much, but considering how irreconcilable the conflict parties have been, even that can be seen as a small success. Separate talks with Brahimi The two delegations were actually due to meet on the first day of negotiations in Geneva in order to agree on a timetable and on the subject and agenda of the talks. But emotions are running too high on both sides. Instead both delegations held separate talks with Lahkkdar Brahimi, both lasting just about an hour each In the morning. The Syrian government delegation had apparently been threatening to leave the conference. At least that is what the deputy foreign minister Faisal Mekdad had implied. \"We are here to start the negotiations,\" he told waiting journalists, \"but we found that the other party did not want to come.\" Before the conference, the opposition had explained that for its delegation, the formation of a transition government would be a central tenet of the negotiations. They emphasized that this topic should be discussed right at the beginning of talks and that the establishment of such a body should be initiated without delay. Social media and good old propaganda The representatives of the Syrian National Coalition that were present in Geneva neatly used all imaginable channels to make their views public. At #Geneva2, they tweeted: \"Forming a transitional body is our major priority,\" leaving people in no doubt that the Syrian National Council would not want to include Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Assad's government, on the other hand, is relying on classic propaganda and loyal state media representatives in Geneva. An impressive entourage of dominant journalists from state-run media outlets is constantly at hand, accompanying the government delegation and making sure they get their point across at press conferences. Lakhdar Brahimi even had a small altercation with a journalist from a Syrian state news agency, who made a political statement under the pretense of asking the UN mediator a question. \"Are there any signs that Saudi Arabia, Turkey and other countries would stop the support of terrorism in Syria?,\" she asked in somewhat shaky English, before Brahimi interrupted her. \"Please, please, there is no point in asking such questions!\" Such exchanges hint at the type of negotiating style the experienced diplomat and mediator Brahimi must have behind the scenes. 'Wish us luck' Lakhdar Brahimi described the preliminary talks that took place in Geneva as encouraging and asked for patience. He said that because the peace conference had come about at the last minute and the delegations had therefore only been appointed very recently, there hadn't been enough time to hold preliminary discussions - a task that the delegations were now catching up on. \"We never expected it to be easy and I'm sure it's not going to be,\" he said. \"But I think the two parties understand what is at stake. Their country is in very, very bad shape.\" He added: \"The huge ambition of this process is to save Syria. Nothing less than that.\" After appealing to the willingness of both parties to negotiate, he simply added: \"So wish us luck!\" Fight for freedom As the official delegations held talks with UN mediator Brahimi in the Palais des Nations, the European headquarters of the United Nations, hundreds of Syrian expatriates who had come from all over Europe protested outside, forming a sea of red, white and black Syrian flags on the Place des Nations. With their presence outside the UN gates they wanted to show that despite all the government propaganda, the Syrian National coalition has a lot of support from the Syrian people. Thirty-two-year-old Ziad Malki came to Geneva from Zurich to show his solidarity. Ziad knows how it feels to be deprived of his freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. In 2005, he was arrested at a demonstration in Damascus and says he was tortured during his time in prison. Now he is fighting for a new Syria from outside the country's borders. Ziad is sure that with Bashar al-Assad and his family, there will be nothing new. \"We don't want this man to be in",
        "generated_story": "Syrian National Coalition Mediating with UN in Geneva Syrian Deputy foreign minister Lahkkdar Brahimi has mediated with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad for the past 24.01.2014. He has been in the Syrian capital, Damascus, for more than a year and a half. On Friday, he travelled to Geneva, Switzerland, to mediate between Syrian opposition forces and Syrian government forces. \"We are in a very difficult situation,\" he said, adding that he was \"deeply concerned\" about the situation in Syria, which he described as \"difficult and difficult\" to deal with at the moment. Speaking to reporters in Switzerland on the sidelines of the Geneva talks, the Deputy Foreign Minister said he had been \"very impressed\" by the progress being made in negotiations between the opposition and the regime in Damascus. The two sides have been holding talks since the beginning of this year, with the aim of reaching an agreement on a cessation of hostilities. At the same time, they are also working on an end to a long-term ceasefire that has already been agreed to between Damascus and its ally Turkey over the last two years. In the end, Syria's opposition is now united in its opposition to the ceasefire, and has called for a ceasefire between Assad's regime and pro-government forces, as well as a return to negotiations with Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Turkey. However, it is not clear how long the truce will last. According to Mekdad, a spokesman for Syrian National Council (SNC) spokesman Ziad Malki, \"at least for now, we are not going to talk about it.\" He added that the SNC is \"not ready to give up the fight against terrorism,\" and that it has not yet decided whether or not it will continue to fight the Assad regime. It is also unclear whether the coalition is prepared to continue its campaign against the rebels, or whether it intends to keep fighting until the war is over. This is the second time in as many years that a Syrian leader has visited the United Nations. Earlier this month, Syrian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad announced that his country was willing to take part in peace talks with Russia, but he did not say whether he would be able to attend the talks. His comments came after a meeting between his deputy and UN special envoy for Syria and Syria. A Syrian official told the Associated Press news agency on Friday that \"the Syrian regime is in no position to interfere with peace negotiations.\" \"The Syrian people have a right to know what is happening,\" said the official, who was not authorized to discuss the meeting by name."

        "target": "Italy's navy to patrol with Libyan ships to curb human trafficking Italy wants to work more closely with Libya to limit the number of sea crossings by migrants and potential asylum seekers. But what are the consequences? Italy's prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni, does not want to wait any longer for EU countries to show solidarity in distributing asylum seekers throughout the bloc. On Thursday he announced in Rome that the Italian navy would be patrolling with Libyan ships just off the Libyan coastline. The aim, Gentiloni says, is to curb human trafficking and bring migrants back from the smugglers' boats to Libya. According to the Italian government's figures, 93,000 migrants have arrived in Italy so far this year. At least 2,000 have drowned in the attempt to cross the Mediterranean - the true figure is unknown. Italy has already threatened to stop allowing boats carrying rescued migrants to dock in Italian ports, or that it may issue migrants with documents that would allow them to travel on to other European countries. Rome has not yet implemented either policy, but the government has made clear that Italy will soon run out of options. The EU Commissioner for Migration Dimitris Avramopoulos acknowledged, again, in Brussels on Thursday that \"Europe continues to face high migratory pressures. And Italy more than (almost) any others.\" The European Commission issued a letter offering more aid and personnel to help manage migration better. Accommodation will soon be full The office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, wrote at the beginning of July that \"Close to 200,000 accommodation places are available for refugees and migrants across [Italy], but are nearly all full.\" The High Commissioner referred particularly to the numbers of people dying when he warned, \"What is happening in front of our eyes in Italy is an unfolding tragedy.\" The United Nations anticipates that another 100,000 migrants will come to Italy via Libya before the end of this year. The number of arrivals is already 20 percent higher than last year; and the number of dead, those who could not be saved, would rise accordingly. According to UN estimates, the Mediterranean remains the \"deadliest\" refugee route in the world. Italian government statistics say that around 600,000 people have arrived in Italian ports since the start of the crisis in 2014. It is unclear how many have since traveled on to Austria, France or Switzerland. Once migrants are registered in Italy and accommodated in camps, they are not held there. If, however, they leave the accommodation without giving notice, they forfeit their claim to subsistence and social services. Most of the migrants are from African countries, and many try to travel on to France, for example. 300 people are currently sleeping on the beach in Ventimiglia, on the French border, hoping to take a bus or train to France. However, the border is being policed by French officials. Migrants who are caught are sent back to Italy. Austria has announced that it too will close its border with Italy if the number of migrants starts to rise. Repatriation and distribution are difficult Last year 120,000 new asylum applications were made in Italy. Around 50 percent of these are rejected. The asylum seekers are then supposed to leave the country. However, the process of people either returning voluntarily or being deported is very slow. The interior ministry has therefore announced that it will reinforce repatriation programs. The redistribution of asylum seekers from Italy, as agreed by the European Union, is well behind target. Two years ago the aim was to resettle 120,000 people. So far, only 24,676 people have been redistributed, the EU Commission said on Thursday: 7,873 from Italy, and 16,803 from Greece. The numbers are low not just because of the reluctance of other EU countries to take the refugees in, but also because of Italian delays in the registration of possible candidates. Asylum seekers from Eritrea are the most likely to fulfill the criteria for redistribution. Around 25,000 are currently living in Italy, but only 10,000 have been registered with the EU Commission and the European Asylum Support Office as possible candidates. Migration Commissioner Avramopoulos has announced that Italy will be given more help and logistical support in this area.",
        "generated_story": "EU Commissioner for Migration Paolo Gentiloni says Italy is facing \"an unfolding tragedy\" in the Mediterranean region The European Union's migration commissioner for migration, Dimitris Avramopoulos, said on Thursday that Italy was facing an \"unprecedented tragedy.\" \"We are faced with an unfolding catastrophe,\" he told a news conference in Rome. \"It is a tragedy that we have to deal with in order to cope with the influx of asylum seekers from Libya and other countries who are seeking asylum in our country.\" The EU's refugee commissioner, Filippo Grandi, made the comments in an interview with Italian newspaper Ventimiglia. The Italian prime minister, Matteo Salvini, has called for an end to the migrant crisis in Italy, which has seen more than 1.5 million people flee the country since 2014, according to figures released by the European Commission. Italian Prime Minister Gentili has also called on the EU to take action to stem the flow of migrants and refugees into Italy. Italy has been one of the fastest-growing countries in Europe in terms of arrivals and departures, with a total of 2.6 million migrants in 2014. Last year, Italy became the first EU country to receive asylum-seekers from the Middle East and North Africa. In the past few years, the number of people who have sought asylum has fallen by more and more, and the numbers of those who seek asylum have dropped by a third. This year alone, around 2,000 people have applied for asylum, up from 1,500 in 2013. Most of them are from Eritrea, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Many of these migrants have fled their home countries to escape persecution in their native countries. They have also sought refuge in other EU countries, such as Austria, Germany, Switzerland, Austria and Switzerland. According to Italian officials, they have not yet been able to reach Greece, where they are staying with their families. At the same time, many migrants are trying to find a way out of their homes and into the United Nations refugee agency, UNHCR, in a bid to ease the burden on migrants. On Thursday, a spokesman for the UNHCR said that the agency was \"deeply concerned about the situation in Libya,\" adding that \"it is not a question of whether or not the migrants will be allowed to return to their countries of origin.\" In a statement released late Thursday evening, EU officials said they were \"very concerned\" about Italy's handling of migrant arrivals, saying that it was a \"serious humanitarian crisis\" and that they had not been adequately dealt with."

The tournament will take place in Berlin on June 26-26, 2011. Germany is the host country for the tournament, which will be hosted by Germany's national soccer team, the German newspaper Deutsche Welle reported. \"Germany will have the opportunity to showcase its talents to the world,\" the paper said, adding that it would be \"a great honor\" for Germany to host a major international sporting event. It was not immediately clear whether Germany would take part in this year's tournament. There are no official dates yet, but the event is expected to be broadcast live on German television and online. According to a report by the newspaper, \"Deutsche Zeitung\" (Germany's official news agency) said that the match would not be televised on television, and that there was \"no guarantee that we would win the game.\" The paper also reported that \"there was no guarantee of a fair and equitable competition between Germany and the rest of the countries.\" \"There was a lot of speculation about who would play,\" said the report, quoting a source close to FIFA's office in Germany, referring to Germany as the \"biggest soccer city in Europe.\" It is not yet clear if Germany or the United States will play host or not. FIFA said in a statement on its website that they had no plans to broadcast the matches on the internet. However, they said they were looking into the possibility of broadcasting the games online, as well as in print and on social media. In a bid to attract more fans, Germany has decided to field a team of women from all over the globe, with the aim of attracting more than 1.5 million spectators. This is a first for a country that has never hosted an international competition. At the same time, it is also a chance to establish itself as a global soccer power with a host of female soccer stars, such as Brazil, France, England, Spain, Italy, Portugal, Greece and Spain. Many of these women have already been invited to play for their country, while others have expressed interest in playing for other countries, including the US, Canada, Mexico and even the Netherlands, where they are due to compete in 2010. German media have been heavily critical of Germany for years, saying it was the only country to have hosted a FIFA event in its history that had not been able to do so. Some media outlets, however, have also expressed concern about the lack of gender equality at the top of their coverage."

        "target": "Is China seeking regime-change in North Korea? The sudden reduction in aggressive rhetoric and actions by North Korea has led to suggestions that Pyongyang has realized it has pushed its only ally in the region to the brink of severing its friendship. The announcement in Pyongyang on May 13 of the promotion of Jang Jong-nam to \"minister of the People's Armed Forces\" came out of the blue. Until recently, the little-known commander of an army corps in coastal Kangwon Province, Jang has replaced Kim Kyok-sik, a four-star general with a long track record of loyal service to the regime. The reasons for 70-year-old Kim's replacement are not clear - as with most of the political maneuvers in North Korea - but it may have been his loyalty that cost him his position in the politburo. Kim was widely seen as a hawk in the regime and is believed to have been in command of the operation to shell the South Korean island of Yeonpyeongdo in November 2010, an incident that killed four people, destroyed civilians' homes and infrastructure and dramatically worsened the already strained relationship between Pyongyang and Seoul. By sacrificing Kim, analysts believe, North Korea is signaling that it is backing away from the confrontational stance it adopted after the United Nations imposed new sanctions in the wake of the nation's third underground nuclear test in February. And there are other indicators that Pyongyang is seeking to return to the status quo. The North's troops have been permitted to step down from the highest state of preparedness for war that was initially ordered when South Korea and the US began a series of annual military exercises. Missiles withdrawn Similarly, two Musudan intermediate-range missiles that were identified as being on mobile launchers being operated in eastern areas of the country have apparently been ordered to return to base. In late April, there was concern that test-launches of the missiles would be a further escalation by Kim Jong-un's government and a message that it would not bow to international pressure to halt its nuclear and missile development programs. But the analysts believe the tokens of Pyongyang's goodwill have come too late. \"For the North Korean leader, this is a very difficult time,\" Toshimitsu Shigemura, a professor at Tokyo's Waseda University and an authority on North Korean affairs, told DW. \"Timing is very important here and it is possible that China is moving to abandon Kim Jong-un. The atmosphere between the two nations is changing. China may have decided that it is time for a regime-change in the North, they will not permit the collapse of the country because they do not want chaos on their own borders.\" Further evidence that Beijing is slowly tightening the screw on its erstwhile ally comes as more state-run financial institutions sever their links with banks in North Korea. The latest institution to adhere to the government's orders to halt transactions across the border is the Bank of China, one of the four major banks in the country, which announced on May 7 that it would cease dealings with the Foreign Trade Bank of North Korea, which has been identified as being involved in Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs. Contingency plan in place Intelligence sources have passed on to DW information that Beijing has a contingency plan in place for when Kim Jong-un's control over the country crumbles. The reports confirm that China is indeed quietly encouraging regime change and is grooming Kim's brother, Kim Jong-nam to take over his role. At 42, Kim Jong-nam is the oldest son of Kim Jong-il, the dictator who ruled North Korea with an iron fist for 17 years until his sudden death in December 2011. Kim Jong-nam had been expected to assume the leadership after his father's death, but fell from favor spectacularly in 2001 when he was detained with two women and a boy aged 4 at Tokyo's Narita International Airport travelling on a forged Dominican Republic passport. He later admitted that he had wanted to visit Disneyland. He subsequently lived in Macau and Beijing, under the close watch of the Chinese authorities. The reports suggest that after Kim Jong-nam is installed in Pyongyang, his brother will be permitted to go into exile, probably in China. The tactic is not without its pitfalls, however, in part due to the efficiency of the campaign to deify their young leader as the future of the nation. Kim Jong-nam as 'new king' \"China may be dreaming of appointing Kim Jong-nam as the new king - and he is more preferable to the West than Kim Jong Un - but the problem is that he is not known in North Korea,\" said Ken Kato, director of Tokyo-based Human Rights in Asia. \"Many people in Japan know much about the North Korean 'Royal Family,' but this information is hidden in North Korea,\" he said. \"Even residents of Pyongyang know very little about Kim Jong-nam.\" Yet the reports are gaining credence among North Korea-watchers. Jun Okumura, a political analyst with the Eurasia Group, told DW that North Korea withdrawing",
        "generated_story": "Kim Jong-un is North Korea's 'new king' The North Korean leader has become the world's most powerful man, according to the United Nations. The country's new leader, Kim Jong Un, was born on May 7, 2001, in the capital Pyongyang. He is the son of the late leader of his father's ruling party, the People's Armed Forces (PAS), and is believed to be the heir apparent to Kim's father, who was killed in a suicide bombing in 2011. His father was also a member of a group of North Koreans who were killed by a rocket fired from the North's capital city of Musudan. In a statement released by Pyongyang's Foreign Trade Bank of China (FTRB), the ministry of foreign affairs said that Kim was \"the new king\" and that he was the \"king of all things.\" The statement came after a meeting between Kim and his son, Jang Jong Nam, at the Pyongyang airport in March 2011, where the two men were to meet for the first time since the end of World War II. During the meeting, both men said they were \"very happy\" with the outcome. \"We are very happy,\" Kim said, adding that they had \"a lot of respect for each other and we are happy that we have been able to work together as a country for a long time,\" he said. However, he added that there was still a \"long way to go\" for Kim to reach his goal of becoming the next leader. On the other hand, it is not clear how long Kim will stay in power. According to a report by the Korea Central News Agency (KNA), Kim is expected to take over the reins of power in his country by early next year. Kim has been accused of plotting to overthrow the government of South Korea, which has ruled the country since December 2011 and which is now the largest trading partner in Asia. But he is also said to have no plans to step down from his post as head of state, and he has not ruled out the possibility of stepping down as soon as he leaves office. That would be a major setback for his regime, as the UN has said he will not be returning to office until at least 2021. It is unclear how much time Kim would have left in office, but it seems unlikely he would return to his old position of being the nation's \"new leader.\" In the past few months, Pyongyang has made a number of changes to its foreign policy. One of them is that it will no longer have to rely solely on foreign currency reserves to run its economy. This is a big change from what it used to do during the Cold War, when it relied heavily on the foreign exchange reserves of Japan and China to finance its nuclear weapons programs. Another change is to allow the military to continue to operate in its own country, rather than relying on external sources, such as China and the US. For the most part, this change will be achieved through a combination of economic and political means. There is no need to worry about the long-term effects of sanctions on Pyongyang as long as they are in place. If the economy continues to improve, then the regime will have a chance to expand its military capabilities. And that's a good thing, because if it does not, that will only mean that more money will flow into the coffers of other countries. So far, so good. What's the problem? What do you think? Do you believe that the Chinese government will do with all the money that is being pumped into it? Is it really going to give up on that? How much will it be worth? I don't know for sure. I think it depends on what happens next. How long will the currency exchange rate stay stable? If it stays stable, we'll see. We will see if there is any change in China's policy toward the DPRK."

        "target": "Gang battle in Mexico as US' John Kelly visits A gunbattle between drug gangs in northern Mexico has left 14 people dead. It's the latest in a series of turf wars. Smuggling has prompted a visit to Mexico City by US Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly. Prosecutors said the remote town of Las Varas in Chihuahua state was the scene of Wednesday's battle between affiliates of the Ciudad Juarez cartel and a gang from the state of Sinaloa. Police said fighting escalated when patrols arrived. Fourteen people were found dead; 12 others were hospitalized. Grenades, launchers and rifles were found. The mountainous region is used as a corridor for smuggling into the US. El Chapo effect Chihuahua security commissioner Oscar Alberto Aparicio said a Black Hawk helicopter was called in as police chased surviving gang members through the area known for marijuana and opium poppy production. Two police officers had been killed in a \"cowardly\" way in the area a week ago, he said. In a similar incident last Friday, 17 gunmen were killed during a shootout with police on a highway in Sinaloa, Mexico's northwestern state. Sinaloa was the home base of Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, whose extradition to the US in January apparently left gangsters in a struggle for control of criminal syndicates. Homicides have surged in recent months, with the number of persons killed in May put at 2,186, the highest since the collection of such statistics began 20 years ago. Nieto and Kelly to talk In Mexico City Wednesday, President Enrique Pena Nieto's office said he and visiting US Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly had discussed how to rein in organized crime groups. \"Shared responsibility\" must become the focus of transnational efforts, Kelly said. Narcotics smuggling into the US has become a multibillion-dollar (multibillion-euro) business for Mexican drug cartels. Mexico in turn wants the US to throttle demand for narcotics and the supply of illegal weapons to Mexico cartels. Pena Nieto and US President Donald Trump, who wants a border wall, are schedule to meet Friday on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany. ipj/ng (AP, AFP, dpa)",
        "generated_story": "US Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly meets Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto at the scene of a gunbattle in northern Mexico on Friday. The Mexican president is expected to meet with US Secretary of State John Kerry in Mexico City later in the day. Mexico's border with Sinaloa has been hit by a suspected drug cartel attack, killing at least 10 people and injuring hundreds more. US President Donald Trump has called for an end to the violence in southern Mexico, which has claimed the lives of more than 1,000 people since the end of the drug war in January. Mexican officials said on Wednesday that the attack was the result of an exchange of gunfire between Mexican security forces and drug traffickers. \"We are very, very concerned about the situation in our own country,\" Mexican Interior Minister Oscar Alberto Aparicio told reporters at a news conference in Chihuahua. He added that he was \"deeply concerned\" about a possible escalation of violence between drug cartels and the US, adding that \"it is not a question of whether or not we are going to act in a way that is conducive to peace and stability in this country.\" The incident took place near the border town of Ciudad Juarez, about 30 kilometers (25 miles) north of Mexico city. A border patrol spokesman said the Mexican army was responding to a tip-off that a man had opened fire on a police vehicle. Police said they were searching for the suspect, who was later arrested and charged with murder. Officials said a search warrant had been issued for his arrest in connection with the incident, but that it was not yet known whether the man was a US citizen or a Mexican citizen. In a statement, the president said he had \"no knowledge\" of what was going on in Las Varas, where the alleged attack occurred. On Wednesday, Mexican Prime Minister Pedro Pablo \"El Chapo\" Guzman, a former drug trafficker, was arrested after a shootout with police in his home town in central Mexico. An investigation is under way into the circumstances surrounding the shooting, according to an official statement from the interior ministry. It is unclear how many people were killed or injured during the shootout, although it is believed to have been between a dozen and 15. More than 100 people have died in recent months in drug-related attacks, including in attacks on police stations, hospitals, schools, prisons and other places of worship. At a press conference on Thursday, Trump said his administration was working closely with Mexican authorities to prevent a repeat of last year's deadly drug violence."

        "target": "Nigeria sentences 54 soldiers to death for mutiny A Nigerian court martial has sentenced 54 soldiers to death for mutiny and cowardice as they refused to fight against Boko Haram Islamists. The case has highlighted the army's problems with equipment and morale. The men sentenced to death on Wednesday were part of the special forces division ordered in August to retake three towns in Borno state, which had been taken over by the Islamist Boko Haram insurgents. Their lawyer, Femi Falana, said the 54 men were sentenced to death by firing squad and five had been acquitted. They were accused of conspiring to commit mutiny against the authorities of the 7th Division of the Nigerian army, which is on the frontline. The trial began on October 15 and was conducted behind closed doors. It is subject to approval by top military officials, but there has so far been no indication that senior officers oppose the court martial. They were not available for comment afterwards. There was a similar case in Nigeria in September, when 12 soldiers were sentenced to death for mutiny after firing on their commanding officer in the northeast city of Maiduguri. The 7th Division, based in Maiduguri, leads the offensive but there are numerous reports of troops refusing to deploy. Soldiers have regularly complained that they lack weapons, food, and other basic supplies to fight the Islamists, who are reported to have tanks, rocket-propelled-grenade launchers, and other heavy weaponry. Boko Haram has taken a number of towns and declared an Islamic caliphate in the region near the border with Cameroon. The Nigerian military has in recent weeks claimed to have made progress in recapturing lost territory. Thousands of people have been killed since the Islamist uprising began five years ago. An estimated 1.3 million have been displaced, with tens of thousands seeking refuge in neighboring Cameroon, Chad, and Niger. rg/bk (AFP, AP, dpa)",
        "generated_story": "Court martial against Boko Haram Islamists in Borno A court martial has been ordered in the northeastern Nigerian state of Borna. The military said on Wednesday it would launch an investigation into the Islamist group's activities. Police said they were looking into whether the group, which claimed responsibility for the attacks in September, was linked to the kidnapping of a Christian woman and her three children in Maiduguri on October 15. A military spokesman said the military had arrested the woman, who is believed to be the daughter of one of the sect's leaders, and that she was being held in custody. \"We are going to bring her to court,\" the spokesman, Femi Falana, told AFP news agency, adding that the court had ordered the arrest of three men suspected of having links with the kidnappers. He did not elaborate on the charges, but said it was not the first time the army had been accused of kidnapping a woman. On Wednesday, the 7th Division, a division of Nigeria's military, announced that it had launched an operation to arrest the suspected kidnapper and his three accomplices in connection with his abduction and the release of his wife and three young children. It was the second such operation in as many months, according to a military statement released by the Nigerian army. In August, it launched a counter-offensive against the militant group. At the same time, troops were deployed in Chad, Cameroon, Chad and Chad to try and stop the Islamists from gaining a foothold in northern Nigeria, where they have been holding sway since the end of last year. According to military sources, some 30,000 people have fled the country in search of refuge in Cameroon. Many of them have returned to Nigeria after fleeing the violence in their homes in recent months. There are also reports that some of those who fled to Cameroon have also been arrested and are facing charges of rape and attempted rape. Some of these men are suspected to have kidnapped the women and children of their captors in an attempt to flee the war-torn country. They were arrested in August and charged with kidnapping, rape, kidnapping and other crimes. Their lawyers said that they had not been able to prove their client's innocence."

After successfully weathering the Great Recession, Commerzbank's board of directors appears to want to signal a continuation in its growth trend with Martin Zielke's appointment as the new CEO as of May 1. Outgoing head Martin Blessing announced last year he would not renew his contract. Zielke had previously been put in charge of implementing reforms in the company's private banking sector following the recession. His restructuring measures attracted 800,000 new customers to the bank and changed the image of the 146-year-old financial institution. The 53-year-old has an illustrious career across several German financial institutions to look back on, having started at the teller of a local branch in 1983. Zielke's crowning achievement The beleaguered German financial institution recorded a profit of more than a billion euros (more than $1.1 billion) last year. It was the first time in five years that Commerzbank had made such profitable gains, which it said would translate into paid dividends for shareholders. A good portion of the yields were achieved by a restructuring and expansion drive of Commerzbank's private banking arm under Zielke's leadership. However, some of that money will go to the German government, as it had to step in and rescue the bank in 2009 to the tune of 18 billion euros ($25 billion at the time) by chiefly acquiring more than 15 percent of the shares, effectively nationalizing part of Commerzbank's operations. ss/jlw (dpa, Reuters)",

In a document on combating AIDS, the Commission said that as of 2007, around 2.2 million people carried the virus in the EU and nearby countries, an increase of 700,000 from 2001. According to Commission figures, around 730,000 of these live within the EU's 27 member states. France, Italy, Spain and Portugal have relatively high infection rates - ranging from 0.4 percent to 0.5 percent. In the Baltic country of Estonia, the infection rate stands at around 1.3 percent. In neighboring Ukraine, around 1.6 percent of the population has been diagnosed with HIV, while in Russia around 1.1 percent are HIV positive. The Commission warned that now was not the time for Europe to drop its guard on preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS, adding that in some neighboring countries the number of people carrying the virus had doubled. EU Health Commissioner Androulla Vassiliou said political momentum in the fight against HIV/AIDS needed to be maintained, adding that people must \"take responsibility for themselves and their partners by talking about and practicing safe sex and going for HIV testing.\" A cure for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has yet to be found more than a quarter century after it was brought to public attention. However, efficient treatments exist to slow the evolution of the virus. dfm/AFP Editor: Chuck Penfold",

The figure is the highest among the 28 member states, according to figures from the European Union Health Commissioner's Office (EHHS). The figures are not yet available to the public, but are expected to rise as more people are exposed to HIV and AIDS, the Commission said in a statement. It added that more than half of those infected live in countries with high rates of HIV or AIDS. According to a report by the EHHS, this number could rise to as high as 40 percent by 2007. In addition, a quarter of all people infected by HIV are also unaware that they have HIV, which is a virus that can be transmitted to other people through contact with infected bodily fluids. This could lead to an increase in cases of AIDS and other diseases such as cancer, liver disease, kidney disease and cancer. One in five people with AIDS in Europe and the neighboring states of Portugal and Spain live with a high risk of developing the disease. A third of these people have been diagnosed with it in their own country, Spain, Italy, Portugal or Spain. Spain and Italy are the other two countries where the outbreak has been reported to be most severe. France and Portugal have also reported a rise in HIV infections in recent years, although the figures do not appear to have changed much since 2001, when it was first discovered that HIV was present in some people's bodies. And in addition to this, there is also a growing concern about the spread of this virus in other countries as well as in developing countries. There is concern that the infection could spread to others, and that this could result in more infections and deaths than previously thought. But the commission said it did not see any reason to believe that these infections could be linked to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections. However, it also said that there was no evidence to suggest that HIV was the main cause of death in those who were infected in 2001 and 2005. H.I.V."

And they all have their own specialties: wine, cheese, beer, wine and beer. But the wine that is really great for German consumers is the one that really makes you want to go out and buy it. That's why I'm going to share this wine with you, because I think you'll enjoy it even more than I did last year, when I made it for myself and my family. I love it when people tell me how good it is to have wine in your house. \"It's like having wine on a plate,\" I tell them, \"but it doesn't taste as good as it does in the cellar.\" \"I don't know if you've tried it before, or if it tastes like wine at all,\" they say, adding that \"it's not that bad, it just tastes better when you're drinking it in a glass.\" They say that when it comes to wine consumption, there's no such thing as a bad wine. In fact, they call it a \"bad wine\" because it has a tendency to make you sick of it, which is why they make it so much better than other wines. This year's crop is expected to produce more wine than usual, according to a study by the University of Bonn in Berlin. However, the study also found that the grape variety is not as strong as grape varieties, making it more difficult to find the right balance between grape and wine varieties. So, for this reason, I decided to try a few varieties of grape wine instead. One of my favorite varieties is wine vinegar. Another is beer vinegar, another is olive oil. Both varieties are made from grape leaves. These are very expensive, so I used to buy them at the farmers' market. Then I started making them for my own use."

        "target": "Bayern blast five as Schalke draw Bayern Munich stamped their authority over the Bundesliga on Saturday, with a ruthless 5-0 drubbing of Hannover at home. Meanwhile, second-placed Schalke and third-placed Frankfurt were forced to share the points. With many critics saying Bayern might as well be given the giant Bundesliga dish already, perhaps the struggle for second is shaping up to be the more compelling battle. But Saturday afternoon's clash between second-placed Schalke and third-placed Frankfurt did not take a decisive turn, with the game ending in a 1-1 draw. Schalke drew first blood in the 11th minute, when Frankfurt's Stefan Aigner was dispossessed in midfield, and Lewis Holtby released Klaas-Jan Huntelaar in front of goal - the Dutchman's first in the Bundesliga since September. But the hapless Aigner waited just over 100 seconds to make amends for his error, when the Royal Blues allowed him a free header that left goalkeeper Lars Unnerstall with no chance. But neither side could make inroads in the second half, which allowed Dortmund to leap-frog both sides and claim second place. Bayern take command Meanwhile the imperious Bayern Munich dispelled any talk of winter form-dip - following last week's draw to Nuremberg - with a brutally efficient 5-0 win at home to Hannover. The Bavarians stormed to a 3-0 lead in just 37 minutes, celebrating a nifty overhead kick for star signing Javi Martinez in the fourth minute. Toni Kroos and Franck Ribery scored the next two against a Hannover side that were torn open at will. The overhead kick was the first for the 40-million-euro ($52-million) signing Martinez, and in the second half new defender Dante also opened his account with a straightforward header from a Kroos free-kick. The festival of football continued just four minutes later, when Mario Gomez - making first Bundesliga appearance of the season - slammed the ball into the net from a tight angle just 30 seconds after replacing Mario Mandzukic. Dortmund win The champions Dortmund, meanwhile, are still nine points behind Bayern after beating Mainz 2-1 away. It was a potentially tricky fixture in the town where J\u00fcrgen Klopp began his coaching career, and Mainz showed their brilliance in the fourth minute, when Elkin Soto knocked a dream ball into the path of Marco Caligiuri, whose volley fairly screamed into the top right corner. Dortmund's own star-Marco - national team player Marco Reus - leveled the scores just eight minutes later. Reus worked himself some room at the outer edge of the penalty area, and slotted a beautiful 17-meter effort into the far corner. And Dortmund's second goal, just before half-time, was equally aesthetic - a vertical ball bisected the Mainz defense perfectly down the middle, where Polish predator Robert Lewandowski got his eighth league goal of the season with a deft lob over the onrushing Christian Wetklo in goal. Allofs' homecoming Bremen's 1-1 draw at Wolfsburg had a special frisson of its own, as Wolfsburg's newly-minted sporting director Klaus Allofs faced the club he had served as general manager for over a decade. And there was some gesticulating from the Bremen bench in the general direction of the Wolfsburg management when the guests took the lead in the 35th minute. Just seconds after Wolfsburg missed several chances, Marko Arnautovic was left free in the box after Eljero Elia found space on the left and cut the ball back for the Austrian to finish. But Wolfsburg got their own back in the second half. In the 62th minute, Bremen were reduced to ten men when Lukas Schmitz was given second yellow card for a hard tackle on Adelino Vieirinha. Just two minutes later, Bas Dost took advantage of their guests' disorgnaization and smashed the ball into the goal after neat piece of play from Vieirinha. Dirty derby The Franconian derby between Greuther F\u00fcrth and Nuremberg was a cagey affair that ended in a frustrating 0-0 draw. The first half was marked mainly by a straight red card for Nuremberg's Markus Feulner after an ugly, flying lunge on Stephan F\u00fcrstner. But the home side's numerical advantage was short-lived - Sercan Sararer was also sent for an early ice bath after his high elbow on Javier Pinola was adjudged worthy of a second yellow card in the 61st minute. But the aggression in the tackles was not matched by ruthlessness in front of goal, and neither side could eke out any clear chances.",
        "generated_story": "Bundesliga: Bayern Munich vs Wolfsburg Preview: Mainz vs. Nuremberg Bremen have a tough task ahead of their Bundesliga clash with Bayern on Saturday. The Bavarians will be looking for their first win of the season when they travel to Hannover to take on the Dutch side in the first leg of a three-match Bundesliga trip to the German capital. Bayern, who have won the last three Bundesliga matches, are looking to build on their impressive start to this season. They have been on a tear in recent weeks, having lost their opening two games in a row to N\u00fcrnberg and Hannovers. But they are still on course to win the league on Sunday, with a win at home to Mainzen and a draw away to Cologne in their last four matches in all competitions. That is, if they can get past their opponents, they will have the chance to make it into the Champions League quarter-finals, where they have to play a top-four match against a side that has been relegated from the Bundesliga for the second time in three seasons. \"We are going to try and win this game,\" said Bayern coach J\u00fcrgen Klopp, referring to his side's first-ever Bundesliga win in four years. He added that he was \"very happy\" with the result, adding that \"it was a very good result\" and that the players were \"delighted\" by the way the match was played out. It was also a positive result for Bayern as they were able to hold off the visitors for a few minutes before the half-time break. Coach Lars Unnerstall's side, meanwhile, were unable to keep their heads above the freezing temperatures and were forced to give up the ball after the break in order to protect their star striker, Mario Mandzukic, from being sent off for an ankle injury. Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, the Netherlands' leading goal scorer, was one of only a handful of players to have played in Germany's top flight for more than a year, according to German sporting director Stefan Aigner. His side have also been struggling to find a way to get back on track after losing to Borussia Dortmund at the weekend. On the other hand, Bayern are expected to continue their strong run of form and are hoping to secure a place in next season's Bundesliga, which they hope will see them reach the top four. In the end, though, it will not be easy for them to do so, because they cannot afford to lose to a team that is not as good as the one that they currently have. And that's a problem for Dortmund. After all, there are a lot of young players out there who want to be part of this team, and they don't know how to cope with that. If they do, then they'll be in trouble. As a result of all the injuries they've had to deal with, one can only hope that one day they won't be as bad as last year's squad, but that doesn't mean they're not capable of playing in this league. For the moment, we're looking forward to seeing what the future holds. We'll see how things turn out for us. I'm hoping that we can make the most of what we have so far. There's no doubt about it. You can't just sit back and relax and enjoy the game and let the team do what it wants. What can you do? What do you think? Do you have any idea what you can do to improve your team's chances of success? Can you tell me? I can tell you what I think about that? If you've got any doubts, I'd like to hear from you.\""

        "target": "In Argentina, red wine exports to balance Porsche imports About 100 Porsches are imported to Argentina each year. Now the country wants to keep a positive trade balance by having the value of the imported luxury cars matched by red wine exports. Porsche is currently enjoying record profits after a two-year downturn, but the export-reliant company has hit a pothole in Argentina. Buenos Aires-based Porsche importer Grupo Pulenta has signed an agreement obligating it to export several hundred bottles of red wine for each car it imports, the Argentine government announced Wednesday. Grupo Pulenta declined to comment when contacted by Deutsche Welle. Job creation During the past year, Argentina has held thousands of high-end vehicles in customs until companies agreed to export goods valued at the same amount. Most of those vehicles came from Germany. According to a spokeswoman for the Argentine embassy in Berlin, the country has been trying to safeguard domestic employment with a positive trade balance. \"Our government has negotiated with automakers to balance their imports of cars with an equivalent amount of exports,\" she told Deutsche Welle in a statement. \"Since March 2010 we have been working with the automakers and importers in order to increase local integration and reduce the trade deficit in this sector.\" Small market A Porsche spokesman said the company sells just short of 100 vehicles into Argentina each year. That compares to more than 40,000 sold worldwide during five months in 2010. \"For Porsche, Argentina is a rather small market,\" the spokesman told Deutsche Welle. \"Our importer, the Pulenta Group, also deals in wine. They have their own vineyards and export that wine. It has nothing to do with Porsche - we just have an import contract with them, and it seems they've found an individual solution with the Argentine government.\" Domestic production Volkswagen, which has an Argentine subsidiary producing the new \"Amarok\" pickup truck and transmissions, has thus far avoided mandatory exports. The company had reported an export surplus of 384 million euros ($545 million) for this year. Porsche's holding company owns 32.2 percent of Volkswagen, and the Porsche brand is intended to become integrated into Volkswagen's lineup. Daimler and BMW also have subsidiaries in Argentina. While Daimler produces its \"Sprinter\" there, BMW only imports to the country. According to the Argentine embassy in Berlin, the country has recently sought more domestic production by foreign car companies. Author: Gerhard Schneibel (dpa) Editor: John Blau",

Argentina is the world's second-biggest market for wine, behind only Germany's BMW in terms of sales, according to a report by the Buenos Aires-based newspaper Deutsche Welle (dpa) Editor: Gerhard Schneibel.

The move has been questioned by officials, with some saying it places the EU at-risk of taking sides in an internal dispute. The European Commission's decision to launch the rule of law procedure on Warsaw puts the EU's executive institution at-risk of taking sides, Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Konrad Szymanski told reporters in the European Parliament. \"I have the impression that the [European] Commission risks taking a role as a side in a political dispute inside Poland,\" Szymanski noted. On Wednesday, European Commission Vice President Frans Timmermans - a former Dutch foreign minister - announced the move, marking the first time the EU has used the mechanism. Timmermans said that the move was aimed at entering \"into a dialogue with the Polish authorities, to clarify the facts in an objective way and help find solutions if necessary.\" He added that the procedure is focused on seeking answers regarding the new right-wing Polish government's actions not to apply two judgments by the country's constitutional court, and the reasons behind the president and vice-president's terms were shortened. Preserving rule of law However, Poland's deputy foreign minister said that the European Commission was informed of the reasons behind the government's actions. \"We would insist that the questions are phrased precisely because we have provided much information to the Commission in recent days and we are not entirely clear as to what the Commission is still not clear about,\" Szymanski noted to reporters at the European Parliament. New media laws, giving the government the power to hire and fire senior figures at state broadcasters, were also called into question by Timmermans. The controversial legislation prompted mass pro-democracy protesters in the European country. \"The rule of law is one of the EU's fundamental values. Making sure the rule of law is preserved throughout the Union is a key part of the European Commission's responsibilities,\" Timmermans wrote on his official Facebook page. The Rule of Law Framework was created two years ago as a response to criticism that the 28-nation bloc had not adequately responded to possibly-authoritarian moves taken by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban during his tenure. ls/jil (Reuters, AFP, dpa)",

The opposition Law and Justice party failed in its bid to oust Prime Minister Donald Tusk on Friday through a vote confidence, the second such vote since the publication of private conversations between high-ranking officials, referred to by some in Poland as \"Waitergate.\" Tusk withstood the opposition challenge by a wide margin of 236-155. The prime minister's Civic Platform party governs Poland in a center-right coalition with the Polish People's party. Last month, recordings of a private conversation between Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski and then-Finance Minister Jacek Rostowski were published by the weekly magazine Wprost. During the conversation, Sikorski said the US-Polish alliance was \"worthless\" and British Prime Minister David Cameron's concessions to euroskeptics had shown his \"incompetence in EU affairs.\" Prior to the leak of the Sikorski recording, Wprost also published a tape in which central bank chief Marek Belka told Interior Minister Bartlomiej Sienkiewicz that he would only support the government's economic policy if Finance Minister Rostowski left his post. The secret recordings were reportedly made over several months, including at high end restaurants in Warsaw. Wprost says it received the tapes from a businessman. Immediately after the conversations were published, Tusk called his own vote of no confidence. His government survived that vote 237-203. slk/rc (AP, AFP, dpa)",

A spokesman for the government denied the allegations, saying that \"there was no evidence\" of any sexual misconduct between the two men. Wprost news agency reported that Polish Finance Minister Marek Belka was also accused of having sexually abused a woman in the 1990s, a charge that was later dropped by the British government. Polis' main opposition party, Civic Platform (CPP), said the accusations were politically motivated, adding that it was \"deeply concerned\" about the alleged abuse of women and children in Poland.

        "target": "Beekeepers battle mites with technology Bees are useful, hard-working and vital for our ecosystem. Aside from making honey, bees pollinate most of our food crops. But summertime is also the season for one of the biggest threats to honey bees \u2013 the varroa mite. Dete Papendieck puts on a white veiled protective hat and takes out a metal jug with a beak-shaped spout. He sets fire to the container's contents \u2013 formic acid \u2013 and starts directing the smoke that is wafting at the beehives lined up in front of him in his garden on the outskirts of Bonn. The acid doesn't harm the bees, but it does kill the varroa mites, he says. And July, after most of the honey has been harvested, is the best time to treat his hives. The one millimeter-large varroa mite is a parasite that infests beehives and lays its eggs in the honeycombs, alongside the bees' larvae. \"It feeds on the bees' and the bee brood's blood, the so-called haemolymph,\" Papendieck explains. A third of bees killed in Germany Papendieck is an apiarist at the Bee Research Institute at the University of Bonn and he knows that the threat of mites is serious. If left untreated, varroa-infested colonies rarely survive a winter. In 2010, German beekeepers lost about 200,000 hives to the mite \u2013 one third of Germany's total bee population. And it is not just the honey and beeswax production that are affected by the mite. Many of our food crops depend on bees: Some 80 percent of all agricultural plants and 90 percent of fruit trees in Europe are pollinated by Apis mellifera, the European honeybee. Varroa introduced from Asia Had Dete Papendieck been a beekeeper forty years ago he would not have had to worry about mites. He says the varroa mite that was originally native to Asia, was introduced to Europe in the 1970s. \"It happened during a research project in which it was attempted to crossbreed the European honeybee with the Asian honeybee. The researchers were exchanging bee colonies between Europe and India, and that is how the mites came to Germany,\" Papendieck said. Unlike Asian bee species, the European honeybee cannot fight off the varoa mite by itself. According to Papendieck, bees easily transmit the mite to other beekeepers' hives in what apiarists call robbery. \"It happens when certain colonies are being robbed by other bees. Large numbers of bees from different colonies attack weak hives and steal their stocks. At the same time, parasites and diseases are exchanged\", he says. Researchers have been trying to breed varroa-resistant mites, but so far they haven't had much success. High-tech tools help fight the mite Klaus Maresch is also worried about his bees. He is an organic beekeeper from Bonn and he has been passionate about bees since he was a little boy. \"They are part of my family. When I open my hives and smell the honey and hear the buzzing of the bees it's like being in another world,\" he told Deutsche Welle. In addition to using formic acid to fight the mite, Klaus Maresch employs a high-tech tool \u2013 a special cylindrical scale that helps him determine when it is best to start the varroa treatment. \"Every day this hive scale sends data about the colonies to our server. The data, such as the temperature in the hive and the amounts of nectar and pollen collected, help me to find a good day to treat varroa,\" Maresch says. Maresch also makes the data about the activities in his hives available to fellow beekeepers who can treat their colonies accordingly. A driver's license for beekeepers? But it is not the mite that angers Maresch most. \"That's nature,\" he says, \"I feel angry about beekeepers who don't fight varroa. If the bees of neighboring beekeepers are infested, I also have a problem.\" The existing German pest regulation obliges beekeepers to treat their bees against varroa, but there are no strict controls. The majority of Germany's more-than-80,000 beekeepers are amateurs who keep between one and 20 colonies. This makes it difficult to impose and survey certain quality standards. Maresch, who sees himself as a kind of 'bee activist', would like to see the government introduce stricter rules. \"There should be a law that obliges every new beekeeper to learn about beekeeping before they are allowed to keep bees. They should get an education and there should be something like a driver's license for beekeepers,\" he says. In the mean time, Europe's bees are going to have to",
        "generated_story": "German beekeeper fights varoa mite with high-tech hive scale German beekeepers have been battling the varroa mites for years with a new technology. One of them, Dete Papendieck of the University of Bonn's Bee Research Institute, has been fighting the pest for more than a year. \"I've been working on this for the last three years,\" he told Deutsche Welle in an interview with the German news agency dpa. In July, he was able to successfully fight the insect, which he described as a \"mite-like insect.\" \"It's a very difficult insect to fight, but it's something that can be fought with,\" said Maresch, who is also a professor at the university's bee research institute. He added that the technique could be applied to other insect species, such as honey bees, as well as to the larvae of other insects. The technique is used to protect the bees from the pests, and it can also be used in the fight against other pests. It's not just the insects that are fighting for their lives, the researchers say. They also say that it is possible to use the technology to control the growth of pests and diseases in a way that would not be possible in other regions of Europe. This is the first time that a bee has successfully fought a pest that has spread from Asia to Europe, according to a study published last year by the European Union (EU) and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in collaboration with researchers from Germany and India. According to this study, about 1.5 percent of all honeybee species in Europe are infected with this pest, while only 2.4 percent are affected by it. A new method of controlling the disease is being developed in Germany, where it was first discovered in 1970. Since then, it has become a common practice to test the effectiveness of this technique. For example, in India, for instance, there are a number of honeybees that live on the ground. However, this method is not as effective as the one used by humans in Asia. That's because the virus can spread through the soil, causing the body to become more sensitive to changes in temperature and humidity. So, when it comes to insects, we have to be careful what we do with our bees. We don't want to get into the weeds, so we're going to try to keep them out of our garden. But we also want them to stay in their natural habitat. And that's where the problem lies. There's also the risk that they will get infected again, because they are more susceptible to infection. What's more, they won't have the chance to survive if they can't survive without the help of their bees.\""

        "target": "EU Mulls Warning Labels to Curb Alcohol Abuse While still targeting smoking, European Union's public health commissioner is considering adding alcohol to the list of vices the bloc should clamp down on. In a report commissioned by the European Commission, the London Institute for Alcohol Studies recommended raising the legal age to buy alcohol to 18 (in some countries, such as Germany, 16-year-olds can buy beer), lowering the permitted blood alcohol level while driving to 0.5, banning alcohol advertising on TV and in movies as well as adding warning labels to bottles as ways of preventing alcohol abuse across the bloc. Which of the methods EU Health Commissioner Markos Kyprianou actually introduces will be announced \"sometime in the autumn,\" according to a spokesperson. Other options include a 10 percent increase in the price of alcohol. Kyprianou has, however, hinted that he favors warning labels -- similar to those that appear on packs of cigarettes -- that make the dangers of alcohol clear. \"Drinking harms your unborn baby\" on bottles? Brewers and wine makers across Europe, however, have come out against placing \"Drinking Kills\" or other labels on bottles of beer. \"Warning labels are the completely wrong way to go,\" Peter Hahn, head of the German Brewers Association told Germany's Express newspaper. \"The do not deter people who have lost a sense of how much to drink and unsettle the people who enjoy a beer after work.\" Industry groups also opposed implementing EU-wide guidelines in countries with traditionally different ways of approaching drinking and drinking problems. \"Policies that do not consider cultural and regional differences, will fail to deal with the social problems, while at the same time generate a rising level of political objections,\" said Rodolphe de Looz-Corswarem of Brewers of Europe. Keeping social vices separate Green party EU parliamentarian Hiltrud Breyer meanwhile called on the alcohol industry to stop \"saber rattling\" before it sees the a final version of the EU's strategy to prevent alcohol abuse. German Consumer Affairs Minister Horst Seehofer said he would wait to see what Kyprianou's actual suggestions are before commenting. Other German politicians, however, were more willing to voice the opposition to putting a sip of wine on the same footing with a puff of a cigarette. \"People should not expect that a skull and crossbones end up on every bottle of beer and wine,\" German EU representative Karl-Heinz Florenz told Der Tagesspiegel newspaper, adding that when it comes to alcohol, each member state should be responsible for how it deals with alcohol abuse. The harm of \"passive drinking\" While cigarettes are a health risk from the first puff, moderate drinking can actually be healthy and there is no danger from \"passive drinking,\" Peter Liese, a German EU representative, told the paper. The commission's report disagreed with Liese's conclusion, saying alcohol abuse had a major role in as many as 200,000 deaths in Europe due to car accidents and disease and played a role in some 60,000 underweight births. The report also estimated the effects of alcohol abuse of costing the EU 125 billion euros ($161 billion) in 2003. Some 25 percent of men and 10 percent of women in Europe drink what the EU considers to be more than healthy amounts of alcohol and between 3 percent and 5 percent are suffering from alcoholism, according to EU statistics.",
        "generated_story": "German Brewers Association warns against 'passive drinking' The European Commission has warned against the use of alcohol on bottles of beer. The EU's consumer affairs commissioner, Peter Liese, told the German newspaper Der Tagesspiegel that it was \"unacceptable\" for people to drink alcohol. \"It is unacceptable,\" he said, adding that \"it is irresponsible and irresponsible to use alcohol in a way that is harmful to the health of the consumer.\" \"We are not going to allow alcohol to be sold on the market,\" the commissioner said in an interview with the newspaper. He added that he was not aware of any evidence that alcohol was being used in the manufacture of alcoholic drinks, but that there was no evidence to suggest that beer was used as a substitute for wine. According to Deutsche Welle, the European Union's Consumer Affairs agency, which is responsible for regulating alcohol sales in Germany, is \"very concerned\" about the impact on consumers' health and well-being of drinking. Germany's Health Commissioner, Karl-Heinz Florenz, said on Thursday that the EU should take a closer look at the issue. In a letter to German parliamentarian Peter Hahn, who is also a member of parliament for the Green party, he wrote: \"I am very concerned that people are drinking more alcohol than they should be drinking, and that they are becoming more and more dependent on alcohol for their daily lives.\" The letter was published in German news agency dpa on Wednesday, a day after German lawmakers voted in favor of a bill to ban alcohol from the country's beer-making industry. It was the first time the bill had been passed by parliament and the second time in three years that German beer sales had fallen below 125 billion euros ($161 billion) since 2003, according to a study by the London Institute for Alcohol Studies (LIDA). The study also found that drinking alcohol can lead to an increased risk of heart disease, stroke and cancer, among other health problems. But the study did not find a clear link between alcohol consumption and cardiovascular disease. LIDA said that, while alcohol is not a cancer-causing drug, it is a disease that can be treated with antibiotics and is therefore not treated as such by doctors and patients. However, its findings are likely to have a positive effect on people's health, as it could be used to treat cancer patients and to reduce the number of cases of cancer that are treated in hospitals."

        "target": "German Minister Urges Peace in Georgia's Separatist Regions German Foreign Minister Steinmeier has called for an end to the \"spiral of violence\" between the Georgian government in Tbilisi and its Russian-backed rebel regions and presented a three-stage plan to break the deadlock. Steinmeier issued the plea as he began a tour of the region to sponsor a new peace plan aimed at calming the simmering tensions over Georgia's separatist regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. \"This is my appeal to break out of the spiral of violence. A lack of dialogue is not an option for the future,\" he said after meeting with his Georgian counterpart Eka Tkeshelashvili. Steinmeier, who chairs the so-called Group of Friends of the United Nations' Secretary on Georgia, is proposing a three-phase peace plan based on a mutual declaration of non-violence and repatriation of about 25,000 ethnic Georgians expelled from Abkhazia in the 1990s. Negotiations over the status of the two rebel regions, which have enjoyed de facto autonomy since the end of a civil war in 1994, was reserved for the final phase of negotiations. Tkeshelashvili said, \"The plan has great potential for success,\" but added that the most difficult thing would be to convince Russia. Peace talks remain distant The threat of armed conflict in the region last month has given urgency to international pressure for renewed peace talks, but Tbilisi, Moscow and the Russian-backed regions remain far apart on the basic premises for restarting peace talks. Officials in Tbilisi oppose a treaty on the non-use of force without guarantees on the return of refugees and the withdrawal of Russian peacekeeping forces base in the region. Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was skeptical of peace efforts Thursday. \"Signing of a treaty on the return of Georgian refugees to Abkhazia is unreal now, because such a return requires a calm situation,\" Lavrov was quoted as saying by news agency RIA-Novosti. \"We think that signing a treaty on the non-use of force without any preconditions is an absolutely unavoidable first step,\" he added. Experts see little hope for Steinmeier's plan Analysts do not expect anything conclusive from Steinmeier's trip, pointing to intransigence on the part of the Abkhaz President Sergei Bagapsh, who said he would \"not consider the plan.\" \"We are not going to discuss Abkhazia's status with anyone. We are building an independent, democratic state,\" Bagapsh was quoted by Georgian news agencies as saying. Speaking to journalists ahead of the meetings Thursday, Steinmeier admitted: \"We don't have any illusions about simple answers, but we cannot stand by without acting on this conflict. That would be irresponsible.\" From Tbilisi, the German minister is to travel to the Black Sea city of Batumi for talks with Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili and then to Abkhazia on Friday before ending his three-day tour in Moscow. Most citizens of the breakaway republics have been issued Russian passports and over 2,500 Russian peacekeeping troops patrol the region under a UN ceasefire agreement. In opposition to Georgia's bid to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Russia moved to strengthen diplomatic ties with the breakaway regions sharply aggravating tensions with the Georgian leadership in recent months.",

        "target": "Maldives revokes state of emergency citing improved security situation The president of the Maldives has lifted a state of emergency following an outcry from the international community. The government says the measures are no longer necessary because the security threat has subsided. The government said Tuesday it had rescinded the emergency measures \"with immediate effect\" and that \"all fundamental rights that were suspended have been restored.\" President Yameen Abdul Gayoom declared the state of emergency one week ago after the discovery of a homemade bomb and a stash of weapons near his official residence. The finding followed an explosion on Gayoom's speedboat in September - an incident the government labeled an assassination attempt. The president was not hurt in the blast, but his wife, an aide and a bodyguard were injured. The emergency regulations, intended to be in place for 30 days, gave security forces wide-ranging search and arrest powers, and suspended citizens' basic rights. They drew criticism from former colonial power Britain as well as the United States, the European Union and neighboring Sri Lanka. Reading out a presidential decree revoking the emergency, Attorney General Mohamed Anil said there was no longer a threat to the Indian Ocean atoll nation. He said investigations into the September blast and the recovery of weapons had made good progress. The foreign ministry said a number of people had been arrested. Lawmakers also used the security regulations to fast-track the impeachment of Vice President Ahmed Adeeb, who stands accused of plotting the alleged attempts on the president's life. Impact on tourism Attorney General Anil said pressure from the international community, as well as \"the possible adverse impact on Maldives tourism and the economy,\" had also played a role in ending the state of emergency. Foreign tourists visiting the tropical nation, known for its luxury tourist resorts, palm-fringed beaches and coral reefs, contribute close to a third of the country's gross domestic product. The Maldives has had a rocky road to democracy since holding its first multiparty election in 2008. The country's first democratically elected leader, current opposition chief Mohamed Nasheed, was forced to step down in 2012 after a mutiny by security forces. In March, he was jailed for 13 years on terrorism charges in a trial the United Nations said was illegal. President Gayoom is under intense international pressure to release him. Nasheed's opposition Maldivian Democratic Party welcomed Tuesday's announcement. But said declaring the state of emergency in the first place was a political move designed to stop a rally planned for last week calling for Nasheed's freedom. \"It appears that Yameen is willing to make up threats about the nation's security in order to settle political scores,\" the party said in a statement, referring to the president. nm/kms (AP, AF, Reuters, dpa)",
        "generated_story": "Maldives state of emergency lifted despite international criticism The Maldives government has lifted a state-of-emergency in the country following criticism from the United States, Britain, Sri Lanka and the European Union. The government said on Tuesday that it had lifted the emergency imposed by President Yameen Abdul Gayoom on the island nation of the Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) in response to criticism of its handling of a disputed presidential election in which the opposition chief, Mohamed Nasheed, was accused of plotting to overthrow the president. \"The situation is very tense,\" said Mohamed Anil, a senior United Nations official who has been in exile in Britain since 2008. He said the situation was \"very tense\" and that the government was in \"deep trouble.\" \"We are in a very difficult situation,\" he said in an interview with the AP, AFP, Reuters, dpa news agency, referring to the ongoing dispute between the two countries over the disputed elections in 2008 and 2012, which have since been annulled by the Supreme Court. A UN envoy has also called for the release of all political prisoners, including former Vice President Ahmed Adeeb, who was arrested in March on charges of sedition and attempted murder in connection with a failed coup attempt last year. In a statement, the UN said it did not believe the allegations were true, adding that \"there is no evidence that there is any evidence to support the accusations.\" The UN has called on all parties to respect the constitution and to refrain from using violence against the people. On Tuesday, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he would not rule out the possibility of an independent judiciary, but that he had no immediate plans to do so. Author: nm/kms (AP, AF and Reuters)"

Clubs officials say talks are ongoing in the hope Max Meyer will extend his contract. Schalke might struggle to retain 22-year-old midfielder Max Meyer when his contract runs out at the end of the season, at least according to recent media interviews from the club's sporting director, Christian Heidel. Speaking to German news agency dpa, Heidel confirmed that Meyer turned down an offer of a contract extension earlier in February. \"Max Meyer's agent received an extension offer on January 12 with a deadline of February 15, and informed us on February 15 via email that Max would not be accepting the offer because of the deadline imposed,\" Heidel told dpa. \"We have acknowledged this. For now, we no longer feel beholden to the terms of that offer, but that doesn't mean an extension is impossible either.\" Meyer was reportedly offered an annual salary in the region of \u20ac5.5 million ($6.7 million); it was the second contract he refused, following a less lucrative offer at the end of last season.

Schalke offered improved terms in light of this development on the pitch. Heidel said this week that the club was still trying to convince the German to stay. \"At the moment we're still ready to talk,\" Heidel told this week's edition of football magazine Kicker, albeit stressing that time was of the essence. \"But we must and we will plan for the new season.\" In a separate newspaper interview Heidel was even more explicit, saying the club was not in a position to wait until summer for Meyer to make up his mind. Speaking to Sport Bild magazine, meanwhile, Heidel sought to focus on Meyer's more important role at Schalke, his regular game time, arguing it might be in the youngster's best interests to stay at a club that needs him every week. \"[Coach] Domenico Tedesco has formed the team around him in such a way that there is now an ideal spot for Max. That was not always the case,\" Heidel said. \"He needs to ask himself, putting the financial aspect to one side: 'Will I get such a position at a different club?' Because one thing's clear: Max wants to play, and he needs to play.\" Schalke are already preparing for the departure of one of German football's brightest young stars, midfield all-rounder Leon Goretzka will join Bayern Munich on a free transfer at the season's end.

        "target": "Hurricane Irma thrashes Caribbean as Jose strengthens in wake Hurricane Irma has continued to pack 300 kph winds as it moves across the Caribbean toward Florida. The record-breaking storm has battered the Bahamas and Cuba, while Hurricane Jose followed in its path. As one of the Atlantic Ocean's largest storms plowed through the Caribbean, leaving destruction in its wake, residents of the US state of Florida prepared for what could be the worst storm to make landfall in over a century. At least 17 people have been killed and dozens more injured across several island nations in the Caribbean. Irma is expected to be there second major hurricane to make landfall in the United States in less than two weeks. Hurricane Harvey struck Texas last week, killing more than 60 people and displacing roughly 1 million others. In the US territory of Puerto Rico, 1 million people \u2013 nearly one-third of the population \u2013 lost electricity during the storm, said Puerto Rican Governor Ricardo Rossello. \"It will be difficult to estimate how long the power outage will last,\" Rossello said. Later, officials confirmed that at least two people on the island had been killed by the storm's devastation. Two other major storms have developed in the Caribbean, namely Hurricane Jose and Hurricane Katia. Jose was east of the Lesser Antilles with maximum sustained winds of 120 miles person hour (195 kilometers person hour) as a hurricane watch was in effect for Antigua and Barbuda. Jose has followed the same path as Hurricane Irma, and was upgraded to a Category 4 on Friday by the US National Hurricane Center. Katia has remained relatively static, hovering off the coast of Mexico. Florida on edge Florida Governor Rick Scott said 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain were expected after Irma made landfall at the weekend as he urged evacuations during a press conference on Friday. Nearly 700,000 people have been asked to leave Miami and its surrounding areas. \"Today is the day to do the right thing for your family and get inland for safety... Do not ignore evacuation orders. All Floridians should be prepared to evacuate soon,\" Scott said. Read more: How to reduce risks from mega-storms? \"I know many of you are stuck in traffic, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s very frustrating. Evacuations are not convenient but they are absolutely meant to keep you safe,\" he added. On Friday, US President Donald Trump described Irma as a storm of \"absolutely historic destructive potential.\" Trump also on Friday signed a $15 billion (13.5 billion euro) hurricane relief package passed by Congress, which also raises the debt ceiling and postpones the possibility of a shutdown of government funding until December. Downgraded to an \"extremely dangerous\" Category 4 but still packing winds of 185 mph (300 kph), Irma moved between the north coast of Cuba and the Bahamas as it neared the Florida Keys and the southern Florida Peninsula. 'Major hurricane' Irma will have a \"truly devastating\" impact on the state's southern coastal areas when it slams into Florida, said US Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) chief Brock Long. Read more: Is climate change making mega-hurricanes the new normal? \"Bottom line is the majority of people along the coast have never experienced a major hurricane like this. It will be truly devastating,\" Long told CNN. \"The entire southeastern United States better wake up and pay attention. Death and destruction At least 11 people have been killed and dozens more injured after Irma tore through the French Caribbean, Barbuda, Anguilla and the British Virgin Islands. Amid widening criticism from residents in British territories that not enough was done to safeguard people from the storm, British Foreign Office Minister Alana Duncan said London has sent tents, vehicles and other relief equipment. \"Anguilla received the hurricane's full blast. The initial assessment is that the damage has been severe and in places critical,\" Duncan told the British Parliament. Thousands displaced Antigua and Barbuda Prime Minister Gaston Browne said nearly every building on Barbuda was damaged when the hurricane's core crossed almost directly over the island early Wednesday and about 60 percent of the island's roughly 1,400 people were homeless.

French, British and Dutch military authorities reportedly rushed aid to the devastated Caribbean islands later on Thursday, with warships and planes dispatching food, water and troops. French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said four people were confirmed dead and about 50 injured on the French side of St. Martin, an island split between Dutch and French control. French Interior Minister Gerard Collomb said 100,000 food rations were sent to St. Barts and St. Martin, the equivalent of four days of supplies. ls/jm (AP, AFP, Reuters, dpa)",
        "generated_story": "Hurricane Irma in the Caribbean: 'Truly devastating' Hurricane Irma has devastated the Lesser Antilles, killing at least 13,000 people and injuring more than 1,500. US President Donald Trump hailed the storm as \"a truly devastating\" storm. \"It's going to be a really devastating storm,\" Trump said in a tweet on Thursday, referring to the Category 4 storm that slammed into Puerto Rico earlier this week. The storm, which hit the island of Hispaniola on Wednesday, is expected to make landfall on Friday, Sept. 28, with winds of up to 130 miles (209 kilometers) per hour (75 kilometers/h) (25.5 miles) from the US mainland. Puerto Rican Prime Minister Ricardo Rossello said on Twitter that he was \"deeply concerned\" about the damage caused by Irma, adding that \"it will be very, very difficult for us to recover from this storm.\" \"We have a lot of work to do,\" he said. In the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, the White House said it was working with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to determine the exact path of Irma's path. It was not immediately clear how much damage would be caused, but it is believed that it could be as much as 13 billion euro ($15 billion) if not more, according to a report by the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) in Miami. Florida Governor Rick Scott said the hurricane was a \"truly catastrophic storm\" and that the state of Florida and the United States would have to deal with it \"with the consequences of this disaster.\" The NHC also warned of the potential for catastrophic damage from Maria and Irma if it were to become a major hurricane. A number of US states have already declared states of emergency, including Florida, Texas, New Mexico, Puerto Ricans, Anguilla, Haiti, and New York. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who is also a former governor of New England, called on the federal government to step up its efforts to help the victims of Maria. He also called for an end to mandatory evacuations for people living in low-lying coastal areas and for those who are unable to leave their homes due to high winds and torrential rain."

        "target": "Opinion: Yet another crisis for Merkel A summery turquoise blazer and fresh makeup could not hide the fact that Angela Merkel was \"not amused.\" Now she is needed as a champion in the fight against populist forces, DW's Kay-Alexander Scholz writes. Britain-EU divorce proceedings will probably last about two years. Until then, the status quo must be maintained, German Chancellor Angela Merkel emphasized in her press statement. If she is no longer chancellor after the upcoming parliamentary elections in 2017, then others will have to live with the consequences of Brexit. But that is not what she is actually thinking. It is not coincidental that foreign ministers and government leaders are visiting Berlin in the coming days. They want to discuss how things will continue. Berlin, under Merkel's chancellorship, has become a center of power outside of Brussels. Difficult international politics The Brexit decision has disrupted Europe's equilibrium. Germany has lost an important ally on European issues related to economic growth and budgetary discipline. Now, France presumably will be the next to raise its voice against Maastricht Treaty criteria. If the Netherlands and Denmark also decide to leave the EU, Germany will become isolated, as Eastern Europe is not as tight with Germany as it once was. Poland now plays a key role for the Balkan nations and the Visegrad Group (Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic and Slovakia). And Poland is still annoyed about Merkel's refugee policy. What about Germany's populists? They're giddy with glee as they feel that their anti-establishment policies have been validated. They are teaching potential AfD (Alternative for Germany) voters a lesson: \"Here, have a look: it's possible. There is always an alternative. Vote for us!\" Those are exactly the words that protest voters want to hear. Germany's AfD has forged ties with other right-wing parties in Vienna, Paris, The Hague and London. They are all pursuing a \"European\" plan to gain power. The recent Austrian presidential election was significant, as the populist candidate lost by a very narrow margin; in fact, the final election results are still undecided as they are being contested. The Brexit vote was also triggered by populist powers. Domestically difficult Many populists believe that the stronger populism becomes - no matter where - the more advantages there would be for individual parties of their persuasion. Many would also like to see Donald Trump as US president. That is how AfD may become even stronger in Germany, which also means that political majorities would fluctuate even more. Will there be enough seats after the next election for a Christian Democrat and Green coalition, or will yet another grand coalition made up of Christian Democrats and Social Democrats be formed? Can Angela Merkel change course? Can she counter the trend with a new political model in Europe and Germany? Or do we stand on the edge of a new era, a \"political revolution,\" as the AfD calls it? Until now, Europe has survived attacks on its currency (euro crisis), the principle of peaceful coexistence (Crimea crisis) and its open borders policy (refugee crisis). Merkel deserves credit for defending these values, despite mistakes that have been made along the way. The outcome of the Brexit crisis is, however, still open. Have something to say? Add your comments below.",
        "generated_story": "Merkel and the Brexit Crisis in Europe Angela Merkel and her conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) are at loggerheads over the future of the EU. The German chancellor is facing a \"Brexit crisis\" in her home country, the Czech Republic, after the country voted to leave the European Union in 2017. Merkel, who is seen as one of Europe's most important political leaders, faces a difficult task in the coming months. She has to decide whether she wants to stay in Germany or go back to the US, where she was elected Chancellor of Germany in 2015. In the end, she will have to choose between the two camps: the CDU or the Green party. Both parties are currently in talks to form a coalition government, with the Greens and Social Democrats as the main opposition parties. DW's Kay-Alexander Scholz reports from The Hague. \"I don't know what the outcome will be,\" she says, \"but I think it's going to be a very difficult situation for the German government to deal with.\" Merkel is also facing an uncertain future, as she faces the prospect of losing her majority in parliament next year in a referendum on EU membership. But she has a lot to say about the current political climate, which has seen a rise in anti-immigrant sentiment in recent months, and a growing number of migrants fleeing the migrant crisis in eastern Europe. Germany, for example, has been on the receiving end of an influx of asylum seekers from the Middle East and North Africa. This has led to a surge in migrant arrivals from countries such as Poland, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Poland and even the United States. Many of these migrants have fled their home countries and are living in refugee camps across the Balkan and eastern European countries. They are fleeing their own countries in search of a better life for themselves and for their children. Some of them have come to Germany to seek asylum, while others are seeking asylum in other EU countries, including the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, France, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Slovakia. There are also a number who are looking for a way out of their current situation. One such asylum seeker is a refugee from Poland. Another is an asylum-seeker from Slovakia who has fled his native country in order to return to his homeland. A third, however, is still waiting for asylum. It is not clear how many asylum applications are being processed, but it seems to me that there are more than a few people who want to come back home to their country. That is because they are not allowed to do so. What is the alternative to asylum? The Alternative for Germany (AfD), which is opposed to immigration, wants asylum for migrants and refugees, to deport them to other countries where they can't find work. And that is where the problem lies. For the first time in decades, refugees have been able to move to Europe without fear of persecution. At the same time, they have also become more and more desperate to get asylum abroad. These migrants, many of whom are refugees from other parts of Eastern Europe, have become increasingly desperate for work and have begun to flee their homes and seek refuge in countries that are closer to them. As a result, migrants are increasingly turning to refugees and fleeing to countries like Hungary and Poland in desperate need of help."

        "target": "Reports: Merkel to run for fourth term as German chancellor German Chancellor Angela Merkel has confirmed that she will stand for the chancellery in the 2017 election, German media reports. The Christian Democrat Leader (CDU) first took office in 2005. After months of speculation, German Chancellor Angela Merkel reportedly told her fellow Christian Democrats (CDU) in Berlin on Sunday that she is prepared to lead the party into next year's election. An official statement is expected from Merkel at 7 p.m. local time (1800 UTC) on Sunday. The 62-year-old has faced a number of difficulties in recent months, from criticism over her handling of the migration crisis to falling support amid a rise in right-wing populist sentiment. Since taking office in 2005, however, Merkel has also been praised for navigating Europe's largest economy through the financial and eurozone crises. According to an Emnid survey published in the German newspaper \"Bild am Sonntag\" 55 percent of Germans are in favor of Merkel remaining head of the German government for another four years. Thirty-nine percent said they were against her re-election. Sign of stability Should she be elected next September, another full four-year term would put Merkel on a par with her mentor Helmut Kohl who set the post-war record and presided over the Fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. In light of the UK's shock vote to leave the European Union in June and Donald Trump's election last week as US president, Merkel's re-election is likely to be welcomed in many capitals as a sign of stability. During his final visit to Berlin this week, US President Barack Obama said that if he were able to, he would vote for his longtime partner and friend. In an interview with German magazine \"Spiegel\" and broadcaster \"ARD,\" Obama said: \"She has great credibility, and she is willing to fight for those values in a way that is very, very important.\" \"I'm glad that she's there and I think the German people should appreciate her. Certainly, I've appreciated her as a partner.\" Winning back votes With the less that a year until Germany heads to the polls, Merkel's CDU is now turning its efforts to wooing back disenchanted voters who have left the conservative camp to support the right-wing populists, Alternative for Germany (AfD). Formed as a Euro-sceptic party in 2013, the AfD won 4.7 percent of the popular vote in the last federal elections in 2013, just falling short of the 5 percent threshold required to enter the Bundestag - Germany's lower house of parliament. After benefiting from the rise in europsceptic, anti-immigration sentiment, seemingly sweeping across western Europe, the party now holds seats in nine of Germany's 16 states.",
        "generated_story": "Merkel's re-election bid comes amid growing populist sentiment in Germany Chancellor Angela Merkel is set to run again for a third term in office in 2017. The conservative Christian Democrat Leader (CDU) is seeking a second term as chancellor, following the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the rise of anti-immigration parties in the US and UK. Merkel, who was first elected to the German parliament in 2005, is expected to seek a fourth term. German media reported on Sunday that Merkel would run for the first time in five years in a coalition government led by Chancellor Helmut Kohl, the CDU's parliamentary leader and a member of Merkel's Christian Democrats party. In a statement, Merkel said she would not seek another term, adding that she was \"not going to stand for another four years.\" \"I will not stand against the new chancellor,\" she said, referring to Chancellor Merkel and US President Barack Obama. \"This is not an election for me. This is a referendum on the future of Germany,\" Merkel told the weekly Bild am Sonntag in an interview published Sunday. She also said that her party would continue to work with the European Union to develop a common vision for Germany's future. But she did not rule out the possibility of a return to a post-World War II Germany, which has suffered from a series of economic and political crises, has seen a rise in populism in recent years. A new president is due to be inaugurated in September, but Merkel has yet to announce a date for her inauguration. Her party has already announced that it will seek to form a government in Berlin, a move that is seen by many as an attempt to distance itself from the United States. It is unclear whether Merkel will run, however, whether she will be able to do so, or if she is willing to step down from her post as Chancellor. On the other hand, there is the question of whether the current chancellor will stay on as long as she wants to, and how much longer she can hold on to her position in government. Germany has a long way to go before a new Chancellor is ready to take over the reins of power. That is, if the chancellor is to win the next election, she must first secure the support of her own party in order to secure a majority in parliament. If she does not secure that support, then she may have to rely on other candidates, such as the Greens and Social Democrats (SPD), who have been in power since 2005."

        "target": "NFL stars defy Donald Trump's call for boycott Baltimore Ravens and Jacksonsville Jaguars players \"took a knee\" during the national anthem after Trump urged fans to boycott football matches. The kneeling protest, to highlight social injustice, has stepped up a gear. Hundreds of National Football League (NFL) stars protested President Donald Trump's call for fans to boycott the league by refusing to stand for the US national anthem this weekend, starting Sunday's game between the Baltimore Ravens and Jacksonsville Jaguars. A number of other players locked arms in solidarity ahead of the game at Wembley Stadium in London. Jacksonville Jaguars' owner Shahid Khan, who last year donated one million dollars\u00a0(840,000 euros) to the Trump campaign, locked his arms with players - a rare scene, as owners almost never take to the field. US media reported that about 200 players on Sunday sat, knelt or raised their fists in defiance of Trump's comments. In one of the most memorable moments, singer Rico LaVelle took a knee and held up a fist at the last line of the Star Spangled Banner ahead of the game between the Detriot Lions and Atlanta Falcons. The protest came in response to Trump's tweets on Sunday morning urging fans to boycott NFL games to pressure the league into firing or suspending players to kneel in protest during the national anthem. In an early morning tweet, Trump posted: \"If NFL fans refuse to go to games until players stop disrespecting our Flag and Country, you will see change take place fast. Fire or suspend!\" \"NFL attendance and ratings are WAY DOWN. Boring games yes, but many stay away because they love our country. League should back US,\" he added. Later, the president said that his rant \"has nothing to do with race,\" despite the fact that the origins of the protest are to do with police brutality against minorities, especially African Americans. Trump said his comments were instead about \"respect for our country and respect for our flag.\" Trump's spat with US professional sports began at a Republican rally in Alabama on Friday, when the president attacked activist NFL players for kneeling or sitting during the national anthem, labelling them as \"sons of bitches.\" \"Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, 'Get that son of a bitch off the field right now... he is fired'?\" Trump told a crowd of cheering supporters. That day, basketball star Stephen Curry, the top player for California's Golden State Warriors, announced that he would not be attending a traditional White House reception honoring the National Basketball Association champions. The kneeling protest was started by former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick who refused to stand for the anthem back in 2016. Kaepernick's gesture came amid a spate of deadly police shootings of black men and was aimed at drawing more attention to treatment of minorities in the US. However, Kaepernick has since become a free agent, after failing to be signed by a new team for the new NFL season. NFL executives decry Trump's calls Trump also drew the ire of senior NFL executives and team owners. Responding to Trump's tweets, Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti, said he \"100 percent\" supported his players' decision to kneel during the anthem. Robert Kraft, the owner of the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots, who is also a close friend of Trump, said in a statement on Sunday that he was deeply disappointed by the president's comments in Alabama. Kraft defended players' rights to \"peacefully affect social change and raise awareness in a manner that they feel is most impactful,\" and said that sports were a unifying force in the US. \"Our political leaders could learn a lot from the lessons of teamwork and working together toward a common goal,\" he said. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, who has taken much of the heat for Kaepernick's failure to find a new team, was also quick to condemn Trump's comments. Read more: NFL player's refusal to stand for national anthem ignites online controversy \"The NFL and our players are at our best when we help create a sense of unity in our country and our culture,\" Goodell said. \"There is no better example than the amazing response from our clubs and players to the terrible natural disasters we've experienced over the last month.\" Denouncing Trump's remarks, Goodell said: \"Divisive comments like these demonstrate an unfortunate lack of respect for the NFL, our great game and all of our players, and a failure to understand the overwhelming force for good our clubs and players represent in our communities.\" But Trump hit back later on Sunday at a worsening furore, saying the row \"has nothing to do with race.\" Instead, he said: \"This has to do with respect for our country, and respect for our flag.\" At least seven NFL team owners donated at least $1 million each to Trump's presidential campaign last year. They include the owners of the New York Jets, New England Patriots, Dallas Cowboys, Washington Redskins, Jacksonville Jaguars, Houston Texans, Los Angeles Rams and Tampa Bay Buccaneers",
        "generated_story": "US President Donald Trump's call for NFL players to kneel during the national anthem has sparked controversy The US president has called on NFL teams to stand for the anthem. On Friday, the NFL announced that it would not allow players who protest the flag to take part in Sunday's Super Bowl. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said the league's decision was \"inappropriate\" and \"unacceptable.\" The league announced on Friday that the players would be barred from participating in the game until the end of the first half. The announcement came as NFL owners Robert Kraft and Steve Bisciotti were set to meet at Wembley Stadium in London on Sunday to discuss the issue. \"The NFL has a responsibility to protect the rights of its players,\" Trump said in a statement released by the team's owner, Shahid Khan, in response to a question about the president's stance on the topic. In a tweet, Khan said: \"I don't think it's appropriate for a president to make such a call. It's not acceptable for him to say that he doesn't have the right to do that. I think he should be allowed to play,\" Khan wrote, adding that \"it's his responsibility as the owner of a football team to ensure the safety of his players and the security of their families.\" Trump has also called for an end to the protests, which have been taking place across the country since the start of last season. He also said he would support a ban on protests at the White House, saying it was a \"disgrace\" to those who are protesting. His comments came after the National Basketball Association (NBA) announced the suspension of 49ers running back Stephen Curry, who had been suspended for protesting during last year's NFL season, for \"conduct detrimental to national security and national unity.\" \"It's a disgrace to our country,\" he said on Twitter, referring to his criticism of President Trump. 'We're going to have to deal with the consequences' The NFL's commissioner has said it will continue to monitor the situation, but he did not rule out the possibility of an NFL ban for kneeling during games. But he has not ruled out a move to ban the practice of kneeling in front of fans during a game in which the US flag was lowered to half-mast in protest of racial inequality in America. Last year, US President Barack Obama signed an executive order banning the use of social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to promote racial equality in sports. This week, Trump is expected to announce that his administration will hold a special meeting with NFL team owners, owners and owners of professional sports teams in Washington, D.C."

        "target": "Turkey, Greece seek NATO mission in Aegean, says German official Germany, Greece and Turkey will ask NATO to approve a maritime surveillance mission in the Aegean to combat illegal people smugglers. Greece had previously voiced reservations about the proposal. The proposed mission to be discussed at a NATO defense ministers meeting in Brussels on Thursday comes days after German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutolgu said they would raise the issue of refugees with the Alliance. According to a Reuters report citing a senior German official, initially reticent Greece has now given the green light for the operation, which could see NATO assets deployed in the Aegean in a mostly intelligence and reconnaissance role. Under the proposal, which would need to be approved by Alliance members, NATO maritime assets would provide information to national coastguards and the EU border agency Frontex to combat illegal smugglers using rickety boats to bring migrants to Europe. Turkey would then take back the refugees, as envisioned as part of a 3 billion-euro ($3.2 billion) EU-Turkey deal agreed to last year. According to German sources, the mission would not be similar to the NATO mission in the Mediterranean intercepting migrant boats making the dangerous run from Libya to Italy. However, NATO ships could intervene in emergency situations to save passengers. \"It is not NATO's remit to push back or stop refugee boats,\" the official told Reuters. The mission would use assets from the Alliance's standing naval group, a permanent reaction force deployed in the Mediterranean. The naval group's current flagship is the German combat support ship \"Bonn.\" Denmark has already said it would provide additional ships to the mission, according to the official. However, it is unclear whether NATO members will approve the mission which may fall outside the bounds of the Alliance's mandate. Complicating matters is a long-running maritime dispute between Greece and Turkey over sovereignty in the Aegean, where the two NATO members' jets regularly engage in dogfights. Turkey has taken in more than 2.5 million Syrian refugees, and is a major transit point for migrants from Asia and Africa. More than a million migrants and refugees reached Europe last year, many making the dangerous boat journey from Turkey to Greece by boat. So far this year, more than 340 have perished in the cold waters trying to reach Europe. cw/msh (AFP, dpa, Reuters)",
        "generated_story": "NATO's Standing Naval Group in the Aegean to combat illegal smugglers The deployment of the NATO-led anti-terror force is part of a broader effort to tackle illegal migration in Europe. The move comes a day after Turkey announced that it would deploy a combat support ship to the Mediterranean Sea to fight illegal migrants. NATO has announced plans to deploy 3 billion-euro ($3.2 billion) to help tackle the influx of migrants and refugees from the Middle East, Africa and Asia, as well as to train and equip ships to deal with the growing number of refugees and asylum seekers seeking refuge in European countries. \"We are going to use this as an opportunity to make sure that we have the best possible situation,\" German Prime Minister Angela Merkel told a news conference in Bonn, Germany, on Thursday. Germany's defense minister, Ahmet Davutolgu, said the deployment was \"part of an ongoing effort by the European Union and the international community to address the refugee crisis in Syria and in other parts of Europe.\" Germany and Denmark have been leading the EU's efforts to stem the flow of migrant arrivals to Europe, which has been a source of tension between Ankara and Brussels over the past few weeks. Turkey has said it will not allow migrants to enter its territory without a permit, but it has not ruled out the possibility of doing so. EU leaders have said they are willing to cooperate with Turkey in its fight against the migrant crisis. In a statement released Thursday, EU foreign ministers said that they were \"deeply concerned\" about the situation in Turkey, adding that \"it is not a question of whether Turkey will be able to meet its obligations under the deal.\" The EU has called on Turkey to take action against migrants who are seeking asylum in Greece, Italy, Libya and other EU member states, including Greece and Italy. Ankara has also expressed concern that migrants are being driven from their homes by smugglers. German Chancellor Merkel said on Wednesday that Turkey was ready to provide asylum to migrants fleeing the conflict in eastern Syria. She also said Turkey would be prepared to accept asylum for refugees who have fled their home countries, such as Greece or Libya, if the migrants were allowed to return to their countries of origin."

Israel's army said several militants were killed after tunneling into Israel. Secretary of State John Kerry is due to arrive in Cairo on Monday where he is expected to urge Hamas to accept a cease-fire agreement offered by Egypt that would halt nearly two weeks of fighting with Israel. Meanwhile, the death toll in Gaza continues to rise. Medics on Monday said the number of Palestinian deaths in Gaza has risen to more than 501 since fighting intensified on Jul 8. Most of the dead are civilians. On the Israeli side, 13 soldiers were killed inside Gaza on Sunday, raising the number of soldiers killed since a ground operation began late on Thursday to 18. Two Israeli civilians also died in mortar and rocket attacks. The Israeli army said that more than 10 militants from Gaza were shot dead on Monday after infiltrating southern Israel. According to army spokespeople, two squads of militants were killed after tunneling into Israel. Israel's UN ambassador Ron Prosor, meanwhile, denied a claim by Hamas that an Israeli soldier had been kidnapped by the Islamist group, saying: \"Those rumurs are untrue.\" US President Barack Obama expressed concern about the rising death toll of civilians in a telephone call Sunday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, according to a White House statement. The US State Department confirmed late Sunday that two US citizens were killed in Gaza violence and released their names, but did not immediately disclose their occupations. US media reported, however, that the two were American members of the Israeli Defense Force, citing relatives and friends. \"We can confirm the deaths of US citizens Max Steinberg and Sean Carmeli in Gaza,\" spokesperson Jen Psaki said in a two-sentence statement. Late Sunday, the United Nations Security Council in New York held urgent talks on the conflict, and expressed \"serious concern about the growing numbers of casualties.\" \"The members of the Security Council call for an immediate cessation of hostilities,\" said Rwandan ambassador Eugene Richard Gasana, whose country currently chairs the 15-member council. hc/dr (Reuters, AFP, AP, dpa)",

Kerry is expected to make his first visit to Cairo since the end of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict on Jul 8. The visit comes a day after the UN Security Council adopted a resolution calling for an end to the conflict in the Gaza Strip. Israel, which has been embroiled in a bloody conflict with Hamas for more than a year, has rejected the resolution, saying it did not meet the needs of its own people. \"We are not going to allow this to happen,\" Israeli Foreign Minister Ron Prosor told a news conference in Cairo, adding that he was \"deeply disappointed\" by the failure to reach an agreement on the ceasefire. Israeli and Palestinian officials have been holding talks since last week, with the aim of reaching a deal by early next week. On Sunday, Israel's foreign ministry said it would hold talks with Egypt, Egypt and the Palestinian Authority to try to broker a truce between the two sides. In a statement, Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman said the talks were \"very constructive\" and that \"we will continue to work together to achieve the goal of a lasting ceasefire.\" Israel has called on Egypt to halt its blockade of Gaza, accusing Egypt of supporting Hamas, a Palestinian militant group that has claimed responsibility for the deadly attacks on civilians in recent weeks. Hamas has denied any involvement in those attacks, but Israel maintains that the attacks were carried out in response to a request by Hamas to end the blockade. Netanyahu said on Sunday that Israel was ready to resume negotiations with Gaza's Hamas rulers, who have called for a cease-fire. A spokesman for Netanyahu, however, said he had no immediate comment on Kerry's meeting with Netanyahu. According to Israeli officials, the meeting was scheduled to take place at the White House in Washington, D.C."

        "target": "A borderline war The crisis in Syria is in danger of drawing in neighboring countries. Despite the Syrian government's immediate apology, the shelling on the Turkish border has led to concerns about possible escalation. These weren't the first incidents on the Syrian-Turkish border, but the fact that several people on the Turkish side were killed by Syrian shells on Wednesday (03.10.2012) has brought the conflict between the two countries to a new level. It has led the Turkish military to retaliate for the first time. Several people were killed when Turkey shelled Syrian territory. But neither Turkey, which is a member of NATO, nor Syria would benefit from a broader conflict. An adviser to the Turkish president tweeted, \"Turkey has no interest in a war with Syria.\" Volker Perthes, director of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs in Berlin, agrees: \"Assad has no interest in an escalation,\" he told DW. \"That can be seen from the fact that the Syrian information minister apologized and expressed his regret over the victims immediately after the attack on Turkish territory.\" Perthes doesn't think it's likely that the Syrian President, Bashar Assad, wants to provoke Turkey to intervene in Syria. \"That would only accelerate the fall of his regime,\" he said. It's not yet clear who was responsible for the shelling. According to Syria's ally, Russia, it was a \"tragic accident.\" Relationship damaged The armed incidents on the Syrian-Turkish border have been going on for months. According to Amnesty International, some 300,000 Syrians have left their country since the start of the uprising against Assad, and many of them have fled to Turkey. The relationship between the two countries, which used to be close, has deteriorated dramatically, and the Turkish government is now openly supporting the Syrian opposition. \"Turkey is itself a player in the Syrian conflict,\" said Perthes. \"It provides shelter for many refugees and it's through Turkey that supplies come for the opposition.\" NATO has lined up behind Turkey and told Syria to end its \"flagrant violations of international law.\" Call for 'great discretion' The German chancellor, Angel Merkel, has also positioned herself alongside Turkey. \"We call on all parties to show great discretion,\" she said in Berlin. The foreign minister, Guido Westerwelle, declared that everything must be done to deescalate the situation, so that the Syrian conflict did not turn into a conflagration in the region. Indeed, the Syrian crisis is not only spreading to Turkey, but also to Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon. According to Perthes, \"The neighboring countries are partly victims and partly instigators. Jordan too has taken in refugees and supplies the rebels. On the other hand, Iraq has tended to support the government of Bashar Assad.\" Even so, he said, all the neighboring countries had an interest in ensuring the conflict was confined to Syria. Appeal to the international community But the number of Syrian refugees is rising by the day. Ruth J\u00fcttner, a Middle East expert with Amnesty International, believes this will continue in future months. \"It's important that the countries bordering on Syria are supported by the international community in providing accommodation, medical and psychological care and schooling for children,\" she told DW. It's an appeal she directs especially to European countries. The shelling on the Syrian-Turkish border has made it more likely that there will be armed conflict between Syria and its neighbors. According to Perthes, \"It's probably the case that political resistance in Turkey to intervention in Syria is decreasing right now.\"",
        "generated_story": "Turkey's response to Syrian conflict is 'not likely' The German Institute for International and Security Affairs (DIY) on Wednesday said the Syrian government was not likely to respond to the ongoing conflict in Syria.

        "target": "Libya factions declare ceasefire After two days of peace talks in Geneva, a tentative ceasefire has been called in the restive North African country. Although they sent no representatives to Switzerland, Islamists have agreed to halt the fighting. The Islamist-backed militia alliance that took over Tripoli and installed its own government announced a ceasefire on Friday, following a breakthrough in Geneva-based peace talks. Despite not attending the UN-brokered meeting, the militias have agreed to \"a ceasefire on all fronts,\" according to a statement issued by Islamist group Fajr Libya (Libya Dawn). The only condition is that \"the other parties respect the truce.\" The announcement came hours after the United Nations declared that Libya's warring factions had agreed to a roadmap for forming a unity government. Nearly four years after a NATO-backed revolt saw Moammar Gadhafi removed from power, two rival governments each backed by different groups of militias have plunged the country back into chaos and threatened all-out civil war. After the elected government of Prime Minister Abdullah al-Thinni was forced out of Tripoli by Libya Dawn, it was forced to move to the far eastern city of Tobruk while Libya Dawn reinstated the old parliament known as the GNC. The fighting and violence has displaced hundreds of thousands of civilians, left hundreds killed and thousands wounded. Most foreign diplomats fled the country and shut their embassies last year. The Tobruk government, as well as a few other factions who favor a peaceful resolution, came to Geneva to work on \"confidence-building measures,\" which includes the release of detainees from both sides, opening closed ports and securing safe freedom of movement around the country. es/bw (AP, AFP, Reuters)",
        "generated_story": "Fajr Libya declares ceasefire after two days of peace talks A ceasefire has been declared in the North African country of Libya after a two-day ceasefire brokered by a group of armed groups. The ceasefire, which began on Friday, is the first of its kind in Libya since the end of the civil war in 2011. Two days after the start of a ceasefire in Tripoli, the GNC (GNC) rebel group declared a new phase of violence in a bid to oust longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi. At the beginning of Friday's talks in Geneva, Libya's top military commander, Abdullah al-Thinni, announced that the ceasefire had been extended to include the entire country. \"We have agreed that we will continue to monitor the situation,\" he said, adding that he hoped to reach an agreement by the weekend. He also said he would call for an end to the fighting between pro- and anti-Gaddafi forces and a transitional government in Tobruk, a city in eastern Libya that has long been under the control of militias loyal to former Prime Minister and rebel forces. In a statement released by his office, he also called on the international community to support him in his fight against the regime of former President Moameh, who is now in exile in Switzerland. A UN peace envoy, however, said the truce was \"not enough\" and that \"it was not enough.\" \"The ceasefire is not sufficient,\" the envoy said. It was the second day of talks between the two sides, with a total ceasefire lasting until Friday evening, according to a UN report. Both sides have said they are willing to continue negotiations, but have not yet agreed on an exact date. On Friday the UN said it would hold a special meeting on Saturday to discuss the issue of whether to resume the peace process. There is no immediate date for the Geneva meeting, although the United Nations has said that it will hold an emergency meeting at a time when the country is in need of stability and stability.

        "target": "France's conservatives: Combating the National Front with a swing to the right A staunch conservative is joining the race for the French presidency. Republican candidate Francois Fillon could turn into a big problem for right-wing extremist Marine Le Pen's National Front. France's Republicans are moving to the right: by choosing Francois Fillon, voters nominated a presidential candidate who has a reputation as a staunch conservative. The former prime minister has already announced that he intends to refocus politics with the traditional family in mind. Fillon takes a dim view of homosexual couples adopting children. He wants to introduce a cap on the number of refugees allowed into France, he intends to make it harder for foreign nationals to access the social welfare system, and he wants to put Muslim communities and mosques under government control. In addition, Fillon advocates a renationalization of school curricula. Fillon makes gains in FN territory Fillon's agenda could turn out to be a problem for the \"National Front\" (FN). The 62-year-old appeals to similar sentiments as the right-wing party's base: concern about foreign domination and loss of identity, fear of terrorism and crime. \"For a long time, FN was the only political force that addressed those fears,\" said Henrik Uterwedde of the German-French Institute (dfi) in Ludwigsburg. \"Now a politician has arrived on the scene who addresses those fears using a different language and makes them a political offer.\" In rural, Catholic France especially, where traditions still matter a great deal, the avowed Catholic Fillon strikes a chord with his proposals pertaining to family and society policies. He receives support from traditional Catholic groups who, for years, have been able to mobilize crowds for demonstrations against gay marriage. During the intraparty election campaign, Fillon predominantly traveled to France's villages and small towns - regions which FN leader Marine Le Pen had labeled the \"forgotten France,\" regarding herself as their foremost lobbyist. \"Fillon has made gains in an environment that is also canvassed by Le Pen,\" Andreas Jung, Chairman of the Bundestag's German-French parliamentary group, told German broadcaster rbb-Inforadio. \"He does not represent the lofty levels of Parisian politics, but rather provincial entrenchment. Fillon is committed to traditional values, like the family. Therefore, he may not only be capable of defeating Le Pen, but also of taking the lead during the first ballot.\" 'Most dangerous candidate for FN' Consequently, the FN camp is less than enthusiastic about the conservative's candidacy. \"Because of Fillon, we now have a strategy problem,\" Marion Marechal Le Pen, the FN leader's niece, recently told journalists. \"He is the most dangerous candidate for the National Front.\" Pollsters' findings appear to support that statement. Recent surveys establish Fillon as the current favorite in the French presidential election scheduled for next May. However, Fillon's election is not a foregone conclusion. By denouncing the conservative candidate as a member of the establishment, FN tries to win over those who are frustrated with politics and politicians in general. There is persistent opposition against his economic-liberal plans in particular. Fillon wants to abolish the 35-hour working week and raise the retirement age to 65 years. In addition, he wants to cut 500,000 jobs in the public sector and reform industrial law. Fillon is known as an admirer of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. \"Issues pertaining to liberal economic policy have always been heavily contested in France,\" said Uterwedde. \"Fillon's adversaries have already taken up their positions, criticizing what, in France, is called 'ultra-liberalism.'\" That was one of the nastiest words in French politics, he added. An offer for the left Fillon wants to raise VAT by 2 percent. This would predominantly hurt low-income households. Exactly that clientele, however, is wooed by FN with a program that is regarded as rather left-wing. The right-wing extremists are on a clear anti-globalization course, intending to seal off the French economy against foreign countries and exit from the European Union. The party is already trying to present Fillon as a symbol of anarchic, ultra-liberal capitalism. \"Francois Fillon will even go beyond EU demands for austerity and liberalism,\" David Rachline, Marine Le Pen's election campaign manager, wrote on Twitter. According to current polls, it is very likely that Fillon will have to face Marine Le Pen in a runoff election in May. The main hazard for the Republican candidate: his economic-liberal course could deter left-wing voters from choosing the conservative in order to avert Le Pen. \"Francois Fillon will have to start making offers, also to those voters who are closer to the center and more moderate,\" said France expert Uterwedde. \"And he will, prior to the runoff election at the latest, have to make offers to left-wing voters - without changing his original course.\"",
        "generated_story": "French presidential candidate Francois Fillon is the most dangerous candidate for the French presidential election, according to a new report. The report by the German-French Institute in Ludwigsburg shows that the far-right leader of the National Front party, Marine Le Pen, is far more dangerous than the right-wing extremist. According to the report, the conservative candidate, who has been in the lead for months, has the potential to become the next prime minister of France. \"If he wins, he will be the strongest candidate in France,\" said Henrik Uterwedde, a professor of political science at the Ludwig-Inforadio think-tank in Germany. He added that \"if he doesn't win, then he's the least dangerous person in Europe.\" \"He's very dangerous,\" he said, adding that he would be a \"dangerous person\" if he were to win the election. In his own words, \"I don't think he can win.\" The study also found that Fonseca is more likely to lose the presidential race than his conservative rival, Emmanuel Macron, because of his anti-immigration stance. Foul's campaign has also been criticized by some French politicians, including former French Prime Minister Manuel Valls and former German Foreign Minister Andreas Jung, for his support of Marine le Pen's conservative party. On the other hand, it's not just the left-of-centre candidate who is a danger to French democracy. It's also the center-left, which has traditionally been more moderate in its approach to politics, such as its opposition to abortion and its support for gay marriage. Both candidates have been heavily criticized for their extreme views on abortion, gay rights and the use of violence against women and minorities in their own country. They have also faced criticism from some of their party's members for not being able to stand up for women's rights. And they are not the only ones who have called for a ban on the abortion of young people. A number of other candidates are also running for office. One of those candidates, French-born Andreas J\u00fcngde (pictured above), has called on French voters to vote for him in a runoff election next year. His party is expected to form a coalition government with the Social Democrats (SPD) and other conservative parties, and he has said he is willing to run for president if his party wins a majority of seats in parliament. But he also said that, as far as he was concerned, there was no way he could win a second term in office because he had no experience in politics and was not a member of a political party with which to make a living. That's why he won't be running. After all, his father was a staunch Catholic and his mother was the first woman to give birth to his first child. So he wasn't going to allow his son to be born in his home state of L\u00fcwigburg, where he grew up. This is not to say that there is no danger of him becoming president, but rather that his family would have to leave the country in order to get a better life for themselves. There are a lot of factors at play in this race. For one thing, if you have a child, you can't have your own family. You cannot have two children. If you've got a family, that's a big problem. What's more important is that your child has to grow up and learn how to live with himself. Do you know what you're doing? What do you want to do with your children? You can do that by being a good father? How can you teach your son a lesson? Can you tell him about your family? And what are you doing in your home town?"

        "target": "Berlin court rules Google Street View is legal in Germany A Berlin court has ruled that Google Street View is legal. But that doesn't mean the lawsuits will end, legal scholars say. A Berlin court has ruled that Google Street View is, in fact, legal in Germany. Last Tuesday, the Berlin State Supreme Court (Kammergericht) announced its decision in a court case from late last year, in which a woman had sued Google, fearing that photos of her, her family and the front of her house would be posted on Google Street View and would thus violate her property and privacy rights. The court ruled that it is legal to take photographs from street level, rejecting her argument that Google was trying to take unauthorized pictures. Part of her argument rested on the fact that Google used cameras mounted at three meters (9.84 feet) high, which could see over her two-meter-high hedge. However, the court did not find this argument convincing, given that the photographs were taken from the street, and not the sidewalk. Furthermore, because Google automatically blurs faces and license plates and did allow Germans to opt-out of the service to have their house obfuscated as well, the court did not find any potential violations. This is the first high-level court ruling, which cannot be appealed any further, regarding Street View since the service debuted in Germany at the end of last year. An ongoing debate Since Google announced plans to launch Street View in Germany last summer, debate around the service has become heated, with some politicians trying to stop it at every turn, while German Chancellor Angela Merkel famously said that she would not remove her house from Street View. In November 2010, the company announced that 244,000 German residents in the 20 cities had chosen to opt out of Street View - less than three percent of residents. However, in Germany and everywhere else, the company also allows people to report abuse, inaccuracies or request that something be blurred using an online tool. \"Our job is to develop services that respect these cultural differences,\" Peter Fleischer, Google's global privacy counsel told Deutsche Welle in November 2010. \"We try to anticipate them. We're all internationally-minded people ourselves. We try to guess how people will react to them. But a lot of these services are new and have never been on the market before, so we learn and we adapt as we go along.\" A 'landmark decision' European legal experts called the Berlin ruling a \"landmark decision,\" saying that this would now become part of German case law regarding property rights. \"Yes, other people are now warned: Don't sue Google simply claiming that Google Street View violates personality [or] property rights,\" wrote Thomas H\u00f6ren, a professor of media and communications law at the University of M\u00fcnster, in an e-mail sent to Deutsche Welle. But, he also warned that this decision was very narrow, focusing on the issue of property rights, and not on the larger issues of data protection from Google. \"The problem of Google Street View - to be honest - has never been a problem of personality rights or property rights, but the enormous risk of personal data compilations in cases where people use Google Street View for compiling personal profiles (such as building insurance companies; future employees, et cetera),\" he added. \"And this risk has not been considered by the Berlin courts.\" Similarly, Viktor Mayer-Sch\u00f6nberger, a professor at the Oxford Internet Institute, agreed that this case was \"limited in scope,\" adding in an e-mail, \"The plaintiff never alleged an actual invasion of privacy, just a potential one.\" Author: Cyrus Farivar Editor: Nancy Isenson",
        "generated_story": "A Landmark Decision on Google Street View in Germany A landmark decision has been made in the German city of Berlin on Tuesday on the future of Google's street-view product. The decision by the Berlin State Supreme Court is the latest in a series of high-profile cases in which the search giant has made its presence felt across the country. In November 2010, a German court ruled in favor of the company's search engine, which is used by millions of people around the world to search for information about the whereabouts of their homes and businesses. At the time, the decision was made by a court in Berlin, Germany's largest city. Since then, Google has expanded its search operations to cover more than 1.5 million square kilometers (1.6 million sq. miles) of territory. Google is also the first company to make the move into Germany, where it has a presence in almost every major city, including Berlin and Berlin. On Tuesday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel made the announcement that Google would no longer be allowed to sell its products to the public. According to a report in Deutsche Welle, \"the decision will not be binding for the rest of Germany.\" The court's decision comes a year after Google announced that it would stop selling its own products on its website. \"We are not going to give up,\" said Peter Fleischer, head of research at the University of M\u00fcnster in eastern Germany. He added that \"we will continue to work with Google to develop products that will help people find their way to their next destination.\" Google said it was \"very pleased\" with the ruling, adding that the new products would be able to be used in schools, colleges and universities. However, it did not say how many students would have to take part in such an experiment. Author: Cyrus Farivar Editor: Nancy Isenson"

        "target": "UK lawmakers propose jail sentences for reckless bankers A British parliamentary commission has completed its work on the overhaul of the domestic banking sector. Among other things, it proposed jail terms for bankers displaying grave malpractice and causing huge damage. Members of the UK's Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards agreed Wednesday that Britain needed a radical overhaul of its scandal-hit lenders. The panel, which was mostly composed of lawmakers, concluded in its final report that senior bankers must be made personally responsible for malpractice through the introduction of a new criminal offence of reckless misconduct. It would carry a prison sentence. The reputation of the country's banking sector had been damaged in recent years by a string of scandals, including Libor rate-rigging, credit insurance mis-selling and a controversy over staff behavior and bonuses in the run-up to the 2008 global financial crisis. The level of malpractice had been \"shocking and widespread,\" said the commission's chairman, Conservative party lawmaker Andrew Tyrie. RBS cut in two? \"Taxpayers and customers have lost out, and the economy has suffered,\" the 500-page report said. \"Under our recommendations, senior bankers who seriously damage their banks or put taxpayers' money at risk can expect to be fined, banned from the industry or in the worst cases go to jail.\" The commission called for bankers to sign up to a new code of conduct under which all key responsibilities within a bank would be assigned to specific senior officials who would be held responsible. The panel also proposed that more remuneration for bankers should be deferred for longer periods of up to ten years in order to \"reflect the longer run balance between business risks and rewards.\" The commission recommended that the government consider splitting the state-rescued Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) into a good bank and a bad one mopping up toxic assets. The report was published ahead of a key speech by Finance Minister George Osborne on his bank reform plans. hg/ipj (AFP, Reuters)",
        "generated_story": "Reprehensibility of Bank Mafia: A British parliamentary commission on banking standards has released a report on the banking mafia. The report, published on Wednesday by the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards (PBS), found that the bank mafia is not only a criminal organization, it is also a financial crime. \"It is a crime to be a bank robber,\" said Andrew Tyrie, a member of the PBS committee, which is tasked with investigating the financial crimes committed by banks in the UK and the United States over the past two decades. It is the first time that a banking crime has been investigated by a parliamentary panel, the commission said, adding that it was \"unacceptable\" for banks to commit such crimes. A spokesman for the committee said the inquiry was looking into the allegations made against the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) in 2008 and 2009, when the lender was accused of bank fraud and attempted to sell its shares in a London-based bank to the British government."

        "target": "Party leaders call for increased wages in growing German economy Chancellor Angela Merkel and other top officials have called for upticks in Germany's economy to trickle down to workers in the form of higher pay. But a leading think tank has warned against giving raises too soon. Germany's foreign minister and deputy chancellor, Guido Westerwelle, has added his support to comments made by Economics Minster Rainer Bruederle about increased wages for German workers. \"When the economy grows and this growth is substantial and sustainable, then the benefits of this upswing should be felt by the people who worked so hard for it,\" Westerwelle told the Hamburger Abendblatt newspaper in an interview. Westerwelle heads the free-market liberal FDP, which shares power with Chancellor Merkel's Christian coalition. Earlier this week, Bruederle, also an FDP member, said in light of Germany's currently growing economy, those economic gains should trickle down to employees in the form of higher wages. Merkel, who is also the head of the Christian Democratic Union, supported Bruederle's idea. \"That is something the chancellor sees the same way, letter for letter,\" said Merkel's spokesman, Steffen Seibert. Not so fast Earlier this week, analysts predicted growth of 3.5 percent this year and 2 percent in 2011. Germany's five leading economic think tanks also predicted that the number of unemployed would fall below 3 million next year, the lowest level since 1992. Despite the current rosy outlook for the German economy, not everyone is convinced that a growing economy should inevitably lead to higher wages. The president of the German Institute for Economic Research, Klaus Zimmermann, warned against reacting too quickly. \"I can't support the idea of a general wage increase, I think it is too dangerous,\" Zimmermann said in an interview with the Handelsblatt newspaper. Zimmermann wasn't opposed to the idea of raising wages, but said he was against across-the-board increases for all sectors and pointed out that not every industry is benefitting the same from the growing economy. \"We can't forget that the German economy did not resort to mass lay-offs when it wasn't going so well last year,\" Zimmermann said. Raising wages in some branches could be a good idea, Zimmermann said, as that would make those branches more attractive option to potential workers from outside of Germany.

The chancellor's spokesman, Rainer Bruederle, said on Thursday that the chancellor was \"not in favor\" of the wage increase. \"The chancellor is not opposed to the general increase,\" he said in an interview with the German newspaper Hamburger Abendblatt. However, he added that he was not \"in favor of it at all.\" \"I don't think it's a good idea for the government to increase the national wage,\" the spokesman said, adding that \"it's not the right thing to do.\" The FDP leader, Steffen Seibert, told the newspaper that his party was against the increase, arguing that it would be \"unacceptable\" for Germany to have to pay more to its workers than it is for its own people. He also said that if Germany's economy were to improve, it should be able to meet the needs of its citizens. In a statement released by his office on Wednesday, Westermann said he \"would not be willing to give up his position\" on the issue of higher wages for German workers. According to a report by the Economic Research Institute (EWR) in 2011, the number of people working in Germany rose by 1.6 percent to 2.4 percent in 2012, up from the previous year's figure of 3.2 percent. But the FDR spokesman Steff Seibper said the party's position was still unchanged, with only one exception: \"We are not going to raise the wages of our workers by any amount of money, and we will not do it in a way that will make the job more difficult for our employees.\" In the same report, a spokesman for Chancellor Merkel said she would not rule out the possibility of a \"general increase\" in wages, but that there was no evidence to suggest that this was the case.

        "target": "Belarusian president accuses Germany, Poland of coup plans Before being sworn in for a fourth term, the reclusive leader of Belarus fired a warning salvo at the European Union, accusing Germany and Poland of plotting a coup and threatening action against sanctions. Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko was sworn into office on Friday in a lavish ceremony boycotted by Western diplomats. The previous day, the 56-year-old leader openly accused Germany and neighboring Poland of planning a coup against him. \"There were [in Germany and Poland] plans worked out for an overthrow of the constitutional order,\" Lukashenko said in the Belarusian capital, Minsk, on Thursday. \"This is not an invention of our intelligence agencies.\" Lukashenko, who came to power in 1994, was re-elected last month with 80 percent of the vote in what the opposition and international monitors said was a rigged election. Relations between the reclusive Belarusian government and the West have been strained ever since. 'Belarus question must be answered' German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said in a statement that the accusations were \"baseless\" and an attempt by Lukashenko to draw attention away from his own wrongdoing. \"The EU needs to find a clear political answer to events surrounding the presidential election and the continued incarceration of opposition politicians and their supporters,\" Westerwelle said. A wide-reaching crackdown against the regime's opponents followed Lukashenko's re-election. Hundreds of his critics were arrested and dozens threatened with long-term jail sentences. Poland also dismissed the accusations as absurd and said that relations with Minsk would not be normalized unless all political prisoners were released. Sanctions threat The situation in Belarus pushed the European Union to adopt a resolution on Thursday in support of economic sanctions against the country. The threats earned a sharp rebuke from Lukashenko, who promised the \"hardest possible reaction\" should the bloc impose sanctions against his country. At the same time, the Belarusian prime minister, Mikhail Myasnikovich, travelled to Moscow in a effort to shore up Russian support for Minsk during its standoff with the EU. That meeting ended with a Russian promise not to impose its own set of sanctions on Belarus over an unrelated spat over oil exports and a commitment to resume a nuclear power plant project shelved after the 1986 Chernobyl disaster.

A parliamentary election in Belarus is scheduled to take place on Saturday, with the first round of votes set to be held in a week.

On Thursday, the EU's foreign policy chief, Guido Westerwelle, announced that he would step down from his post at the end of the year. \"I will not stand again,\" he said, referring to the scandal that broke during his first term as head of state in 1986.

        "target": "Indian government tells Supreme Court Rohingya pose'serious threat' After an appeal from two Rohingya, India's top court is considering PM Narendra Modi's plan to deport some 40,000 Rohingya in India. The government said intelligence data showed links between some Rohingya and terrorism. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government told the Supreme Court of India on Monday that the Rohingya were \"illegal\" immigrants. The hearing is taking place as Rohingya face severe violence in their native Myanmar. More than 400,000 Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh in the past few weeks to escape military and civilian reprisals that the United Nations has described as \"ethnic cleansing.\" Later on Monday, Myanmar's national security advisor said that his government was willing to welcome the refugees who had fled to Bangladesh back to their native Rakhine state, but that the details of the process still had to be worked out. \"We will make sure that everybody who left their home can return to their home but this is a process we have to discuss,\" Thaung Tun told Reuters news agency after a meeting with British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. It was unclear how this would affect the estimated 40,000 Rohingya believed to have settled in India, including 16,000 of whom are registered with the UN's refugee agency. Read more: Myanmar's Rohingya - A history of forced exoduses The Indian government told the court that it had intelligence data that showed links between some Rohingya Muslims and Pakistan-based terror groups and other international terror organizations. It argued that such links made them a \"serious threat to national security.\" The government also said there was a \"serious possibility of eruption of violence against Buddhists in India by radicalized Rohingya.\" Lawyer Colin Gonsalves, who in a separate case is representing about 7,000 Rohingya living in the northern Indian city of Jammu, countered the government's assertions. \"We just want to know: 40,000 people have been here, many of them for the last five years. Have you [the government] filed a single charge sheet, is anyone being prosecuted in the criminal court for being a terrorist? The answer is: no,\" he told DW. The court has adjourned the hearing in the matter to October 3. Lack of evidence India says it is not bound by the UN convention on refugees as it is not a signatory to the accord, but human rights activists disagree. \"The principle of non return of a person to a place where he will be executed or tortured has become a principle of customary international law which India follows,\" Gonsalves told DW. \"And it has attained the status of 'jus cogens,' which is a principle of law that no country can say is not applicable to it, such as torture and genocide.\" In a communication sent to all states in August, the Home Ministry [interior ministry] said the illegal migrants were more susceptible to terrorist recruitment efforts. But an investigation by Indian broadcaster NDTV found \"little evidence of the government claim.\" The investigation that was carried out at major Rohingya settlements in the country showed little involvement in criminal wrongdoing by the refugees. Lack of any evidence to support the government claim has led to speculations that the Rohingya were being targeted for their religion by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu-nationalist government. \"It is really unfortunate that the government is going back on its commitment to refugees which it has reiterated several times in the past merely because these Rohingyas are Muslims,\" said lawyer Prashant Bhushan, who filed the plea on behalf of two Rohingya men. \"I mean this is clearly a case of religious discrimination and an attempt to arouse a sort of feeling of... an anti-Muslim feeling or try and communalise the situation,\" he told reporters outside the courthouse. The UN's human rights chief last week deplored Indian government's move to deport Rohingya refugees. \"India cannot carry out collective expulsions, or return people to a place where they risk torture or other serious violations,\" Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein said. The Rohingya are an Indo-Aryan people, the vast majority of whom are Muslims. They usually migrate to India through a rather porous border to escape persecution in their native Rakhine state in Myanmar, where they have been denied citizenship rights. They are viewed by the local authorities as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. Myanmar's Buddhist majority is often accused of subjecting them to discrimination and violence. Read more: Rohingya people in Myanmar \u2013 What you need to know The ongoing violence follows an insurgent attack on security forces on August 25 in Rakhine state that sparked off a brutal military counteroffensive. Hundreds of people, the majority of them Rohingya, have been killed in the violence that has seen many homes destroyed and several villages burned down. Myanmar's government maintains the crackdown is part of a counter-terrorism drive, while the UN's al-Hussein has said that it \"seems a textbook example of ethnic cleansing.\"",
        "generated_story": "India says Rohingyas pose'serious threat' to India The Indian government on Monday said it was \"deeply concerned\" about the influx of Rohingya refugees into the country. The country's interior ministry said that the refugees were \"serious threats\" to its security. \"We are deeply concerned,\" Indian Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson told the UN General Assembly in an interview published on the website of India's state-run news agency NDTV, adding that \"it is a serious threat to the security of our country and to our security.\" The statement came a day after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the state of Rakhine on August 25, where the Rohingya are believed to be living in a refugee camp. Indian officials said they were aware of the situation in the area, but did not know how serious the threat was. India has a long way to go to deal with the crisis in Myanmar, according to a statement released by the ministry of interior and external affairs in Jammu and Kolkata on October 3. According to an official statement, the government is \"very concerned about this situation\" and will continue to do so until the end of August, when the Myanmar Supreme Court will hold a hearing on a case brought by a Rohingya refugee family in eastern India. In the meantime, India is working closely with Bangladesh, which is also part of Myanmar's security forces, to try to resolve the refugee crisis. On Monday, Bangladeshi President Sheikh Hasina called on India to take action against Myanmar over the issue, saying that it would be a \"grave and grave challenge\" if Myanmar continued to use violence against the minority community. Bangladesh's army chief, Gen. Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, also called for an end to violence between Rohingya Muslims and Buddhists. He said the army was ready to provide security to Rohingya, who have been fleeing persecution in neighboring Myanmar for more than a year. However, he added that there was no evidence that India was prepared to give up the fight against terrorism. A UN report on Rohingya violence in India last month found that around 1.5 million Rohingya people had fled their homes to Bangladesh in August to escape persecution and persecution. Author: Reuters"

        "target": "Armstrong stripped of Tour de France titles Cyclist Lance Armstrong has been stripped of his seven Tour de France titles and banned from cycling for life, in a much-anticipated ruling by the sport's international governing body. Monday's announcement by Pat McQuaid, the president of the International Cycling Union, ratified recommendations in an October report from the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), which ordered Armstrong's Tour de France titles be wiped out. \"Lance Armstrong has no place in cycling,\" said McQuaid. Addressing his remarks to cyclists, McQuaid said the fight against doping was his priority. \"UCI is listening and is on your side. We\u2019ve come too far in the fight against doping to return to our past. Cycling has a future and something like this must not happen again.\" The scathing USADA report included testimony from 11 former teammates, accusing Armstrong of running the \"most sophisticated\" doping program in the sport's history. The USADA said it had collected evidence to prove the seven-time Tour de France winner had engaged in the biggest doping conspiracy to date. Effect on cycling and sponsorship Monday's decision comes as the sport of cycling reels from Armstrong's well-documented fall from grace. Organizers of the Tour de France will be trying to move on from the scandal as the race prepares to celebrate its centenary next year. Sponsors have been deserting Armstrong and the sport in general. Last week, Nike - one of Armstrong's main corporate sponsors - said it was terminating its relationship with the cyclist and accused him of deception. Trek, the company that made the bicycles Armstrong rode to seven titles, announced on the same day it would terminate its sponsorship contract - as did the beer maker Anheuser-Busch. The Dutch institution Rabobank ended its association with professional cycling after the doping allegations came to light, leaving 17 riders in need of a sponsor. Last week Armstrong also announced he would step down from his own charity, the Lance Armstrong Foundation, also known as Livestrong, a move believed to have been intended to limit the damage to the organization from the USADA report. Armstrong appears Lance Armstrong spoke briefly to thousands of riders in Texas at a benefit organized by his charity, the day before UCI's decision. \"I've been better, but I've also been worse,\" he said. \"Obviously it has been an interesting and difficult couple of weeks.\" jr/rc (Reuters, AFP, AP)",
        "generated_story": "Lance Armstrong stripped of Tour de France titles Lance Armstrong has been stripped by the International Cycling Union (IUCN) of his three titles. Armstrong, who was cycling's most successful cyclist in the United States in October, was stripped on Monday of all titles he had won at the Tour of France. The IOC said Armstrong had failed a drug test and had been banned from cycling for three years. \"The IOC has decided that Lance is no longer eligible to compete in cycling,\" the organization's president, Pat McQuaid, told a news conference in Texas. He added that Armstrong was \"not fit for the sport\" and that he would not be allowed to participate in any other sporting event, such as the World Cup, the Grand Tour or the Olympic Games. A spokesman for Armstrong's foundation said he was not aware of the allegations against him, adding that \"the IOC does not have any information on Lance's whereabouts.\" \"We have no information about his whereabouts or whether he has any contact with any of our athletes,\" he said, referring to the athletes who have been suspended or suspended for doping offenses. US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) has also banned Armstrong from participating in major sporting events for a year and a half, and has banned him from all professional cycling activities until the end of October. In a statement released Monday, USADA said it had found no evidence of any wrongdoing by Armstrong or his team-mates. It also said that the team had \"no knowledge\" of Armstrong\u2019s whereabouts, which it said was a result of a \"technical error\" in a doping test conducted by a team of US authorities in late October and early November. jr/rc (Reuters, AFP, AP)"

        "target": "US Supreme Court Justice Scalia dies at 79, setting off succession showdown Justice Antonin Scalia, an outspoken conservative and the longest-serving member of the US' top court, has passed away in Texas. President Obama vowed to nominate a successor 'in due time,' despite political opposition. The 79-year old justice died in his sleep, presumably of natural causes, local media reported on Saturday. Scalia was visiting Texas for a hunting trip, and his body was discovered after he failed to appear for breakfast in the resort where he was staying. US President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama extended \"their deepest condolences to Justice Scalia's family,\" White House deputy spokesman Eric Schultz said. Texas Governor Greg Abbott described the conservative justice as a \"man of God, a patriot and an unwavering defender of the written Constitution and the rule of law.\" \"He was the solid rock who turned away so many attempts to depart from and distort the Constitution. His fierce loyalty to the Constitution set an unmatched example, not just for judges and lawyers, but for all Americans,\" Abbot said. Battle for the empty seat His passing is likely to open a new political front between President Barack Obama and the Republican Party, as Scalia's replacement could shift the composition of the court towards a more liberal persuasion. Several Republican lawmakers have already urged Obama to leave the decision to the next president who will be voted in later this year. \"The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court justice,\" Senate Republican majority leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement, referring to the upcoming November general election. \"Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president,\" McConnell concluded. President Obama, however, said he would fulfill his constitutional duty and nominate Scalia's successor \"in due time.\" \"These are responsibilities I take seriously, and so should everyone. They are bigger than any one party,\" he said. Decades of controversy Scalia joined the Supreme Court in 1986, becoming the first Italian-American to serve in the top judicial body. He was nominated by US President Ronald Reagan. Throughout his long carrier, Scalia voted in favor of privacy and protecting defendants' rights, but also against legalizing abortion, same-sex marriage and gun control. He also drew public attention for his theatrical flair and sharpness of tongue, as well as his alleged unwillingness to compromise. In June last year, the nine-person Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage with a five-to-four vote. Scalia, who was in the minority, commented he would \"hide my head in a bag\" if his own name were associated with the decision. He also said that the majority opinion was \"couched in a style that is as pretentious as its content is egotistic.\" dj/jm (AP, Reuters, AFP, dpa)",
        "generated_story": "Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia dies in sleep in Texas A US Supreme Court justice has died in his sleep. He was 85. The death of the conservative jurist was the latest in a series of events that have shaken the Republican Party in the wake of President Barack Obama's election victory in November. US President Donald Trump said on Saturday that he was \"deeply saddened\" by the news. \"We are deeply saddened by this tragic event,\" Trump told supporters at a rally in Austin, Texas, a day after the court announced it would no longer be able to confirm the late justice's death. In a statement released Saturday, the White House said the death had been caused by \"a combination of factors.\" The statement came after President Obama announced he would not seek re-election to the US Senate next year. Obama has said he will nominate a replacement for Scalia, who died last month at the age of 80. His death came just two days after his wife, Michelle Obama, was sworn in as the nation's first female president. On the day of his funeral, Obama said his family would attend the service, which was to be held at his ranch near the Texas state capital of Galveston. It was not immediately clear how many people had attended the ceremony, but it was widely reported that the funeral was attended by hundreds of thousands of mourners. A number of prominent Republicans, including former President Ronald Reagan, were also in attendance. Many of them, however, said they were not aware of what had happened to Scalia's body. They also said that they had not heard from him since he died, and that there was no indication that his death was related to his work as a federal judge in 1986, when he served as chief justice of a US federal court in San Antonio. After Scalia died on Friday, his body was taken to a hospital in Houston, where it remained for more than a week, according to US Deputy spokesman Eric Schultz."

        "generated_story": "My Freiburg: A tour with Tonatiuh Ibarra From Mexico to Germany I've been on a tour of Germany, Mexico and Germany. My first stop was in Mexico City, where I spent a few days with the German-born teacher. I had the chance to see the city of Mexico for the first time. It was a great trip, and I got to spend a lot of time learning about the country's history, culture and culture. We had a good time, but I was also able to catch up on my German studies and learn a bit more about Germany's cultural history. In Mexico, I took a trip to the Goethe Institute, which is located in the heart of the state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. On the way there, we stopped at a restaurant and had lunch. The food was very good and there were lots of interesting things to talk about, such as art, music, art history and the history of German society. There were also some very interesting discussions about German and Mexican culture, as well as a discussion on the subject of \"German-Mexican relations.\" I also took the opportunity to meet the director of a German language course at the institute. Tonatuh said he was \"very impressed\" by the professor's German accent. \"I think he's a very intelligent person,\" he said. He also said that he'd like to study German history in Germany for a couple of years, so he could get a better idea of what it means to be German. But he also wanted to get to know his country better, because he had never been to Mexico before. So I asked him to take me on his tour and he told me about his experiences in his native Germany and his desire to learn German in a foreign country. After all, it's not just Germany that's interested in learning German, he added, \"it's also the whole world.\" He said it was important to understand that Germany is a country of many different cultures and that it has different customs and customs than Mexico is. And that is something that I want to explore as much as I can in my own country, in order to find out what German is all about. That's why I'm going to try to make it as easy as possible for me to travel to a different country and see what Germany has to offer. This is my first trip abroad, after a long time away from my homeland, to my new home in Berlin. For me, the most important part of my trip was to visit my parents, my sister and my brother-in-law, who are both German Studies students. They have been living in their own countries for more than a year now and they've come here to stay with me for two years now. One of them has been a professor of philosophy and philosophy from the university of Berlin and she's been studying German since she was 12 years old. She's an expert on German literature and German philosophy. Another is an education and history teacher who has taught German for over 30 years. Both of these are very different things, she says."

        "target": "Opinion: The pope's impossible mission in Mexico Pope Francis's trip to Mexico is a dangerous mission - a diplomatic as well as political balancing act, one that brings with it enormous expectations. Francis won't be able to meet them, says DW's Astrid Prange. Dead prisoners, disappearing students, refugees shot dead and murdered priests. Mexico has lived through one violent episode after the other. The mood in the nation is explosive. And now this: just a day before the pope is set to arrive, more than 50 people died in the largest prison revolt in the country's history. What meaning does the pope's presence hold on such an occasion? Only one thing is certain: Francis won't be able to resolve the problems of the world's second largest Catholic nation in just a five-day trip. The unrealistic demands placed on him are not something he can fill. Yet the pope carries with him an important message: you don't have to love your enemies but you do need to speak with them. And he's living the example himself by meeting with the Russian Orthodox Patriarch Kirill on a stopover in Cuba on his way to Mexico. Cuba all over again It's sensational! Bannings and mutual ex-communications are ancient history. Nearly a millennium after the split, the head of the Roman Catholic Church and the head of the Russian Orthodox Church are speaking to each other. It's not as if the two will become friends - their positions are far too different. Yet their centuries-old enmity feels out of place and in view of the massive worldwide persecution of Christians, almost unchristian. And both of these church leaders know this. In Mexico, efforts to stem the polarizing forces at play in society have not been successful. The extreme differences between rich and poor are dividing Mexican society. President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto has prioritized economic growth over dialogue with his critics - a group which includes students as well as teachers and union members who regularly protest against government policies. They demand an end to lawlessness and corruption. The presumed murder of 43 teaching students in Iguala in September 2014, a crime which remains unsolved, stands as a symbol of the lawlessness sweeping Mexico. The recent mutiny in a Monterrey jail serves as further proof of the country's shortcomings in regard to human rights and the rule of law. With a visit to Ciudad Juarez and the largest prison in Mexico, Francis will only make that deficiency more transparent. Even the pope of peace has enemies. The route he's chosen to take on his travels through the country has displeased the staunchly Catholic president. A meeting with the relatives of the Iguala victims is therefore hush-hush and participation in a holy mass remains secret. Considering the tense situation in the country, it's still possible that the pope's route will change once again. The church in the pillory Even within his own church, Francis has met with opposition. A meeting he requested with victims from the church's abuse scandal will not take place - a bitter disappointment for many former seminarians who were abused by Marcial Maciel, the founder of the Legion of Christ, and members of his order. It's just one example of how impunity continues even within the church itself. None of the perpetrators have yet to answer for their crimes in court. It appears as though the pope has accomplished more on the world stage than he has brought on reforms to the Vatican. Despite the revolutionary coming together of Cuba and the US and the revolutionary meeting with Patriarch Kirill, the revolution in Rome has yet to materialize. Do you have something to say? Add your comments below. The thread to this editorial closes in 24 hours.",
        "generated_story": "Pope's impossible mission in Mexico fails to convince Mexico's Catholic Church Pope Francis has failed in his mission to Mexico, according to a report by a leading Catholic journalist. The pope has been accused of failing to persuade the country's Roman Catholic community of the need to send him to the United States. Astrid Prange, a journalist for DW, has written about the pope's failure to reach Mexico in September 2014, when he was imprisoned in a prison in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. In a letter to Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, the Vatican said that the pontiff's mission was \"impossible\" and that he would have to travel to Cuba, Cuba or Cuba to meet with the Russian Orthodox Church's patriarch, Patriarch Kirill. \"I don't know what the answer is,\" the letter said, adding that \"it is impossible for a pope to visit a country where there are so many people who are not Christians and who do not have the means to do so.\" The letter was published in the Mexican newspaper El Pais, and was translated into Spanish. It was also published by the Catholic news agency Diario d'Italia, which also reported on the Pope's trip, saying that it was the first time he had visited Mexico since the end of World War II. However, it did not say whether the trip was a success or a failure. DW spoke to Archbishop Marcial Maciel of Mexico City, who is also a member of Pope Benedict's staff. He told the newspaper that his visit was an \"unprecedented success.\" \"It is an unprecedented success,\" he said. But he added that there was still \"a lot of work to be done\" to get the message across to other countries, including Cuba and Cuba. On the other hand, he also pointed out that Mexico was not the only country that had a problem with him. That's why he's been criticized for not being able to make it to Washington, D.C. in time for the inauguration of a new pope. And that's not just because he doesn't have enough money to cover his own travel costs, but also because of his lack of experience in foreign countries. According to an article published last year in The New York Times, \"Pope Francis' mission is not impossible,\" referring to his trip to Latin America, where he met with Cuban and Cuban leaders, as well as Cuba's president, Vladimir Putin, during his time in office."

        "target": "Report: Torture is a European problem too A day after Amnesty International published a report on Europe's collusion with the CIA's torture program, the Council of Europe published its own shocking survey of abuse in detention centers across the continent. Prison guards in several European countries carried out reprisals against detainees who talked to the Council of Europe's Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT), the new CPT report has revealed. The council considers this a violation of the spirit of cooperation between the CPT and the Council of Europe's member states. According to the CPT's 24th General Report, released on Wednesday, reprisals were carried out against prisoners in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Greece, Hungary, Moldova, Russia, Spain, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and Ukraine. \"Intimidation or retaliation against persons the CPT has interviewed may not only violate their human rights but also strikes a blow to the preventive mechanism established by the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture,\" CPT President Letif H\u00fcseynov said in a statement. \"I urge national authorities to respect their obligation to prevent, investigate and punish such actions.\" The report also highlighted several problems with the detention of juveniles around Europe, and proposed a series of practical measures to protect young people's rights when detained. Ad hoc visits The little-known CPT, now 25 years old, represents a unique approach to international torture prevention. A team of specialists make roughly 180 visits a year to all kinds of detention centers (including prisons, police stations, holding centers for immigration detainees, psychiatric hospitals, and even social care homes) all across the 47-member Council of Europe - one of the few international blocs that offer platforms for dialogue with Eastern European regimes considered to have poor human rights records, such as Russia, Azerbaijan, and Ukraine. The method combines the carrot of talks with government officials and the stick of ad hoc visits, which all members are committed to allowing into their prisons. Once inside, the CPT also has the right to interview any detainees it chooses - in private, though of course the detainees have the right to refuse. \"The first thing to say is how important the CPT is,\" said Carla Ferstman, director of Redress, a UK-based organization that helps torture survivors. \"As a result of their boot work over a very long period of time, the UN has set up a global system which in many ways mirrors the approach of the CPT.\" But given that the committee has no powers to enforce its proposals to governments, there are question marks over its effectiveness. \"In the report, they complain about how some of the recommendations they've made have not been implemented,\" said Ferstman. \"It's a sign that they're a little bit frustrated.\" But in the long run, she maintains, the CPT has more than proved its value. \"The dialogue that they are able to have is really important,\" she said. \"Looking long-term, they have been very effective.\" CIA collusion, asylum seekers The CPT's report comes a day after Amnesty International released its own report on European collusion with the CIA's torture program. While the CPT's report examines more prosaic day-to-day mistreatment, rather than mass rendition of terrorist suspects at the behest of the US, there are obvious links between the two, since some countries - such as Poland, Macedonia, and the UK - are highlighted in both reports. \"What is finally coming out in all of this is that the Europeans, despite all the criticism of the Bush and Obama administrations on the use of torture - so many of them connived,\" said Judy Dempsey, senior associate at Carnegie Europe. \"It's really a double standard. This report is quite damning and quite shameful, and it follows the Amnesty International one as well.\" The CPT's work also mentions the mistreatment of asylum seekers, a problem increasingly afflicting European countries that take in the largest number of asylum seekers - particularly Spain, Italy, and Greece. \"With Greece there are two things to remember,\" Dempsey told DW. \"A - the appalling situation of the prison system, and B - the lack of training among police of how to deal with asylum seekers. Awful things have happened. Parallel to this is the illegal detention centers. There have been lots of cases of terrible mistreatment over the last several years.\" \"Immigration detention is a growing issue,\" added Ferstman. \"In the UK, there was a whole parliamentary inquiry into one immigration detention center, where some of the women alleged that guards propositioned them in order to get quick treatment on their claims. Each country has its own history of torture.\"",
        "generated_story": "The CPT is a European problem, but it's time to step up its game The European Commission's 24th General Report on Torture, released on Wednesday, said that the use of torture was a \"European problem\" and that it was time for the EU to take action. The Commission, which is part of the Council of Europe, has called on the US government to stop using torture as a weapon of mass destruction. \"We have a problem with torture,\" said Carla Ferstman, head of research at Carnegie Europe in the UK, adding that \"it is not only the Europeans who are victims, it is the whole world that is suffering.\" \"The European people are suffering the most from torture, and we have to do something about it,\" she said. Amnesty International, a non-governmental organization that works with human rights groups, called for an end to the practice of torturing people under the guise of providing medical care to them. Human rights organizations have also been calling for a halt to torture for years, particularly in Eastern European countries such as Greece, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary and Moldova, where torture is carried out by the CIA, according to a report from the UN Human Rights Council (HRRC), which was published in November.

        "target": "Dresden marks 70 years since massive Allied bombing Seventy years ago, Allied bombers attacked Dresden, killing tens of thousands of people, the majority of them civilians and refugees. Every year, the East German city remembers its dead. DW's Naomi Conrad was on hand. As the tram trundled through Dresden's drab suburbs on Friday morning, a prim, elderly woman suddenly turned to her friend sitting on the seat beside her: \"You know, my mother never told me about the bombings.\" She shrugged, then, after a moment's pause, continued. \"It must have been such unspeakable hell that she just couldn't talk about it,\" the woman said. She was referring to February 13, 1945 - the morning, exactly 70 years ago, when Allied bombers swooped down on an unsuspecting city famous for its baroque architecture and that, until that point, had survived the war mostly unscathed. That was to change in the course of three dreadful days: As the bombs rained down on the city, its churches and palaces were turned to rubble. Up to 25,000 people - many of them refugees fleeing the advancing Soviet Red Army - died in the inferno that raged in the city for days. \"There was nothing left, nothing,\" a frail, bent man with a checkered cap recalled, \"just rubble and death.\" He was leaning on the balustrade of a viewing platform in Dresden's old gasometer, staring down at the 360-degree painting by the Iranian-German artist Yadegar Asisi; sirens howled from hidden speakers and strobe lighting illuminated the ruined churches and black smoke billowing from the burnt skeletons that were once buildings. The man swallowed, his voice hoarse, barely audible: \"It's so hard being here.\" The soundtrack and images, he said, \"bring back too many memories.\" 'So, so many dead' He was 15, he recalled, working on a school essay when the sirens began to wail. He never finished the essay. Instead, he ran for shelter with his family. When they returned home three days later, the roof had been blown off, the windows smashed. \"But we were lucky: We survived,\" he said. \"There were so, so many dead.\" His voice broke and, muttering an apology, he shuffled off. The bombings were intended to break the German population's morale - a decision that to many was incomprehensible, given that the war had long been decided and Dresden's economic and strategic importance was relatively minimal. Consequently, the death and destruction wreaked by the Allied bombers quickly became a tool, first for the Nazi propagandists in the last months of the war, then by the East German regime for its anti-West propaganda, and then later by neo-Nazi groups, who traditionally congregate on February 13. Even today, \"the debate continues about guilt and innocence, even about the exact number of victims,\" Dresden Mayor Helma Orosz told a packed audience, including delegations from abroad, gathered for a memorial service in the city's Frauenkirche, which in 2005 was rebuilt with the help of private donations after Germany's reunification, many of them from the United States and Great Britain. Call for peace \"War, hatred and violence begin in people's minds,\" Orosz said. \"We must resist any attempt at once again categorizing people based on their origin and skin color,\" she added, referring to what has often been described as a right-wing catchall movement called PEGIDA, generally translated as Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West, which has taken to the streets in Dresden since October. Later, on a platform overlooking thousands of people, many of them wearing white roses as a sign of peace while bracing the icy cold outside the church, Orosz called on Dresden to remember every victim of the Nazi terror - a plea that was reiterated by German President Joachim Gauck when he took to the microphone: \u201cWe don't want the pain that people suffered here to be misused by others.\u201d Behind him, the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, who, back in the Frauenkirche, had talked of the \u201cmiracle that peace in Europe represents,\u201d leaned in closer to his interpreter. Then, as evening fell over Dresden and church bells tolled, thousands - possibly as many as 10,000, according to the city's press office - lined up along Dresden's riverfront, holding hands to commemorate the dead and call for peace as police men dressed in black riot gear looked on. \"I can remember it all,\" Siegfriede Leonhard, a vivacious woman in her late 70s said. She was 7 when the bombs fell, she said, and had been coming to the commemorations in Dresden \"for at least 60 years.\" Sometimes, she said, stomping her feet to keep warm, she wondered whether she shouldn't remember at home, alone. \"",

It was one of the worst attacks on German soil since World War II, when the city was attacked by the Soviet Red Army in the summer of 1945 by a group of German neo-Nazis. German Chancellor Helma Orosz said on Friday that the attack was a \"victory\" for Germany. \"It was an attack on Dresden,\" she said, adding that it was the first time Germany had suffered such a major attack in a long time. She added that \"it was not just Dresden that was hit, but also the whole of Europe.\" DW: How did this happen?"

        "target": "Experts: Taliban have not changed strategy with Kabul restaurant attack The weekend attack on a Kabul restaurant frequented by foreigners came as no surprise to international organizations on the ground. Experts don't believe the Taliban have changed their strategy to target more civilians. Dramatic scenes must have played out in the restaurant: Guests sought cover under tables as a group of terrorists shot wildly into the dining rooms. News agencies report the restaurant owner tried in vain to fend off the attackers. He was among the more than 20 people who perished, most of whom were employees at international organizations. The attackers were also among the dead. During the evening dinner rush, at 7:00 p.m. Friday (17.01.2014), one of three Taliban members detonated his explosives-laden vest and blew a breach in the highly secured restaurant. Neither the man-high blast walls, nor the secured access points with armed guards could stop the attackers. The two remaining terrorists were killed later in a firefight with security forces at the scene. No change in Taliban strategy The suicide bombing on the popular Lebanese restaurant, Taverna Du Liban, in the high-end Kabul neighborhood of Wazir Akbar Khan was the worst attack so far in 2014. Afghanistan votes for a new president in April; and the international troops are scheduled to withdraw from the country by the end of the year. Although there are plans for a small contingent to remain in Afghanistan, President Hamid Karzai first has to sign a bilateral security agreement with the United States. But he continues to play for time. In this context, the Taliban may be targeting civilians more in order to drive out not just the military coalition, but the entire international community. Yet \"as horrible as this incident is, I don't see a change in strategy,\" said Thomas Ruttig, the co-director of the Afghan Analysts Network. Similar attacks have also been launched before, \"at least 12 to 15 times in the past eight years,\" Ruttig said. The worst attack was in 2012 at Qargha Lake, a popular weekend destination near Kabul. More than 20 people were killed, all of them Afghans. Extensive security precautions The Taliban, which normally doesn't miss an opportunity for fiery rhetoric, hasn't declared a change in strategy. A spokesman for the Islamist militant group said the attack was retaliation for a NATO airstrike in Parwan Province, a few kilometers north of Kabul. According to an assistant of the Afghan president, seven children and one woman died in the coalition strike. \"You have to carefully monitor the security situation,\" Nils W\u00f6rmer, head of the Konrad Adenauer Institute in Kabul, told DW. \"But I think it's a bit early to talk about a change in [Taliban] strategy.\" W\u00f6rmer's office lies just a few hundred meters from the site of Friday's attack. He could clearly hear the explosion, which shook the window panes in his office. \"It was immediately clear to me that something had happened,\" W\u00f6rmer recounted. But the Konrad Adenauer Institute was prepared. \"We had a relatively concrete warning in the last week related to our neighborhood, and we were very cautious,\" W\u00f6rmer said. He met with colleagues in his secured office. Like most of the international organizations, the Konrad Adenauer Institute is also integrated into the security networks. \"The security precautions are high,\" W\u00f6rmer said. \"But that doesn't exclude the possibility that something similar could happen again.\" But the Afghan security forces have succeeded in preventing many attacks in the past few months, he said. Kabul residents criticize Taliban An informal, impromptu poll by DW's Kabul correspondent, Hussein Sirat, suggested the Taliban are not winning Afghan hearts and minds with such attacks. \"Wherever the Taliban have killed civilians, they have not achieved their goal,\" said Mirwais, a pedestrian in the Kabul city center. Idris, another Kabul resident, seconded Mirwais' sentiment. \"The Taliban intimidate the people so that the security agreement won't be signed,\" he said. \"But the people won't bend to this intimidation.\" How the international organizations adapt to the tense security situation in Kabul will come after many conversations, analyses, and briefings in the following days. But W\u00f6rmer is not thinking about giving up. \"We have a clear agenda and long-term projects, which I considered to be very sensible,\" W\u00f6rmer said. \"I am of the opinion, as I was before, that what I'm doing here with the Konrad Adenauer Institute is worth the risks.\"",
        "generated_story": "Afghan Analysts Network: The Taliban haven't changed their strategy with the Kabul restaurant attack The Afghan analysts network (AfD) says the Taliban have not changed the strategy of the Afghan government in the wake of last month's deadly attack on a restaurant in Kabul. \"The Taliban are not going to give up,\" said Nils W\u00f6rmer, a researcher at the Konrad Adenauer Institute in Afghanistan's Parwan Province. He added that the country's political and security situation has improved since the attack, which killed at least 17 people and wounded more than 250. The attack was the latest in a string of attacks on Afghan restaurants and bars in recent months. In the past few months, Afghan security forces have stepped up their attacks, particularly on the upscale Taverna Du Liban restaurant chain. Last month, the United States and its allies launched airstrikes against the establishment of a new Taliban-controlled Afghan capital, Kabul, in response to the deadly attacks in April. On Friday, US President Hamid Karzai and his Afghan counterpart Wazir Akbar Khan, both of whom were killed by the attackers, were arrested in connection with their alleged involvement in last year's attack. Afghan officials have said they have no plans to extradite the two men, who are believed to be linked to al Qaeda, to face charges of murder and attempted murder. They have also said that they will not release the names of those who died during the attacks. DW spoke to a senior Afghan analyst who said the government had not made any changes in its approach to Afghanistan, and that it was not yet clear whether they would be able to return to their old positions of power. According to him, \"the only thing that has changed is the perception that Afghanistan is no longer a stable and stable country. It is a very unstable country,\" he said, adding that there was no evidence of any change in strategy. But he also pointed out that Afghan authorities have been working to improve the image of Kabul as a safe and secure place to live and work in. Afghanistan has a long history of violence, he added, but it is not the first time it has been the case that a country has suffered from a terrorist attack in which civilians are killed or injured. This year, Afghanistan suffered its worst terrorist attacks since 2001 when a suicide bomber blew himself up in an attack at a popular restaurant near Kabul's Qargha Lake. That attack came just a few days after the US and NATO launched a counteroffensive against al-Qaeda in eastern Afghanistan. A number of Afghan media outlets reported on Friday that Taliban gunmen had attacked the restaurant, setting off a firefight between Afghan troops and Afghan civilians. However, none of these attacks were reported to have resulted in casualties, according to an Afghan expert who spoke on condition of anonymity. Author: Thomas Ruttig"

        "target": "Teabag filter cleans water with nanotechnology A new water filter developed in South Africa could provide millions of people with clean drinking water. The filter, about the size and shape of a teabag, would be inexpensive, easy to distribute and simple to use. Marelize Botes is conducting a final set of tests on a new type of diminutive water filter before industrial production can begin. The microbiologist pours water from a plastic bottle though a high-tech, teabag-sized filter before analyzing it in her in her laboratory at the University of Stellenbosch in South Africa. \"The filter is much cheaper than bottled water as well as any other filter on the market,\" she told Deutsche Welle. Instead of being filled with black or green tea, the bag contains active carbon granules and is made from nanofibers treated with biocide, which kills bacteria rather than simply filtering them from the water. Nanotech for pennies \"This project takes nanotechnology to the poorest of the poor people who live in this world, and it will make a difference in their lives,\" said Eugen Cloete, who in addition to inventing the filter is dean of the faculty of science at Stellenbosch University and chair of Stellenbosch University's Water Institute. With some 300 million people in Africa - and over a billion worldwide - living without access to clean drinking water, the need for such a filter is huge. When in mass production, the developers said they expect the teabag to cost just a few South African cents (under half a US cent and under a third of a euro cent). In addition to being inexpensive, Botes said, the filter is also easy to distribute to rural area and simple to use as it can be place in an adapter that fits on nearly any regular-sized plastic bottle. Each filter can clean one liter (one quart) of the most polluted water to the point where it is completely safe to drink. Once used, the filter can be disposed of and is biodegradable. African countries, led by Somalia, Mauritania and Sudan, were ranked to have the most vulnerable water supplies, according to a June report by UK-based risk consultancy firm Maplecroft. Decentralized use The filter's small size and light weight make it ideal for rural areas where other means of filtration do not exist, Cloete said. \"It is simply impossible to build purification infrastructure at every polluted stream,\" Cloete said. \"So we have to take the solution to the people. The water is cleaned right then and there when you drink from the bottle.\" The filter is now undergoing testing by the South African Bureau of Standards, after which Cloete and his team hope it can be rolled out to the United Nations and non-governmental organizations that have expressed interest in it by the end of the year. The project grew out of research into larger filters, according to Cloete. \"We were busy developing filters for larger applications, but when you do the tests in the labatory you do the tests on a much smaller scale,\" he said. \"The results we were getting on a smaller amount of water promoted me to think about a smaller application.\" Author: Joerg Poppendieck, Sean Sinico Editor: Anke Rasper",
        "generated_story": "South Africa launches Teabag-sized water filter for decentralized drinking in Africa South Africa's Water Institute has launched a new technology for decentralizing water supply in the country. The technology is designed to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in drinking water. Marelize Botes, a water expert at the University of Stellenbosch in Johannesburg, told Deutsche Welle that the technology could be used to improve water quality in rural areas. \"This technology can be easily adapted to meet the needs of rural communities,\" she said, adding that it could also be adapted for urban areas, such as towns and villages, as well as schools and universities. It is currently being tested by the South African Bureau of Standards (BOS), a risk consultancy firm, and is expected to be deployed by early next year. Bots said the system, which is being developed by Maplecroft, would be able to handle a wide range of water needs, ranging from low-lying areas to rural and remote areas with high-altitude rainfall and high winds. In addition, it would allow the water to flow through a network of pipes and pipes, making it easier for farmers to sell their produce to their customers. According to the company's website, the new system will be available by mid-year, with the aim of reducing the number of people who have to drink from a tap to a single tap. However, there is still a long way to go before it is ready for widespread use. There is a lot of debate about the effectiveness of this technology, especially in developing countries, where it has been used for many years. For example, in Mauritania, for instance, water is only available to those who can afford to pay for it. At the same time, people in other African countries have been using it for the past few years to make sure that their water supplies are safe and that they are not being used as a weapon against the poor. This is not to say that water isn't safe, but it's not safe for people to use it in their own homes. That's because it can lead to diseases and diseases that can spread to other areas of the world. But it also means that people are more likely to live in poverty than in countries where they do not have access to basic services like electricity or water heaters. And that's a problem that is becoming more and more acute as the population ages. So, we're going to try to find a solution to this problem. We'll see what we can do. I think the solution is to have a system that works for all people, not just the poorest and the most vulnerable. You can't just throw away your water and throw it away, because you don't want to contaminate the environment.\" The system is based on the principle that all water must be recycled and stored in a sealed container, so that no one else has to worry about it contaminating the soil. While it may not be easy to clean up after a disaster like this, this is the first time that this kind of technology has actually been applied to people's homes and businesses. What is important is that we have the right to know what is going on in our home country and where we are living. How long will it take for us to do this? What do you think? Do you have any idea how long it will take to get this system to work? Can you imagine what the future will hold for your family and your children? The answer is, of course, that you'll never know for sure until you see the results of your own research. If you do, you can imagine that your child or your grandchild will grow up with a family that doesn't have enough money to buy a house or a car, or even a home."

        "target": "How to wrap a present without using paper or tape Next time you get invited to a birthday party, you could try wrapping the present using a piece of fabric and ribbon. It's very easy and the best bit is, it can be reused. Maybe it will come back to you on your birthday. 1. All you need is a piece of fabric big enough to wrap your gift, a ribbon long enough to go right around it, and if you want to make a gift tag, you will also need a piece of old cardboard, a hole punch and another small piece of ribbon. Ready? 2. No, wait, we forgot the present. Get that, and you have everything you need. Spread the fabric on the ground and put your gift on top 3. Fold the fabric around the gift you are wrapping 4. With the last little bit, you don't tuck it under, but create a little flap on top 5. Fold that flap over like this 6. Take one end of the parcel and tuck the fabric inside, BEHIND the gift inside 7. You can take your time to wiggle it all inside. Make it as flat as you can 8. Once it is all inside, turn to the other end and do the same thing again 9. When you have done both ends, it should look like this. Your present is all tucked up inside and you don't need any tape to keep it closed 10. Now for the ribbon. Place the gift on top of it 11. Tie the bow 12. So it looks like this. Finished? If you want a gift tag, that comes now. If you don't you're done! 13. Cut a piece out of an old cardboard box and make a hole in it using a hole punch. Watch your fingers though ;) 14. Put a piece of short ribbon through your hole 15. Tie the tag to your gift 16. And you are finished! P.S. You can either ask your friend to reuse the fabric, and show them how to wrap with it, or if they don't like that idea, you can take it home with you to use again the next time. And remember, you don't have to buy the fabric. You can use an old pillow case, an old t-shirt or skirt, or whatever you want. You can even make your ribbon from an old t-shirt if you don't have any. Happy wrapping.",
        "generated_story": "How to Wrap a Present Without Using Paper or Tape In order to wrap a present without using paper or tape, you must wrap it with paper and tape. How do you wrap your present with a paper towel? Read on to find out how to do it without paper, tape or scissors. Read more: How to Wrap Present With Paper and Tape in the Past Without using Paper, Tape or Paper Or Tape A present is wrapped in a plastic wrap and placed on top of the present. It is then used as a wrapping paper to cover up any wrinkles or creases that may be presentable. You can also use a tape measure to seal up the paper. This method is called \"wrap\" and can be used for a number of different purposes. One of them is to use paper as an adhesive. Another is simply to tape the tape around the edges. The tape is used to protect the material from the sun, so that it doesn't stick to the fabric. Finally, it is just a matter of putting paper on the packaging and wrapping it up. If you don't have paper tape on hand, then you can use tape to secure it to your finger. But if you do have plastic tape in your pocket, use it sparingly. That way you won't be able to see what you're doing. And that's okay, because it's not as easy as it might seem. Paper is not the best material for wrapping presents, but it can still be very effective. For example, paper is the most effective method of wrapping a gift, and it has a lot of advantages over paper wrap, such as reducing the amount of time it takes to store the product. In addition to that, there are advantages to using tape instead of paper when wrapping the gift. \"Paper is a good substitute for paper,\" says one expert. Tape is also a great option for sealing presents. However, plastic is more expensive than tape and is less effective at sealing them in place. As a result, the presents are more likely to be torn up and torn in half by the time they're ready to take off. A good example of this would be wrapping your presents in plastic and then putting them on a table, which is what I did with my present when I was in high school. I used tape for the wrapping of presents and wrapped them around my finger and hands. Then I wrapped my hands and feet in tape so they wouldn't fall apart. Now I can wrap my presents with tape again and wrap them again. What do I do with all this tape? Do you have a solution? Is it really necessary? What is your solution to this problem? I think it depends on how much tape you use? Can you tell me?"

        "target": "European court overturns law requiring German-language skills for spouse visas The European Court of Justice has overturned a German law requiring foreign spouses from certain non-EU countries to take a language test before receiving a visa. The ruling primarily affects Germany's Turkish minority. The European Union's highest court on Thursday ruled in favor of a Turkish citizen, who was denied a visa to live in Germany with her husband, because she was illiterate and therefore unable to demonstrate basic German-language skills. According to the court, a lack of language skills shouldn't automatically lead to the rejection of an entry visa application. Instead, Germany must consider the unique circumstances of each individual case. The court went on to say that quickly granting visas for spouses improves the quality of life and promotes the integration of foreign residents. Specifically addressing the case of the Turkish plaintiff, the court ruled that the rejection of her visa had violated a bilateral treaty between Turkey and the EU. In 1970, Brussels and Ankara agreed not to tighten their residency laws for each other's citizens. Law only applies to some In 2007, Germany introduced the requirement that spouses from certain non-EU countries must demonstrate a basic grasp of German before being granted a visa to live in Germany with their husbands or wives. Spouses affected by the law are required to obtain a basic language certificate from recognized centers, such as Germany's Goethe Institute, proving that they have an A1 level, or \"Beginning German\" language ability. The German government claims that the goal of the language requirement is to prevent forced marriages as well as marriages made simply for the sake of obtaining a visa. Citizens of European Free Trade Association (EFTA) member states are exempt from the language requirement. That includes Iceland, Lichtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. In addition, citizens of Australia, Canada, Israel, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea and the United States also don't have to demonstrate German-language skills. slk/xx (AFP, AP, dpa, KNA)",
        "generated_story": "EU court overturns Turkish language skills law The European Court of Justice on Thursday overturned a law requiring Turkish spouses to learn German in order to compete in the European Union. The court in Brussels said the law violated the rights of spouses and children of Turkish citizens living in Germany. \"The European court of justice has ruled that the new law does not violate the right to a fair and equal trial,\" the court said in a ruling. It also ruled in favor of the Turkish-born spouses of EU citizens, who had been barred from entering the EU for five years by a court ruling in 2007. In the ruling, the judges said that Turkey was not to blame for the lack of cooperation between the two countries, but that it was to be expected that both countries would be able to work together to achieve their goals. Germany, however, said it would appeal the decision, saying it did not have the legal authority to do so. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Thursday that she was \"very disappointed\" by the lower court's ruling and that \"it was unfair and unfair\" for Turkey to impose its own laws on its citizens. She added that Germany was the first EU country to allow Turkish nationals to enter the bloc without having to prove they had a German background, which would have meant that they could not compete with other European countries in terms of their own language and culture. Turkey is one of only a handful of countries to have such a system in place, according to the Goethe Institute, a think-tank in Berlin. According to German newspaper dpa, it is the only country in Europe that has such an extensive network of German-speaking spouses. However, Germany is also the country with the largest number of foreign-owned Turkish companies, with more than 1.5 million employees, and has a total of 2.4 million foreign workers. This is in contrast to Sweden, Norway, Switzerland, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the United States which have all had similar laws passed in recent years. Norway and Switzerland are the other two EU member states with a similar law. Both countries have laws that require spouses with Turkish background to register as foreign nationals in their home countries. They are also obliged to provide a certificate of citizenship for their spouses, while Switzerland and Australia have no such laws. On Thursday, an EU court rejected a request from Norway to introduce a new language test for spouses who are not Turkish. That test will be carried out on the basis of whether they have Turkish citizenship and whether the test can be used to determine whether or not they are eligible for a job offer. At the same time, they will have to sign up to receive training in German, Swedish, Norwegian, Dutch, German and Norwegian languages, as well as the equivalent of a diploma in French and German from the University of Lichtenstein in Switzerland. If they do not sign the exam, then it will not be available to them. There is no way to know for sure how long the tests will take place. For example, if a spouse is Turkish, he or she is not allowed to use the language of another country's language. But if she has Turkish parents, she can use it in her own home country. And if they don't have a Turkish spouse, that means they can't speak German. So the question is, how do you know if the German language is good enough for them? Do you think that's a good thing? If so, I think it's not a bad idea to try to teach them German? It's an easy question to answer, because it doesn't make any sense at all. What's more important is that you can teach your children German as a foreign language, so they understand it better than you do in other languages. You can do that in your own country, for example."

        "target": "Bayern Munich coast to win over Nuremberg Bayern Munich wrapped up the 12th Bundesliga match day with an easy win over Nuremberg. Freiburg scored an extra time goal to squeak out a victory against Hoffenheim. Bayern Munich cruised to a 3-0 victory at home against Bavarian rival FC Nuremberg on Sunday, closing the German soccer tables for the weekend. Striker Mario Gomez got things going in the 10th minute for Bayern and also scored the final goal in the 75th minute off a corner kick from Franck Ribery. Ribery came on as a substitute five minutes earlier, making his first appearance for the team since injuring his ankle in September. Near the end of the match, Gomez had an opportunity for his third goal on a penalty kicked but missed. Thirty points at break Phillipp Lahm successfully converted a penalty kick in the 57th minute to round out the scoring for Bayern. The victory for Bayern moved them into sixth place in the table with 19 points and has continued a slow shift in momentum following a rough start to the season. Bayern coach Louis van Gaal said after the game he hoped his team would have 30 points by the end of the first half of the season in five more matches. Cisse saves win for Freiburg In Sunday's other Bundesliga match, Senegal striker Papiss Demba Cisse broke a scoreless deadlock with a goal in the 91st minute to give Freiburg a 1-0 win over Hoffenheim. Cisse has now scored 10 goals in 12 games and is currently the Bundesliga's second highest scorer. The win moves Freiburg into fourth place in the table with 21 points, one ahead of Frankfurt in fourth and three behind Bayer Leverkusen and Mainz, in second and third place, respectively. Nuremberg drop to 10th place with 18 points at the end of a very tight middle group. Just three points separate Nuremburg from Freiburg. Hoffenheim also have 18 points but are two places ahead of Nuremberg in eighth place on goal difference. Author: Matt Zuvela (dpa, sid) Editor: Sean Sinico",
        "generated_story": "Bayern Munich 3-0 Freiburg: Papiss Demba Cisse seals win for Bayern Munich in Bundesliga The Senegal striker sealed Bayern's third win in as many games as possible on Sunday, scoring a brace for his side. The 23-year-old midfielder, who has been linked with a move to Hoffenheim for the past two seasons, scored the first goal of his Bayern career in a 2-1 win over FC Nuremberg in the Bundesliga. He was on the pitch for a few minutes before the break, but he was nowhere to be seen. His goal gave Bayern the lead they had been looking for all season. It was his third goal in four games, and his first since the end of the season in September. \"I'm very happy with the way I've been playing,\" he said, adding that he is \"very happy\" with his team-mates' performances in recent weeks. In September, the German side had lost to the likes of Bayern, Cologne and Mainz by a combined score of 4-2. Last month, Bayern were eliminated from the Champions League after they were knocked out by the Wolfsburg squad. This season, however, they have been on top of their Bundesliga table, with Bayern leading the table by 10 points. They have a chance to win the league title in their last three games. But they are still a long way from reaching the top four in Germany, where they will have to wait until September to make sure they can reach the next level. On the other hand, there is still time to improve on their recent form, which has seen them qualify for next year's Bundesliga playoffs. That is, if they don't make it through to next season's playoffs, then it will be up to them to decide whether they want to stay there or not. If they do decide to go for it, that would be a big step forward for them. And that is a good thing, because it would give them a lot of momentum going into the second half. There is also the possibility that they could make a run at the title. After all, it is only a matter of time before they find themselves in that position again. So far, so good. I think they're going to try to get back into it. We'll see how it goes. You can't just sit back and wait and see what happens. What can you do? We've got to find a way to keep the pressure on.\" The German club's goalkeeping coach, Phillipp Lahm, said that the goal was \"a very good goal\" and that it was a \"good goal.\" \"It was good to see that we were able to come back from a deficit and get a result,\" said Luka Modric."

They were originally arrested for taking photographs of restricted areas. Slovak citizens detained by the Iranian authorities on suspicion of taking photographs out of bounds have returned home, said Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico. Eight people in total were arrested in May after taking photographs of restricted areas. A Slovakian news website said the group was detained near the central city of Isfahan, where Iran has nuclear facilities. The six that have been freed attended a news conference held by Prime Minister Fico in the capital, Bratislava on Sunday. Fico told reporters that the government was working to secure the release of the remaining two paragliders who are stiil in custody. \"Negotiations were fair and their result is the release of six out of eight detainees,\" Fico was quoted as saying on the government's website. He added that Slovakia had not made any \"financial commitments\" in the negotiation process. Detainees 'unaware' of rule-breaking One of the released paragliders, Vladislav Frigo, said the group did not break any rules it was aware of. \"We had information that there was a ban on taking photographs below the height of 2,300 metres. We were taking pictures from higher (altitudes),\" said Frigo. He added that the detainees were well treated, had access to television, a refrigerator and could cook for themselves as well as getting regular meals. Foreign nationals accused of spying In recent years, Iran has levelled accusations of espionage against both foreign nationals and Iranians. Two U.S. citizens - Josh Fattal and Shane Bauer - were sentenced to eight years in jail for spying after being arrested while hiking along the Iraq-Iran border in 2009. They denied espionage - neighbouring Oman helped secure their release in 2011 by posting bail of 1-million US dollars (756,000 euros). Last year, Iranian-American Amir Hekmati was sentenced to death for spying for the CIA, but judges overturned the decision and ordered a retrial. lw/ipj (Reuters, dpa)",
        "generated_story": "Slovak President Robert Fico releases Slovak paragliders on suspicion of spying in Iran Slovakia's president has ordered the release of six Slovaks who have been detained in the United States over allegations of espionage. The men, aged between 30 and 60, were detained on Sunday by the U.S. intelligence agency, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in Bratislava, Slovakia. They are suspected of having links to the Iranian government and of plotting to overthrow the government of Slovakia in 2011. Slovakia's prime minister, Vislav Frigo, has denied any involvement in any of the alleged crimes. \"We have no evidence that we are involved in this,\" he said in an interview published on the website of his official website. Slovakia is one of a handful of countries where the CIA has been able to track down and interrogate suspected spies, including the head of state's secret service, who was arrested in May in connection with an alleged spying operation in Iraq. He said he had no information about the men's whereabouts, but that he did know that they were being held in Isfahan, Oman, where they are believed to be hiding in a house in southern Slovakia, according to a government source. A US official told Reuters that the arrests were made after a tip-off that a man had been in contact with the spy agency's director of intelligence, Josh Fattal, in exchange for $56,000 (1.56 million euros). The official said the information came from an internal CIA document, which was handed over to him by his wife and daughter-in-law. It was not immediately clear whether the document contained the names of those arrested, or if the man was a CIA agent or a member of an Iranian intelligence service. In a statement released Sunday evening, Fic said his government was \"deeply concerned\" about what was happening in Slovakia and that his country was in danger of losing its ability to defend itself against the threat posed by Iran. On Sunday, he also said that Slovakia was working with Iran to find a way to protect itself from Iranian influence and influence. His office said it was looking into the matter, adding that it had not received any information at the time of their arrest."

        "target": "French presidential debate does little to woo undecided voters This year's French presidential race is perhaps the most closely watched election in recent history. Many voters are still undecided, including those in the Paris caf\u00e9 where DW's Jake Cigainero saw the latest TV debate. Just over two weeks ahead of the first round of voting in France's presidential election, all 11 candidates met for the second televised debate of the campaign. It was the first time in the history of French elections that the entire official ballot shared a television stage. This race for the Elysee is perhaps the most closely watched election in the history of the Fifth Republic in view of conservative candidate Francois Fillon's embezzlement charges, the deterioration of the left, political amateur Emmanuel Macron's surprise surge to the top, and the rise of Marine Le Pen's National Front. With so much media attention on the five main candidates, Tuesday's debate felt almost like a consolation for the six other candidates rarely in the spotlight. For French voters watching the televised debate at Cafe des Phares on Place de la Bastille, the saturated stage kept the candidates from detailed discussion of pressing issues. For those who are still undecided, the debate did little to bring them closer to choosing their pick for president. Vincent Couronne, a researcher, said it was good to see candidates who don't get as much media attention. However, 11 candidates at once for the political spectator was overkill. \"It wasn't very interesting. It's just one position after another. There's no real debate. It's not like when it was just five candidates.\" Boredom all round Charlotte Theuvenin and her friends, all students in their early 20s, tuned out early on from boredom and exasperation. \"It was too flat and too hypocritical. Fillon and Le Pen play with our money, then say they did nothing and that they are good for our country,\" she said. As though addressing the candidates in front of her on the TV screen, she added, \"How dare you talk about being president when you use our money for your own interests.\" Le Pen had come under fire over accusations that she misused public funds to pay bodyguards as parliamentary assistants. Francois Fillon of Les Republicains, meanwhile, is under investigation for allegedly paying family members more than 1 million euros ($1.1 million) for government work they never carried out. Frequently casting a blank stare at his opponents, Fillon also seemed bored, or at least more subdued compared to the first debate. Couronne said, \"Fillon seems to be not there. Probably because he knows all the small candidates can attack him on the criminal offenses he's accused of.\" Debate watchers cited Europe as the most important issue of this election, with many fearing Le Pen's promise to tear France out of the European Union in a so-called Frexit. Though no one at the cafe vocally supported Le Pen's plan, several acknowledged the EU is a pressure point for France. \"France's place in Europe in relation to Germany is a very important issue,\" said student Thibault Cirier. \"The general problem is France has lost its influence at the European level over the years, and that needs to be remedied, because France is one of the founders of Europe and should have a strong place in the union. The EU is also important for cohesion and to have a strong position internationally.\" Caf\u00e9 viewers say no to Le Pen Cirier was initially excited by Macron when he launched his campaign, but ultimately decided there was no substance. Now he says he will probably vote for far-left candidate Jean-Luc Melenchon. Kevser Taspinar also said she liked Melenchon for his fighting spirit and that \"he throws barbs.\" As a practicing Muslim who wears a headscarf, she said the most important issue for her is laicite, France's state institution of secularism. \"For me Hamon has the best interpretation of this. Maybe Hamon,\" Taspinar said hesitating. \"I'm still undecided, because there's Melenchon.\" Another viewer, Marie Dubois, said that although she really liked Melenchon, she had definitively decided on Macron. \"Melenchon has a way of putting humanity in politics and giving hope,\" she said. \"But Macron is the only possible candidate.\" With polls putting Le Pen and Macron in the second round on May 7, the undecided voters at this Paris cafe said they were certain which candidate they would not for vote for in that scenario. \"Definitely Macron. There is no way I am going to vote for Le Pen,\" Theuvenin said. \"I will never vote for that woman or Front National, no matter who is running against them in the second round.\" Tuesday was the final debate for Macron and Melenchon, two of the crowd-pleasers among the candidates. Both have pulled out of the third debate on grounds that it cuts too close to the first vote just two days later on April 23.",
        "generated_story": "French presidential candidate Francois Fillon faces off with Marine Le Pen The French presidential hopeful is facing off against the far-right National Front (NFP) in a runoff election on May 7. French media reported on Tuesday that French President Emmanuel Macron was facing a tough re-election campaign in the country's second-largest city, the Elysee. The election is expected to go to the polls on April 23, with the first round of voting set to take place later this month. In an interview with DW's Jake Cigainero, French political analyst Thibault Cirier said the election would be a referendum on whether or not to leave the European Union. \"I don't think it will be an easy decision,\" he said, adding that he was \"very disappointed\" by the outcome of the runoff. France's presidential election has been marred by a series of violence and violence, including attacks on police officers and a shooting at a police station in Paris last week that killed at least 15 people and injured more than 100 others, according to a report by French news agency Les Republicains (Le Pen). \"It's a very difficult decision to make, but I think we can make the right choice,\" said Caspinar, who is studying at the University of Paris. He added that \"it's not just a question of who wins, it's about who loses.\" \"We have to decide whether we want to run for president or to stand for a third term.\" The candidates have been running for the past two years, and the French president has repeatedly said he wants to stay in office until the end of his term in May. On the campaign trail, Macron has promised to use his popularity to his advantage. But he has yet to win a majority in parliament, which is due to be voted on by his own party's parliamentary majority next year. At the same time, he is also seeking to strengthen his grip on power in his home state of Normandy, where he currently lives with his wife and two children. His campaign has also been criticized by critics who accuse him of being too soft on migrants and of not being open enough to refugees and asylum seekers. According to one report from the Parisian newspaper Le Monde, his party is \"in danger of losing its majority\" if he fails to secure the support of French voters. Another report, published on the weekend, suggested that Macron could be forced to step down from his post in order to avoid a second term as prime minister. A third report said that the president would not be able to form a coalition government until he had secured the votes for his presidential bid. And a fourth report on Macron's chances of becoming president was also published in French daily Le Parisien, citing a survey published earlier this week in which French students said they were more likely to vote for him than for Macron."

Reported criminal offenses on the whole dropped by 1.4 percent over 2005 -- to a total of just over 6.3 million. \"The statistics show reductions in crime among children, adolescents and teenagers, as well as adults,\" said Sch\u00e4uble. He added that criminality among foreigners living in Germany also fell, saying that this development reflected Germany's efforts to integrate non-Germans. Drugs offenses were down 7.8 percent, followed by theft and street crime, which both declined by four percent or more. Youth violence Vandalism, on the other hand, was up 5.9 percent. Fraud rose slightly, as did violent crime -- among young people by an alarming 4.5 percent. Berlin Interior Minister Erhart K\u00f6rting said that was part of a decade-long trend in Germany. \"As many experts have pointed out,\" K\u00f6rting said, \"the potential for violence in society is increasing.\" The head of the German Police Officers' Union Konrad Freiberg also said those figures showed that German society was not truly getting safer. Frankfurt tops most-dangerous list Crime was down in Frankfurt am Main, but it's still the German city with the greatest number of criminal offenses person 100,000 people. Hanover was a close second, followed by D\u00fcsseldorf, Bremen and Berlin. The total percentage of criminal cases solved by German police also improved slightly from 55 to 55.4 percent. According to the study, Germany's safest place was Bergisch Gladbach, a city of 100,000 inhabitants in the west of the country -- coincidentally, model Heidi Klum's home town.",
        "generated_story": "Germany: The State of Crime in Germany The state of crime in the country has become a topic of debate in recent years. In 2006, the German Police Officers' Union (D\u00fcsseldorf, Frankfurt am Main, Bremen) and the Berlin police union (K\u00f6rting) were among the most outspoken critics of Germany's anti-corruption drive. The police unions, which represent police officers and prosecutors, have been calling for the end of the state-of-the-union (SOPU) drive, arguing that it is only a matter of time before the government of Chancellor Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble is forced to step down. On Tuesday, German police chief Konrad Freiberg called for a \"state of law\" to be imposed on the police, saying it was \"unacceptable and unacceptable\" for police forces to take part in such activities. \"It is unacceptable,\" he told a news conference in Berlin, adding that he would not allow police to carry out such acts of violence against the public. He also said that police should not be allowed to use excessive force against civilians, and that they should be prevented from carrying out attacks on civilians. Police union leader Erhart K\u00f6tting said on Tuesday that the SPD's stance on crime is \"incompatible with the principles of democracy and human rights.\" The SPD is also pushing for an end to the use of force by police and other security forces, including the deployment of armored personnel carriers, armored vehicles and police cruisers, as well as the creation of a special police force to fight crime and to protect the interests of citizens. SPD leader Gerhard Schr\u00f6der said in a statement that his party was committed to ending the \"war on drugs\" and \"to end the war on terrorism.\" \"We are not going to give up the fight against terrorism,\" said the party leader, who has been in office since 2005 and who is a member of parliament since 2006. But he added that \"it is not enough for us to stand up for what we believe in,\" and said he was willing to do what he believes is right. K\u00fctter, a former police officer from the city of Hanover, told the news agency dpa that Germany was not ready for this kind of action, but that there was a need for it to happen, he said."

        "target": "All or nothing for Bayern in Champions final Bayern Munich have one last chance to salvage a season that has otherwise been marked by their inability to beat Borussia Dortmund: a win against Chelsea in the Champions League final at their home stadium. All season long, Bayern Munich have been consumed with achieving one goal: reaching the final of the Champions League, held at their own Allianz Arena in Munich, and raising the trophy in front of their home fans. After finishing a distant second place to Dortmund in the Bundesliga and dismally losing to them 5-2 in the German Cup final, Bayern Munich are in a must-win situation Saturday against Chelsea. A loss would be the final straw in a disappointing season for a team that can't stand second place. A win for Bayern would mean redemption, to some extent, for their shortcomings in the league. Key players were rested down the stretch in the Bundesliga, especially before the two legs of Bayern's European semifinal against Real Madrid. That was an indication that Bayern had given up on the league and put all their eggs in one basket, hoping for a big payoff with the Champions League title. The same can be said for the German Cup final against Dortmund: true, Bayern essentially beat themselves by making mistake after mistake, but Bayern could, if they win Saturday, wipe the slate clean. Saving the season Win this match, and all will be forgiven in Munich. Lose, and it will be Bayern's second straight season without a piece of hardware, not to mention the heartbreak of losing the biggest match at Allianz Arena since it opened in 2005. \"We must not even think about [losing],\" said Bayern's Franck Ribery on Thursday. \"If we win the Champions League, then we can forget about not winning the league or the cup, nobody will care about that.\" Bayern are a team that thrives under pressure, and the high stakes of this match will be good for them. Chelsea are a team that showed in their semifinal upset of Barcelona that they can rise to a challenge, even if that challenge is simply holding on against a superior opponent. \"We are not the favorites of the game, we are playing away,\" Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech said on Thursday. \"It is very rare when you have the home team playing in the home stadium, using the home dressing room, so I think the advantage goes to Bayern Munich because of that. But we know we have a chance and we will fight for it.\" But this match will come down to the team that can better take advantage of holes that have been blown in each team's defense due to injuries and suspensions. Filling the gaps Between the two sides, seven starting players will miss out on the final. Chelsea saw Raul Meireles, Ramires, and Branislav Ivanovic each get their third yellow card in the second leg against Barcelona, and captain John Terry was given a straight red. Terry and Ivanovic are fixtures on Chelsea's backline, which was already at half-strength due to hamstring injuries suffered by Gary Cahill and David Luiz. Chelsea coach Roberto di Matteo hopes those two are fit enough for the final, since Chelsea will need all the help they can get in the back. For Bayern, David Alaba and Holger Badstuber - both defenders - and Luiz Gustavo, a defensive midfielder, are also suspended for picking up three yellow cards. The impact of the suspensions will hit Chelsea the most. In addition to a weakened back line, Meireles and Ramires are mainstays on offense, supporting strikers Didier Drogba or Fernando Torres. With Ramires out, Drogba could start as striker, with Torres moving to the wing. At any rate, there is more uncertainty in The Blues' lineup than there is in Bayern's, who will be able to rely on striker Mario Gomez and the dynamic-duo of Arjen Robben and Ribery on the wings as they have all season. Most of the question marks will still be defensive for both teams, but to think that this is an indication of a high-scoring affair on Saturday would be a discredit to both team's last lines of defense. Between the posts Neither side would be competing in the final if it wasn't for the heroics of the teams' keepers. Cech defended against wave after wave of attacks from Barcelona in the semifinal for Chelsea, and Manuel Neuer showed nerves of steel in Bayern's penalty shootout in the final leg against Real Madrid, blocking penalties from Madrid stars Cristiano Ronaldo and Kaka. Chelsea's best shot will be to come out of the gate at a sprint and gain an early advantage against Bayern, who will be doing everything they can to keep their long-cultivated dream-final in their control. Otherwise, Bayern's determination to salvage their season may be enough to carry them through to the trophy ceremony - at home, just like they planned it.

        "generated_story": "Borussia Dortmund vs. Bayern Munich in Champions League final The Blues are in the last 16 of the German Cup final. They have a chance to make it to the quarter-finals, where they will face Real Madrid on Saturday. The German side, who have won the Bundesliga title for the first time since 2005, have been eliminated from the competition by Barcelona on Thursday night. Coach Roberto di Matteo's side have already qualified for next year's competition, but they have to wait until the end of next season to qualify. That's a tough task for them to do, as they are only two points clear of Barcelona. But they can't afford to give up on their dream of reaching the final, which they hope will be their last chance. \"We are not going to let this happen to us,\" said Raul Meireles, a former Bayern defender who has been linked with a move to Manchester United for a number of years. In the past, the Blues have had to rely on the likes of David Luiz and Franck Ribery to get them through the group stage. Last year, they were knocked out by Manchester City in a penalty shootout, and in 2005 they lost to Barcelona 2-1. This time around, it's all about the players, not the coach. It's not just the strikers, though. There's also the midfielders. And there's the goalkeeping, too. At the same time, there is the fact that there are a lot of young players who want to play at the top level. You can see that in this match, you can also see the way that the boys are playing. On the other hand, that doesn't mean that they don't have the ability to score goals, because they're not scoring goals. What they need is a striker who can score in front of goal and that's what we're looking for. We need to be able to use that as a platform to show that we are capable of doing that. I think we can do that if we have good players and a good coach who is willing to help us win the game. So we'll see how it goes.\" That would be a great way to end the season. After all, this is not a team that can win a league title, let alone a European Cup, or even a domestic cup, for that matter. If you're a player who wants to win one, then you've got to look at your own team and make sure that your team is good enough to beat the best teams in your country. For the rest of us, we just need a few more games to prepare for this season's Bundesliga final and then we will see what happens when we get back to Germany. As a result, I'm looking forward to seeing what the future holds for our club and the club that I've been playing for for so many years.\" \"I'm very happy with my team,\" added Russav Ivanovic, captain of Bayern, \"but I have no idea what's in store for us in terms of how long it will take us to reach the next level,\" he said, adding that he was \"very happy\" with his side's performance against Barcelona last week."

A high-ranking Vatican diplomat will face trial in the Holy See on charges of possessing child pornography in the US and Canada. Catholic priest Carlo Alberto Capella was indicted on Saturday after a Vatican investigation found he had allegedly possessed and exchanged \"a large quantity\" of child pornography during his diplomatic posting. His trial will start on June 22 in front of a Vatican magistrate. If convicted, he could be sentenced to between one and five years in prison and fined between \u20ac2,500 and \u20ac50,000 ($2,100 to $42,000). He is being held in the city's police barracks.

Shortly afterwards, Canadian authorities issued an arrest warrant for allegedly possessing and distributing child pornography while visiting a church in Canada. The Capella case has hampered the Catholic Church's attempts to move on from its myriad of pedophile priest scandals. There has been particular focus in recent months on the Chilean branch of the Catholic Church ignoring and covering up of child abuse by pedophile priest Fernando Karadima during the 1980s and 1990s. Pope Francis wrote a letter to Chileans last week expressing \"shame\" for the affair despite previously defending one of the main alleged offenders behind the cover-up. The Vatican's third-highest ranking official, Cardinal George Pell, is facing trial in Australia on abuse-related charges. aw/kms (AFP, Reuters, dpa)",
        "generated_story": "Catholic priest faces Vatican probe for distributing child pornography Catholic priest Carlo Alberto Capella has been charged with sexually abusing children. The charges stem from allegations that he sexually abused children in the 1980s and 1990s. In a letter to Pope Francis on Saturday, the Vatican said the priest had confessed to having sex with children under the age of 13. Capell, who is accused of having sexually transmitted diseases, was charged in September with sexual abuse of children by a pedophile priest in Chile. He denied the allegations and said he had no knowledge of the accusations. \"I was not aware of any such allegations until I received the letter,\" he said in an interview with AFP, Reuters, dpa and the Australian news agency aw/kms."

        "target": "Russia to create corporate aid fund, tapping pensions Moscow is planning to set up an emergency fund to help companies hit by sanctions imposed on Russian firms over the country's role in the Ukraine crisis. The money is to come from the Russian pensions system. Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov unveiled a plan Monday aimed at creating a \"multi-billion-dollar\" funding vehicle for companies hit by Western sanctions. Moscow-based news agency RIA quoted Siluanov as saying that the emergency fund would be set up next year with money originally earmarked for the State Pension Fund and leftover funds from this year's budget. According to RIA, Moscow was planning to devote \"at least 100 billion roubles\" (2 billion euros) to the fund, which will mainly be aimed at helping cash-starved Russian banks and key oil companies. \"These 100 billion roubles will be added to the reserve next year, which will allow us to help companies,\" RIA quoted Siluanov as saying. \"We are planning to create a reserve of significant size.\" Just last week, the European Union and the United States imposed a third round of sanctions on Moscow for Russia's involvement in the Ukraine conflict. The latest sanctions target the Russian banking sector as well as key energy firms and arms manufacturers. As one of several companies that have asked for government help, Russia's oil giant Rosneft said it would need 1.5 trillion roubles ($39.70 billion) in aid to keep exploring for oil. Siluanov also told RIA news agency that the decision to stop transferring money to the Pension Fund would hand the budget an extra 309 billion roubles. It will be the second year running that Moscow has stopped transfers of funds from the budget to the Pension Fund, which provides benefits for Russia's pensioners, some invalids and families who have lost their breadwinners. uhe/nz (Reuters, RIA)",

The move comes after the European Union and the United States announced on Monday that they would set aside 1.5 trillion roubles ($39.70 billion) for the purpose of boosting the country's sovereign wealth fund. Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said the move was part of a broader plan to boost Russia's state pension funds, which have been hit with sanctions imposed on Moscow over its handling of Ukraine's conflict with the West. \"We are going to establish a fund that will be able to invest in companies that have suffered from sanctions,\" he told a news conference in Moscow. RIA news agency quoted him as saying that the fund would be run by Russian state-owned oil giant Rosneft (ROSN) and would have a total of 2 billion euros (2 billion pounds). The announcement came after a meeting of the heads of state of Russia, the State Pension Fund (SPSF), the state oil company, and its subsidiaries in the eastern Ukraine region of Donetsk and Luhansk. Both companies have said they are willing to contribute to the new fund, although they have not said how much they will contribute. Uhe/nz (Reuters, rIA)"

        "target": "Heidi hits the Big Screen Heidi, the world famous girl from the Swiss Alps who first appeared in a novel 121 years ago, has hit the big screen in a fresh look. A century after the death of Heidi inventor Johanna Spyri, the lovable Alpine heroine is being portrayed in a new film which replaces grassy slopes and mountainous range with city skyscrapers and city streets. The $ 3.5 million \"Heidi\", funded by the Z\u00fcrich-based film company Vega and directed by German film maker Markus Imboden, is to be launched in Germany on Thursday. The making of the film was one of the highlights of a past year of events including exhibitions, lectures and fireworks celebrating the July 7 2001 centenary of the death of Spyri, whose novel \"Heidi\" sold 20 million copies and has been translated in 50 languages worldwide. It is thought to be one of the most successful books of all times. The book has inspired 17 films, including Shirley Temple\u2019s Oscar winning portrayal of Heidi in 1937 and a Japanese cartoon series. Imboden\u2019s remake is the 18th \"Heidi\" film. Blue hair in Berlin According to Vega, \"the film was transmitted to today\u2019s world without losing sight of the original novel\". But Imboden\u2019s new movie is far from the charming original, with its rosy-cheeked, curly-headed Heidi, delicate Clara and goat-tending shepherd Peter\u2019s frail old grandmother. In the first film, Heidi, who lives happily with her grandfather in a tiny hut in the Swiss Alps is plucked from her contented life by her Aunt Dete to live in a stiff, rich family in the bustling metropolis, Frankfurt. Heidi becomes so home-sick, she starts to sleepwalk and is eventually sent home. But not before she causes confusion in the otherwise prim household and brings laughter in the life of the disabled and homely, Clara. The Heidi in the latest film has blue hair, surfs the net and roams the streets of Berlin. Friend and shepherd Peter sheds his rustic pastimes and whizzes down streets on his mountainbike. Clara is not the weak, lame young girl of the Spyri novel, but a moody Britney Spears wannabe. Aunt Dete is a modern-day stylist living fashionably in the German capital. The new surroundings are a far cry from the tranquil days of cow milking, goat- tending and flower-plucking in the verdant meadows of the Swiss Alps. Transforming the Heidi myth According to a Berlin daily, the remake is a \"refreshing Heidi\", adding that the script writers had managed to transform the Heidi \"myth\" into an independent, self-assured girl and not into a \"transfigured mountain heroine\". However, it is just this portrait of a naive and charming alpine heroine that has made Heidi so popular all over the world. Heidi has become a well-known Swiss brand worldwide. Some 60,000 tourists \u2013 half from Japan \u2013 are said to visit the picturesque wine-growing village in Graubuenden, which boasts the original Heidi House and other Heidi related attractions such as winding mountain trails and pastures. Imboden\u2019s film, which is to be launched in Germany on Thursday, will also open elsewhere in Europe, and may reach fans in Japan and South Korea too. Whether Imboden\u2019s blue-haired, computer savvy Heidi will charm her Asian viewers, however, remains to be seen.",
        "generated_story": "The Remake of Heidi in the Swiss Alps Film maker Markus Imboden has directed a film about Heidi. The film is set in Switzerland's Alpine region. Heidi is a German-born Swiss woman who was born in 1937 and grew up in Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland. She is the daughter of a Swiss man who died in a plane crash on July 7 2001. In the film, Heidi and her mother, Johanna Spyri, live in Germany's Graubuenden Alpine village. Her father, Peter, was killed in an accident on the way back from a ski trip to Switzerland, where he had been staying with his mother for the past three years. He was buried in his grandmother's grave, which is now a UNESCO World Heritage site. His mother was also buried there, as was his father and stepmother, who had died of cancer the year before Heidi's birth. After Heidi died, her family moved to Germany, and she became a member of the family of an elderly German shepherd. They moved back to their Swiss village in 2005, when she was still living with her father. Now, she is back in her native Germany. \"I'm still in shock,\" she says, \"but I don't know if I'm going to be able to live with this anymore.\" The movie is based on a novel by the German author Shirley Temple, in which the author, author and illustrator Heidi House, has written a book about her life and works. It's a story about a man and his family who have been living together for more than 40 years, with the aim of creating a better life for themselves and for their children. On the other hand, the book is about an inventor who invented the idea of making a house for his son Peter and gave it to his wife, Joanna. Both of them are now working on their own film. Their first film was \"Shirley Temple,\" which was released in 2001 and was directed by Markus, director and screenwriter of \"The Little Mermaid.\" It was the first time that Heidi has been seen in real life, but it wasn't until the last few years that she had a chance to make it into a movie. When she finally made the decision to go to the cinema, it was because she wanted to spend more time with Peter. But she didn't have the money to do it, so she decided to take a break from her work and write a new novel about the man she loved. That's when the movie came to life. At the end of last year's Cannes Film Festival, a documentary on Heidi was shown on stage in Berlin, Germany and Switzerland with a cast of five actors and a director who were also in attendance. One of those actors was Swedish-German actress Johann Spyr, whose film \"Sheidi\" was adapted from the novel's German translation into English as \"Him Heidi.\" She was given the opportunity to play a role as a shepherd for a short time after her husband Peter's death in July 2001, although she did not take part in any of her scenes. According to a report in The New York Times on Thursday, there was a lot of interest in Heidi, particularly from German film company Vega."

        "target": "Rethinking the term 'honor killing' The murder of 28-year-old Samia Shahid comes less than two weeks after Qandeel Baloch was killed by her brother. The media was quick to report them as \"honor killings.\" We have to rethink that term, writes Gouri Sharma. When news broke that Samia Shahid, a British-Pakistani woman, had been found dead while visiting relatives in Pakistan at the end of July, mainstream media outlets were quick to report it as an honor killing. It was the second time in two weeks that the media had reported a killing of a woman this way - the first being the murder of Pakistani social media star Qandeel Baloch. There are strong similarities between the cases. Both were murdered in places where they would have felt they were at their safest - in their family homes. It's likely they knew their killers - in Baloch's case, her brother has admitted to strangling her, and Shahid's father and cousin have already been questioned. And as more reports emerge about Shahid's death, it's clear that both were killed because they didn't behave in a way deemed acceptable in a conservative, patriarchal society. 'Deeply offensive' term The debate around terminology in \"honor killings\" isn't new, and after Baloch's murder there were members of the media - such as ABC Australia journalist Juanita Phillips - who decided against using the term, calling it \"deeply offensive\" and referring to it as a \"family killing\" instead. And there are outlets, like the Guardian, that already use inverted commas with the word honor. But some commentators argue that more needs to happen if media consumers are to gain a better understanding of the problem. \"I think an important step for the media would be to refuse to give weight to the term 'honor crimes,'\" said UK-based freelance journalist Shehnaz Khan. \"While it is imperative to highlight that these crimes and murders stem from the roots of misogyny and therefore a false sense of 'honor,' there is absolutely nothing but'shame' within them, as murder is nothing but dishonorable.\" \"The word 'honor' can sometimes carry an almost positive connotation that we are inclined to automatically accept just because it's not happening to us, when the reality is, this a huge problem affecting thousands of girls and women across the world,\" she added. Naming the issue But this isn't a view shared by all journalists. Ruby Hamad, a writer at Australia's Daily Life newspaper, said that the first step in dealing with the issue is naming it. \"There are some deeply patriarchal societies that still limit women's freedom according to old tribal concepts of honor, where, unfairly, the behavior of women reflect on their entire family,\" Hamad said. \"By naming these 'honor killings,' we are acknowledging the role that this misogynistic concept of honor plays, not only in the murders themselves but in these entire societies, and how it entraps both men and women.\" Through the eyes of the perpetrator? There are other issues with the term though. Some have argued that by framing it as such, media outlets are showing the crime through the eyes of the perpetrator - and not through the victim - as they should. And with such cases regularly hitting the headlines, framing is important. The United Nations estimates that around 5,000 women - predominantly from Asia and the Middle East - are killed annually in honor-related crimes, a figure that women's advocacy groups say is closer to 20,000 worldwide. This raises an important cultural element for the media to consider - how far does the term play into cultural stereotypes? \"When honor is considered the most important thing in life, then all family members become expendable,\" Hamad said. \"The collective outweighs the rights of the individual. Does this feed into cultural stereotypes? Perhaps. But that doesn't mean we should pretend that this cultural context isn't there.\" Looking for answers - and alternatives There have been many alternatives put forward by women's advocacy groups, including hate crime, misogynistic murder, femicide and shame killings. But which one should we pick? Al Jazeera for one has decided which one they won't use. \"We are always updating our style guidelines to convey a deeper and more authentic understanding of world affairs. Recent events in Pakistan ignited a healthy debate in Al Jazeera on the term 'honor killings' in particular. Our editors are currently studying alternatives to the term, but'misogynistic murder' is not one of them,\" said an Al Jazeera spokesperson. Terminology in the media matters, and for murders as complex as these, it's the media's responsibility to find a name that better fits the crime. Only then will it become easier to work towards a solution.",

        "target": "Myanmar Junta Announces Amnesty The junta in Myanmar, also known as Burma, announced an amnesty for more than 7,000 prisoners on Friday, including a few political detainees. The amnesty came on the 21st anniversary of the brutal crackdown of a student-led pro-democracy movement in 1988 and the subsequent seizure of power by the current junta. Journalists were invited to Yangon\u2019s notorious Insein prison on Friday as the authorities released the first batch of prisoners. At least 600 inmates were freed as part of an amnesty for over 7,000 inmates nationwide. Among those released in Yangon were two journalists and 25 political prisoners -- rights groups say this is only 1 percent of the total number of political prisoners held by the military regime. Maung Zarni, a research fellow at the London School of Economics, was \u201chappy for the prisoners who were part of the release\u201d. \u201cThis is a very positive personal development and I am happy they have been released but we need to understand that the junta is using the prisoners\u2019 release as a public relations exercise. It is the 21st anniversary of the military coup so they are using this as a way to pacify political discontent in the country.\u201d Amnesty comes ahead of next year\u2019s polls Myanmar's director general of prisons, Zaw Win, said that the prisoners had been freed so they could take part in next year's polls. In recent months, rights activists, pro-democracy activists and Western countries have cast doubt on the credibility of the planned elections as many key political activists are still in detention. This includes pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who recently began a new 18-month period of house arrest after being found guilty of violating her house arrest order in a widely condemned trial. \u201cThe whole Suu kyi trial is rather unlawful,\u201d said Zarni. \u201cBecause the country does not have an independent judiciary, the judges are just puppets who dance to the tune of the top leadership.\u201d Junta is holding on tightly In 1990, Suu Kyi\u2019s National League for Democracy won Myanmar\u2019s last general election by a landslide. But the junta never recognised the results and has since tightened its control over the country. The 2008 constitution, which was drafted and approved by the military generals, which guarantees the army 25 percent of parliamentary seats, is yet another sign of its desire to consolidate power. \u201cThe military is going to be in power for a long time,\u201d warns Zarni, \u201cbecause they have got control of all the political and economic institutions in the country as well as the entire state of Burma. So with or without elections, this is likely to remain the same.\u201d New Democratic Party formed Meanwhile, a new political party has been formed in Myanmar. The Democratic Party is headed by Mya Than Than Nu, who is the daughter of the country\u2019s first democratically-elected prime minister, U Nu. The party has proposed a power-sharing deal with the military, which would give 40 percent of power to politicians and 60 percent to the military rulers. Harn Yawnghwe, the director of the Brussels-based Euro-Burma Office, doubts the new party stands a chance: \u201cIt is possible that they they would be able to get some votes. But it is not likely, even if they were able to contest the elections freely, that they will be able to form a new government because the military is not prepared to let any party rule.\u201d Democrats should exploit elections He thinks the only way out for the democratic forces in Myanmar is to use the upcoming elections wisely and \u201cto take part in them even if they are against them. I think we have to look at the elections as a process which will lead to democracy -- maybe in few more years.\u201d The National League for Democracy has indicated that it will not take part in the polls unless all Myanmar\u2019s political prisoners, including Suu Kyi, are released. Suu Kyi\u2019s lawyers have filed an appeal against the extension of her house arrest and the court is expected to give a ruling on October 2. But few are hopeful that the junta will amnesty her anytime soon. Author: Disha Uppal Editor: Anne Thomas",

        "target": "A quarter of deaths caused by environmental degradation, says UN A new United Nations report warns that pollution and global warming are causing millions more deaths than conflicts. The UN's environment agency has called for an urgent roll-back on harmful substances and fossil fuels. In its report \"Healthy Environment, Health People,\" the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), the World Health Organization and several other environment organizations said that, in 2012, an estimated 12.6 million deaths were attributable to deteriorating environment conditions. The largest numbers of deaths took place in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific regions, followed by sub-Saharan Africa, where around a quarter of deaths were likely caused byair pollution, chemicals, climate change and a lack of access to sanitation. \"By depleting the ecological infrastructure of our planet and increasing our pollution footprint, we incur an ever-growing cost in terms of human health and well-being,\" said UNEP Executive Director Achim Steiner. He added that humanity's life support systems had been compromised by globalization and powerful economic interests. The report was released during UN climate talks in the German city of Bonn which are drawing up rules pertaining to the Paris agreement, which seeks to lower carbon emissions. The document suggested that several drivers were responsible for the threat to human health, including ecosystem disruption, climate change, inequality, unhealthy and wasteful lifestyles, along with unsustainable consumption and production. Worsening effects UNEP estimated that an extra 250,000 deaths could occur each year between 2030 and 2050 as a result of climate change, leading to malnutrition, malaria, diarrhea and heat stress. Between them air pollution and a lack of access to clean water and sanitation cause almost 8 million premature deaths each year. Environmental impacts are responsible for the deaths of more than one quarter of all children under the age of five, the report states. UNEP called for governments to act to remove harmful substances from working environments, reduce the use of carbon fuels and rely instead on renewable energy, and change lifestyles to allow a more sustainable use of the world's resources. The report also called for a bigger investment to protect the planet's natural ecosystem. UNEP predicted a further increase in emerging zoonotic diseases (spread between animals and humans), and called on developing countries, in particular, to prioritize prevention methods. \"Never before have so many animals been kept by so many people - and never before have so many opportunities existed for pathogens to pass through the biophysical environment and wild animals to livestock and people,\" the report warned.",
        "generated_story": "A quarter of deaths due to climate change are linked to environmental degradation, says UNEP The United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) has released a report on the number of people dying from climate-related diseases in the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Thursday that more than 1.5 million people died from the effects of extreme weather conditions, including heat waves, floods and landslides, as a result of high levels of greenhouse gas emissions. According to the report, this number could rise to 2.6 million by 2050. \"The number is likely to rise as more people are exposed to extreme climate conditions,\" said Achim Steiner, Executive Director of the UN environment program in Bonn, Germany. He added that the increase in deaths could be attributed to a combination of factors, such as rising temperatures, rising sea levels and a lack of awareness about the dangers of environmental pollution, which can lead to severe health consequences."

        "target": "No more'veggie sausages?' Minister wants ban on meat names for plant-based foods Terms like \"vegan sausage\" and \"vegetarian schnitzel\" confuse consumers and need to be replaced, according to German Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt. He wants new names for plant-based dishes. Germans shouldn't be biting into a \"vegan sausage\" or cutting a slice of \"vegetarian schnitzel,\" German Minister for Food and Agriculture Christian Schmidt told the daily \"Bild\" newspaper on Wednesday, adding that names traditionally used for meat-based dishes should not be applied to plant-based foods. \"I don't want anyone to pretend that these pseudo-meat dishes are actual meat dishes,\" Schmidt said. The minister said manufacturers should come up with distinct names for plant-based meat-substitutes. Schmidt also said meat was part of a healthy and balanced diet and belonged on the menu in schools and kindergartens. Soy? Steak? Soy-steak? Schmidt's statements echo demands from the German Farmers Association and German Butchers Association. Both lobbying groups have asked for a ban on terms such as \"vegetarian ham\" or \"soy steak.\" Schmidt's call for plant-based foods to have their own name was also made in October in the state of Lower Saxony, a state with many large livestock farms. The German Vegetarian Association, however, argued against the proposal. A spokesperson for the organization said that \"names that are used for animal-based products should without a doubt also be legal to use for vegetarian substitute products.\" More meatless 'whatever-you-want-to-call-thems' The market for vegetarian and vegan dishes has grown steadily in the past few years in Germany, partly at the expense of the meat industry. According to a research paper by the Institute for the Study of Trade (IfH), revenue for vegetarian and vegan products in Germany was 454 million euros ($474 million) in 2015 and grew by more than 100 percent between 2010 and 2015. In the same time period, the demand for meat products fell by almost 10 percent. mb/sms (dpa, epd)",

The minister said that the meat product would be sold at a discount of 454 million euros ($474 million) to farmers in the state of Lower Saxony, which is home to the country\u2019s largest meat exporter. Schmidt, a member of the government's Agriculture and Food and Agriculture Committee (DAF) since taking office in October, said the move was aimed at reducing the number of meat sales in Germany. He added that \"we will not be selling meat at this time.\" The DAF is a trade association that represents German farmers. It has a membership of more than 400,000 members, and its members have the right to buy meat from other countries, including Germany, Austria, Switzerland, the Netherlands, France and the United States. In a statement released Wednesday, German Farmers Association (DFA) said it would continue to support the agriculture ministry's efforts to reduce meat prices by up to 5 percent by the end of 2015. mb/sms (dpa, epd)"

Stephen Harper has stepped down as leader of the Conservatives after nine years in the top job. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper resigned as Conservative Party leader on Tuesday after the Liberals, led by Justin Trudeau, emerged victorious in legislative elections. \"I have spoken to Prime Minister Stephen Harper, and he has instructed me to reach out to the newly elected parliamentary caucus to appoint an interim leader,\" Conservative Party president John Walsh said in a statement. \"The people are never wrong,\" Harper said of his defeat. \"The disappointment is my responsibility and mine alone,\" Harper said, adding that he had called Trudeau to congratulate him. Trudeau calls for hopeful, diverse future In electing Trudeau, the charismatic son of a former popular prime minister, Canadian voters illustrated the growing discontent with nine years of Conservative rule that saw lowering of corporate taxes, avoidance of climate change legislation and disagreement with the Obama administration over the controversial Keystone XL pipeline. \"Canadians have spoken,\" Trudeau said, adding that he would be the man to lead the \"hopeful, positive\" country \"with a vision\" that they had asked for. In his victory speech, Trudeau said his government \"believed deeply in the diversity of our country,\" striking a contrast with the strain of nativism that had become apparent under Conservative rule. \"We beat fear with hope,\" said Trudeau, a 43-year-old former teacher. Liberals blow past projected results Projections ahead of the elections had Harper and Trudeau in a dead heat, but as polls closed on Monday night it became clear that the Liberals had won an outright majority, with a projected 175 of parliament's 338 seats. This represented a huge leap from four years ago when Liberals were handed their most crushing defeat in history with a mere 34 seats. Harper will stay on as a member of Parliament for his constituency, public broadcaster CBC reported, as he was re-elected to his seat. The left-leaning New Democratic Party had hoped to capitalize on its second-place finish in 2011, but only managed to come in third with CBC estimating that the party had garnered 32 seats. es/cmk (AP, Reuters) Have something to say?

        "generated_story": "Stephen Harper steps down as leader of Canada's Liberal Party Stephen Harper has announced his resignation from the leadership of the country's main opposition party, the New Democratic Party (NDP). Harper, who was prime minister from 2011 to 2011, will step down on Tuesday. Harper's resignation comes a day after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced he was stepping down from his position as the party's leader in the House of Commons. The announcement came hours after Harper announced that he would no longer run for re-election next year. \"I have decided to step aside,\" Harper said in a statement released by his office on Monday. He said he had no plans to run again until the end of his term, which began in 2011. His resignation came after months of speculation about whether he might run as a candidate for a second term in office. In the weeks leading up to Tuesday's election, Harper was widely seen as one of Obama's closest political allies in Canada. On Monday, he resigned as party leader and was replaced by John Walsh, a former federal prosecutor who served as chief of staff to then-prime minister Harper. At the same time, Walsh said the new leader would not be able to take over the reins of government until after the next election in 2012, when the Liberals would have to form a coalition government with the opposition New Democrats and the Greens. Walsh also said that Harper would be unable to continue to lead his party as long as his successor, outgoing Liberal leader Paul Martin, was in charge of running the federal government. Both Harper and Trudeau have been at loggerheads in recent months over a controversial plan to build a new Keystone XL pipeline through the Canadian province of Alberta. Last year, Canada voted to approve the controversial pipeline, dubbed the \"Keystone XL.\" The pipeline is part of a $1.5 billion ($2.6 billion) pipeline that will be built by Canadian energy giant TransCanada Corp. (TEC) has said it will not allow the pipeline to cross the border into the U.S. It is not clear how long the project will take to complete, but it is expected to be completed by the middle of 2011 or early 2012.

The minister added that the cease-fire could be extended depending on the response from Yemen's Shiite Houthi rebels. Al-Jubeir said he hoped the Iran-backed rebels would \"come to their senses\" and agree to the truce. He urged them to stop fighting. \"We hope the Houthis will come to their senses and realize the interests of Yemen and the Yemeni people should be the top priority for everyone,\" he said. It is unclear whether the Houthis would reciprocate the Saudi gesture. \"The cease-fire will end should Houthis or their allies not live up to the agreement - this is a chance for the Houthis to show that they care about their people and they care about the Yemen people,\" the Saudi foreign minister emphasized. At this point, US Secretary of State John Kerry said anyone who cared about Yemeni people \"should take clear notice of the fact that a human catastrophe is building,\" adding that a cease-fire was \"not peace\" and that all parties must find a political solution to end the conflict. Kerry urged all sides to hold talks immediately. Saudi ultimatum Hours before the cease-fire announcement, Saudi Arabia declared a Houthi stronghold along its southern border a \"military target,\" giving an ultimatum to the residents to leave the area, Saudi state-run TV reported. Lately, the northern Yemeni province of Saada has become a battleground for the Shiite rebels and the Saud-led coalition forces as the Houthis carried out border attacks on nearby Saudi cities. More than 50 airstrikes hit Saada overnight and in the early hours of Friday morning, Yemeni officials said. A Saudi-led coalition of Arab states launched an air campaign against the Houthis on March 26. Riyadh accuses Tehran of backing the rebels, who have made significant territorial gains in the impoverished Middle Eastern country, capturing the capital Sanaa and ousting internationally recognized President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, who fled Yemen back in March. The Sunni Gulf states are wary of Iran's increasing influence in the region, and they see the Houthis' advance in Yemen as a move that threatens their regional and geopolitical interests. Over 1,200 people have been killed in Yemen since the start of the Saudi campaign, according to the United Nations. shs/bw (AFP, dpa, Reuters, AP)",

The Saudi-led coalition in the war-ravaged country, which has been embroiled in a bloody civil war since March 26, announced on Friday that it had agreed to extend a ceasefire until the end of the month. \"We have reached an agreement on the cessation of hostilities,\" Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir told a news conference in Sanaa, capital of Yemen, after talks with Houthi rebels brokered by the US Secretary of State John Kerry. Riyadh has said that the truce was meant to allow for the resumption of fighting between the Shiite rebels and the Iranian-backed government in Saada province, the country's capital, and to provide humanitarian assistance to the Yemeni people. A UN Security Council resolution has also been adopted, calling for an end to a conflict that has killed more than 2,000 people since the beginning of this year. On Tuesday, Riyadh said it would continue to monitor the ceasefire, with the aim of ending the conflict by mid-May. Washington has called on Riyadh to halt the fighting until at least early next year, when it is due to resume its bombing campaign. Saudi officials have also called for a halt to air strikes on Yemen and said they are ready to take action if the rebels return to their strongholds. Iran has denied the allegations. Tehran has accused Riyadh of supporting the regime of Hadi, who is accused of plotting a coup against President Abed Rabbo Mansour. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, however, has rejected the accusations, saying that Tehran was not involved in any such coup attempt. In a statement, Tehran said Riyadh was \"deeply concerned\" about the escalation of violence, adding that \"it is not at all surprising\" that Iran was behind the attacks. It added that Riyadh had also expressed concern over the \"unprecedented\" number of rockets fired at the Saudi capital Riyadh, according to Iranian state news agency dpa."

He said that his victory meant voters had chosed the path of \"European Integration.\" Exit polls gave Petro Poroshenko, a 48-year-old billionaire and owner of a chocolate factory, between 55.9 and 57.3 percent of the vote. This put him well ahead of former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, who was reported to have come in second, at 12.9 percent. Andrij Shevchenko, one of Tymoshenko's political allies, said on Twitter that she had conceded defeat. DW's reporter Kitty Logan in Kyiv said voter turnout was extremely high in the capital. Most polling stations in the east of the country remained closed on Sunday. If the figures are confirmed, there will not be a need for a runoff on June 15. Poroshenko, who has promised closer economic and political ties with the West, has also vowed to mend relations with Russia, but insisted that Ukraine's territorial integrity was of top importance to him. In his first statements following the publication of the early results, Poroshenko announced he would travel to the east of the country quickly. He also announced that parliamentary elections would be held later this year. rg/lw (Reuters, dpa)",

Brazilian judge Juliana Leal de Melo - who serves on a court overseeing amateur and professional sports - authorized the release of Hickey's passport upon payment of 1.5 million real ($435,000) bail. Hickey could now have medical treatment, the Rio state court system said in a statement. Reported to have a heart condition, Hickey was arrested three months ago during the Rio de Janeiro Olympics on ticket scalping charges. He is awaiting trial, though has not been imprisoned. Hickey has denied any wrongdoing. He is one of 10 people facing charges of ticket scalping, conspiracy and ambush marketing related to the Olympics. Hickey said he would fight \"each and every one\u201d of the Rio Games ticket-touting charges he faces. Hickey, who was also the head of the Olympic Council of Ireland, was released from custody last month, but must remain in Brazil until the case is heard. \"For clarity, I am not under house arrest as, like with so many things with this case, has been misreported by the media,\u201d Hickey said in a statement on Monday.

He was freed Monday after a two-day trial on charges of bribery, fraud and money laundering related to his involvement in the Rio Olympics. The trial began on 10 August, with the trial set to run until the end of this month. A Brazilian court on Monday ordered the former Olympic committee member to pay 1.5 million euros ($435,000) to the Brazilian president, Juliana Leal de Melo, for his alleged role in a bribery scheme that led to him being arrested and sentenced to life in prison. In a statement released Monday, the EOC said it had found no evidence of any wrongdoing. \"We have not found any evidence that the defendant was involved in any bribery or fraud,\" the statement said, adding that it was \"unacceptable\" that he had been charged. It was not immediately clear how much money he was seeking, however, whether he would be able to repay the money, which he received from Brazil's president and his wife. Jbh/bw (AP, AFP)"

        "target": "The Shift in Libya's Relations to the West The La Belle disco bombing in Berlin on April 5, 1986 was ruled to be Libya's doing. Twenty years later, relations between Libya and Europe have done an about-face. The Berlin disco \"La Belle\" was packed as usual on the night of April 5, 1986. Among its guests were many US soldiers, who were certainly not thinking of politics, the Middle East or strained relations between the United States and Libya. But reality caught up with them: a bomb detonated near the dance floor that night, killing two Americans and a Turkish woman. Over 200 people were injured. A Berlin court ruled that Libya and its intelligence services were responsible for the bombing. In 2001, following a nearly four-year long trial, the judges convicted a Libyan diplomat and three others to prison sentences between 12 and 14 years. The big oil-exporting country in the meantime was busy working on its reputation. Already in the 1990s, Tripoli began striving to improve its relations to the European Union. Financial reparation opened the door to Europe In 2004, the Gaddafi International Foundation for Charity Associations and the legal representatives of the German La Belle victims settled on $35 million in compensation. This opened the door to Europe. Just a few weeks later, Germany's chancellor at the time, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, visited Moammar Gadhafi in a traditional Bedouin tent outside of Tripoli. Britain's Prime Minister Tony Blair also paid Gadhafi a visit. A few months earlier, in April 2004, the European Union had welcomed the Libyan leader to Brussels. It was Gadhafi's first official visit to Europe in 15 years. Bernd Westphal, the German ambassador to Libya, said bilateral relations had been through difficult times. \"The German Embassy in Tripoli today is working for a quick return to the liveliness of close relations between Germany and Libya,\" Westphal said. \"We want to build on our traditional friendship with Libya and we want to strengthen the political, economic and cultural cooperation between our two countries and peoples.\" Business interests booming in Libya In the past few years, Libya has moved from being the supporter of international terrorism to an attractive economic partner for the West. European business representatives have been increasingly knocking on Libya's door. Even the United States is showing increased interest in the northern African nation. Washington is pleased that Libya announced at the end of 2003 that it would discontinue its efforts to develop and produce weapons of mass destruction. Libya's ambassador to Germany, Said Abdulaati, said political and economic relations between Libya and Germany were \"excellent.\" Libya is one of Germany's strongest trading partners in northern Africa. Last year, Germany exported goods to Libya worth 657.7 million euros ($805.7 million), according to the German Federal Statistics Office. \"The economy is the driving power in German-Libyan relations,\" said Abdulaati in an interview with the Arab-German association for trade and industry. But Germany isn't the only European country making deals in Libya. France last month signed an accord with Libya on peaceful nuclear research. \"This accord represents a qualitative leap in relations between the two countries and proves that Libya has transformed its weapons of mass destruction into constructive weapons,\" Public Works Minister Maatuk Maatuk said at the signing ceremony in March. \"We are telling the world that we are moving towards the development of Libyan nuclear technology for peaceful purposes.\" This week, the Netherlands' Economics Minister Laurens Jan Brinkhorst will visit Libya to negotiate gas and oil agreements. It will be the first high-level visit by a Dutch official since Gadhafi took power in 1969.",
        "generated_story": "The Shift in Libya's Relations to Europe The shift in relations between Libya and the United States has been marked by a sharp rise in tensions between the two countries. In April 2004, the German Federal Statistics Office (BISO) published a report on the country's relations to the EU. The report said that in the first half of the year, a total of 657 million euros ($805.7 million) was spent on public works projects in Tripoli and other areas of Libya. This figure was more than double the figure for the whole of April 2005, when the government of former Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi was overthrown in a coup attempt. At the same time, there was an increase in anti-government protests in eastern Libya, as well as a surge in attacks on police stations and military installations. \"We have a lot of work to do,\" said Bernd Westphal, head of Germany's Public Works Department. He added that \"we will continue to work closely with the Libyan government to make sure that we are able to provide the necessary security for our citizens and to ensure that the security of our own country is maintained.\" The German government, however, did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the report, which was published in an official German news release on Thursday. German Foreign Minister Gerhard Schr\u00f6der said he was \"deeply concerned\" by the reports, adding that it was not yet clear how much money the new government would be willing to spend on civil works. According to German officials, this was due to \"a lack of awareness\" among the public and private sectors about how to deal with a crisis that has gripped the region since the end of Gaddafi's regime in 2011. Germany is not the only country that is concerned about this issue. It is the second largest economy in Africa, after the US and Britain, according to figures from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and it is also the third largest in terms of foreign direct investment (FDI). In addition to this, Germany and France are also part of a growing number of countries that are interested in developing their own economies, such as Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Turkey, Greece, and even the Netherlands. These are the countries which have the most direct influence on Libya: the European Union, for example, is one of them. But it's not just the Europeans who are concerned that Libya is becoming more and more dependent on its oil and gas resources. They are worried that this is going to lead to an escalation in oil prices and that there will be a drop-off in Libyan oil production. That's because Libya will no longer be the source of oil revenues. There will also be an influx of refugees from other African countries, particularly from countries like Tunisia and Egypt, who will have to pay more to cover the costs of reconstruction and reconstruction. As a result, many of these migrants will move to other countries in order to get a better deal out of their current situation. For instance, some of those who have fled Libya to seek refuge in other European countries are now living in Europe, while others are fleeing the Middle East, where they have no choice but to return to their home countries to find a new life in their native land. Some are even seeking asylum in Germany. Others are looking for a way out, but they don't know what the future holds for them, because they're not sure how long they'll stay in this country."

        "target": "Bremen Election Results Could Have National Repercussions It might be Germany's smallest state with a population of less than 700,000, but the make-up of Bremen's new government could curb the ability of Angela Merkel's coalition to continue with planned reforms. The Social Democrats (SPD) and Christian Democrats (CDU) have ruled the small northern city-state of Bremen in a coalition for the past 12 years. But after winning state elections on Sunday with 36.8 percent, the SPD is now flirting with the idea of ditching their previous coalition partners to rule together with the Greens, who made their best-ever showing in a German state poll with 16.4 percent. Bremen's state SPD leadership is to hold talks later on Wednesday with the CDU, which polled 25.7 percent. After an SPD meeting in Bremen, Mayor Jens B\u00f6hrnsen made the first signal he could be favoring the Greens. He said that during the campaign he had deliberately abstained from mentioning the possibility of a renewed CDU coalition because \"after 12 years it shouldn't automatically be continued.\" Bremen's acting head of government and CDU member Thomas R\u00f6wekamp, however, warned against an SPD-Green coalition. \"The majority of people don't want a red-green experiment, but a continuation of the grand coalition,\" he said. Both the SPD and CDU conceded heavy losses in the election, which showed a swing towards the Greens and the Left Party, which scored an unexpected 8.4 percent to win representation in a western German state legislature for the first time in its brief history. Block reforms? If Bremen's SPD decide in favor of the Greens, this would affect the ability of Chancellor Angela Merkel's grand coalition of CDU and SPD to push ahead with reforms requiring constitutional changes, such as stage two of Germany's urgently needed federalism reform. The federal Bundesrat, which is made up of state cabinet members, has to approve the majority of legislative bills passed by the lower chamber, the Bundestag, before they become law. Also, any proposed constitutional changes require two-thirds of all votes in order to be passed by the Bundesrat. The CDU and SPD currently hold 47 of the Bundesrat's 69 seats, which is one seat more than the necessary two-thirds majority. But without Bremen, the number held by the grand coalition would fall to 44 seats, meaning they would need the cooperation of one of the small opposition parties for any constitutional changes. Internal strife Earlier in the week, Chancellor Merkel called for unity within her ruling left-right coalition after the losses in Bremen set the stage for more infighting between the two parties. Merkel also warned the SPD against moving to the left after it lost some five percent points. The chancellor said the outcome showed the SPD had made a mistake by attacking the coalition and campaigning on promises of a minimum wage, which she believes will hamper efforts to fight unemployment of just under 10 percent. \"The result showed that this strategy did not pay off,\" Merkel told a press conference.",
        "generated_story": "Merkel's coalition of Social Democrats and CDU could block German reforms Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives and Greens are set to form a coalition government in the German state of Bremen on Wednesday. The Greens and the Left Party (CDU) are expected to join the coalition, which will form the center-left government of Chancellor Merkel and Chancellor Thomas R\u00f6hrnsen. Merkel has promised to introduce reforms to the country's economic and social policies, but opposition parties have said they will not sign off on the plan. \"We are not going to allow this to happen,\" Merkel said in a speech at the Bundestag in Berlin on Sunday, adding that she was \"very concerned\" about the SPD's plans to block the reforms. She also warned that the Greens would not be able to win the support of the federal government if they failed to pass a bill that would make Germany's labor laws more efficient and more flexible. German media reported on Tuesday that Merkel had called for a \"grand coalition\" of conservative parties to be formed in order to tackle the issue of labor rights in Germany. A spokesman for the chancellor's conservative Christian Democrats said the government was ready to take action if the new laws were passed. Chancellor's party, the Social Democratic Party, has said it would oppose the proposed reforms, saying they would only be approved by the Bundesrat, a federal agency responsible for economic affairs, and would be unable to reach a deal with the opposition. Berlin has also said that it is willing to hold talks with other parties, such as Greens, to discuss the possibility of a government-wide strike on labor-related issues. Germany\u2019s parliament is due to convene on Thursday, with a vote set for early next week. On Wednesday, Merkel is scheduled to meet with her conservative coalition partners, including the conservative Left party and right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD). The SPD, however, have already announced it will hold a special election in September to elect a new mayor and a Social Democrat mayor, as well as a Greens candidate, who has been in opposition since Sunday. In an interview with German news agency dpa, German Finance Minister Jens B\u00f6rnen said his party would hold an emergency meeting on Monday to decide whether or not to approve the changes. He also called on parliamentarians to vote in favor of an anti-immigration bill, while the Green party has called a snap election for September."

        "target": "Top NATO commander says Ukraine ceasefire is 'in name only' NATO's top military commander has called the truce between Ukraine's military and pro-Russia separatists a 'ceasefire in name only.' US General Philip Breedlove said Russian forces were still operating inside Ukraine. Speaking to reporters after a meeting with NATO military chiefs in Lithuania's capital Vilnius on Saturday, US General Philip Breedlove expressed \"sincere hope\" about a renewed peace plan, agreed to earlier in the day in the Belarusian capital Minsk, by separatists and representatives from Ukraine's and Russia's governments. The new pact, including an artillery buffer zone, was a move to strengthen a peace plan signed earlier this month, also in Minsk. However, Breedlove said violence levels in Ukraine in recent days were as high as prior to the earlier ceasefire. \"The ceasefire is still there in name, but what is happening on the ground is quite a different story,\" Breedlove said, adding that Russian forces were still operating in Ukraine, although he could not pinpoint how many. \"The fluidity of movement of Russian forces and Russian-backed forces back and forth across that border makes it almost impossible to understand the numbers,\" he said. A convoy from Russia consisting of about 170 trucks arrived in Ukraine on Saturday, with a reported cargo of humanitarian aid. Previous aid convoys sent from Russia were met with outrage in Kyiv, as it was suspected they may have been used to provide support to the pro-Moscow separatists in eastern Ukraine. Russia has repeatedly denied such accusations. The separatists have said they want to break from Kyiv and have already declared \"people's republics'\" in Donetsk and Luhansk. This week Ukraine's parliament passed a bill which paves the way for more autonomy for those areas. While neither Russia nor Ukraine are members of NATO, both share borders with NATO countries. se/ksb (AP, AFP)",
        "generated_story": "US General Philip Breedlove says ceasefire in Ukraine is 'in name only' The ceasefire has been in effect since the end of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, the US general said on Saturday. \"It is in the name of peace and stability,\" he told a news conference in Minsk, Belarus. He said the ceasefire was in \"name only\" and that it was \"in the interests of Ukraine's security and sovereignty.\" \"We are not going to allow any escalation of violence,\" the general, who is based in Lithuania, told reporters in Vilnius, Lithuania's capital, adding that he was not aware of any ceasefire at the time of his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The truce, which was agreed to by Kyiv and Moscow last week, was meant to end the fighting between pro-Russian separatists and Ukrainian forces in Luhansk and Donetsk, according to a statement released by the Russian General Staff (GSB). \"There is no ceasefire, no cease-fire, and there are no guarantees,\" GSB spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in an interview with the AP, AFP and Reuters news agencies. Russia and Ukraine have been at loggerheads over the truce since early Saturday, with Moscow accusing Ukraine of violating the terms of an arms embargo. Moscow has denied the accusations, saying the Ukrainian government was violating its own ceasefire. NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen has also said that Moscow is not in favor of a ceasefire between Ukraine and its eastern neighbor, Donetsk. Russian officials have also called for an end to the armed conflict between the two sides, a spokesman for Moscow told the AFP news agency, citing a Russian military source. A ceasefire is a \"non-negotiable condition\" for both sides to agree to, he added, noting that \"it is the responsibility of all sides in this conflict to ensure that no one is killed or injured.\" Russia has said it will continue to support Ukraine in its fight against the separatists, but the Kremlin has rejected the idea that Ukraine should be allowed to return to its former self-styled \"state of war\" in a bid to weaken Moscow's grip on the region. Ukraine has called on Moscow to halt its military operations against separatists in east Ukraine. Putin has repeatedly said he will not allow Ukraine to resume its war against Russia, despite the fact that the country's armed forces have not been able to take part in any offensive against Moscow. In the past few days, Moscow and Kiev have repeatedly threatened to impose sanctions on each other if Moscow does not stop its aggression. But the latest round of ceasefire talks between Moscow, Kiev and the West has so far failed to reach an agreement on how to stop the violence. Last week Moscow announced it would stop shelling the eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk in retaliation for Russia's annexation of its territory from Ukraine last year. It also announced the withdrawal of Russian troops from the Donetsk region in exchange for the return of Ukrainian troops to Lithuania."

        "target": "German FA calls off matches with China under-20 team after protests Germany's football association has called off several friendly matches between China's under-20 team and German lower league sides. The move follows a political protest at the first such match. In a statement released on Friday, the German football association (DFB) announced that the games would be rescheduled for 2018 and that talks would take place between them and their Chinese counterparts in order explore how to move forward. \"To the regret of all parties involved, the project has not received the broad approval that had been expected,\" the DFB said. \"In fact, the project was used by a handful of spectators to send messages that were considered hurtful by the Chinese team, officials, the Chinese Football Association's support staff and Chinese spectators.\" Protests in opening match The first of the arranged matches, against TSV Schott Mainz of the fourth-tier Regionalliga S\u00fcdwest was interrupted midway through the first half when the Chinese players left the field because a small group of activists had unfurled Tibetan flags. The team later returned to the field after the flags had been taken down, before succumbing to a 3-0 defeat. On Monday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry strongly criticized the protest. Initially, it had been thought that the Chinese side would play in the Regionalliga S\u00fcdwest - a regional division of Germany's fourth tier which has only 19 teams but the plan was revised so the matches would just be friendlies. This followed an agreement signed in 2016 between the German FA and the Chinese government to help boost the sport in the Asian country, where the Bundesliga is increasingly popular. Financial boost not enough to soothe concerns Despite the financial boost for the clubs \u2013 TSV Schott Mainz were reportedly paid a fee of \u20ac15,000 ($17.800) for last weekend's game \u2013 the move hasn't proved entirely popular with German fans, many of whom see it as just another example of commercial interests trumping sporting concerns. But the protests, and potential for further disruption, seem to be behind the cancellations - the DFB said both federations were aware of \"substantial evidence of further escalation,\" FSV Frankfurt, who were due to host the Chinese side on Saturday, said earlier this week that they would not ban protests despite an angry response to last week's incident from Beijing. \"We will not back a single centimeter off the basic rights our our democracy, including those relating to freedom of speech,\" FSV Frankfurt President Michael G\u00f6rner said in an interview with the Stuttgarter Nachrichten and Stuttgarter Zeitung newspapers. His words echoed those of DFB vice-president Ronny Zimmerman, who said that the games should be played \"within the framework of freedom of expression.\" The fixtures that have been abandoned include games against Wormatia Worms and Bundesliga club Hoffenheim's reserves. mp/pfd (dpa, SID)",
        "generated_story": "German football association cancels China Under-20 team due to protests Germany's national football team has canceled its trip to China for the 2018-19 season, citing protests in the Chinese capital. The German Football Association (DFB) announced on Saturday that it would cancel the team's participation in next year's Regionalliga S\u00fcdwest tournament in China. \"We regret to inform you that we will not be able to attend the event,\" the FSB said in a statement on its website. It did not elaborate on the reasons behind the cancellation of the tournament, which is scheduled to take place between Aug. 1 and Sept. 15, but it is understood that the decision was made by the club's vice-president, Ronny Zimmerman, in an interview with the German newspaper Stuttgarter Zeitung. According to the association's website, the trip was canceled because of a \"technical problem\" with a Chinese team that had been playing against a team from the same province as the Bundesliga side, TSV Schott Mainz, on Friday. German media reported that a number of Chinese players had left the stadium after the match, and that they were not allowed to return to their home country of Xinjiang, where they have been training for two years. A spokesman said the foreign ministry was \"deeply concerned\" about the situation, adding that \"it is not the first time we have had to cancel an international event.\" \"It is unfortunate that there is a technical problem,\" said Michael G\u00f6rner, a spokesman for German football's Confederation of Asian Football (CASF). \"But we are not going to allow it to happen again,\" he added, referring to a dispute between the two sides over the future of China's football federation and the country's association of football federations (FAZ). The FAZ has said it will continue to monitor the issue and will hold a press conference at the end of this week to discuss the matter. In the past, it has been the case that China was the only country that was willing to accept the invitation to travel to Germany. On Friday, FZ officials said they would be holding talks with Chinese football officials in Beijing over a possible return of an under-21 team to play for Germany in 2018. However, they also said there was no immediate decision on whether or not to send a delegation to Beijing for a training camp. Fazio, who is also a former head coach of Germany\u2019s national team, told the newspaper that he was not aware of any plans to boycott the games. \u201cWe have no idea what is going on,\u201d he said."

        "target": "For drivers in Germany, 2010 was the most expensive year ever Owning and operating a car in Germany has never been cheap, but it's never been more expensive than in 2010. German auto club ADAC says costs associated with owning a car have risen more than 40 percent since 1995. In 2010, German car owners had to pay a high price for their mobility, according to ADAC, which cited record-high fuel prices as the major cost factor. \"For drivers, 2010 will go down in history as the most costly year ever,\" ADAC said in a statement. High taxes The cost of acquiring and operating a car has risen 42 percent since 1995, compared to a 24 percent increase in the general cost of living. Due to tax increases and higher production costs, fuel prices soared 86 percent over the 15-year period. In 2010 alone, the average price for a liter of super gasoline was more than 1.40 euros ($1.84) - the highest the average price ever. According to ADAC, urban singles spent an average of 3,340 euros on their cars in 2000. Five years later, that figure had jumped to 3,900 euros. By the end of 2010, their expenses reached 4,380 euros, or 1,000 euros more than a decade earlier. Driving is also pricey for four-person families with two cars. According to the automobile club, their annual costs have risen 30 percent over the past 10 years from 5,940 euros to 7,740 euros. Taxes account for the lion's share of gasoline and diesel prices. The German government's mineral oil and value added taxes account for nearly 88 cents of the 1.35-euro price of a liter of fuel. Low toll revenue While the German government reaps more revenue year for year from vehicle-related taxes, income generated by its highway toll for trucks is expected to fall this year for the first time since the haulage charges were introduced in 2005. The government predicts this year's toll revenues will amount to 4.2 billion euros, down from 4.3 billion euros in 2009. Author: John Blau Editor: Sam Edmonds",
        "generated_story": "The Most Costly Year in History for German Auto Clubs The most expensive year in German auto clubs' history has been marked by an increase in the cost of ownership of vehicles. In 2010, Germany's largest auto club, ADAC, announced that it had spent 4.3 billion euros ($4.2 billion) on the purchase of new cars and trucks. The car club was one of the largest car clubs in Germany at the time of its founding in 1995. Since then, the number of cars sold has risen by more than 30 percent, according to the German Automobile Clubs Association (ADAC). The average price of a new car was 3,340 euros (1.35 euros) in 2009, up from 4,380 euros in 2000 and 4 percent in 2005. This was the most costly year for a German club since the introduction of electric cars in 1990. \"It was a record year,\" said the club's president, Hans-Joachim M\u00fcller, in a statement released on Thursday. It was also the first time that a car had been sold for less than 1.40 euros, and it was only the second time in its history that the price had increased by as much as 5,740 euros. That's a lot of money for one car, but it's not enough to cover the costs of owning one. For the average car owner, this is a very expensive car to own. And it is not just for the car owners who have to fork out the money to buy one for their own car. There are also a few car dealers who are willing to sell their cars for as little as 2.5 percent of their sales. These dealers are not the only ones who can't afford to do this. They are the ones that are struggling to make ends meet, such as the BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Audi, Porsche, Kia, VW and Porsche. But they can do it all, because they have a great deal of pride in their vehicles and they don't need to spend a fortune on new models. So, they're not going to be able to afford the expensive cars that have been around for so long. At the same time, there's no reason to think that they won't be doing this again. What's more, it will be the last time they'll be selling their car before the end of this year. How much do you think they will spend on it? It's hard to say. You can see the difference between 2005 and 2009. Then there was 2008, when they sold their first car and then they were selling it off. Now they sell it to a dealership in Berlin for 2,300 euros a year, which is about $1,000 euros less. After that, that's about a third of what they paid for it. Last year's car sales were down by 3.4 percent compared with the year before, with a total loss of 5.9 percent on sales in 2007 and a drop in sales of 7,940 euros on a comparable basis in 2008. All of these figures are in line with figures from the previous two years. However, last year was not a bad year at all. Only a handful of German clubs sold cars at a loss, while the rest of Germany sold off their entire fleets. Most of them sold the cars they bought in 2004 for an average of 1,350 euros or more. More than half of all German car registrations were sold to foreign carmakers in 2010."

        "target": "Spain takes in first of five Guantanamo detainees The first of five Guantanamo inmates slated to be taken in by Spain has arrived there. The move shows Madrid's support of US efforts to close the controversial prison. Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said the first inmate from the US prison at Guantanamo Bay had arrived in his country. Madrid has agreed to host five prisoners, the largest commitment yet from a European country. Citing privacy concerns, Rubalcaba refused to give the prisoner's name or any identifying information, except to say he was a Palestinian. The new arrival will be able to work and move around Spain as he wishes, but will not be able to leave the country. \"He is a Palestinian, he has already arrived in our country. We do not want to give out further details because we want everyone who comes to live in our country to be able to live their lives normally,\" he told a news conference. Spain urges others to 'do the utmost' Spain's decision to take five Guantanamo detainees is part of an effort to help US President Barack Obama with his plans to shut down the jail. The prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, was set up at a US navy base by former President George W. Bush in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos has urged other European countries \"to do their utmost\" to take in former Guantanamo detainees as well. Third countries are being asked to take in detainees who are cleared of any charges, but who can't be sent back to their homelands for fear of persecution. Obama had said he would close the prison by January 22, 2010, yet the deadline passed unmet. Some 200 detainees remain there, but finding places to take in the prisoners - even the dozens already cleared for release - has proved controversial. jen/AFP/AP Editor: Andreas Illmer",
        "generated_story": "Spain releases first of five prisoners from Guantanamo Bay A Spanish Interior Minister has announced the release of the first five detainees from the US prison at Guantanamo in Cuba. The release comes a day after US President Barack Obama announced that he was releasing five of his own Guantanamo prisoners on January 22, 2010. Spain's interior minister, Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba, said on Wednesday that the five had been transferred to a prison in the southern Spanish state of Galicia. \"We are happy to see that these five have been released,\" he said in a statement released by the Interior Ministry. He said the prisoners were being held at a military base in southern Spain, where they were to be interrogated by US special forces. In addition to the detainees, the government also said that it would release the remaining three prisoners, including a woman and a Palestinian, who were detained at the prison on Sept. 11, 2001. A spokesman for the interior ministry, Miguel Angel Moratinos, told AFP/AP Editor: Andreas Illmer that his ministry had received a letter from US Secretary of State George W. Bush expressing concern about the situation in Guantanamo, which was opened in September 2001 by then-President Bush. According to US officials, this letter was sent to Spain in response to Obama's decision to open the Guantanamo prison there. It was not immediately clear whether the new detainees would face charges of terrorism or espionage, but it is believed that they would be held for up to three years in prison. Spanish officials have said they have not yet decided on the charges against the men, although they are expected to do so within the next few weeks. They have also not ruled out the possibility of a return to their home countries, according to Spanish media reports. At the same time, Spanish Foreign Minister Luis de Guzm\u00e1n told the Spanish newspaper El Mundo that Spain was willing to cooperate with the United States in its fight against terrorism. However, he did not rule out an extradition request from Washington, D.C. On January 21, 2009, a US court in Madrid ruled that a request for asylum in Spain would not be granted until the end of this year. That ruling was later overturned by a lower court, and the case was referred to an appeals court."

        "target": "Opinion: A decision against heart and mind The House of Commons has passed the Brexit bill - despite most parliamentarians being against it. But now they should take care that Great Britain does not move further away from Europe, writes Birgit Maass. If only they had done it out of full conviction. If they at least believed that they could really benefit their country by withdrawing from the EU. But many of the parliamentarians whose vote will finally set Brexit on its wayhave voted against their hearts, as well as their minds. It was a vote against their minds, because the withdrawal from the EU will almost certainly, at least on a short to medium term basis, have negative repercussions for the British economy. And it was a vote against their hearts, because for many, a view of the future, divorced from Brussels and increasingly reliant on an unpredictable US President Donald Trump, is somewhat alarming. In recent days, many members of parliament have described it as \"a catastrophe.\" No vote \"against the will of the people.\" Of course there are \"Brexiteers\" who believe that a Britain independent of Brussels will be able to return to its former greatness, once it is no longer held back by the \"Little Europeans.\" But they are in the minority - the majority of parliamentarians already declared their support for remaining in the EU during the referendum campaign. Yet despite this, Theresa May's government was able to push its legislative proposal through the House of Commons without any great difficulty. The predominant view, also amongst members of the two leading parties, is that to hinder Brexit and to fail to support the government in its endeavors to do so, would be to go \"against the will of the people.\" Anti-EU newspapers have targeted Brexit opponents. And those who have publically come out in support of the EU have had to reckon with death threats. The at times passionate debate in the lower house, that went on over several days, was a temporary highlight in this European tragedy, which in the worst case could contribute to the continent disintegrating into individual sovereign states. Don't be intimidated The British public supports the hard-line position taken by Prime Minister May in withdrawing from the common market. Polls are showing that her strategy is gaining increased support. There is no turning back now. The British are now looking for clarity on the repercussions of their withdrawal from the EU. They want the negotiations with the EU to start as soon as possible. It was an historical misjudgement by David Cameron that he could win the referendum. Most of the members of the lower house believed the then-prime minister and voted to hold a referendum. But now they can no longer stop Brexit. But they should not let themselves be intimidated by party discipline, nor the leading Brexiteers, nor by voter impatience. Over the next two years they should use every chance they can to influence the withdrawal process. May announced that although they are leaving the European Union, they will not be moving away from Europe. The parliamentarians must now hold her to her word. Have something to say? Add your comments below. The thread will stay open for 24 hours after publication.",

        "generated_story": "Klaus Staeck Artist and Publisher of \"No Detox Water\" has published a new book on the subject. The book is a collection of short stories and essays by the artist and publisher of the no-detox water series. It is the first book in the series to be published in a German language, and it has been translated into English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, English and German. Klaus has a lot to say about the book. He is also the author of a number of other books, including \"The Art of Water,\" a book about water conservation and the history of water use in developing countries, as well as a series on water-related topics. His most recent book, \"Water-based Water-Based Water\", was published last year and is due out in early 2018. In it, he will be publishing a selection of his work on a wide range of topics, ranging from water management to water treatment to the development of new technologies for the treatment of drinking water. There will also be a special edition for those who are interested in learning more about how water is used and how it can be used. \"I'm very excited about this book,\" he said, adding that he hopes it will help people understand that water isn't just for drinking, it's also for people who don't have access to clean water and who want to use it for their own health and well-being. And that's something that can only be done with a little bit of help from the help of your friends and family. You can read the whole thing here, but the main point is that you have to make sure that the water you're drinking is safe and that it doesn't contaminate the environment. This is not something you can do with your own water, that is for example, if you are drinking from a well or using a tap. That's not the case with water - it is water that gets into your body, which is contaminated with bacteria and can lead to cancer and other diseases. So, I think you'll find it very interesting to see how Klaus and his team have managed to get the word out that they're going to try and do something about it. They've been doing this for a long time and they've done a great job. Now, they just need to figure out how to do it again and again. What do you think? What are your thoughts on this? Do you agree with Klaus's conclusions? Is it a good idea to go back and forth between the two of them? Does it make sense for you to stick with the same thing? Or is it better to stay with what you know and stick to it? The answer is no. If you do that, then stay away from all of these things that are happening to you, because you won't be able to change your mind about them. But you've got to keep going back to what's going on in your life, so stay out of this world. I'm not sure how long it'll last. How long will it last? Well, maybe a few more years. We'll see what happens. Then we'll know for sure."

        "target": "A Brief History of the Seaside Holiday These days, millions take seaside holidays for granted as one of life's pleasures. But 200 years ago, a dip in the sea was more a test of courage. Hardly anyone could swim. As late as the 18th century, many Europeans still thought of the sea as the realm of Satan: storm-tossed and inhabited by terrifying monsters. \"Unlike the mountains, the coasts were terra incognita as a holiday spot,\" says Manfred B\u00e4tje, director of the Bade-Museum on the North Sea island of Norderney. Anyone who set foot in the water was \"stepping into the unknown\". Brighton showed the way That only began to change after the British aristocracy discovered the healing power of salt water. As early as 1780, Brighton, England's biggest and oldest seaside resort, was a bustling spa. Philosopher and physicist Georg Christoph Lichtenberg (1742-1799) of G\u00f6ttingen gave Germans the starting signal with his 1793 essay \"Why doesn't Germany have any large public seaside resorts?\" In it, he called for the creation of a resort in Cuxhaven on the North Sea. He received support from the most notable German physician of the time, the Prussian king's court physician, Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland. But things turned out somewhat differently. Germany's first seaside resort was indeed built in September, 1793, but in Heiligendamm on the Baltic Sea. Four years later, permission was granted for construction of Germany's first resort on the North Sea, on Norderney. \"For the first bathing season on July and August of 1800, only around 250 guests turned up. Now, the nearly 6000 residents host a good 530,000 bathers annually, plus around 230,000 day-trippers,\" B\u00e4tje reels off the figures. Romanticist inspiration In the 19th century, the landscapes of Caspar David Friedrich, such as his famous Chalk Cliffs on R\u00fcgen (1818), gave seaside holidays added impetus. From then on, the sea was no longer a voracious beast. From the shore, the cultivated, modern European contemplated the vast melancholy of the deep. \"The calm sea became an embodiment of unspecified yearning, the waves an expression of vitality and dynamism,\" soliloquizes museum director B\u00e4tje. But the journey to the sea long remained an arduous, time-consuming one. It took the mail coach a good thirty hours to cover the distance from Hamburg to the North Frisian town of Aurich over bumpy, muddy roads. The express cab from Bremen only took about 16 hours to reach the East Frisian town of Norden - including six changes of horses along the way. \"It wasn't comfortable,\" explains B\u00e4tje. Not until the introduction of seaside tourist steamers out of Hamburg and Bremen to the islands and the expansion of the railways did the journey become easier. Strict bathing rules At first, it was primarily the well-to-do bourgeois and nobility who were able to afford a seaside holiday. Victorian-era society is known for its extreme prudishness, and the beach was not exempt. Bathing machines were essentially changing cabins on wheels that could be rolled into the surf. The sexes were kept strictly separated. Wet swimsuits could not be allowed to cling, thus revealing the body's contours. Women sported baggy flannel garments with bloomers underneath that swiftly became waterlogged to where the bather was risking her life. Hardly anyone really knew how to swim anyway. \"Most bathers wouldn't stay in the water any more than two minutes, often just seconds at a time. The English had a rule: 'Three dips and out',\" quips archivist Manfred B\u00e4tje, whose Bade-Museum is housed in a building for a former wave pool, just a few steps from Norderney's Weststrand, where, during the summer months, vacationers sunbathe in wicker beach chairs and on blankets, cooled by a salty sea breeze. Sunbathing first came in style early in the 20th century, and the first true swimsuits were produced in the United States. \"Starting in 1919, today's bathing culture gradually began to take shape,\" B\u00e4tje looks back. At the same time, ideals of beauty were in flux - such as the attitude towards tan skin, which had long been regarded as a mark of farmers and manual laborers. B\u00e4tje: \"People were still cultivating their genteel pallors.\" Water, Waves, Wellness Today, the sun worshipers are the devout masses, and seaside holidays are their pilgrimages. The North Sea resorts alone count some 12.9 million overnight stays annually. Health is once again a primary concern: sea air, sea water, sea salts and the algaes and mud used in",
        "generated_story": "A Brief History of the Seaside Holiday in Germany In the 19th century, Germany's seaside holiday was known as the \"Chalk Cliffs on R\u00fcgen.\" In 1818, the town of Norderney was founded by a German physician named Caspar David Friedrich. The town is now home to the Bade-Museum in Bremen, a museum dedicated to German history and culture. It is located on the North Frisian coast, near the German border with England, and is a UNESCO World Heritage site. There is also a small museum in the city of Cologne, which is part of a group of German museums that have been established around the world to commemorate the 18th-century holiday. They are located in an area of about 1,500 square kilometers (1,200 square miles) and are the site of many of Germany\u2019s most famous tourist attractions. In 1780, they were the first tourist attraction in North America to be opened up to visitors from all over the globe. Since then, visitors have come to Germany to enjoy the sights and sounds of sea life and to see the beauty and beauty of nature. Some of them have even gone on to travel to other countries, such as Germany, England and the United States, where they spent many years studying and studying the natural world. Many of these places are still in use today, but they are becoming more and more popular as tourists come and go. For example, in 1799, there was a shipwreck off the coast of Cuxhaven in England that killed more than 100 people and injured hundreds more, according to a study by German archivist Manfred B\u00e4tje. \"It was an accident,\" he said, \"that the ship was wrecked in a storm and that the crew had to come back and rescue it.\" The wrecking ball was discovered by an Englishman who had been working on it for a year and a half. He was able to recover the wreck and restore it to its former glory. But he was unable to return to his native Germany until the summer of 1919, when he discovered that it was no longer possible for him to stay in his home state of Hesse. After that, he decided to move back to England where he had lived for the last 20 years. This time around, his wife and two children were living on a farm near his parents' house in H\u00fcrtingen in northern Germany. His wife was also living there at the time of his death. Her son was born there, as well as her daughter and step-grandson. She was the youngest of four children, aged five and six. Bismarck, who was then living with his father, was one of two brothers who died of typhus in 1817. Both of their parents were German-born, so the family moved to H\u00fcbingen after their father died. Their mother was German and their stepfather was from the same family."

        "generated_story": "Lockdown lifted after active shooter incident at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland US President Barack Obama has lifted a lockdown at the US military base at Camp Springs outside Washington, D.C. after an active-shooter incident on Thursday morning. The lockdown was lifted at 9 am local time (9 am. EDT) after a man opened fire on US troops stationed at a military facility outside the capital. US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said the incident was an \"isolated incident\" and that no one was injured. \"There was no immediate threat to our national security,\" Obama said in a statement released by the White House. He added that the military was \"comfortable\" with the situation and would continue to do so in the event of an incident like this. Obama also called on the public to stay away from the area where the shooting took place, saying it was a \"very isolated incident.\" \"We have a very active situation,\" he said, adding that \"it is not the first time that we have seen this kind of situation in our country.\" The incident occurred at an Air Force base near the Maryland-US border and was reported to have taken place on Wednesday morning, the Pentagon said. It was not immediately clear how many troops were deployed to the base, which is located about 30 miles (48 kilometers) southwest of Washington. Officials said there were no reports of any injuries, but that there had been \"a number of incidents\" in recent days, including one in which a woman was shot and killed by a US soldier, according to US officials. A spokesman for the Defense Department said no injuries were reported and no suspects were believed to be in custody. On Thursday, US media reported that a gunman had entered the facility and fired a single shot into the air, killing one soldier and injuring two others. Military spokesman Col. Joe Biden, who was traveling with Obama to Maryland, told reporters that he had not seen any evidence of a terrorist attack. In an interview with The Washington Post, Biden said he did not know the extent of the attack, though he was aware that it had occurred in an area that was heavily populated with military personnel. According to Obama's office, there have been reports that at least one person was killed and more than 100 wounded. However, it is unclear whether any of those injured were seriously injured or whether the shooter was in self-inflicted wounds."

        "target": "Threat of the Punjabi Taliban is growing Deutsche Welle talks to Pakistani political expert Hasan Askari Rizvi about the growing ties between militants in northwest Pakistan and Punjab province. At least four gunmen disguised in police uniforms raided a hospital in Pakistan's eastern city of Lahore on Monday night, claiming at least five lives. Local officials said the gunmen were trying to free a militant, who was being treated there after being captured during attacks on two mosques last Friday. The police said the gunfight at Jinnah Hospital had lasted around 45 minutes but the gunmen had managed to flee. Friday's twin attacks on the minority Ahmadi community left more than 90 people dead. They were claimed by a group, which identified itself as the Punjabi wing of the Taliban. Deutsche Welle spoke to political expert Hasan Askari Rizvi in Lahore, where there has been a wave of violence in recent days. DW: Who are the \"Punjabi Taliban\"? It is a kind of a pejorative term, which includes a host of groups. Initially in Punjab, you had two types of militancy: One, the groups that focussed mainly on Indian-administered Kashmir and there were other types of groups that focussed on Pakistan. Those were the sectarian groups targeting mainly the Shias, and there were some Shia groups targeting the Sunni leadership. Over the years a lot of factions have broken away from these groups and these small entities are functioning more or less autonomously. They have trainings in the tribal areas because these are secured for them and certain parts are not under Pakistani control so these groups go there. They operate with the Pakistani Taliban based in tribal areas against the Pakistani troops in the region. They also have an autonomous agenda, which they pursue in Punjab, as they have been doing in the past days. These groups also play host or are a kind of a local link to Taliban suicide bombers who come into the main part of Pakistan from the tribal areas (let's say to Punjab). If they have to target some place, they park themselves with these Punjab groups, and then do it. All these factions and groups that have broken away from traditional militant groups and are functioning in close collaboration with tribal area Taliban are often described as the \"Punjabi Taliban\". Why do you think these militants are resurfacing now? They have always existed here and there and generally the trend is that they undertake a couple of operations, one after the other. Then the government comes in and takes action against them. Then they just disappear or become sleeping groups and suddenly after a couple of months they resurface. That's the standard pattern. The last major incident in Lahore was in the first week of March. Then there was nothing in April and now towards the end of May you have this kind of incident. Do you think the government should have taken stronger action against them? They should have but the problem is that the Punjab government has a kind of ambiguous approach and I think there is some element of denial within the leadership also. These groups also have some sympathy if not support at the societal level and that makes it difficult for the government to go against them openly. They need to work together and to emphasise to the people that they are terrorists. They use different names and Islam but actually their agenda is terrorism. Somehow the government of Punjab has been rather confused and ambiguous regarding these groups. Interview: Disha Uppal Editor: Anne Thomas",

        "target": "Former Barcelona coach Tito Vilanova loses battle with cancer Former Barcelona coach Tito Vilanova has died from the cancer that forced him to retire from football at the end of last season. He was 45. The Catalan club announced the death of its former bench boss in a statement posted on its website on Friday. \"FC Barcelona is in immense mourning. Tito Vilanova has died at the age of 45. May he rest in peace,\" the statement said. Vilanova had first been diagnosed with a tumor in a saliva gland in November 2011, while he was an assistant to then-Barcelona head coach Pep Guardiola. He had been battling against recurring cancer ever since and had been admitted to a Barcelona hospital last week. He led Barca to the Primera Liga title last season, his only campaign as head coach, when the Catalans earned a record-tying 100 points. Last July he stepped down due to his ongoing health problems. Vilanova is survived by his wife and two children, including a son who now plays in Barcelona's youth academy. pfd/lw (AP, dpa, AFP)",
