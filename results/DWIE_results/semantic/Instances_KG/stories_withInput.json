        "target": "Opinion: Obama's Cuban revolution President Barack Obama has made a very special declaration of love to Cuba. It's as revolutionary as the Cuban revolution, and as peaceful as the biblical Sermon on the Mount, says DW's Astrid Prange. US President Barack Obama has lost his old communist \"enemy,\" and Cuban President Raul Castro has lost his hatred of capitalism. In the first phone call from president to president since 1961 the two heads of state came to a surprisingly swift agreement. They want to renew diplomatic relations, which have been on ice for more than 50 years, and exchange ambassadors. It's only a matter of time before the US lifts its trade embargo against Cuba. All the word \"embargo\" is really good for - at this stage - is as an ideological soapbox for political hardliners, especially Republicans in Congress who believe lifting sanctions would constitute defeat for the US. Yet the lifting of the embargo has already begun. In addition to medication, it has been possible since 2000 to export agricultural produce such as maize, cereal crops, and poultry to Cuba. Flirting with the rogue state Furthermore, 100,000 US citizens have travelled to Cuba since 2011 for cultural and scientific exchanges. Travel restrictions on Cubans living in exile in the US who wanted to visit their relatives on the island were also lifted. According to press reports, the two countries' military forces are even said to be cooperating, as are their coastguards, and military on the border of the US marine base in Guantanamo. Now Obama wants to officially open a \"new chapter\" in relations with the communist Caribbean island and remove Cuba from the US list of so-called \"rogue states\" that support terrorism. The travel ban on American tourists visiting the island will also largely be lifted. That's as far as things will go for the time being, as Obama would require a majority in Congress in Washington to lift the embargo entirely. But even if these are only small steps, the fall of the American-Cuban wall has begun. The easing of the sanctions and the resumption of diplomatic relations are setting the scene for an end to the embargo. Embargo as scapegoat The tearing down of this \"wall in the mind\" is long overdue. The blockade is obsolete, and has proved to be entirely ineffective. More than this, its advocates have achieved the opposite of what they actually wanted. The blockade has provided the leaders in Havana with an easy excuse for their economic failure. Raul Castro realized long ago that Cuba's economic problems can no longer be justified simply by citing the US embargo. It looks as though he was counting on the blockade being lifted: There is no other explanation for the completion of the Mariel container port in January this year. Cuba's biggest infrastructure project was, incidentally, financed by Brazil. The Brazilians also sent a declaration of love to Cuba. Raul Castro opened the door to them. He loves anyone who helps him - his friends even more than his enemies.",

The US president has promised to end the war on terror in Cuba. \"We are going to do everything in our power to stop it,\" he said in a speech to Congress on Tuesday. Obama is set to sign a deal with the Cuban government on the future of terrorism and human rights. He is expected to announce the deal on Wednesday, the first day of a three-day visit to Cuba by US Secretary of State John Kerry and Cuban Foreign Minister Raul Castro, who is scheduled to visit the island later this month. Read more: Obama's Cuba policy The fall of Cuba's war against terror has been marked by a new wave of violence and repression. In a statement released Tuesday, Obama said he was \"deeply disappointed\" by what he described as a \"new wave\" of anti-terror violence in his country. But he added: \"I am deeply disappointed in what I have seen in my own country, and I will continue to work with my Cuban friends and family to make sure that we are doing everything we can to prevent this from happening again.\" The president also said that he would be \"very happy\" if the United States and Cuba agreed to a ceasefire on terrorism. However, he did not rule out the possibility that the ceasefire could be extended to include the use of force against terrorism or other forms of violent crime. Astrid Prange, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington, D.C., told DW that \"there is a danger that this will lead to an escalation in violence, which is something that has to be dealt with in order to protect the interests of all Cubans.\" He added that there was also \"a risk of escalation\" that could result in more attacks on US troops in Syria and Iraq, as well as an increase in terrorist attacks in North Africa and the Middle East. \u201cThere is also a risk that some of these attacks will be carried out,\u201d she said, adding that it was not possible to predict what would happen to US forces stationed at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, if they were to take action against the terrorist group, al-Qaeda, or any other terrorist organization, such as the Islamic State (IS, formerly known as \"Islamic State.\")"

The 89-year-old did not say when exactly his resignation would take effect. Calling the move a personal decision, President Giorgio Napolitano made his announcement during an end-of-year speech on Wednesday. \"I'm about to step down, to resign as the constitution expressly allows,\" he said, adding. \"I've reached an age that brings with it growing limitations and difficulties for me to do my institutional duties, which are complex and very demanding.\" Though he did not say when his resignation would take effect, a potential date is January 13 when Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi is due to give up the country's rotating six-month presidency of the Council of the European Union. Renzi faces a political challenge in organizing a replacement for Napolitano, dubbed by Italian media as \"King George.\" The president has served as a key intermediary between political parties through numerous changes in government and other tricky political situations. Napolitano, a former communist respected by Europe and Washington, took office in 2006. At the end of his seven-year mandate in 2013, he was asked to stay on because parliament could not agree on his successor. At the time he warned he may not serve out the full term, given his age. In Italy, presidents have loosely-defined powers including the ability to nominate prime ministers, dissolve parliament and veto legislation, as well as use the moral authority of the office to influence politics. se/cmk (dpa, Reuters)",
        "generated_story": "Giorgio Napolitano resigns as Italy's president The Italian president has resigned as president of the European Union, replacing Matteo Renzi. The resignation comes after months of speculation over the fate of his successor. Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte announced on Thursday that he would step down from his post at the end of this month. \"I have been informed by the Italian government that I will not be returning to the position of president,\" he said in a statement released on his official Twitter account. He said he was \"deeply disappointed\" with the results of last month's elections, which saw the country's economy shrink by 1.5 percent and the unemployment rate rise by 2.6 percent. Italy had been in recession for more than a year and a half and was in dire financial straits, according to a report in the Financial Times. It was the first time in nearly a decade that a president had resigned from the post, and it marked the beginning of a new era of political stability in Italy. But it also marked a turning point for Italian politics. In the past few months, Italy has become one of Europe's largest economies, with a population of just over 2 million people living on less than 1 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP) and an average of 3.4 million euros ($4.1 billion). The country is also the world's second-largest economy, behind only the United States in terms of GDP, after Germany. Napoli's resignation came after the EU's executive body, the Council of European States, announced that it would no longer be able to approve the appointment of an interim head of state until the new government is inaugurated on July 1, following the resignation of outgoing president Gennaro Gattuso, who was widely considered to be the most powerful man in Europe. However, it was not immediately clear whether the move would have a positive impact on the economy or whether it could have an adverse effect on economic growth. There was speculation that the president would be replaced by a technocrat, but it is not yet clear what role he will play. According to Italian media reports, there were no immediate reports of any plans for a possible re-election, although some analysts have speculated that there could be a change in leadership. Some Italian newspapers reported that Italian President Gio-Manolo Gabbiadini had asked for an extension to his term, while others suggested he should stay on as interim president until a successor was found to have resigned. Other reports have suggested that Italy may be in talks with other European countries about the possibility of holding a referendum on whether or not to hold a general election next year. That could lead to an election in June, when the election is due to take place. At the same time, Italian officials have said that they are open to discussions on a range of issues, such as whether Italy should be allowed to run for president again, as long as the current president is still in office. On Thursday, a spokesman for the prime minister's office said the government would not rule out the idea of appointing a permanent successor, even if the term was extended to another four years. A spokesman said: \"We have no plans to do so. We have not made any decision yet.\" The spokesman did not respond to requests for comment from The Associated Press."

The spokesman said more help was needed, but could not give exact numbers \"due to pending assignments.\" Recent soccer violence raises concern Swiss media has been questioning the security preparations for Euro 2008 after a spate of violence at recent games. In the latest incident, seats were ripped out and a goal post wrenched from the ground after St. Gallen faced the prospect of relegation following a 2-0 defeat to Bellinzona on May 20. St. Gallen was the third incident in a month that saw violent clashes with police who twice resorted to rubber bullets and tear gas. While Switzerland is seen as a low risk country in terms of hooliganism, violence has been on the increase in recent years and estimates claim there are around 400 hooligans and 600 sympathizers. Swiss Sports Minister Samuel Schmid said that hooliganism cannot be ruled out, reported German news agency DPA. But he expressed his belief that extra measures such as more policing, restrictions on alcohol -- which he has called \"a catalyst for violence\" -- and video surveillance will help keep trouble at bay. Private firms to boost European police The private security companies will be responsible for patrolling the stadiums and their surroundings, as well as the public viewing areas, team hotels and trainings areas. An international police force will manage the rest. Switzerland has committed some 31,200 police officers and soldiers.

It is the first time that a private firm has been contracted by the government to assist in security planning for the European soccer championships in St. Gallen and Bellinzona, Switzerland. According to a statement released on Thursday, the firm will provide \"technical support\" to the Swiss security forces. \"We will be providing technical support to our partners,\" said Urs Stadler, head of security at Tages Anzeiger, adding that it would be a \"significant step forward\" in ensuring that security is in place in all major sports events, such as the World Cup and the Olympic Games. In addition, it will also provide financial support for sports federations in Switzerland and Germany, as well as financial assistance to athletes and other sports organizations in other countries, including the United States, France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece, Romania, Turkey, and Spain. A spokesman for Swiss Olympic Committee President Samuel Schmid said that the move was \"a very significant step\" and that \"it is a very important step.\" \"It is important that we have the information we need in order to be able to make the most of this event,\" he said.

But it is not clear what will happen next, which is why we are looking at a number of different options. For example, we will have to look at how to deal with the threat posed by terrorist attacks. We are also looking into the use of cyber security as a means of protecting our athletes.\u201cI think the best way to do this is to use the Internet and social media platforms to communicate with each other and to share information about what is going on in our countries. I think that is something that will help us to better prepare for this year\u2019s event. That is, to say the least, what we can do in terms of our own security and how we want to protect the athletes, spectators and spectators who come to watch the games. There is also the possibility that some of these games could be played out in a different way, for example in Germany or the Netherlands, where there is an ongoing conflict over who is allowed to take part in them. If that happens, then we'll be doing something about it. And that's a good thing, because we don't have any problem with that at all. What we do have is people who are willing to cooperate with us, who can help in any way. They are very good at communicating with one another and they can be very helpful in helping us understand the issues that are important to us. This is one of those things that I'm really looking forward to doing in future.\" The announcement came a day after German Chancellor Angela Merkel announced that she would step down from her position as foreign minister. Merkel's decision to leave the presidency of her country was seen by many as an indication that her government was ready to step up its efforts to ensure the safety of its citizens. She said she was confident that Merkel would stick to her promise of keeping the peace in Europe, even if it meant that Germany would not be invited to attend the tournament. Her comments came after a meeting with Merkel in Berlin on Wednesday, in which Merkel was asked by German media to explain her decision not to seek a second term in office."

Conservative members of Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition put forward a united front at the weekend against recent developments in the city of Wuppertal. Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said civilians wearing uniforms bearing the logo \"Shariah police\" could not simply start patrolling German streets. The groups reportedly hovered around sites like discotheques and gambling houses, telling passers-by to refrain from gambling and alcohol. Wuppertal's police have begun pressing charges. \"Sharia law is not tolerated on German soil,\" de Maiziere told mass-circulation daily Bild on Saturday. \"Nobody can take it upon themselves to abuse the good name of the German police.\" Justice Minister Heiko Maas, meanwhile, told Bild that \"the state alone\" was responsible for the administration of justice in Germany. It was obvious, Maas said, that any illegal parallel system of law enforcement would not be tolerated. Christian Democrat party whip Volker Kauder was similarly emphatic in an interview to be published in this week's Welt am Sonntag newspaper. \"Under absolutely no circumstances can we tolerate self-styled 'Sharia police officers' patrolling our streets and dictating what people should or should not do,\" Kauder said. Ringleader: goal was attention The 33-year-old behind the Wuppertal patrols, former fireman Sven Lau, published a video on his website on Saturday. Lau said that a \"Sharia police\" never existed, and that a group of men had simply worn the mock uniforms for a few hours. \"We knew that this would raise attention,\" Lau said, claiming that his goal was to spark a debate about Sharia law in Germany. Lau is a leading member of Germany's Salafist movement, advocates of a strict Sunni interpretation of political Islam. He works with a mosque in his native M\u00f6nchengladbach, not far west of Wuppertal, and used to head the fundamentalist group \"Invitation to Paradise.\" (Einladung zum Paradies, in German.) The central council of Muslims in Germany (ZMD) condemned the activities. \"These few teen yobs do not speak in our name,\" chairman Ayman A. Mazyek told the Tagesspiegel am Sonntag newspaper. \"These people are perverting the name of our religion. With this shrill and foolish action, they are really hurting Muslims.\" Sharia law is the Arabic term for a legal system based on the Koran. Saudi Arabia and Iran are examples of countries where such a system officially applies. Wearing a veil is obligatory for women and corporal punishment such as stoning is legally tolerated. Human Rights Watch reported last month that Saudi Arabia had beheaded 19 people in just 16 days in August, for convictions on charges ranging from cannabis smuggling to \"sorcery.\" msh/rc (AFP, dpa, Reuters)",

The two parties have been at loggerheads over a number of issues, including the presence of IS in the country's most populous Muslim-majority state of M\u00f6nchengladbach, which is home to the largest concentration of Muslims in Europe. On Saturday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel called for a \"total and complete shutdown\" of the state's police force, adding that it would be \"unacceptable\" for Muslims to be forced to leave their homes in order to take part in a police operation. In a statement released on Sunday, the CDU's spokesman, Volker Kauder, called on the government to step up its anti-Islamic stance. Maas also said his party would continue to work closely with police to ensure the safety of its members and their families. However, he did not rule out the possibility of a ban on Muslims entering Germany as a result of an increase in attacks by IS, according to a report by German daily Bild. A spokesman for Merkel's Christian Democratic party, however, said she was not aware of any plans to ban Muslims from Germany's largest Muslim city of M\u00fcnchen, where the Muslim community is located. German media reported on Saturday that police had been called to police stations around the city, but that there were no reports of attacks. Migrants from other Muslim countries were also reported to have fled to Germany in recent months, with some of them fleeing to neighboring countries. According to German news agency WDR, \"the police have not been allowed to enter the area at all and are therefore not permitted to use force against Muslims.\" \"There is no reason to believe that this will happen again,\" the spokesman said, referring to an incident in which a man was shot and killed by a member of his family."

Lui said the world community needed to get the \"upper hand\" over the next six months. While the viral spread had been slowed in Guinea, concerns focused especially on Liberia. \"If we don't stabilize Liberia, we will never stabilize the region,\" Lui said. She was critical of the WHO for delaying its public health emergency warning until August 8. \"We need people with a hands-on operational mindset,\" to combat the outbreak, Liu told the Geneva news briefing. WHO - 'vastly underestimated' On Thursday, the World Health Organization (WHO) said the scale of the epidemic had been \"vastly underestimated\" and that \"extraordinary measures\" were needed to contain the contagious virus. The UN health agency said the death toll had climbed to 1,069 in four afflicted countries, spanning Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia and more recently Nigeria. Sierra Leone's chief medical officer Brima Kargbo disclosed on Thursday that at least 32 of the nation's nurses and doctors had died from the Ebola virus while performing their duties between May 24 and August 13. Local staff suffered stigma, despite saving lives, Kargbo said. \"We still have to break the chain of transmission to separate the infected from the uninfected.\" Youth Olympics also affected The mounting alarm coincided with an announcement Friday from the International Olympics Committee that three athletes from Ebola-hit countries had been barred from competing in pool events and combat sports at the Youth Olympics opening in China on Saturday. ipj/tj (AfP, Reuters)",

The WHO said on Thursday that it was \"impeding\" efforts to contain the outbreak of the hemorrhagic fever, which has killed more than 1,000 people in the country. \"We are making progress, but we are moving slower than we should have,\" said Joanne Liu, head of global health at the UN's medical mission in Geneva, Switzerland. She added that there was a \"new level of urgency\" in dealing with the crisis, adding that \"it is becoming more and more difficult to control the spread of this disease.\" \"It is moving faster,\" Liu said in a statement released by the health ministry in Switzerland, referring to the epidemic that has swept across the globe and killed at least 2,500 people since the beginning of last year, according to a WHO report released on Friday. In addition, she said, \"there is a new level in which we have to deal with this crisis.\" The report said that in addition to Ebola, the virus has also spread to other infectious diseases, such as cancer, HIV, AIDS, tuberculosis, and HIV. It also said there is an increase in deaths from the disease, as well as a rise in cases of cancer and AIDS. According to Liu's report, more people are dying from Ebola than from other diseases. At the same time, there are a number of new infections that have been reported in other countries, including Nigeria, Liberia, Guinea, Haiti, Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, South Africa and the United States. There is also a growing concern that Ebola is spreading rapidly, particularly in Africa, where it is believed to be the most common cause of death among people living in low-income countries. As a result, it has become increasingly difficult for health workers to cope with high-risk populations, especially those who are in high risk of becoming infected. This is particularly true in developing countries where the death rate is much higher than in countries like Nigeria and South Sudan. For example, in Liberia where there has been a surge in Ebola cases in recent years, about 1.5 million people have died from it, compared to 2.4 million in Nigeria. That's a figure that is expected to rise to 3.6 million by 2020, when the world's largest health organization, WHO, predicts it will reach 3 billion people by 2030. China, however, has yet to make an official announcement about its plans to tackle the problem, while the US, Britain and France have all said they will continue to monitor the situation closely. A WHO spokesman said the agency is working closely with health authorities to ensure that no new cases are discovered. However, he cautioned that this is not the case for the West, saying that if the current outbreak were to continue, they would be able to prevent it from spreading. He also pointed out that some countries have already begun to recognize the danger posed by Ebola and are working to reduce the risk to others by introducing new strategies to combat it. On Thursday, a spokesman for one of those countries said it would not be possible to do so because of a lack of information about what is going on in West Africa. \u201cWe do not have any information on this,\u201d the spokesperson said."

The Luxembourg-based court thus sided with the German firm UsedSoft in a protracted legal battle with US software giant Oracle. The ruling made it clear that trade in used software was permissible even if the software had not been shipped on a physical medium such as a CD or DVD, but had been digitally downloaded from the Internet. UsedSoft's business model hinges completely on reselling used packages or legally obtained license keys for them. By reselling the keys to clients, the latter are then able to download the latest version of a given program directly from a company's Internet site and obtain all new updates and patches in the process. Legal clarity Oracle had sued UsedSoft over its business model, trying to prevent buyers of used software licenses from downloading programs again. But the European court ruled that the so-called principle of exhaustion applied whenever software was originally sold to a customer for an unlimited time span, not giving the maker of the software the right to prevent the resale of that software. \"The door for the trade in used software has been pushed wide open throughout the European Union,\" UsedSoft said in a statement, welcoming \"perfect legal safety on the market.\" The court in Luxembourg emphasized, though, that whoever resold pieces of original software and their accompanying licenses must erase every copy on their own computers in advance and was not allowed to keep a copy after resale. hg/mz (AFP, dpa)",

        "target": "NASA's 'Curiosity' readies to hit the Martian road The US space agency has said its Mars rover appears to be working \"flawlessly,\" with a lengthy period of instrument checks almost complete. The Curiosity rover will soon re-start its sluggish search for signs of life. NASA's Mars rover, \"Curiosity,\" will wrap up a lengthy self-testing phase on Thursday, freeing it up to continue exploring the surface of the Red Planet. Mission manager Jennifer Tropser told reporters in a conference call on Wednesday evening that the plan, once the final checks were completed, was to \"drive, drive, drive\" until Curiosity discovers a rock suitable for analysis. She added that the instrument checks have delivered positive results. \"Through every phase of the check-out, Curiosity has performed almost flawlessly,\" Tropser said. \"The success so far of these activities has been outstanding.\" Many of the tests have concerned Curiosity's robotic arm. The 2.1-meter (7-feet) appendage will be used to pick out and sample rocks and soil. NASA is investigating whether Mars can sustain life, or whether it could in the past. The tests were designed to identify any damage sustained during its interplanetary flight and also to ensure that the arm still functioned properly on Mars, with its different temperatures and gravity. The Mars rover landed in the giant Gale Crater, near the Martian equator, on August 5; it has so far moved about 109 meters within the crater. The rover is traveling east, heading first to an intersection called Glenelg, where three types of terrain meet. This is likely to be the location for the first rock and soil samples, though NASA said Curiosity was unlikely to arrive there for several weeks. Curiosity's ultimate destination is the nearby Aeolis Mons or Mount Sharp, a 3-mile-high mound of rock rising out of the crater. Mount Sharp is about 4.3 miles (7 kilometers) away from Curiosity's landing site. The $2.5-billion (1.93-billion-euro) six-wheeled rolling science lab is designed to last two years in order to complete its Mars mission. msh/jm (AFP, AP, Reuters)",
        "generated_story": "NASA's self-testing of Curiosity has been a success -- and so far, so good. The US space agency is pleased with the results of its experiment. \"We are very pleased,\" said Jennifer Tropser, head of NASA's Curiosity science mission in the US, adding that the rover is \"very, very good at self testing.\" The rover, which was launched in March 2011, is the first manned manned space probe to test a variety of instruments, including the Curiosity rover and the Mars rover Curiosity. It has already tested more than 1,000 instruments and is expected to be ready by the end of the year. In addition, the team is working on a number of new instruments that could be used in future missions. One of these instruments is called the \"Self-Test\" system, and it is designed to detect the presence of viruses and bacteria on the surface of an object. This means that it can be tested in real-world conditions, such as on Mars, Venus and even the moon. According to the mission's technical team, it will be able to measure the effects of various viruses, bacteria and viruses on an individual's body temperature, as well as whether they are present in a laboratory setting or a lab setting. If the experiment is successful, then it could lead to a manned mission to Mars. However, there is still a long way to go before Mars is ready to take off. There is a lot of work to do, but the most important thing is to make sure that all the instruments are working well. That is why we are so excited about this experiment, because we know that we will have a very interesting and interesting future. We are looking forward to seeing what the future holds for Mars and how it might look like on Earth. So far we have so much work ahead of us. I think we're going to have to wait a bit longer before we can get a feel for what Mars will do. And that's a good thing because Mars has always been an interesting place to live and learn about the planet and its inhabitants. What we don't know yet is how long Mars can stay in orbit. But we do have some good things to look out for. For one thing, Mars hasn't been completely destroyed yet. On the other hand, we haven't seen the impact of Mars on our own lives. As a result of all of this, I'm really excited to see how Mars' mission will play out in space. How will Mars react to this new technology? We have no idea yet -- but we'll see what happens when Mars decides to launch a new rover. At the moment, Curiosity's mission is very much in its infancy and will likely not be launched until at least the second half of next year, when the spacecraft is scheduled to return to its original mission. NASA is also looking into the possibility that Mars could launch an unmanned version of itself into space, using the same instruments as the original spacecraft. While the initial mission was to collect data from the Earth's surface, NASA has not yet decided whether or not it would be possible to use the data collected from Mars as a test for the new mission, or whether it should be deployed in other areas of space as part of a broader effort to find out more about what is going on in our solar system. To date, no one has commented on how successful Curiosity is in this area of science, other than the fact that its mission has become more and more successful. After all, what's the big deal with Mars? It's not just the technology that is being used to study the planets and their atmospheres -- it's also the people who are using it -- that are in charge of it. You can't just say, \"Well, that was a great experiment,\" but that doesn't mean that Curiosity isn't doing well, either. No one knows what will happen when it returns to Earth, even if it does. Even if Mars does launch the next mission on Sept. 11, 2018, in an attempt to explore the world's most famous planet, Earth will still be a mystery to most of humanity. Who knows? Maybe it won't be the last time we see Mars again. Or maybe it'll be just a few more years. Whatever the case may be, at the very least, this is something that will give us a better chance of success.

        "target": "Aging health: WHO call to action as world population over 60 set to double by 2050 In a new report on aging and health, the World Health Organization is calling for action on \"population aging,\" as figures suggest the number of people over 60 will reach two billion by 2050. People worldwide are living longer, says the World Health Organization in its World Report on Aging and Health. This is both good and bad. It gives us the chance to \"pursue new activities\" as we get older, such as in education and family life. But it all depends on our health. And for that the WHO says world governments need to act now to make sure our societies worldwide are ready. What are the take home facts from the World Health Organization's 2015 report on Aging and Health? The WHO says that in the next 35 years, the global number of people aged 60 years and over will almost double from 12 percent to 22 percent. By 2020, there will be more people over the age of 60 than 5 year olds. And a majority of older people (80 percent) will live in \"low and middle income\" countries. It's estimated that the world's population aged 60 years and older will total about 2 billion in 2050, which is more than twice as much as now. Furthermore, worldwide, about 125 million people are aged 80 years or older. But by 2050, it is expected that this number of people - aged 80 and over - will live in China alone. But I'm not old, so why should I care? Well, all this is happening at a faster rate than ever before. And the WHO says \"all countries face major challenges to ensure that their health and social systems are ready\" for this major demographic shift. It will cost a lot of money to improve health and social infrastructures, especially in more developed countries where traditional families structures have changed dramatically. Surely, there's \"no typical older person,\" though. How does the WHO define aging? We tend to think of older people as physically and mentally frail. But that's not necessarily the case, not everywhere in the world. Old is a relative concept - especially in middle income to rich countries. For instance, some 70 year olds are as fit as some 20 year olds. Just think how many older folk are at your gym, and ask yourself whether you can keep up with all of them. But that still doesn't explain aging. What is it exactly? The WHO says that at a biological level, \"aging results from the impact of the accumulation of a wide variety of molecular and cellular damage over time.\" Basically, this puts people at a higher risk of disease and, of course, death. But aging can also be associated with \"life transitions,\" such as retirement or witnessing other people, such as friends and family, die around you. This can affect you psychologically and sometimes, as a result, physically. What sort of diseases come with old age? Some of the most common non-fatal conditions include hearing loss, cataracts, back and neck pain and osteoarthritis. Other conditions include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - which affects the lungs - diabetes, depression, and dementia. What needs to be done? The WHO is proposing a five-step plan of action, which includes: Committing to healthy aging and \"evidence-based policies to strengthen the abilities of older persons.\" Aligning health systems with the needs of older populations Developing systems for providing long-term care Creating \"age-friendly cities and communities Improving measurement, monitoring and understanding of \"aging issues\" worldwide. But don't forget: \"a longer life brings with it opportunities, not only for older people and their families, but also for societies as a whole.\"",
        "generated_story": "WHO's Population Aging Plan: Actions Now Now The World Health Organization (WHO) has announced plans to reduce the number of people living in the developing world by 2050. The plan, which was announced on Thursday, is aimed at reducing the world's population by one-third by 2030. According to the WHO, the plan will be implemented by the end of the year, with the aim of reducing people's risk of developing chronic diseases by two-thirds by 2040. This is the first step in a long-term plan to tackle the problem of a rising population. \"We are going to take action now,\" said WHO Director-General Ban Ki-moon in an interview with The Associated Press. He added that the goal was \"to make sure that people are able to live longer and healthier lives.\" The WHO also said that it was working on a plan that would allow people to retire at the same time as they did when they were in their 20s and 30s. However, it is not clear how long this plan would take to implement, or how much longer it will take. In addition, there is still a lot of work to be done, and there are still many more years to go before the new plan is implemented. There is also the issue of how to deal with people who are already living longer than they should be. For example, if you have a family of five or more, you will have to do more than just take care of your own family. You will also be doing more to help your family and friends. That's why we are looking at this as an opportunity to make the most of our time and resources. We are also looking into how we can help our children and grandchildren. What do you think about this? What are your plans for the future? Do you see a way forward? Are you looking for solutions to this problem? If so, what will you do? There are several options. One is to develop a strategy that will allow you to adapt to a changing world. Another option would be to create a new generation of young people, such as women and children. If you are a woman or a man, then you can adapt your diet to meet the needs of those who need it most. And that's what we're doing right now. It's not just that we want to see more women, but also more men and more children, so that they can have more opportunities for self-sufficiency and better health. These are the options that are available to them. They are not only available for women but for men as well. I think we all know that women are more likely to have children than men, because they are older and they have less time to get married. But that doesn't mean that men can't be married and have kids. Women can also choose to stay married to men. So that means they don't need to choose between men or women. A third option is for them to become more active in order to maintain their own social status. As a result, they will no longer have the option of having to wait for their children to grow up. To do this, women must be willing to give up their jobs and become part of their families. At the moment, this is a very difficult task for many women to undertake, given that their bodies are aging at a rate that is far too fast for most women's bodies to cope with. How do we prepare for this change? How can we be prepared for it? Is it possible for us to prepare ourselves for a future in which we will not have our own children? The answer is, of course, no one knows for sure. Let's just say that if we do that, we won't have any children at all. Who knows, maybe one day we'll have one of these children who will become the next generation? We'll see what happens. Then, let's see how it all plays out over the coming years. Don't get me wrong, I'm not sure what the outcome of this year's WHO meeting will look like. My guess is that there will still be a few more people with children in this age group. Hopefully, these will all be well and healthy and well-educated and will make it easier for all of us. Right now, all the women in our age groups are getting older. Some of them are very young and the men are starting to look at themselves in terms of what they're going through. Why is this so important? Well, that depends on the situation in Africa. Is there any way that this can be achieved? I doubt it's a question of whether or not the people of Africa are becoming more educated and literate? But I do think that at least one thing is certain: the majority of women will start to understand what is going on in other countries. People of all races and ethnicities will decide for themselves whether they want a child to join the family or if they decide to leave the country and join a group of older people and then they'll decide what their country."

It is a reflection of his current inauspicious Formula One campaign that World Champion Michael Schumacher is only featuring in reports on this weekend's German Grand Prix at Hockenheim dues to his nationality. The home grown champion equaled his own record of 11 wins in a season at last year's race but this year he will be hoping to just get on the podium at the end. Schumi lies in third place some 34 points off the top spot and has a lot to do if he is to record his 85th career win. Ferrari's poor season to date is unlikely to get better with hopes dwindling that the 36-year-old will add to his sole victory of the season although the seven-time world champion characteristically refuses to rule it out. Schumi and Ferrari still in the fight \"Contrary to many other people's opinions, we have in no means written ourselves off, even though we have to admit that the situation has worsened recently, rather than improved,\" said the German, referring to the problems with this season's car. \"But that doesn't mean that it can't be improved again, and that's exactly what we're working on.\" The limelight is falling on two young pretenders to Schumacher's throne as Sunday's race approaches. The battle between McLaren's flying Finn Kimi Raikkonen and championship leader Renault's speedy Spaniard Fernando Alonso is diverting eyes from the world record holding German on his own turf. Kimi aims to keep heat on leader Alonso Raikkonen must finish the German Grand Prix for the first time in five attempts to close the gap on Alonso if he is to keep his own championship hopes alive. The Finn retired from last year's race because of a rear wing failure and this season has been plagued by technical problems which most recently cost him 10 places on the starting grid in each of the last two rounds. Despite those penalties for engine failure, the 25-year-old managed to finish second and third but he will have to increase his total of three race wins if he is to make a significant impression on the 26-point chasm that separates him from Alonso. \"The battle for the championship is still on and I am determined to get a good result and work on closing the gap,\" said the Finn. \"The (car) has good speed and we need to make the most of it this weekend.\" Montoya doing McLaren team mate no favors Raikkonen's car is obviously a fast one this season but he's not the only driver in a McLaren hot seat. Colombia's Juan Pablo Montoya is not to going to make way for his team mate while his own hopes of the title, however small, remain alive. \"I am really looking forward to racing again this weekend in Germany,\" said Montoya, who won at Hockenheim for Williams two years ago and got his first victory for McLaren in Britain two weeks ago. \"I enjoy racing at Hockenheim, I have performed well here and won in the past and I am aiming for a strong result like at Silverstone.\" Consistent Ferdy the man to beat at Hockenheim Championship leader Alonso, meanwhile, has been impressively consistent for Renault so far this season, winning five times and failing to score points only at the Canadian Grand Prix, where he crashed, and in Indianapolis. The Spaniard is setting the pace and the standard this season so, problems aside, Alonso will again be the man to beat at Hockenheim.",
        "generated_story": "Alonso and Raikkonen in the title battle at Hockenheim Formula One driver Fernando Alonso and his Ferrari team-mate Kimi Raikonen are battling for the German Grand Prix title. The two drivers are locked in a three-way battle to win the championship in Germany, with the Spaniard in pole position ahead of his compatriot and McLaren teammate, Ferrari's Nico H\u00fclkenberg. \"It's a battle between two very good drivers,\" Alonso told reporters after the Hungaroring on Sunday, adding that he was \"very happy\" with his car's handling and the way it was handling in qualifying. But it's also a fight between the two Ferrari drivers, who have a lot in common, and who will have to wait until the end of the season to see if they can pull off the feat. Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher, meanwhile, will be looking for his first victory since his retirement from the 2014 season after suffering a broken collarbone in his McLaren car at the Australian GP in July. Alonso, however, has yet to make it to the podium. He will now be racing for a fourth time in four years, after having won the last three races in which he has finished second and third, respectively, in both of those races. In his absence, Alonso has been relegated to a reserve driver role, while his teammate Juan Pablo Montoya has taken over as the team's technical director. Both drivers have struggled to get into the top 10 this season, although Alonso is the only one who has made it past the second round of qualifying and is now leading the points standings by a wide margin. Fernando has also been dropped from his position of vice-captain at Ferrari, where he is currently second to Alonso in terms of points with four races to go. That's not to say that Alonso's absence will not have an impact on the race, but it is to be expected that the pair will continue to work together in order to keep up with each other's pace and improve on last year's record-breaking pace. On the other hand, the Japanese driver is expected to stay on course for Sunday's grand prix, which will see him take on Williams' Carlos Sainz in Bahrain and Williams in Abu Dhabi. McLaren's Alonso will also be hoping to retain his title, having already clinched the world title with a win at Bahrain last weekend. His Ferrari teammate Kasey Kahne is also aiming to become the first driver to achieve that feat since Fernando retired in 2009, when he finished fourth in Formula 1. However, it will take a while before he can get back on track and he will need to do so again. It's unclear how much longer he'll be able to maintain his grip on his championship lead, as he's been struggling with an ankle injury that has kept him out of contention since the start of this year. And that's something he hasn't done in recent years. Last year, he missed out on a number of races because of a back injury suffered in an accident at his home country of Bahrain. This year he suffered a shoulder injury and was unable to qualify for Bahrain's F1 season finale in Malaysia. After suffering the same injury in Mexico in August, his season was marred by an engine problem that forced him to retire from racing in September. At the time of that accident, McLaren was still struggling to find a replacement driver for Alonso. Now, they are looking to add a new driver in Alonso to fill the gap left by the retiree. They are also looking at a possible replacement for Williams driver Carlos Fonseca. Facing Alonso at Barcelona next weekend, Hamilton and Alonso have already qualified for Germany's opening race in Barcelona, Spain, on Saturday. Hamilton has already secured a place in next season's championship with Ferrari and has a chance to take the lead in Spain's Formula 3 season-ending race against Williams. If Alonso can stay in contention, though, then he could be a strong contender for that position. Meanwhile, Fillon is hoping that Hamilton can continue his strong form in Hungary and take advantage of Hamilton's resurgence in Brazil. Williams is aiming for its first title since he retired from Formula Two in 2014. Raekonen, a former world champion, said he would like to compete with Alonso again in 2017. \u201cI think he\u2019ll be in good shape,\u201d Hamilton said, referring to his return to McLaren in 2015. Despite his injury, Williams has not yet made a decision on whether or not it would be possible to run Hamilton in 2018, despite the fact that his suspension is still in place. For Hamilton, there is a good chance of retaining his driver's title despite his lack of experience in front of him. Although Hamilton is not a regular starter, Raikel is likely to start his second season with McLaren, making his debut in Russia on Sept. 11. Expectations for Hamilton to finish in fourth place are high for Ferrari next year as well. Lewis Hamilton also has his sights set on Ferrari in Qatar next month"

She will share the prestigious award with US compatriot Oliver Williamson. The jury from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said the Americans' research had shown how \"economic analysis can shed light on most forms of social organization.\" Ostrom, a professor at Indiana University, was honored for her \"analysis of economic governance,\" especially in relation to the management of common property or property under common control. The political scientist's work challenges the widely accepted belief that common property is poorly managed and should be either regulated by central authorities or privatized, it added. She carried out numerous studies showing how self-organization and local-level management work to keep common resources viable. Her studies included both natural resources, such as forests, and artificial structures, for example police forces. Ostrom told Swedish television that she felt \"great surprise and appreciation\" and was \"in shock\" about being the first woman to win the prize. The pros and cons of big firms In his work, co-prizewinner Oliver Williamson, of University of California, Berkeley, examines why large corporations tend to arise - and why they do not - based on the cost and complexity of transactions, according to the Nobel committee. \"He has taught us to regard markets, firms, associations, agencies, and even households from the perspective of their contribution to the resolution of conflict,\" the jury said. Williamson authored 'The Economic Institutions of Capitalism' in 1975, a landmark text of the 'new institutional economics' movement that questioned the idea of firms as simple profit-making machines. Last but not least The Nobel prize for economics is the only Nobel award that was not created by the will of Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel in 1896. It was actually founded by the Swedish central bank, the Sverige Riksbank, to celebrate its tri-centenary a year earlier. It was awarded for the first time in 1969 under its official name: the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel. But although it was the last \"Nobel prize\" to be created and the last to be announced each year, the prize is not a poor relation in monetary terms. Winners of the awards for peace, literature, medicine, physiology, chemistry and physics all receive 10 million Swedish crowns (969,000 euros). A good year for women This year was a record year for women laureates. German-Romanian writer Herta Mueller won the Nobel Prize for Literature. Australian-American Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider of the United States were awarded the prize for medicine. And Ada Yonath of Israel was one of three scientists recognized for her work in chemistry. Americans more or less swept the board this year. Nine of the 11 laureates were US citizens. The most prominent of those was US President Barack Obama, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for his \"extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples.\" jg/AFP/dpa/Reuters Editor: Sam Edmonds",

The Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel has been awarded to the Swedish Nobel Laureate for his work in economic sciences in memory of Nobel Peace Prize winner Oliver Williamson. Author: Carol Greider The Swedish Academy of Sciences has announced the winner of the Sveriges Riksbank Prize for Economics, which is awarded annually to a Swedish woman who has made the most impact on the lives of millions of people in the United States and the world. In 1968, the award was given out to an American woman with a degree in economics from the University of California, Berkeley, and a doctorate in political science from Indiana University. Elinor, who was born in Sweden, was one of only two women to receive the prize in 1968. She was the only woman in history to have won it twice: in 1961 and in 1972. Both times, she was awarded a Nobel Prizes for her work on economic theory and her research on political economy. Her research was published in The Economic Institutions of Capitalism, a book about the economic institutions of capitalism that Williamson and Williamson co-authored. Williamson was a professor of economics at the university's economics department, where she taught for more than 30 years before becoming professor emerita of political sciences. He was also an alumnus of Stanford University in California. \"I think it's a great honor to be recognized for my work,\" Williamson told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation in an interview published on Sunday. Worthy of recognition, Williamson said he was \"very proud\" of his research and that he had been able to work with his colleagues at Stanford and Indiana to develop his own ideas on social and economic issues. However, he also said that it was important for him to make sure that his ideas were understood in a way that made them more accessible to people of all backgrounds, not just those who don't have the means to study the economics of a particular country, such as Sweden or the U.S. It's also important to recognize the work of women who have made a difference in society, because they have a lot to contribute to society. Nobel prizes for literature, history and economics have long been associated with women, but in recent years, women have become more influential in politics and politics. Women have been the main beneficiaries of these awards. For example, in 1964, Nobel laureate and Nobel winner Elizabeth Blackburn won the \"Nobel Prize\" in literature in recognition of her contributions to social science. But in her book, \"The Social Sciences,\" she said she had \"no idea\" that she would be awarded this prize. That's because she didn't know that Nobel laureates were men or that they were women. On the other hand, there are a number of men who are also men and women with degrees in social sciences, including a PhD in computer science and an economics degree. And there is also the fact that women are more likely than men to become Nobel winners in their fields of study in order to get a better understanding of how the economy works and how it works. This year's prize is named after Nobel peace prize winner, author and political scientist Elina Demirjian (1939-2010), who died in 2006. According to her obituary on her website, her name is \"Oliver Williamson\" and she is a member of \"the Nobel Committee for the Study of Economic Literature.\" \"It's an honor that I'm very proud of,\" said Williamson, adding that \"it's something I've always wanted to do for myself and my family.\" Williamson's book is based on his life experiences and his experiences as an economist and professor at a university in Stockholm, Sweden. His book was translated into English and published by the German-language journal \"Economics and Economics.\" The book's title is translated as \"Economic Sciences, History and Philosophy.\" It was written by Williamson himself and was first translated to English by his biographer, Herta Mueller, as well as in German and Romanian. Since then, it has become a popular topic in academic circles, particularly in Germany, Austria, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Romania and Romania. While Williamson has won numerous awards in other countries, his most recent achievement was in his native country of Romania, Turkey, Greece and Italy. A new book on economics is due out next year in 2015. At the end of this month's Nobel Literature Prize ceremony in Berlin, an award ceremony will be held on Monday, May 14. Authors and journalists from around the globe are invited to attend the ceremony. Read more: The most influential women in business, politics, economics, business and culture are the ones who will receive this award. They will also be honored by a ceremony on Thursday, April 19, to mark the 50th anniversary of Adolf Hitler's death in Munich, Germany.

        "target": "The Sun Sets Slowly Over Brandenburg's Tropical Dream Having suffered many disappointments concerning publically funded projects, the state of Brandenburg hoped a tropical leisure center would offer a ray of hope. Instead the ailing concern is just bringing more gloom. The economically depressed eastern German state of Brandenburg has seen its fair share of bitter experiences when it comes to huge public investment projects since German unification in 1990. Against this background, state authorities were pleased when Malaysian businessman Colin Au built a huge tropical-feeling leisure center in Brandenburg without any subsidies. The center, which opened about a year ago, was to become a symbol of economic success in a region where unemployment still hovers around the 20 percent mark. But the leisure time park, which has already swallowed a little under 100 million euros ($120 million) in private investment, is now going to have to depend on public funding to avoid another economic fiasco in Brandenburg. State authorities in Brandenburg haven't been too successful in their public investment policy in the past 10 years, to put it mildly. A grand plan to build one of the world's most modern chip-producing factories there burst like a bubble in 2003. The much-talked about Brandenburg-Berlin International airport still seems light years away from being built. Line of failures looked to be ended by Au's vision Another beacon of economic hope disappeared in 2002 when a company planning to build gas-filled transport airships went bust despite considerable subsidies. But Au's vision for the abandoned dome which the airship company needed as a hangar offered Brandenburg another chance. In the middle of nowhere, he created what he named his \"Tropical Islands\" wonderland, sporting everything from sandy beaches, lakes and a Laguna to a Caribbean-style village. The economics ministry in Brandenburg was over the moon to see Au originally agreeing to build the facility without any state subsidies. And Au himself had no doubt at the time that he could well do without them. Overestimated visitor numbers tell sorry story But the center's first year in operation tells a different story. Colin Au, who has meanwhile left Brandenburg and transferred matters to a German management company, had expected some 1.5 million visitors to come to Tropical Islands within the first year, but only some 950,000 will have turned up by the end of 2005. It seems highly unlikely that visitor numbers will increase considerably in future, placing a question mark on the viability of the whole centre. But Brandenburg's economics ministry is certain that the park will be in the black as of 2008. To make the place more attractive, it has agreed to shell out 15 million euros in subsidies for yet another reconstruction and marketing effort. After all, the leisure time center has a workforce of about 500 and is thus the biggest employer in an otherwise depressed region marked by a high jobless rate. Tropical center down but not out...not yet \"We hope the money will help make the Tropical Islands resort better known throughout Europe according to the new marketing concept hammered out the management,\" ministry spokesman Steffen Kammrath said. \"This leisure time center is unique and has to be marketed as such. What you have there is a tropical and water world 12 months a year with a lot of attractive offers to spend a whale of a time there.\" Some commentators believe that state subsidies may prolong the center's life span, but will not be able to avoid its demise in the long run. But the idea of also making it more attractive for tourists from all over Europe seems unrealistic to them if the resort's management can't even get enough visitors from home to ensure a profitable operation.",
        "generated_story": "The Sun Sets Slowly Over Brandenburg's Tropical Islands Resort The sun sets slowly over the tropical islands in the German resort of Tropical Island. The temperature is expected to rise gradually this week, with temperatures reaching the mid-80s Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) and the sun setting slowly on the Pacific Ocean. In the early hours of Wednesday, the temperature was forecast to reach the high 90s, according to a forecast by the meteorological institute Kammrath. \"The sun is going to be very hot today,\" said the 57-year-old, who was born in Germany and grew up in Malaysia. His father, Colin Au, worked at the resort as a foreman, and his mother was a nurse. He worked as an electrician and was able to get the job done in just a few hours, he said, adding that he was \"very pleased\" with the results. However, it was not enough to convince him that his father was right to let him stay in his home state, where he had been living for more than 30 years. A spokesman for the state's tourism department told the AFP news agency that the forecast was for temperatures to drop to the low 80s on Thursday, but that it would not be too hot for him to stay on his own. An official statement from the tourism office said that \"the forecast is for a very warm and sunny day\" and that there would be \"no snowfall.\" The forecast also called for high temperatures and low humidity throughout the week. There was also a slight chance of rain on Friday, as temperatures rose to near 90 degrees Celsius. This is the first time in a long time that temperatures have dropped below the freezing mark. Temperatures have been steadily rising since the beginning of the year, when temperatures dropped to around 80 degrees C (102 degrees F) in some parts of Germany. That's a significant drop in temperatures, compared to last year's high of around 85 degrees, which was the highest temperature in Europe. But it's not just the heat that is affecting the weather. It's also the humidity that's making it difficult to sleep at night. On Thursday morning, temperatures were forecast at around 70 degrees (38 Celsius) with winds of up to 60 degrees. At the same time, there was an increase in wind gusts to 40 kilometers per hour (25 miles) across the Gulf of Aden. Some of this is due to high winds, while others is caused by a lack of sun. As a result, many people are sleeping in their cars or on their roofs. Many of them are not aware that they're sleeping at all. They have to wake up at 6:30 a.m. (0930 UTC, dpa, AP, AFP)"

        "target": "Bayern's Klinsmann Praises, Hoeness Attacks Hoffenheim The Bundesliga's two top teams don't play until Friday, but the mind games are already underway. Bayern's coach Juergen Klinsmann says Hoffenheim are legitimate contenders, but commercial manager Uli Hoeness disagrees. When the Bundesliga scheduled Bayern's home match against Hoffenheim in the league's unloved Friday night slot, they probably didn't imagine that it would turn out to be the match of the first half of the season. Indeed, few experts or fans thought that Hoffenheim, a first-division debutante located in a southern German village with 3,000 inhabitants, would give mighty Munich a run for its money. But it's the first week of December, and Hoffenheim top the table by three points. They also have a much better goal difference than their second-placed rivals -- and that has drawn praise from Bayern's coach, Juergen Klinsmann. \"I have the highest estimation of Hoffenheim because they've built the squad very ambitiously, rationally and with very good players,\" Klinsmann told DPA news agency. \"They can be proud of that.\" Klinsmann said he thought that the club could establish itself among the top three or four sides in Germany in the years to come and qualify for international competition next season. He also had words of praise for Hoffenheim's software billionaire patron, Dietmar Hopp, whose money has funded the club's ascent. \"There's nothing negative about it,\" Klinsmann said. \"He used to play for the club, is a soccer man through and through and helped the team get on its feet.\" Some fans have criticized Hopp and Hoffenheim for paying inflating salaries and luring talent away from other clubs instead of developing homegrown players. In fact, Hoffenheim's official salary budget is about average for the Bundesliga. Hoeness sounds his horn But while Bayern's coach was praising his opponents to the skies, Munich's commercial manager Uli Hoeness has been trying to play with their heads. On the heels of Bayern's convincing win over Leverkusen last weekend, Hoeness is back to taunting rivals. \"The performance we showed in the second half against Leverkusen will be enough against Hoffenheim,\" Hoeness told the German soccer magazine kicker. Hoeness also dropped a none-too-thinly-veiled hint that Hoffenheim's personnel expenditures were far higher than the officially released figures and scoffed at the idea that strategy would determine the outcome of Friday's match. \"Games are decided by the better players, not by tactics,\" Hoeness said. \"And of course, we've got better players than Hoffenheim.\" But that particular verbal attack may represent some wishful thinking of the manager's part. Hoffenheim coach Ralf Rangnick is one of only two current Bundesliga skippers with a winning record against Munich. Rangnick, whose team cruised past Bielefeld last weekend to keep Bayern three points back, reacted to Hoeness' remarks with a shrug. \"We're preparing for Munich exactly the same way we did against Bielefeld,\" Rangnick said. In any case, soccer fans in Germany know what they'll be doing Friday evening -- finding a bar with cable sports television to watch a top match that no one, before the start of the season, would have considered possible.",
        "generated_story": "Hoffenheim's Commercial Manager Reacts to the First Half of the Bundesliga Season The club's commercial manager, Uli Hoeness, has spoken out about the first half of this season's Bundesliga season. \"We are in a very difficult situation right now,\" he said on Tuesday. Hoffenheimer, who have been in the top flight since the end of last season, have had to deal with a lot of criticism over the past few weeks. The Bundesliga's top-flight club has been struggling to cope with the influx of new players and a new coach, Ralf Rangnick, is the latest to speak out on the matter. He said the club was \"in a tough situation\" and that he was looking forward to a \"very difficult\" season ahead. In his first season as head coach of a Bundesliga club, Hoffenerheim has had a difficult time finding the right balance between success and failure. On Tuesday, the team announced that they would no longer be able to afford to bring in players who are not fit to play for the national team. They will instead have to rely on a coach who is fit and ready to take on new challenges, such as the likes of J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann and the coaching staff of Leverkusen. A new manager is also expected to be brought in to fill the void left by the departure of former Bayern Munich coach Rudi Klaasen, whose contract was terminated in July. K\u00fcnstler, however, said he would stick to his plans to stay in charge of his side until the summer, when he hopes to return to full fitness in time for next year's World Cup qualifier against Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach at the same time as he prepares to make his debut in Germany. Last year, he managed to get the job done, but this time around he has to work hard to keep his head above water. That's not to say he doesn't have his work cut out for him, though, because he does have a job to do. At the moment, his main focus is on his team-mates and to help them get back on track after a disappointing season in which they failed to reach the Champions League final last year. But he also wants to give his players a chance to prove themselves in front of goal, which is something he's been working on for a long time. After all, it's only a matter of time before he'll be back in his old role as a player and coach. And that's something that will be very important to him as well as his ability to motivate and motivate the players. So far, so good, in fact, that is what he is doing. It's good to have him back, and I'm happy to see him working hard on that. I can't say enough good things about him. We'll see how long he can stay on top of things. If he stays healthy, I think he will stay focused on being a good coach and helping his squad to win the league. Otherwise, we're going to miss him out. There's no chance of him getting back into the starting line-up. What do you think? I don't know. Maybe he won't even know what to think about that? He's got a bit of an opinion on it. You know, maybe he wouldn't be surprised if he didn't win a few games. Who knows? Maybe it would be interesting to find out? But I doubt he'd be interested in playing for his club again. How long will it take him to decide? If not now, then when will he start playing again? That depends on how much time he gets to spend with his new team? \"I'm not sure,\" the coach said, adding that it will depend on whether he decides to sign a contract extension or not. 'I think I'll stick with my old club.' \"It's a great opportunity for me to try and get a better deal out of my team,\" added the Bayern boss. However, there's also the question of whether the player will stick around for long enough, as long as I stay healthy and fit. This is a big question mark in terms of how well the squad is performing. For the most part, they're doing very well in training and playing well. As a result of that, you can see that we've got some good players in our squad. Hopefully, this will help us get through the next few months and we'll have an answer to that question.\" The Bayern coach has already made it clear that there are no plans in place to start the new season at all. His team is still in good shape, after all the injuries and suspensions have already been dealt a blow to their squad and he knows what's in store for them. With the exception of one player who was injured in last week's match against Werder Bremen and another who has not played for Bayern, Bayern will still be in contention for another Bundesliga spot next season and if they can keep their top spot in"

        "target": "Automation in the dairy cow industry A small but nevertheless important sector of the German economy today is agriculture. Although the number of farms has declined over the decades, production has actually increased -- especially at dairy farms. Modern automation technology and robotics are helping to keep both cows and farmers happy, but at the cost of jobs.",
        "generated_story": "Automation in the Dairy Cow Industry In Germany, the dairy cow industry is booming. Automation is one of the main reasons why the country's dairy industry has been booming in recent years. Dairy cow production is growing at a rapid pace. In the past few years, dairy cows have been producing milk for a quarter of a billion euros ($1.6 billion) a year. Now, milk cows are producing more milk than any other animal in Germany. This is due in large part to the rise in milk production and the increasing demand for dairy products. However, there is still a lot of work to be done in order to achieve this goal. \"We have to make sure that we are doing everything we can to ensure that milk is produced in a way that is sustainable and efficient,\" said Dieter K\u00fcbler, a professor of agricultural science at the University of Bonn. The new technology is expected to revolutionize the milk industry by the end of this year, he said, adding that it would be a \"huge step forward\" in achieving the goal of making milk more nutritious and more environmentally friendly. It is also expected that the technology will be used in other areas of dairy production, such as meat processing, as well as in animal feed production. There are currently no plans to introduce automated cow slaughter machines in Europe, but the idea is that this will help to reduce the number of cows slaughtered each year and also help in reducing the amount of milk that goes into a cow's milk. Kuebler said that in addition to this, it will also be possible to develop new technologies that will make milk less expensive and easier to produce. He also pointed out that, for example, beef is the most expensive dairy product to manufacture, and that meat is more expensive than milk in many other countries. That's why he believes that dairy farmers should be able to sell their milk directly to their customers, rather than relying on a third party to do the work. But he also thinks that there are other factors that can contribute to that. For instance, when it comes to dairy milk products, this is not the case with cow milk, which is made from milk grown in China. And it's not just cows that are being slaughtered, either, because they are not producing enough milk to meet the needs of their consumers. They are also producing less milk and are therefore less efficient. So, what do you think about this? Do you have any idea what the future holds for milk? I don't think so. I think the answer is quite clear. We are going to try to find out. If we do, we will see what happens. Then we'll see how it all plays out over the next few months. What do we have in store for the market? We have a very good idea of what we want to see in terms of how milk will look like in future. How will milk be made? What will we make of it? The answer will depend on how much milk we produce and how we use it. You can't just buy milk from a dairy farm, you can only buy it from the supermarket or the grocery store, or from an online store. These are the things that make up the vast majority of people's diets. When you combine milk with cheese, cheese and meat, then you get a whole range of different cheeses and vegetables. All of these things are made up of very different ingredients, so it is very difficult to differentiate between the different types of cheese that you eat and those made by different people. One thing is for sure: milk isn't the same as cheese. Another thing that's for certain: it doesn't taste as good as butter and butter. Also, if you are a milk cow, that means you're not eating the cheese from your cow. Don't you know that? You know what I'm talking about? Well, I have no idea. Maybe you do know something about milk or cheese? Then I'll tell you what you need to know about dairy in general. Let's see if there's a solution for this problem. Is milk really the best solution? If not, let's talk about it in detail. Do we really have an answer for that question? Let me know. Can you tell me what's on your mind? Tell me about your opinion on this topic? Is it something you'd like to talk to your mother? Or is there something that makes you feel bad about the situation in your home country? Who knows? And what would you say? That you would say that your mom is a good mother and your dad is an expert in dairy farming? It's very important to me to tell my mother that she's the mother of three children. She's an excellent mother, too. My mother has always been a great cook and she'd be very happy with the way she grew up and raised her own family. As a result, she was very interested in making sure she knows what to expect from me. Her mother was the first person to come up with a recipe that I would"

        "target": "Inching towards direct talks on Syria They came to hold talks, but started negotiations with mutual affronts. But if there is one person who might be able to mediate between the intransigent Syrian conflict parties, it's Lakhdar Brahimi. Lakhdar Brahimi, the United Nations special envoy for Syria, seemed very tired on Friday (24.01.2014). He had had a long day, which was actually supposed to be the first real day of negotiations at the Syria Conference in Geneva. \"Good afternoon,\" Brahimi told the assembled international press, before adding, \"or good evening, I don't know.\" At the Palais des Nations in Geneva, he presented the most important result of his attempts to mediate between the Syrian government and the opposition to the more than 250 journalists who had managed to get a coveted place at the press conference: \"Tomorrow we expect and we have agreed that we will meet in the same room.\" What Brahimi is declaring an achievement doesn't sound like much, but considering how irreconcilable the conflict parties have been, even that can be seen as a small success. Separate talks with Brahimi The two delegations were actually due to meet on the first day of negotiations in Geneva in order to agree on a timetable and on the subject and agenda of the talks. But emotions are running too high on both sides. Instead both delegations held separate talks with Lahkkdar Brahimi, both lasting just about an hour each In the morning. The Syrian government delegation had apparently been threatening to leave the conference. At least that is what the deputy foreign minister Faisal Mekdad had implied. \"We are here to start the negotiations,\" he told waiting journalists, \"but we found that the other party did not want to come.\" Before the conference, the opposition had explained that for its delegation, the formation of a transition government would be a central tenet of the negotiations. They emphasized that this topic should be discussed right at the beginning of talks and that the establishment of such a body should be initiated without delay. Social media and good old propaganda The representatives of the Syrian National Coalition that were present in Geneva neatly used all imaginable channels to make their views public. At #Geneva2, they tweeted: \"Forming a transitional body is our major priority,\" leaving people in no doubt that the Syrian National Council would not want to include Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Assad's government, on the other hand, is relying on classic propaganda and loyal state media representatives in Geneva. An impressive entourage of dominant journalists from state-run media outlets is constantly at hand, accompanying the government delegation and making sure they get their point across at press conferences. Lakhdar Brahimi even had a small altercation with a journalist from a Syrian state news agency, who made a political statement under the pretense of asking the UN mediator a question. \"Are there any signs that Saudi Arabia, Turkey and other countries would stop the support of terrorism in Syria?,\" she asked in somewhat shaky English, before Brahimi interrupted her. \"Please, please, there is no point in asking such questions!\" Such exchanges hint at the type of negotiating style the experienced diplomat and mediator Brahimi must have behind the scenes. 'Wish us luck' Lakhdar Brahimi described the preliminary talks that took place in Geneva as encouraging and asked for patience. He said that because the peace conference had come about at the last minute and the delegations had therefore only been appointed very recently, there hadn't been enough time to hold preliminary discussions - a task that the delegations were now catching up on. \"We never expected it to be easy and I'm sure it's not going to be,\" he said. \"But I think the two parties understand what is at stake. Their country is in very, very bad shape.\" He added: \"The huge ambition of this process is to save Syria. Nothing less than that.\" After appealing to the willingness of both parties to negotiate, he simply added: \"So wish us luck!\" Fight for freedom As the official delegations held talks with UN mediator Brahimi in the Palais des Nations, the European headquarters of the United Nations, hundreds of Syrian expatriates who had come from all over Europe protested outside, forming a sea of red, white and black Syrian flags on the Place des Nations. With their presence outside the UN gates they wanted to show that despite all the government propaganda, the Syrian National coalition has a lot of support from the Syrian people. Thirty-two-year-old Ziad Malki came to Geneva from Zurich to show his solidarity. Ziad knows how it feels to be deprived of his freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. In 2005, he was arrested at a demonstration in Damascus and says he was tortured during his time in prison. Now he is fighting for a new Syria from outside the country's borders. Ziad is sure that with Bashar al-Assad and his family, there will be nothing new. \"We don't want this man to be in",
        "generated_story": "Mediating with the Syrian National Coalition in Geneva UN mediator Lahkkdar Brahimi has met with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to discuss the situation in the country. The Syrian opposition leader has been meeting with his Syrian counterpart, Faisal Mekdad, at the Palais des Nations in Switzerland. \"The Syrian regime is on the brink of collapse,\" said the UN envoy to the conflict in Syria, who is also on his way to Geneva to meet with representatives of the opposition. He is due to arrive on Thursday to hold talks with Assad's government in a bid to end the violence. On Thursday, the two sides agreed on a ceasefire, which would allow Assad to stay in power for as long as he wants. But the ceasefire is not yet in place, according to a statement from the government of Syria's deputy foreign minister. It is still unclear how long the truce will last, but it is expected to last until at least the end of this month. In the meantime, there is a chance that Assad will be able to return to power, and that he will not be forced out of power by the international community. At the same time, he has to deal with a growing number of defectors, many of whom have fled their homes and are seeking refuge in other countries, including Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey and the United States. Some of them have been living in exile, while others have returned to their home countries. Most of these defections stem from a lack of support from his regime in Damascus, where he is believed to be the leader of a rebel group that controls large swathes of territory. This is the first time that a Syrian government official has visited Damascus since the war broke out in 2011, when the regime was forced to flee its capital, Aleppo, for the safety of its own people. Since then, however, it has become increasingly difficult to reach those who are willing to give up their lives to fight for their own interests. For example, in 2012, a group of Syrian rebels called the \"Islamic State\" (IS) took over the city of Aleppo after the US withdrew its troops from Syria in February 2011. That group, known as the Free Syrian Army (FSA), is now the largest rebel faction in Syrian history, with more than 1.5 million fighters fighting alongside the IS. According to UN sources, this group has around 1,500 fighters and around 2,000 civilians. However, most of those fighters are not fighters. They are civilians and they do not have access to weapons or weapons of mass destruction. There is no evidence that they are armed or trained to carry out attacks. Instead, they have to rely on armed groups, such as Hezbollah, to provide them with weapons and ammunition. These groups have a strong presence in areas where they need them most. As a result, these groups are more likely to take part in attacks on civilians, particularly in rural areas and in urban areas. What is more important is that the fighting in Aleppo is being carried out by a coalition of rebel groups that are fighting against the Assad regime, rather than by government forces. If the rebels are to win, then they will need to make sure they don't get killed by Assad. So far, so good. And that is what we have seen so far. We have also seen a lot of progress on this front. You can see the progress made in recent weeks. I think we are going to see more and more people come together and we will see how things turn out. One thing is for sure: the fight against terrorism will continue to get stronger and stronger as we get closer to our goal of ending this conflict. Let's see what happens next, shall we say? What do you think about this? Do you agree with me on that? Is it a good idea to go to Syria and talk to your friends and family? Can you tell me what you would like to hear from them? Tell me about your views? Let me know what your thoughts are on Syria? I would love to know. Thank you so much for your time and your support. Good luck! I hope you all are doing well in your work and you're doing a great job. Thanks for all your hard work. Peace, peace and stability, I'm sure you'll be happy to contribute to this effort.

        "target": "Italy's navy to patrol with Libyan ships to curb human trafficking Italy wants to work more closely with Libya to limit the number of sea crossings by migrants and potential asylum seekers. But what are the consequences? Italy's prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni, does not want to wait any longer for EU countries to show solidarity in distributing asylum seekers throughout the bloc. On Thursday he announced in Rome that the Italian navy would be patrolling with Libyan ships just off the Libyan coastline. The aim, Gentiloni says, is to curb human trafficking and bring migrants back from the smugglers' boats to Libya. According to the Italian government's figures, 93,000 migrants have arrived in Italy so far this year. At least 2,000 have drowned in the attempt to cross the Mediterranean - the true figure is unknown. Italy has already threatened to stop allowing boats carrying rescued migrants to dock in Italian ports, or that it may issue migrants with documents that would allow them to travel on to other European countries. Rome has not yet implemented either policy, but the government has made clear that Italy will soon run out of options. The EU Commissioner for Migration Dimitris Avramopoulos acknowledged, again, in Brussels on Thursday that \"Europe continues to face high migratory pressures. And Italy more than (almost) any others.\" The European Commission issued a letter offering more aid and personnel to help manage migration better. Accommodation will soon be full The office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, wrote at the beginning of July that \"Close to 200,000 accommodation places are available for refugees and migrants across [Italy], but are nearly all full.\" The High Commissioner referred particularly to the numbers of people dying when he warned, \"What is happening in front of our eyes in Italy is an unfolding tragedy.\" The United Nations anticipates that another 100,000 migrants will come to Italy via Libya before the end of this year. The number of arrivals is already 20 percent higher than last year; and the number of dead, those who could not be saved, would rise accordingly. According to UN estimates, the Mediterranean remains the \"deadliest\" refugee route in the world. Italian government statistics say that around 600,000 people have arrived in Italian ports since the start of the crisis in 2014. It is unclear how many have since traveled on to Austria, France or Switzerland. Once migrants are registered in Italy and accommodated in camps, they are not held there. If, however, they leave the accommodation without giving notice, they forfeit their claim to subsistence and social services. Most of the migrants are from African countries, and many try to travel on to France, for example. 300 people are currently sleeping on the beach in Ventimiglia, on the French border, hoping to take a bus or train to France. However, the border is being policed by French officials. Migrants who are caught are sent back to Italy. Austria has announced that it too will close its border with Italy if the number of migrants starts to rise. Repatriation and distribution are difficult Last year 120,000 new asylum applications were made in Italy. Around 50 percent of these are rejected. The asylum seekers are then supposed to leave the country. However, the process of people either returning voluntarily or being deported is very slow. The interior ministry has therefore announced that it will reinforce repatriation programs. The redistribution of asylum seekers from Italy, as agreed by the European Union, is well behind target. Two years ago the aim was to resettle 120,000 people. So far, only 24,676 people have been redistributed, the EU Commission said on Thursday: 7,873 from Italy, and 16,803 from Greece. The numbers are low not just because of the reluctance of other EU countries to take the refugees in, but also because of Italian delays in the registration of possible candidates. Asylum seekers from Eritrea are the most likely to fulfill the criteria for redistribution. Around 25,000 are currently living in Italy, but only 10,000 have been registered with the EU Commission and the European Asylum Support Office as possible candidates. Migration Commissioner Avramopoulos has announced that Italy will be given more help and logistical support in this area.",

The crisis has been exacerbated by the influx of refugees from the Middle East and North Africa, according to a report in The New York Times.

He added that a \"serious crisis\" was emerging in Italy, with migrants fleeing conflict and persecution in Syria, Iraq, Libya and Somalia fleeing persecution and violence in their own countries.

Follow all the action with Deutsche Welle.",
        "generated_story": "Germany is hosting the FIFA Women's World Cup in 2011. It's the first time Germany has hosted a women's football tournament since the 1990s. Germany is the only country in the world to have hosted the event. The country is set to host the 2011 edition of the tournament, which will be held in Berlin, Germany's capital. \"We are very excited about this year's tournament,\" German media said in a report published on Sunday, adding that the country would be \"very proud\" of its participation. In addition to the competition, the German women will also be able to showcase their talents at the same time as their male counterparts in other major tournaments, such as the 2010 World Cups in France, Spain, Italy and the United States. There is also a chance that Germany could be the host nation for the 2012 edition, according to German newspaper Deutsche Welle. According to DW, there is a \"strong possibility\" that a German team could take part in an international competition. However, it is not yet clear whether Germany will have the opportunity to compete at a major international level, or whether it will take place at an individual level. DW: \"I think we are going to be very proud of Germany. We are looking forward to hosting a tournament that is very different from what we have been doing in recent years,\" DW quoted a source as saying. German officials have said they will not be making any changes to their plans. They have also said that they are not planning to introduce a gender-neutral gender neutral gender classification system in order to allow women to play for a greater percentage of their national team. This would mean that, for example, they would have to choose between a male and a female team, rather than a team of two or three, as is currently the case with the men's squad. That is, if the women are allowed to wear a white jersey and have a red scarf on their head, then they can wear the red jersey. But that doesn't mean they won't be wearing red and white, because they do have red, white and black jerseys. And that's not just for Germany, but for other countries as well, too. Women are also expected to show up in many other sports, including soccer, tennis, gymnastics, basketball, volleyball, soccer and more. What's more, women can also wear red or black, and that means that their hair can be combed and their eyes can see their faces. So, what do you think about that? What does that say about the future of women in sports? The answer is that there are a lot of things that can change. For one thing, I think the most important thing is how we can improve our image as a country. I don't think there's anything wrong with having a good image of ourselves as an athlete or a person who can compete with us on the field. How can I improve my image? That's a big question for me. Do I look at myself as someone who has a positive image in my mind? I'm not a woman who thinks that I can do anything for myself? How do I make myself look good? Who am I to say I am not good at something? Do you have any idea? Is that something I should be doing? Can I be a part of something that makes me feel good about myself or do something for my team? If so, how will I feel about my performance in this competition? There's no way to know for sure. You can't just say, 'I'm a professional athlete and I have nothing to do with this,' but I do know that my goal is to win a medal. If I win the gold medal I'll be happy to take home the silver medal and go on to represent my country and compete in some other competitions. As a result, my expectations are quite high. My expectations for this tournament are pretty high, so I hope that we will do well at all the tournaments I've been involved in so far. After all, this is my first tournament in Germany and it has been a long time since I was a member of a sports team that won the national championship. Let's be honest, right? You know what I mean? Well, let me tell you what's going on in your life right now? Let me give you a little bit of advice on how to improve your image and make sure that you're doing the right thing for your team and your country? Tell me what you want to see?

Many others were wounded when the float they were traveling on made contact with a power line. Officials in Port-au-Prince said the accident occurred as thousands of revelers filled the streets of the city center of the Haitian capital in the early hours of Tuesday. The Associated Press quoted witnesses at the scene who reported seeing somebody on one of the floats used a stick or pole to move a power line so that the vehicle could pass under it. Reuters cited a witness who reported seeing the head of a singer from the hip-hop band Barikad Crew make contact with the power line. Some of the victims were electrocuted instantly, while others jumped off the float, causing panic among the revelers who lined the street. Many of the at least 18 deaths came as a result of the ensuing panic, while at more than 40 others were injured, according to local authorities. There was some confusion about the number of fatalities, with the Associated Press putting it at 20, and AFP later reported that only around 10 had died. Haitian President Michel Martelly used his Twitter account to express his condolences to the injured and bereaved. \"My sincere sympathies to the victims of the serious incident that occurred this morning at the Champ de Mars (area in downtown Port-au-Prince),\" the president said. pfd/rc (AP, Reuters, AFP)",
        "generated_story": "Haiti Carnival mishap At least 18 people killed, 18 injured as Carnival disaster hits Haiti Haiti's capital Port-au-Prince has been hit by a Carnival shipwreck, officials said Wednesday. The cruise ship, the Champ de Mars, was carrying more than 1,000 people from Haiti to neighboring countries. Haiti is one of the poorest countries in the world, according to a report by the AFP news agency, adding that at least 17 people were killed and 18 others injured in Sunday's disaster. Haitian authorities said they were investigating the incident, which they said was the result of an explosion and fire at the shipyard. \"We are still trying to establish the exact cause of this disaster,\" a local official told AFP, referring to the accident that occurred on Sunday. A total of 18 deaths have been reported so far this year in Haiti, with the death toll expected to rise as the Carnival season approaches. More than 2,500 people are believed to have died in Friday's accident, a government official said. Authorities said the cause was a \"technical problem\" and that it was not immediately clear how much damage was caused. There were no immediate reports of injuries or fatalities. However, local media reported that a number of people had been injured, including a woman and a man, who were hospitalized in critical condition after being found dead in a car crash on Saturday. Police have said that the crash occurred in an area of about 1.5 square kilometers (1.4 square miles) near the Haitian capital, where Carnival is held. According to local news reports, some of those injured were in wheelchairs, while others had to be transported to hospitals. Local officials have blamed the disaster on a lack of proper medical care for the injured. They have not said how many people died, but they have expressed concern about the safety of Carnival ships and how they are being used. In a statement, Haitian Prime Minister Michel Martelly said he was \"deeply saddened\" by what he described as an \"isolated incident.\" \"I am deeply saddened by this tragedy,\" he added, saying that he and his family were not aware of what was going on. He added that \"it is a tragedy that we have to deal with and we are going to do everything we can to make sure that this is not something that is happening again.\" The government has said it will continue to monitor the situation and will provide information on how to respond if it is found that something like this happens again. It is unclear how long the cruise ships will stay in port and whether they will be able to return to port. On the other hand, there is the possibility that they could be used as a launching pad for a new Carnival cruise that will take place later this month. At the same time, authorities are also concerned about a possible terrorist attack that could lead to an increase in attacks on security forces and civilians. Several people have also been killed in recent days in what they believe is an attempt to cover-up a deadly attack on police officers and other security personnel. An investigation is under way into the circumstances surrounding the attack, and police are working to determine whether or not the attackers were responsible."

        "target": "Is China seeking regime-change in North Korea? The sudden reduction in aggressive rhetoric and actions by North Korea has led to suggestions that Pyongyang has realized it has pushed its only ally in the region to the brink of severing its friendship. The announcement in Pyongyang on May 13 of the promotion of Jang Jong-nam to \"minister of the People's Armed Forces\" came out of the blue. Until recently, the little-known commander of an army corps in coastal Kangwon Province, Jang has replaced Kim Kyok-sik, a four-star general with a long track record of loyal service to the regime. The reasons for 70-year-old Kim's replacement are not clear - as with most of the political maneuvers in North Korea - but it may have been his loyalty that cost him his position in the politburo. Kim was widely seen as a hawk in the regime and is believed to have been in command of the operation to shell the South Korean island of Yeonpyeongdo in November 2010, an incident that killed four people, destroyed civilians' homes and infrastructure and dramatically worsened the already strained relationship between Pyongyang and Seoul. By sacrificing Kim, analysts believe, North Korea is signaling that it is backing away from the confrontational stance it adopted after the United Nations imposed new sanctions in the wake of the nation's third underground nuclear test in February. And there are other indicators that Pyongyang is seeking to return to the status quo. The North's troops have been permitted to step down from the highest state of preparedness for war that was initially ordered when South Korea and the US began a series of annual military exercises. Missiles withdrawn Similarly, two Musudan intermediate-range missiles that were identified as being on mobile launchers being operated in eastern areas of the country have apparently been ordered to return to base. In late April, there was concern that test-launches of the missiles would be a further escalation by Kim Jong-un's government and a message that it would not bow to international pressure to halt its nuclear and missile development programs. But the analysts believe the tokens of Pyongyang's goodwill have come too late. \"For the North Korean leader, this is a very difficult time,\" Toshimitsu Shigemura, a professor at Tokyo's Waseda University and an authority on North Korean affairs, told DW. \"Timing is very important here and it is possible that China is moving to abandon Kim Jong-un. The atmosphere between the two nations is changing. China may have decided that it is time for a regime-change in the North, they will not permit the collapse of the country because they do not want chaos on their own borders.\" Further evidence that Beijing is slowly tightening the screw on its erstwhile ally comes as more state-run financial institutions sever their links with banks in North Korea. The latest institution to adhere to the government's orders to halt transactions across the border is the Bank of China, one of the four major banks in the country, which announced on May 7 that it would cease dealings with the Foreign Trade Bank of North Korea, which has been identified as being involved in Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs. Contingency plan in place Intelligence sources have passed on to DW information that Beijing has a contingency plan in place for when Kim Jong-un's control over the country crumbles. The reports confirm that China is indeed quietly encouraging regime change and is grooming Kim's brother, Kim Jong-nam to take over his role. At 42, Kim Jong-nam is the oldest son of Kim Jong-il, the dictator who ruled North Korea with an iron fist for 17 years until his sudden death in December 2011. Kim Jong-nam had been expected to assume the leadership after his father's death, but fell from favor spectacularly in 2001 when he was detained with two women and a boy aged 4 at Tokyo's Narita International Airport travelling on a forged Dominican Republic passport. He later admitted that he had wanted to visit Disneyland. He subsequently lived in Macau and Beijing, under the close watch of the Chinese authorities. The reports suggest that after Kim Jong-nam is installed in Pyongyang, his brother will be permitted to go into exile, probably in China. The tactic is not without its pitfalls, however, in part due to the efficiency of the campaign to deify their young leader as the future of the nation. Kim Jong-nam as 'new king' \"China may be dreaming of appointing Kim Jong-nam as the new king - and he is more preferable to the West than Kim Jong Un - but the problem is that he is not known in North Korea,\" said Ken Kato, director of Tokyo-based Human Rights in Asia. \"Many people in Japan know much about the North Korean 'Royal Family,' but this information is hidden in North Korea,\" he said. \"Even residents of Pyongyang know very little about Kim Jong-nam.\" Yet the reports are gaining credence among North Korea-watchers. Jun Okumura, a political analyst with the Eurasia Group, told DW that North Korea withdrawing",
        "generated_story": "Kim Jong-un's 'new king' Kim Jong Un is the new king of North Korea. He's the leader of the North Korean People's Armed Forces (PASDF) and the country's most powerful leader. The new leader, who is believed to be the heir apparent to the throne, is said to have been born in Pyongyang in 1949. His father, Jang Jong Nam, was born there in 1950 and his mother, Kim Kyok-sik, died in a suicide bombing in the early 1950s. In a statement released on Friday, the military said it was \"deeply saddened\" by the death of his father. \"We are deeply saddened by what has happened,\" the statement said. It was not immediately clear what the reason was for the sudden death, but it is widely believed that the late leader's death was the result of an assassination attempt on his wife and two children. On Saturday, a group of defectors gathered at the Pyongyang airport to commemorate the anniversary of Kim's birth. They were to attend a ceremony to mark the end of a half-century of war between North and South Korea, which has been divided over the Korean Peninsula since the 1950-53 Korean War. Kim was to return to Pyongyang on Sunday for a two-day visit to his hometown of Yeonpyeongdo, where he is expected to spend the weekend with family and close friends. Pyongyang's military chief of staff Kim Yong-chol said he would attend the ceremony, and that he was looking forward to meeting with Kim. According to a report from the Korea Central News Agency (Korea Central) last week, Pyongyang was planning to send a delegation to Seoul for talks on the reunification of its two rival Koreas. But the meeting was postponed due to differences between Pyongyang and Seoul over who would be in charge of running the two countries' nuclear weapons programs. South Korean Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Shigemura said on Saturday that his country was ready to cooperate with the United Nations in its efforts to end the nuclear arms race. However, he did not rule out the possibility that Pyongyang might try to force the US to give up its nuclear arsenal. North Koreans have long been wary of US sanctions against Pyongyang, saying they are \"not ready\" to deal with a nuclear-armed state. Last year, Seoul announced that it would no longer allow US troops to enter its territory. Washington, however, said that Washington would continue to monitor the situation closely, even if the U.N. Security Council decided not to impose sanctions on Pyongyang. Japan's foreign ministry said in an interview with DW that Seoul was prepared to take a \"strong stance\" against the move. Tokyo's Foreign Ministry said the decision was made \"in accordance with international humanitarian law.\" The ministry's spokesman said Pyongyang would not comment on whether or not the sanctions had been lifted."

Smuggling has prompted a visit to Mexico City by US Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly. Prosecutors said the remote town of Las Varas in Chihuahua state was the scene of Wednesday's battle between affiliates of the Ciudad Juarez cartel and a gang from the state of Sinaloa. Police said fighting escalated when patrols arrived. Fourteen people were found dead; 12 others were hospitalized. Grenades, launchers and rifles were found. The mountainous region is used as a corridor for smuggling into the US. El Chapo effect Chihuahua security commissioner Oscar Alberto Aparicio said a Black Hawk helicopter was called in as police chased surviving gang members through the area known for marijuana and opium poppy production. Two police officers had been killed in a \"cowardly\" way in the area a week ago, he said. In a similar incident last Friday, 17 gunmen were killed during a shootout with police on a highway in Sinaloa, Mexico's northwestern state. Sinaloa was the home base of Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, whose extradition to the US in January apparently left gangsters in a struggle for control of criminal syndicates. Homicides have surged in recent months, with the number of persons killed in May put at 2,186, the highest since the collection of such statistics began 20 years ago.

The US homeland security chief met with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto in Mexico's capital, Chihuahua, to discuss the ongoing violence in the country's northernmost state of Sinaloa. US officials said they had been briefed by Mexican authorities on the situation. \"We are aware of the incident and we are working closely with the Mexican government,\" US Secretary of State John Kerry said in a statement released by the US embassy in New York. Kelly said he was \"very concerned\" about the violence, adding that \"it is not the first time that we have had to deal with this kind of violence.\" \"I am very concerned for the safety of our citizens,\" he said, referring to the people who have been killed in recent months in drug-related attacks in southern Mexico. He also said that he would meet with US President Donald Trump and Mexican Prime Minister Oscar Alberto Aparicio, who are expected to attend the meeting. Trump has called for an end to violence between drug cartels and the United States, saying that it is \"a very serious situation\" and that the fight \"will not be tolerated.\" The president has also called on Mexico to step down from the post of head of state, which it has been in for more than a year. On Wednesday, the two leaders met in Ciudad Juarez, where they were to hold talks on a possible presidential run-off. They also discussed the future of US-Mexican relations. In a tweet, Trump said: \"It is a very important moment for our country. We are going to continue to work with our partners and partners in this fight. I want to be a part of that fight, and I will continue my efforts to ensure that Mexico does not become a victim of this violence. It will be an important day for Mexico,\" Trump wrote in an op-ed published in The Washington Post on Thursday, calling for a \"new era of peace and stability in our society.\" Trump also expressed concern over the recent spate of violent attacks on Mexican soil. Last week, a man and a woman were killed when a car plowed into a crowd of people near the border with Mexico, killing at least one person and injuring dozens more, according to a US official. A Mexican official said the attack was the result of an exchange of gunfire between rival gangs, but that no one was seriously injured. Mexican officials have not commented on whether or not they believe the shooting was an act of terrorism or whether it was a terrorist attack. An official from Mexico City's interior ministry told the Associated Press that there were \"no indications\" that a group of gunmen was planning to carry out an attack on US troops. But the official added that security officials had not yet decided whether to take action against the suspected drug trafficker, Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, at the request of his family."

The trial began on October 15 and was conducted behind closed doors. It is subject to approval by top military officials, but there has so far been no indication that senior officers oppose the court martial. They were not available for comment afterwards. There was a similar case in Nigeria in September, when 12 soldiers were sentenced to death for mutiny after firing on their commanding officer in the northeast city of Maiduguri. The 7th Division, based in Maiduguri, leads the offensive but there are numerous reports of troops refusing to deploy. Soldiers have regularly complained that they lack weapons, food, and other basic supplies to fight the Islamists, who are reported to have tanks, rocket-propelled-grenade launchers, and other heavy weaponry. Boko Haram has taken a number of towns and declared an Islamic caliphate in the region near the border with Cameroon. The Nigerian military has in recent weeks claimed to have made progress in recapturing lost territory. Thousands of people have been killed since the Islamist uprising began five years ago. An estimated 1.3 million have been displaced, with tens of thousands seeking refuge in neighboring Cameroon, Chad, and Niger. rg/bk (AFP, AP, dpa)",
        "generated_story": "Court martial against Boko Haram Islamists in Borno A court martial has been declared in the northeastern Nigerian state of Borna. The military said it would take action against the group, which has claimed responsibility for the attacks. A military court has declared a military crackdown against members of the sect, the 7th Division, on Friday. Police said they had arrested two suspected members and arrested three others in connection with the attack on a school in Maiduguri earlier this week. They were charged with kidnapping, rape and other crimes, and were ordered to return to their homes by the military on Saturday. According to local media reports, one of those arrested was Femi Falana, who is believed to be the leader of a rebel group. \"We have arrested a number of people, including a woman and a child,\" he told the AFP news agency, adding that he had also been arrested. He said he was being held under house arrest and that his wife and two children were also detained. His wife, a nurse, was also arrested, but she was released on bail after the court ordered her to stay away from the area. She is expected to face charges of kidnapping and rape. On Friday, police said she had been released from custody after a court-martial of her husband and three children over the alleged involvement of an al-Qaeda recruiter in her abduction and murder of two girls. Her husband is also suspected of being involved. In a statement, she said: \"I am innocent of any charges against me and my family. I have nothing to do with this case.\" The court also ruled that the suspects were not guilty of all the charges brought against her, saying they were innocent and had not acted in self-defense. However, her lawyer has said that she will appeal the ruling. Borne is home to some of Nigeria's most violent and violent groups. It is not yet clear how many people have been killed or injured in clashes between the militants and the security forces. There are also reports that one woman was killed in a clash between police and gunmen on Thursday, when she tried to flee her home. At the same time, there was a report that a suicide bomber was shot dead by a police officer on the way to her house. An investigation into the incident has also led to the arrest of three other suspects. One of them is suspected to have fled the country on foot after being shot and wounded in an attack last year. Another suspect, however, has not been named in court and has denied involvement. Last week, an investigation was launched into alleged links between her family and members who were allegedly involved in attacks on police officers and soldiers. But the investigation is still ongoing, according to a source close to both sides. As a result, it is unclear whether the case will be brought to trial. If the prosecution is successful in its bid to bring the perpetrators to justice, they will face a maximum sentence of life in prison. This is the first time the government has announced that it will not be prosecuting any of its own members. Earlier this month, President Muhammadu Buhari ordered the release of four suspected terrorists from a prison near the border with Nigeria."

The 53-year-old will be leading Germany's second biggest lender. After successfully weathering the Great Recession, Commerzbank's board of directors appears to want to signal a continuation in its growth trend with Martin Zielke's appointment as the new CEO as of May 1. Outgoing head Martin Blessing announced last year he would not renew his contract. Zielke had previously been put in charge of implementing reforms in the company's private banking sector following the recession. His restructuring measures attracted 800,000 new customers to the bank and changed the image of the 146-year-old financial institution. The 53-year-old has an illustrious career across several German financial institutions to look back on, having started at the teller of a local branch in 1983. Zielke's crowning achievement The beleaguered German financial institution recorded a profit of more than a billion euros (more than $1.1 billion) last year. It was the first time in five years that Commerzbank had made such profitable gains, which it said would translate into paid dividends for shareholders. A good portion of the yields were achieved by a restructuring and expansion drive of Commerzbank's private banking arm under Zielke's leadership. However, some of that money will go to the German government, as it had to step in and rescue the bank in 2009 to the tune of 18 billion euros ($25 billion at the time) by chiefly acquiring more than 15 percent of the shares, effectively nationalizing part of Commerzbank's operations. ss/jlw (dpa, Reuters)",

The move marks the first major change in management at the German lender since the financial crisis of 2008-2009. In his new role, Martin will take on the role of chief financial officer for the second time in three years. \"I'm very excited about this opportunity,\" Martin said in an interview with Deutsche Welle, adding that he was \"very impressed\" with the new CEO's ability to steer the company through the difficult times and the challenges of managing a bank with such a large capital base. It will also be a chance for Martin to make his first public appearance since he took over from former CEO Martin Bieler in January 2009. A year later, he will join the board of directors of Deutsche Bank AG, a German investment bank, where he is expected to stay until his term ends in 2018, according to a source close to the matter. Bialer, the head of investment banking at Deutsche Boerse, said on Thursday that the appointment was made \"in accordance with our strategic objectives.\" The source said the move was part of a plan to strengthen its balance sheet and reduce the risk of falling short of its target of $1 trillion ($1.6 trillion). \"We are going to do everything in our power to ensure that we are able to meet the needs of our customers and our employees,\" he said. But he added that \"we will not be satisfied until we have a clear plan in place.\" \"The bank will continue to invest in its customers, and we will make sure that this is the case for all customers,\" the source added, referring to customers who have been unable to pay their bills due to low interest rates and high costs of living in a country with a high unemployment rate and a rising stock market.

        "target": "'One in three' unaware they are HIV-positive The number of people living with HIV/AIDS in the European Union and neighboring countries has increased by nearly a third, with one in three unaware they have the virus, the EU Commission warned Monday. In a document on combating AIDS, the Commission said that as of 2007, around 2.2 million people carried the virus in the EU and nearby countries, an increase of 700,000 from 2001. According to Commission figures, around 730,000 of these live within the EU's 27 member states. France, Italy, Spain and Portugal have relatively high infection rates - ranging from 0.4 percent to 0.5 percent. In the Baltic country of Estonia, the infection rate stands at around 1.3 percent. In neighboring Ukraine, around 1.6 percent of the population has been diagnosed with HIV, while in Russia around 1.1 percent are HIV positive. The Commission warned that now was not the time for Europe to drop its guard on preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS, adding that in some neighboring countries the number of people carrying the virus had doubled. EU Health Commissioner Androulla Vassiliou said political momentum in the fight against HIV/AIDS needed to be maintained, adding that people must \"take responsibility for themselves and their partners by talking about and practicing safe sex and going for HIV testing.\" A cure for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has yet to be found more than a quarter century after it was brought to public attention. However, efficient treatments exist to slow the evolution of the virus. dfm/AFP Editor: Chuck Penfold",
        "generated_story": "One in three people living with HIV/AIDS in the EU and neighboring countries are unaware they are HIV-positive, the European Commission has found. The figures are the highest in more than a decade. More than two-thirds of EU citizens living in countries with high rates of HIV and AIDS have been unaware of their status, according to the latest figures released by the Commission on Tuesday. According to a survey of 1,000 people in 28 EU member states, one in four of them were unaware that they had been infected with the virus. This figure is up from 1.6 percent in 2006, when it was reported to be at the peak of the AIDS epidemic. In 2007, a quarter of those who had tested positive for HIV were told they were HIV positive. That figure rose to 2.8 percent by 2010. Since then, it has risen to 3.4 percent. Vassiliou said the figures were \"very, very high\" for the first time. \"It's not just the number of people who are aware they have HIV,\" he said, adding that the figure was \"a lot higher\" than the previous year's figures. He also said that a \"significant proportion\" of new HIV cases in EU countries were not aware that their HIV status was linked to their gender identity. However, he also pointed out that there was no evidence that this was the case in any other EU country where HIV was detected, such as in Spain, Portugal, Ireland, Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal. It is also not clear how many people with AIDS in other European countries live in those countries, and whether this is because they don't have access to condoms or if they do have a condom. There is no indication that HIV is transmitted through contact with bodily fluids, which can lead to an infection. And that is the main reason why so many new cases of AIDS are reported in these countries. These cases are more likely to occur in developing countries where there is a high level of awareness about the disease. They are also more susceptible to infection and can be exposed to other forms of disease, including cancer, HIV, AIDS, cancer and other diseases. But it is not yet known whether these new infections are transmitted to people outside the bloc, or whether they will be transmitted by other means. What is known about HIV in Europe is that it can only be spread by contact between individuals and their partners. For example, if a person is infected by a virus, they may not be able to contact their partner or partner for a long period of time, even if the partner is aware of it. If the person has an HIV infection, that person may be unable to communicate with his or her partner, for example through a phone call or text message or through social media. So, in order to get the word out about it, you need to know what is going on in your partner's home country. You have to ask yourself whether you want to stay in a relationship with a partner. Do you have any idea how long it will take to live with someone who has HIV? If not, then why not stay with them? What do you think about this relationship? You can see the relationship between partner and partner? There are a lot of similarities between partners and partners, but there are differences in how they view each other. One partner has a very different perspective on HIV. Another has to look at their own situation and decide whether he or she is willing to work with other partners to help them live a healthier life. Both partners have different perspectives on the same issues. I think it's important to keep in mind that in many cases, there will always be differences of opinion about how to deal with this issue. We are not going to give up on this subject entirely, because we are still working on a solution to this problem. Let's be clear: we will continue to talk about what we have in common and how we can improve the situation in this area. As a matter of fact, we do not have an answer to that question at this point. At the moment, I'm not sure what to do. How do I know? I can't think of a single person who doesn't know that I would be open to talking to my partner if I were to speak to him? That's the question that will come up in an interview with me later this week. Can you tell me what I should do? Let me know if you're interested in speaking to me? Tell me about your experience? We will keep an open mind and I'll let you know. Thank you for your patience and understanding. Thanks for all your support and for being patient with us. Good luck to all of you. Have a great day!

Security forces are on high alert amid fears of unrest. UN leader Ban Ki-moon expressed \"deep regret\" on Monday that political leaders had failed to make progress on a constitution in Nepal, expressing concern about instability within the country. Security forces were put on high alert, with riot police patrolling streets after calls by the opposition for the resignation of Maoist Prime Minister Baburam Bhattarai. \"Nepal has entered an uncertain constitutional and political period,\" Ban warned in a statement read by his spokesman Martin Nesirky. \"The government and the political leaders, as well as leaders of various communities, need to demonstrate the courage and wisdom to come together to address the challenges the nation faces,\" the statement added. Repeated deadlines expired Politicians were to have agreed upon a new framework for the country's political future by Sunday. However, the representation of ethnic minorities and castes within a federal structure has proved a major sticking point in efforts to draw up a secular constitution. Bhattarai on Sunday said that parliament, elected in 2008 after a decade of civil war, would be disbanded after repeated deadlines had been broken. New elections are due to be held in November, but the opposition has criticized the premier's unilateral decision to call the poll. The country's Hindu monarchy, which ruled for centuries, was abolished after Maoist rebels gave up arms and won elections in 2008.

The election in Nepal is set to take place on Sunday, and the country is expected to hold its first parliamentary elections since the end of the 1994-95 civil war. Opposition parties have been fighting each other for months over the disputed elections, which were won by the Nepalese government. In the run-up to the polls, the government of Prime Minister Baburam Bhattarai has called for a peaceful transition of power. \"We are going to make sure that the people of Nepal are able to elect a new government,\" he told reporters in Kathmandu on Monday. He said the election would be held on the same day as the general election, but that it would not be the first time that Nepal's political system has been shaken by violence. Nesirky, who is also the UN's deputy secretary-general for human rights, said he was \"very concerned\" about the situation, adding that there was a \"serious lack of coordination\" between government and opposition parties and that \"there was no coordination between the two parties.\" The government has said it will hold a special election to determine the winner of Sunday's election. It is not yet clear how many candidates will be running for the post of prime minister. There are reports that some candidates are planning to run for re-election, while others have said they won't run at all. According to a UN report, around 1.5 million people have registered to vote in this year\u2019s elections. A number of candidates have already been announced, including a candidate for vice-president, a woman and a man with a disability. Many of those candidates, however, have yet to be named. Some of them, like the woman, are believed to have fled to Nepal, where they are living in fear of losing their jobs. They have also been accused of running away with their passports. This is the second time in as many years that they have had to flee their homes in order to return to their country of origin. At the beginning of last year, they had been allowed to stay in their home country, Nepal. Since then, though, many have moved to other countries, such as India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and even the Maldives. These are the only countries where there is a strong possibility of a change of government, according to UN officials. One of these countries has a population of around 2.6 million. That's a lot of people. But it's not just Nepal that is in danger of becoming a third world country. What is happening is that people are fleeing to neighboring countries in search of safety and security. Why is this happening? The UN is trying to find a solution to this problem. How do you know which countries are doing the right thing? Do you feel safe in your own country? What are your thoughts on this situation? Is it safe for you to travel to another country where you have to leave your country to go to work? I don't think so. I think it is safe to say that we have a very strong sense of what is going on in our country right now. You can't go anywhere without your family, friends and neighbors. We are all very worried about your safety. And that's why we are here. Let's talk about this. So, let's see what we can do about it. Is there a way out of this?

Who will decide what happens in Asia? There is no doubt that something will come up.

        "target": "A Delicious Accompaniment for Wine A regular companion of the fall season's wines is a treat called Zwiebelkuchen, literally, onion cake. It is a one-crust pie, eaten in most German wine regions during the fall wine season. Zwiebelkuchen is traditionally eaten with Federweisser, a young wine available in Germany in the fall. The link between the two is so strong that many Federweisser wines have a recipe for the onion cake on their labels. Here's a recipe for it: Ingredients: 1 packet yeast, active dry 1 teaspoon sugar 1 1/2 teaspoon salt 3 cups unbleached flour 1 tablespoon shortening 1 cup water (49 to 54 C / 120 to 130 F) 6 slices bacon -- diced 2 medium onions -- sliced 1/4 teaspoon cumin 1/2 teaspoon salt Pepper 1 egg yolk 1 cup sour cream Mix the yeast with the sugar, a teaspoon of salt and half a cup of flour. Blend in the shortening and warm water, then beat for two minutes. Add enough flour to make a soft dough, and then knead the dough until smooth and elastic, about five minutes. Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, then cover it and let it rise in a warm place for 30 minutes. Pat the dough into a lightly greased 12-inch pizza pan or onto a lightly greased baking sheet. Press up the edges to make a slight rim. Fry the bacon until crisp and drain it on absorbent paper. Add onions to the bacon grease, and cook slowly until tender, but not brown. Sprinkle the onions, bacon, cumin, half a teaspoon of salt and pepper over the dough. Bake the cake at 204 C (400 F) for 20 minutes. Blend the egg yolk and sour cream and pour the mixture over the Zwiebelkuchen. Bake it for another 10 to 15 minutes, until the cake is golden brown and the sour cream has set. Serve warm or at room temperature with white wine.",
        "generated_story": "Opinion: A German Wine Companion to the Fall Wine Season The fall wine season is just around the corner. It's a time of year when the harvest season kicks off in earnest. In Germany, autumn is the most important season of the year. The harvest brings with it a lot of fruit, vegetables, herbs and herbs. This year, we're looking forward to autumn. We're going to be celebrating the end of summer with a big harvest of vegetables and fruit. But first, let's talk about autumn wine. What do you think? Do you agree with me? I don't think so. I think it's about time that we start to see the fruits of our labor. That's why I'm so excited about this year's harvest. There are so many things that are going on in Germany right now. For example, there's the wine that's been on the market for a long time. And then there are the herbs, the flowers and the vegetables. They're all in season, and they all come from different regions of Germany. You can find them in the vineyards, in wine stores and in bakeries all over the world. These are all very important things for the German wine industry, but they're also important for people who want to make their own wine, especially those who are looking for something fresh and fresh to drink. So, for those of you who have never had the chance to try a wine before, here are a few things you can do to help. One of them is to buy a bottle of wine from a local wine store. Another, to sell at a discount, is that you have to spend a certain amount of money in order to get the best wine for your family and friends. Then you buy the bottle, which is then sold at the grocery store and then you sell it to your friends and family. Finally, you get to enjoy the fruit and vegetables that come with the season. All of these things are important, because they give you a taste of what's in store for you when you're on your way home from work. If you've never tasted a grape or wine in your life, it doesn't taste as good as it does on a regular basis. Or, if you like a good wine and you want something that tastes good, then go for it. As long as you drink the same wine over and over again, that means you'll be able to have a great harvest and enjoy it all year round. Which is why we've been talking about it for so long about the autumn harvest, when it comes to wine production and how it will be used for wine consumption. Now that the fall harvest is almost over, I can't wait to start making wine again. After all, what else is there to do? We've all had our fair share of grape varieties, so we'll see what we can come up with next year in terms of how to use them. \"I think we all have our favorites,\" says one of my favorite German wines, \"the wine of autumn and winter.\" The wine is made by a combination of yeast, yeast and yeast. However, this is not the case for all of us, as the yeast is a yeast-based yeast that can be grown in a variety of different types of fermentations and is used in many different ways, such as yeast fermentation, fermentation and fermentation. A yeast strain is also used to ferment yeast in yeast cells, making it easier for yeast to metabolize and ferment. yeast can also be added to yeast as well as to reduce the acidity of certain yeast compounds. Since yeast has a tendency to oxidize in certain foods, these compounds are more susceptible to oxidation and are therefore more likely to spread through the body than other yeast strains. According to a recent study by the University of Berlin's wine professor, Wolfgang Sch\u00fctter, onion cake is an important component of this process. He says that yeast production is more important than the fermentation process, since yeast oxidation is less efficient and more efficient. When yeast becomes the main source of carbon dioxide in beer and wine fermentation is done, bacteria are released into the air, thereby reducing the carbonation of alcohol. Cholesterol and cholesterol levels are also a major factor in alcohol consumption, he says. Alcohol levels also rise in autumn, leading to an increased risk of cancer and liver cirrhosis in people's bodies. Is this the reason for this decline in blood pressure? \"It's not a coincidence that onion cakes are used as a food for cancer patients,\" he adds. Meanwhile, alcohol levels have also risen in recent years, according to Wolfgang K\u00fcbler, a professor of chemistry at Brandeis University in Berlin, who has been working on this topic for more than a year and a half. On the other hand, most people are not aware of its effects on alcohol production. With the exception of a small number of people with high cholesterol and high blood sugar levels, many people have been drinking more alcohol in their blood than in other areas of their bodies of origin."

        "target": "Bayern blast five as Schalke draw Bayern Munich stamped their authority over the Bundesliga on Saturday, with a ruthless 5-0 drubbing of Hannover at home. Meanwhile, second-placed Schalke and third-placed Frankfurt were forced to share the points. With many critics saying Bayern might as well be given the giant Bundesliga dish already, perhaps the struggle for second is shaping up to be the more compelling battle. But Saturday afternoon's clash between second-placed Schalke and third-placed Frankfurt did not take a decisive turn, with the game ending in a 1-1 draw. Schalke drew first blood in the 11th minute, when Frankfurt's Stefan Aigner was dispossessed in midfield, and Lewis Holtby released Klaas-Jan Huntelaar in front of goal - the Dutchman's first in the Bundesliga since September. But the hapless Aigner waited just over 100 seconds to make amends for his error, when the Royal Blues allowed him a free header that left goalkeeper Lars Unnerstall with no chance. But neither side could make inroads in the second half, which allowed Dortmund to leap-frog both sides and claim second place. Bayern take command Meanwhile the imperious Bayern Munich dispelled any talk of winter form-dip - following last week's draw to Nuremberg - with a brutally efficient 5-0 win at home to Hannover. The Bavarians stormed to a 3-0 lead in just 37 minutes, celebrating a nifty overhead kick for star signing Javi Martinez in the fourth minute. Toni Kroos and Franck Ribery scored the next two against a Hannover side that were torn open at will. The overhead kick was the first for the 40-million-euro ($52-million) signing Martinez, and in the second half new defender Dante also opened his account with a straightforward header from a Kroos free-kick. The festival of football continued just four minutes later, when Mario Gomez - making first Bundesliga appearance of the season - slammed the ball into the net from a tight angle just 30 seconds after replacing Mario Mandzukic. Dortmund win The champions Dortmund, meanwhile, are still nine points behind Bayern after beating Mainz 2-1 away. It was a potentially tricky fixture in the town where J\u00fcrgen Klopp began his coaching career, and Mainz showed their brilliance in the fourth minute, when Elkin Soto knocked a dream ball into the path of Marco Caligiuri, whose volley fairly screamed into the top right corner. Dortmund's own star-Marco - national team player Marco Reus - leveled the scores just eight minutes later. Reus worked himself some room at the outer edge of the penalty area, and slotted a beautiful 17-meter effort into the far corner. And Dortmund's second goal, just before half-time, was equally aesthetic - a vertical ball bisected the Mainz defense perfectly down the middle, where Polish predator Robert Lewandowski got his eighth league goal of the season with a deft lob over the onrushing Christian Wetklo in goal. Allofs' homecoming Bremen's 1-1 draw at Wolfsburg had a special frisson of its own, as Wolfsburg's newly-minted sporting director Klaus Allofs faced the club he had served as general manager for over a decade. And there was some gesticulating from the Bremen bench in the general direction of the Wolfsburg management when the guests took the lead in the 35th minute. Just seconds after Wolfsburg missed several chances, Marko Arnautovic was left free in the box after Eljero Elia found space on the left and cut the ball back for the Austrian to finish. But Wolfsburg got their own back in the second half. In the 62th minute, Bremen were reduced to ten men when Lukas Schmitz was given second yellow card for a hard tackle on Adelino Vieirinha. Just two minutes later, Bas Dost took advantage of their guests' disorgnaization and smashed the ball into the goal after neat piece of play from Vieirinha. Dirty derby The Franconian derby between Greuther F\u00fcrth and Nuremberg was a cagey affair that ended in a frustrating 0-0 draw. The first half was marked mainly by a straight red card for Nuremberg's Markus Feulner after an ugly, flying lunge on Stephan F\u00fcrstner. But the home side's numerical advantage was short-lived - Sercan Sararer was also sent for an early ice bath after his high elbow on Javier Pinola was adjudged worthy of a second yellow card in the 61st minute. But the aggression in the tackles was not matched by ruthlessness in front of goal, and neither side could eke out any clear chances.",
        "generated_story": "Bayern Munich host Hannover in Bundesliga clash Bayern Munich will be looking to bounce back from a 2-0 defeat to Hannovers in the Bundesliga on Saturday. The German side will travel to Nuremberg to take on the Dutchman's Wolfsburg in a clash that could be billed as the biggest match of the season for the Bavarians. Bayern, who have won three of their last four league matches, are looking for their first win since the end of last season. They have a chance to get back into the top four on Sunday, when they will face the winner of Saturday's first-leg match between the two sides at the Stadion d'Hoffenheim. After a 1-1 draw at home to Cologne last weekend, the Rhineland-Palatinate club will look to build on their impressive start to the new season, which has seen them reach the Champions League quarterfinals and the quarter-finals. \"We're looking forward to this match,\" said Bayern's Stefan Aigner after the match, adding that he was \"very happy\" with his side's performance against Cologne. He added that his team-mates were \"excited\" about the challenge ahead of them, and that they had \"a lot of work to do.\" \"I'm very happy with the way that we've been playing,\" he said, referring to his players' performances in recent weeks. 'We've got a lot to work on, but we're going to try and get the best out of our squad.' \" We'll have to see how we do in this game,\" added the Bayern coach, Klaus Allofs, in his first match as head coach of a German club since taking over from Javi Martinez in January. On Saturday, he'll be in charge of his club's defense, as well as his midfield, with a number of key players on hand to help them get through the second half. In the first half, Bayern were able to hold off the visitors, only to lose 3-2 in their opening two matches in all competitions. That was the last time the club had a matchday fixture in which they faced off against a Dutch side that had won the league by a single point in 2014. It was also the only time they'd faced each other this season and it was a good result for Bayern. But it's not just Bayern who are in danger of missing out on a spot in next year's Bundesliga, they're also facing a tough task against the likes of Schalke Leverkusen and Werder Bremen. At the same time, it seems that Bayern have the upper hand in Germany's top flight, thanks to a strong defensive line and a solid attack from Dries Mertens. And that's something that has been missing for quite some time. For the past couple of weeks, there's been talk about a possible return to Bundesliga competition. However, this is not the case at all. There's also talk that the German team is in good shape in terms of its defensive play and its ability to score goals. This week, however, that may not be as clear-cut as it may have been at Cologne, where Bayern are expected to be on top of Group B. Last season's German Cup final was won by the Netherlands in extra time by their former club Klaas-Jan Huntelaar's hometown side, N\u00fcrnberg, on Aug. 11, 2015. What is it like to play in front of your own home fans? What do you think about that? Is it something you can do? You can't just sit back and relax and enjoy the game? I don't think so. I think the answer is no. You've just got to enjoy it. If you want to win, then you're in for a long weekend of football. So, I'm sure you'll enjoy watching your team play. Do you have any idea what's going on? If so, what are your thoughts on this week's match? We're not sure. We have some good news for you. Go ahead and try to find out. Let's see what happens next.

        "target": "In Argentina, red wine exports to balance Porsche imports About 100 Porsches are imported to Argentina each year. Now the country wants to keep a positive trade balance by having the value of the imported luxury cars matched by red wine exports. Porsche is currently enjoying record profits after a two-year downturn, but the export-reliant company has hit a pothole in Argentina. Buenos Aires-based Porsche importer Grupo Pulenta has signed an agreement obligating it to export several hundred bottles of red wine for each car it imports, the Argentine government announced Wednesday. Grupo Pulenta declined to comment when contacted by Deutsche Welle. Job creation During the past year, Argentina has held thousands of high-end vehicles in customs until companies agreed to export goods valued at the same amount. Most of those vehicles came from Germany. According to a spokeswoman for the Argentine embassy in Berlin, the country has been trying to safeguard domestic employment with a positive trade balance. \"Our government has negotiated with automakers to balance their imports of cars with an equivalent amount of exports,\" she told Deutsche Welle in a statement. \"Since March 2010 we have been working with the automakers and importers in order to increase local integration and reduce the trade deficit in this sector.\" Small market A Porsche spokesman said the company sells just short of 100 vehicles into Argentina each year. That compares to more than 40,000 sold worldwide during five months in 2010. \"For Porsche, Argentina is a rather small market,\" the spokesman told Deutsche Welle. \"Our importer, the Pulenta Group, also deals in wine. They have their own vineyards and export that wine. It has nothing to do with Porsche - we just have an import contract with them, and it seems they've found an individual solution with the Argentine government.\" Domestic production Volkswagen, which has an Argentine subsidiary producing the new \"Amarok\" pickup truck and transmissions, has thus far avoided mandatory exports. The company had reported an export surplus of 384 million euros ($545 million) for this year. Porsche's holding company owns 32.2 percent of Volkswagen, and the Porsche brand is intended to become integrated into Volkswagen's lineup. Daimler and BMW also have subsidiaries in Argentina. While Daimler produces its \"Sprinter\" there, BMW only imports to the country. According to the Argentine embassy in Berlin, the country has recently sought more domestic production by foreign car companies. Author: Gerhard Schneibel (dpa) Editor: John Blau",
        "generated_story": "Porsche to balance wine exports with red wine production Argentina's largest carmaker has announced plans to reduce its wine export to the United States. The move comes as the country's top wine exporter, Grupo Pulenta, has been struggling to cope with rising prices in the US and Europe. In a statement on Thursday, the company said it would cut production by 1.5 million euros ($2.6 million) in 2017. \"We are going to continue to focus on our domestic market,\" the statement said. It added that the move was part of a plan by the Argentine government to cut costs by up to 30 percent over the next five years. Argentina is one of the world's fastest growing markets for wine, with a market worth more than $1 billion a year, according to data compiled by Deutsche Welle. However, it is not the first time that Argentina has seen a decline in wine sales. Last year it was the second-largest wine producer in Latin America, behind only the likes of Germany's Mercedes-Benz in terms of volume, followed by France's Daimler in 2014, and the Netherlands' Porsche in 2015. Porsche is also the largest wine importer in Argentina, accounting for around 40 percent of its total wine imports. But it has also been able to increase its production in Brazil, Argentina and South Africa, where it exports more wine than in any other country. According to a report published in a German newspaper in January, Porsche's Brazilian production is expected to rise by 2.4 percent in 2018, up from the previous year's figure of 3.2 percent. That's a slight increase from last year. And the German company has already announced that it will stop selling wine to Argentina in order to concentrate on its domestic wine market, which it calls Amarok, a wine made in Germany. BMW, however, said in an interview published earlier this month that its decision to stop producing wine for Argentina was a \"mistake\" and \"a mistake.\" The German firm said the decision was made \"in response to growing demand\" for the wine from South American countries, such as Brazil and Argentina. German media reported on Friday that Porsche would no longer sell wine in South America to South Korea, but instead sell it to China and other Asian countries. A spokesman for Porsche declined to comment on the report, saying the firm would not comment further on whether or not it planned to do so. DW: What do you think of this move? Porsche: It's not a big deal. I don't think it's big news. We have a lot of things to say about it. What I think is important is that we have to be very careful about what we say and do. There are a number of factors that are important to us. For example, there is the fact that there are so many people who want to buy wine that they can't afford to spend their money on wine. This is something that is very important for us, because we need to make sure we are doing everything we can to get the best possible results for our customers. So we will be looking at this as an opportunity to diversify our product portfolio. If we do not do that, then we won't be doing anything at all. As a result, we'll be focusing on other areas of our business. You can expect to see more and more products from Germany, China, India, Australia, Japan, Korea and China. At the same time, you will also see a rise in exports from other emerging markets, particularly in Europe and Asia. Volkswagen, for instance, is looking to expand its presence in China as well as in North America. Germany is a major player in this area, although it doesn't have much of an international presence there. China is an important market for German carmakers, so we're not sure how much that will influence the market in other markets. Then there's the question of whether Germany or China will do something about this. Do you have any plans for China? What about Argentina? Does it have an answer for that? The answer is \"no.\" In the past few years, Germany has made a concerted effort to develop its own wine sector. They have been doing a good job of diversifying their wine portfolio and expanding their product offerings. Now, they are looking for new markets and new products. One of them is to start a new wine business in Buenos Aires. On the other hand, German wine giant Volkswagen is doing quite well with its red wines. VW is investing heavily in Argentine wine and is expanding its portfolio in Asia and Africa. These companies are also investing in new areas, including wine-making, food and food production, especially in developing countries like the Middle East, Asia, Africa and Australia. Both of these sectors are growing at a very fast pace in recent years and in particular in emerging economies like Germany and Brazil. After all, Volkswagen has a strong presence at the top of their list of leading wine companies in these areas. With the arrival of German-based Porsche, VW has become the biggest"

Timmermans said that the move was aimed at entering \"into a dialogue with the Polish authorities, to clarify the facts in an objective way and help find solutions if necessary.\" He added that the procedure is focused on seeking answers regarding the new right-wing Polish government's actions not to apply two judgments by the country's constitutional court, and the reasons behind the president and vice-president's terms were shortened. Preserving rule of law However, Poland's deputy foreign minister said that the European Commission was informed of the reasons behind the government's actions. \"We would insist that the questions are phrased precisely because we have provided much information to the Commission in recent days and we are not entirely clear as to what the Commission is still not clear about,\" Szymanski noted to reporters at the European Parliament.

The European Commission has warned Poland that it will not stand by while the country negotiates its way out of its political crisis. Poland's government has rejected a request from the European Parliament to take a side in the dispute between Poland and the bloc over its handling of a disputed referendum on the future of EU membership. Polish Prime Minister Viktor Orban has called for a vote on whether to allow the referendum, which is scheduled for November, to be postponed until the end of the year. \"We are not going to sit by and let the situation play out,\" said Frans Timmermans, the head of Europe's Commission for Foreign Affairs, in an interview with the Dutch news agency dpa. He said the Commission was \"very concerned\" by the Polish government's refusal to back down on its demand for an EU-wide referendum. Hungary and Poland have been at loggerheads for months over the issue, with Hungary accusing Poland of meddling in its internal affairs, while Poland has said it would not allow a referendum at the same time. Both sides have rejected the proposal, saying it was not in line with EU law. In a statement released on Wednesday, Hungary's Foreign Minister, Farsi Kaczynski, said that the decision was made \"in the interests of Poland\" and that Poland should not be allowed to participate in any future EU elections. However, he added, \"The Commission is also very concerned about the way Poland is dealing with its own political situation.\" The EU is currently negotiating a deal with Poland over a controversial referendum that could lead to the expulsion of more than 1.5 million people from its member states. A move that would have allowed Poland to return to its former status as a member state could have led to a new round of elections in November. But the move could also have a negative impact on other EU countries, such as Spain, Portugal, Italy, Greece and Spain. It is not clear how much Poland will be willing to pay in return for the vote, but it is widely expected that Hungary will continue to hold the rotating presidency until at least mid-December. On Tuesday, Poland announced plans to withdraw its candidacy for European Council elections next year, a move which was widely seen as an attempt to shore up support for its pro-European stance. Opinion polls show that a majority of voters in both countries are in favor of retaining the right to vote in future elections, despite the fact that most of them are against the current president's plan to stay in office until after the election. That would be a major setback for Hungary, who is seeking a third term as prime minister in May."

        "target": "Beekeepers battle mites with technology Bees are useful, hard-working and vital for our ecosystem. Aside from making honey, bees pollinate most of our food crops. But summertime is also the season for one of the biggest threats to honey bees \u2013 the varroa mite. Dete Papendieck puts on a white veiled protective hat and takes out a metal jug with a beak-shaped spout. He sets fire to the container's contents \u2013 formic acid \u2013 and starts directing the smoke that is wafting at the beehives lined up in front of him in his garden on the outskirts of Bonn. The acid doesn't harm the bees, but it does kill the varroa mites, he says. And July, after most of the honey has been harvested, is the best time to treat his hives. The one millimeter-large varroa mite is a parasite that infests beehives and lays its eggs in the honeycombs, alongside the bees' larvae. \"It feeds on the bees' and the bee brood's blood, the so-called haemolymph,\" Papendieck explains. A third of bees killed in Germany Papendieck is an apiarist at the Bee Research Institute at the University of Bonn and he knows that the threat of mites is serious. If left untreated, varroa-infested colonies rarely survive a winter. In 2010, German beekeepers lost about 200,000 hives to the mite \u2013 one third of Germany's total bee population. And it is not just the honey and beeswax production that are affected by the mite. Many of our food crops depend on bees: Some 80 percent of all agricultural plants and 90 percent of fruit trees in Europe are pollinated by Apis mellifera, the European honeybee. Varroa introduced from Asia Had Dete Papendieck been a beekeeper forty years ago he would not have had to worry about mites. He says the varroa mite that was originally native to Asia, was introduced to Europe in the 1970s. \"It happened during a research project in which it was attempted to crossbreed the European honeybee with the Asian honeybee. The researchers were exchanging bee colonies between Europe and India, and that is how the mites came to Germany,\" Papendieck said. Unlike Asian bee species, the European honeybee cannot fight off the varoa mite by itself. According to Papendieck, bees easily transmit the mite to other beekeepers' hives in what apiarists call robbery. \"It happens when certain colonies are being robbed by other bees. Large numbers of bees from different colonies attack weak hives and steal their stocks. At the same time, parasites and diseases are exchanged\", he says. Researchers have been trying to breed varroa-resistant mites, but so far they haven't had much success. High-tech tools help fight the mite Klaus Maresch is also worried about his bees. He is an organic beekeeper from Bonn and he has been passionate about bees since he was a little boy. \"They are part of my family. When I open my hives and smell the honey and hear the buzzing of the bees it's like being in another world,\" he told Deutsche Welle. In addition to using formic acid to fight the mite, Klaus Maresch employs a high-tech tool \u2013 a special cylindrical scale that helps him determine when it is best to start the varroa treatment. \"Every day this hive scale sends data about the colonies to our server. The data, such as the temperature in the hive and the amounts of nectar and pollen collected, help me to find a good day to treat varroa,\" Maresch says. Maresch also makes the data about the activities in his hives available to fellow beekeepers who can treat their colonies accordingly. A driver's license for beekeepers? But it is not the mite that angers Maresch most. \"That's nature,\" he says, \"I feel angry about beekeepers who don't fight varroa. If the bees of neighboring beekeepers are infested, I also have a problem.\" The existing German pest regulation obliges beekeepers to treat their bees against varroa, but there are no strict controls. The majority of Germany's more-than-80,000 beekeepers are amateurs who keep between one and 20 colonies. This makes it difficult to impose and survey certain quality standards. Maresch, who sees himself as a kind of 'bee activist', would like to see the government introduce stricter rules. \"There should be a law that obliges every new beekeeper to learn about beekeeping before they are allowed to keep bees. They should get an education and there should be something like a driver's license for beekeepers,\" he says. In the mean time, Europe's bees are going to have to",
        "generated_story": "A German beekeeper fights the varoa mite with a high-tech hive scale A German honeybee expert has successfully fought a pest that has become a major threat to his livelihood. Dete Papendieck has been battling the pest for more than a year. \"I have to fight this pest,\" he told the German news agency Deutsche Welle, adding that he was able to stop it from spreading to other areas of the country. The pest, which has a population of around 1.5 million in Germany, was first spotted in the spring of 2014. In the summer of 2015, it was discovered that it had spread to neighboring regions of Germany. It is believed to be the largest pest on the planet, with around 2,000 species of mites living in a single hive. According to a study published in March 2015 by the Bee Research Institute (BRI) in Bonn, Germany's largest bee research institute, the insect is thought to have been the most widespread pest in Europe at the time. But it has since been eradicated, according to the BRI, and the beekeepers are now working on a new method of fighting it. A new technique is being developed that will allow the pests to spread into other parts of Europe, such as the Americas, Asia, Africa and even the Middle East, where they are most commonly found. This method is known as a honeycomb scale and can be used in conjunction with other beekeeping methods. However, there is a problem with this method, as it is not possible to use it in all cases. For example, if a hive is used for honeycarts, then it can only be applied to honeybees. That's why the bees are not allowed to stay in one hive at all. Instead, they must be kept in another hive in order to protect themselves and their offspring from harm. So far, this technique has proven to work well for both humans and bees, but it does not work for other species. On the other hand, when it comes to bees and other pollinators, that's not the case for most bees. There are a number of different types of honeymites, including those that are more common in other countries. One of them, for instance, is the honey bee. Another, called the \"Vegas hive,\" which is made up of about 1,500 honey-eaters and about 3,200 honey bees that live in different climates. Although the hive has not yet been tested on humans, researchers say it could be tested for the first time in humans. If the test results are positive, experts say the new technology will be available in 2017. Meanwhile, some experts believe it will have a positive impact on bees' ability to survive in warmer climates, while others think it may not be possible for bees to thrive in colder climates due to high temperatures and high pollen levels. Experts say this could have an adverse effect on bee populations, especially in areas with high concentrations of pollen and pesticides. They also say that bees can become more susceptible to pests and diseases, because of their high levels of pollination and are therefore more likely to become resistant to pesticides and chemicals. These are the main reasons why many bees do not stay on their own for long periods of time, despite the fact that they can live longer in their natural habitats.

        "target": "EU Mulls Warning Labels to Curb Alcohol Abuse While still targeting smoking, European Union's public health commissioner is considering adding alcohol to the list of vices the bloc should clamp down on. In a report commissioned by the European Commission, the London Institute for Alcohol Studies recommended raising the legal age to buy alcohol to 18 (in some countries, such as Germany, 16-year-olds can buy beer), lowering the permitted blood alcohol level while driving to 0.5, banning alcohol advertising on TV and in movies as well as adding warning labels to bottles as ways of preventing alcohol abuse across the bloc. Which of the methods EU Health Commissioner Markos Kyprianou actually introduces will be announced \"sometime in the autumn,\" according to a spokesperson. Other options include a 10 percent increase in the price of alcohol. Kyprianou has, however, hinted that he favors warning labels -- similar to those that appear on packs of cigarettes -- that make the dangers of alcohol clear. \"Drinking harms your unborn baby\" on bottles? Brewers and wine makers across Europe, however, have come out against placing \"Drinking Kills\" or other labels on bottles of beer. \"Warning labels are the completely wrong way to go,\" Peter Hahn, head of the German Brewers Association told Germany's Express newspaper. \"The do not deter people who have lost a sense of how much to drink and unsettle the people who enjoy a beer after work.\" Industry groups also opposed implementing EU-wide guidelines in countries with traditionally different ways of approaching drinking and drinking problems. \"Policies that do not consider cultural and regional differences, will fail to deal with the social problems, while at the same time generate a rising level of political objections,\" said Rodolphe de Looz-Corswarem of Brewers of Europe. Keeping social vices separate Green party EU parliamentarian Hiltrud Breyer meanwhile called on the alcohol industry to stop \"saber rattling\" before it sees the a final version of the EU's strategy to prevent alcohol abuse. German Consumer Affairs Minister Horst Seehofer said he would wait to see what Kyprianou's actual suggestions are before commenting. Other German politicians, however, were more willing to voice the opposition to putting a sip of wine on the same footing with a puff of a cigarette. \"People should not expect that a skull and crossbones end up on every bottle of beer and wine,\" German EU representative Karl-Heinz Florenz told Der Tagesspiegel newspaper, adding that when it comes to alcohol, each member state should be responsible for how it deals with alcohol abuse. The harm of \"passive drinking\" While cigarettes are a health risk from the first puff, moderate drinking can actually be healthy and there is no danger from \"passive drinking,\" Peter Liese, a German EU representative, told the paper. The commission's report disagreed with Liese's conclusion, saying alcohol abuse had a major role in as many as 200,000 deaths in Europe due to car accidents and disease and played a role in some 60,000 underweight births. The report also estimated the effects of alcohol abuse of costing the EU 125 billion euros ($161 billion) in 2003. Some 25 percent of men and 10 percent of women in Europe drink what the EU considers to be more than healthy amounts of alcohol and between 3 percent and 5 percent are suffering from alcoholism, according to EU statistics.",
        "generated_story": "European Commission warns against 'passive drinking' on bottles of beer The European Commission has warned against the use of alcohol in beer. The EU's chief executive, Peter Hahn, warned on Thursday of the dangers of drinking too much alcohol. \"We have to be very careful with our beer,\" he said in an interview with the German newspaper \"Express.\" The German Brewers Association's Peter Liese said he was \"very concerned\" about the impact on beer consumption by people who drink alcohol on their bodies and minds. He said that \"it is not a good idea to drink beer on your body and mind.\" \"It is a bad idea,\" said the head of Germany's Brewers of Europe, Hiltrud Breyer, who is also the country's representative on the European Council of Brewers (ECB). \"I am very concerned that people are drinking more alcohol than they should be drinking, and that they are becoming more and more susceptible to the effects of excessive alcohol consumption.\" In a statement released Thursday, the ECB said it would not comment on whether or not alcohol was being sold in the EU market, but that it was a \"bad idea\" to sell beer in a market that was already saturated with alcohol, such as wine, beer and spirits. In addition, it said, \"we are not going to allow people to consume alcohol that is harmful to their health and well-being. We will not allow this to happen in other countries.\" German beer is the most popular drink in Europe. But it's not the only beer that can be consumed on a regular basis, according to a study published last year by the Institute for the Study of Alcohol in Germany (ISDA). The study also found that beer drinkers are more likely to binge drink than those who do not drink it. According to ISDA's research, alcohol is more commonly consumed in countries with high alcohol content than in those with low alcohol levels. That's why it is so important for consumers to avoid drinking alcohol when they can't afford to do so. It's also important to ensure that consumers have access to quality products that are safe and accessible to them. This is especially true for people with lower alcohol intake, which can lead to high blood pressure and lower cholesterol levels, as well as lower blood sugar levels and higher smoking rates. However, there is no evidence that alcohol has a negative effect on people's mental health. There is, for example, a link between alcohol use and cancer risk. If you are a person who drinks beer, then you have a very high risk of cancer. You are also a risk to yourself and your health, because you will be exposed to cancer and other diseases. And that's what alcohol can do to you. Alcohol is an important part of your diet, so you must be careful what you drink. What do you do when you're drinking beer? Do you try to abstain from alcohol? What does it mean for you? Is it good for your liver, kidneys, liver or liver? The answer is that you don't drink enough? You drink a lot of water and you lose your appetite. So, what does that tell you about your drinking habits? Well, that depends on how you live your life. I think the answer to this question is very different for me. How do I live my life? I'm not really sure. Do I really want to live a life that I can live with? If I do, I would like to stay in my normal life and be able to enjoy my beer without worrying about my liver and liver problems? That would be a great way to spend my time and my energy. Otherwise I wouldn't have any time to think about it at all. As long as I have my family and friends around me, my health is good and I am happy and healthy and can enjoy the company of my children and grandchildren. Who knows what will happen to me when I grow up? How long will it take me to get my hair cut? And what is it like for my kids to stop drinking? Can you tell me what's going on in their lives? Does it make you feel better about yourself? There are lots of different things that could be done to improve the quality of life in your own home? It is certainly a question that has been asked of me a number of times in recent years. One thing I know for sure: I've always been a big beer drinker. When I was in high school I drank beer all the time. My parents were very young and they were always very good drinkers. They were good people. Now they're not as good as my parents are now. These days I drink more beer than I used to. A lot more than a beer can and a glass of wine is enough to make me feel good about myself. At the same time, you can still enjoy your beer at home, even if it isn't the best beer for a long time before I get sick of it? My father was an alcoholic and he died of a heart attack when he drank too many years ago"

        "target": "German Minister Urges Peace in Georgia's Separatist Regions German Foreign Minister Steinmeier has called for an end to the \"spiral of violence\" between the Georgian government in Tbilisi and its Russian-backed rebel regions and presented a three-stage plan to break the deadlock. Steinmeier issued the plea as he began a tour of the region to sponsor a new peace plan aimed at calming the simmering tensions over Georgia's separatist regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. \"This is my appeal to break out of the spiral of violence. A lack of dialogue is not an option for the future,\" he said after meeting with his Georgian counterpart Eka Tkeshelashvili. Steinmeier, who chairs the so-called Group of Friends of the United Nations' Secretary on Georgia, is proposing a three-phase peace plan based on a mutual declaration of non-violence and repatriation of about 25,000 ethnic Georgians expelled from Abkhazia in the 1990s. Negotiations over the status of the two rebel regions, which have enjoyed de facto autonomy since the end of a civil war in 1994, was reserved for the final phase of negotiations. Tkeshelashvili said, \"The plan has great potential for success,\" but added that the most difficult thing would be to convince Russia. Peace talks remain distant The threat of armed conflict in the region last month has given urgency to international pressure for renewed peace talks, but Tbilisi, Moscow and the Russian-backed regions remain far apart on the basic premises for restarting peace talks. Officials in Tbilisi oppose a treaty on the non-use of force without guarantees on the return of refugees and the withdrawal of Russian peacekeeping forces base in the region. Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was skeptical of peace efforts Thursday. \"Signing of a treaty on the return of Georgian refugees to Abkhazia is unreal now, because such a return requires a calm situation,\" Lavrov was quoted as saying by news agency RIA-Novosti. \"We think that signing a treaty on the non-use of force without any preconditions is an absolutely unavoidable first step,\" he added. Experts see little hope for Steinmeier's plan Analysts do not expect anything conclusive from Steinmeier's trip, pointing to intransigence on the part of the Abkhaz President Sergei Bagapsh, who said he would \"not consider the plan.\" \"We are not going to discuss Abkhazia's status with anyone. We are building an independent, democratic state,\" Bagapsh was quoted by Georgian news agencies as saying. Speaking to journalists ahead of the meetings Thursday, Steinmeier admitted: \"We don't have any illusions about simple answers, but we cannot stand by without acting on this conflict. That would be irresponsible.\" From Tbilisi, the German minister is to travel to the Black Sea city of Batumi for talks with Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili and then to Abkhazia on Friday before ending his three-day tour in Moscow. Most citizens of the breakaway republics have been issued Russian passports and over 2,500 Russian peacekeeping troops patrol the region under a UN ceasefire agreement. In opposition to Georgia's bid to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Russia moved to strengthen diplomatic ties with the breakaway regions sharply aggravating tensions with the Georgian leadership in recent months.",
        "generated_story": "German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier to Discuss Separatist Regions of Georgia and Abkhazia The German foreign minister is to discuss a new peace plan with Georgia's government on Thursday. \"We are going to talk to the Georgian government about the possibility of a ceasefire in the region,\" he said in an interview with the German news agency RIA-Novosti. The meeting was to be held in Tbilisi, the capital of the South Ossetia region, in a meeting between the heads of state and the Russian foreign ministers. It is the first time that the two sides have agreed on a plan for peace in Georgia, which is part of Russia's plan to reunify the former Soviet republics after the fall of Soviet-backed Georgia in 1991. On Thursday, Russia and Georgia agreed to a deal on the future of Georgian-Russian relations, but the talks were postponed until the end of this month due to disagreements over the fate of Russian-Georgian relations. In a statement, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Sergei Lavrov said the new plan would be \"in the best interests of both sides,\" adding that Russia would not interfere in any way with any negotiations. Russia, however, said it would continue to support the plan, although it was not clear whether the deal would include the return of Georgians to their homeland. Moscow has also said that it is willing to consider the idea of reunification with their former East Georgia neighbors. Russian President Vladimir Putin has called for an end to Russian involvement in Georgian politics, saying he would like to see the country reunified with Russia. He also called on Georgia to return to its former self-styled \"Batsumi\" state, a name that has been used by the Soviet Union as a symbol of its rejection of Moscow and its support for the separatist movement in eastern Ukraine. Putin's visit to Georgia came just days after Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev announced that Moscow would no longer be a guarantor of any future peace deal between Georgia\u2019s separatist government and Moscow. \u201cWe will continue our dialogue,\u201d Putin said at the meeting, according to an official statement released by Russian state media. But he added that he did not see any reason why Russia should not be involved in this process. According to Moscow, Moscow is not interested in reuniting Georgia with its ex-Soviet neighbors, and has no interest in re-negotiating the terms of an interim peace accord with Moscow until after elections in November. That would mean that Georgia would have to give up its sovereignty and territorial integrity in return for Moscow's support. At the same time, Putin and his Russian counterpart, Sergei Bagapsh, are expected to hold talks with Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili in Moscow next week. They are also likely to attend the G20 summit in Buenos Aires in Argentina on Friday, where Putin is scheduled to make his first foreign trip since leaving office in January. Both leaders have said they are open to dialogue with each other. However, they have yet to agree on how to proceed with a peace process, with no clear agreement yet on what steps to take. As a result, there is still a lot of uncertainty about what will happen next. There is also the question of how long it will take for Russia to decide whether to allow the separatists to stay in power in their own country. This is a question that will be debated by both the West and in Russia as well as in other countries, including the United States and China. For the most part, it remains unclear whether Russia will accept the proposal. What is certain is that Putin will decide on his own accord on this issue. If he does not, he will have no say in how the negotiations will proceed."

        "target": "Maldives revokes state of emergency citing improved security situation The president of the Maldives has lifted a state of emergency following an outcry from the international community. The government says the measures are no longer necessary because the security threat has subsided. The government said Tuesday it had rescinded the emergency measures \"with immediate effect\" and that \"all fundamental rights that were suspended have been restored.\" President Yameen Abdul Gayoom declared the state of emergency one week ago after the discovery of a homemade bomb and a stash of weapons near his official residence. The finding followed an explosion on Gayoom's speedboat in September - an incident the government labeled an assassination attempt. The president was not hurt in the blast, but his wife, an aide and a bodyguard were injured. The emergency regulations, intended to be in place for 30 days, gave security forces wide-ranging search and arrest powers, and suspended citizens' basic rights. They drew criticism from former colonial power Britain as well as the United States, the European Union and neighboring Sri Lanka. Reading out a presidential decree revoking the emergency, Attorney General Mohamed Anil said there was no longer a threat to the Indian Ocean atoll nation. He said investigations into the September blast and the recovery of weapons had made good progress. The foreign ministry said a number of people had been arrested. Lawmakers also used the security regulations to fast-track the impeachment of Vice President Ahmed Adeeb, who stands accused of plotting the alleged attempts on the president's life. Impact on tourism Attorney General Anil said pressure from the international community, as well as \"the possible adverse impact on Maldives tourism and the economy,\" had also played a role in ending the state of emergency. Foreign tourists visiting the tropical nation, known for its luxury tourist resorts, palm-fringed beaches and coral reefs, contribute close to a third of the country's gross domestic product. The Maldives has had a rocky road to democracy since holding its first multiparty election in 2008. The country's first democratically elected leader, current opposition chief Mohamed Nasheed, was forced to step down in 2012 after a mutiny by security forces. In March, he was jailed for 13 years on terrorism charges in a trial the United Nations said was illegal. President Gayoom is under intense international pressure to release him. Nasheed's opposition Maldivian Democratic Party welcomed Tuesday's announcement. But said declaring the state of emergency in the first place was a political move designed to stop a rally planned for last week calling for Nasheed's freedom. \"It appears that Yameen is willing to make up threats about the nation's security in order to settle political scores,\" the party said in a statement, referring to the president. nm/kms (AP, AF, Reuters, dpa)",
        "generated_story": "Maldives lifts state of emergency after international criticism The Maldives has lifted a state-of-emergency in the country following criticism from the international community. The government of President Yameen Abdul Gayoom said on Thursday that it would no longer impose a curfew on the island nation. \"We will not impose any curfew,\" he said in a statement released by the government. He added that the curfew would not be lifted until the end of the month and that he would be able to travel to the capital, Male, to meet with his wife and two children. A spokesman for the opposition Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) denied the allegations, saying it was \"unacceptable\" to impose an emergency on a country that is struggling to cope with the influx of refugees and displaced people. Opposition leader Mohamed Nasheed, who has been in power for more than a year, said he was not aware of any restrictions on travel or travel. His spokesman, Ahmed Adeeb, called the move \"inappropriate and irresponsible\" and said the president had \"no intention of imposing any kind of curfew.\" The MDP spokesman also said there was no immediate threat to his party's presidential candidate, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, but that \"it is not acceptable\" for him to be in office at the same time as he is in charge of his own party, which has a majority in parliament. In an interview with The Associated Press, the former prime minister said his government would continue to monitor the situation, adding that there had been no change in its stance on human rights and the rule of law. However, he did not rule out the possibility of a return to normalcy in his country, where he has ruled since he took office in 2009. On Thursday, a coalition of opposition parties announced that they would hold a referendum on whether or not to allow the military to take over the post of president. It was the first time that a democratically elected government had ruled in such a way since the early 1990s, when a military coup ousted the democratically-elected president, Mahathir Mohamad, as the head of state. But the new government has yet to make a decision on what to do about the crisis, and it is unclear whether it will do anything about it. There have been a number of developments in recent days, including the release of an ex-president and his son, Yasser, from prison on charges of sedition and drug possession. Many of those arrested have also been released on bail, while others have fled to other countries, according to a report published in The New York Times. Some of them are still in jail. Others, however, have said they will be released if they are found guilty of crimes committed during their stay in prison. They say they have not been charged with any crime and are therefore not seeking to commit any other crimes. This is the latest development in an ongoing crackdown on dissent and anti-democracy protests. Last week, an international court ruled that political parties should be banned from holding rallies and rallies in protest against the crackdown."

Clubs officials say talks are ongoing in the hope Max Meyer will extend his contract. Schalke might struggle to retain 22-year-old midfielder Max Meyer when his contract runs out at the end of the season, at least according to recent media interviews from the club's sporting director, Christian Heidel. Speaking to German news agency dpa, Heidel confirmed that Meyer turned down an offer of a contract extension earlier in February. \"Max Meyer's agent received an extension offer on January 12 with a deadline of February 15, and informed us on February 15 via email that Max would not be accepting the offer because of the deadline imposed,\" Heidel told dpa. \"We have acknowledged this. For now, we no longer feel beholden to the terms of that offer, but that doesn't mean an extension is impossible either.\" Meyer was reportedly offered an annual salary in the region of \u20ac5.5 million ($6.7 million); it was the second contract he refused, following a less lucrative offer at the end of last season.

Speaking to Sport Bild magazine, meanwhile, Heidel sought to focus on Meyer's more important role at Schalke, his regular game time, arguing it might be in the youngster's best interests to stay at a club that needs him every week. \"[Coach] Domenico Tedesco has formed the team around him in such a way that there is now an ideal spot for Max.

Meyer's future is still unclear, but he said he was \"still ready\" to discuss the matter with his club's head coach, Domenico Tedesco, on Friday. He said that Meyer was still \"very close to the end of his contract,\" adding that he \"would like to see him return\" if he could be given the chance to make a return to his former club, Bayern Munich. But he added that it was up to him to decide whether or not he wanted to stay on. The German media reported on Saturday that the coach had already spoken to Meyer about his future, saying he had \"a lot of confidence\" in his ability to play in front of the goal-line and to be able to get the ball out to Goretzka. In a statement released on Sunday, Meyer said the decision was made \"at the last minute\" and that \"it was not a question of whether he would stay or leave.\" He also pointed out that there was a \"strong possibility\" that a decision would be made on whether Meyer would stick around for the long-term. On Friday, he also spoke about a possible move to sign a new contract with Bayern, which is expected to last until the summer of 2021. According to a report in German news agency dpa, the move would come as a result of a change in management at the top of management, with the new head of football, Christian H\u00fcller, to take over as coach. H\u00f6ller said Meyer could still be brought in to fill the void left by the departure of former Bayern midfielder Leon Goetze. However, it is unclear how long Meyer will be in charge of Bayern's midfield, as he is currently on loan at Stuttgart. It is not clear how much longer he will stay at Bayern. At the moment, there is no clear timetable for his return, and he has not been given any information on the exact date of when the transfer will take place. His comments come after a week of speculation over the possibility of Meyer returning to Bayern after being released from a two-year contract. Meyer, meanwhile, has expressed his interest in joining the team in a bid to improve his chances of making it into the first-team squad next season. There is also a chance that his departure could have a positive impact on his playing career. After all, his father is a former player who is now a director at a sports club in Germany's capital city of Cologne, where he currently works as an assistant coach for football's national team. If Meyer is to remain at his current position, then it will have to wait until after the season is over before he can make an official return. That is, until he returns to Germany, when he's due to start his new job in January. A move that will give him the opportunity to strengthen his squad is unlikely to happen until at least the second half of this season, according to Heidler. Speaking to DPA's sports website, Heidemann said, \"It's not something that we're going to do for a long time, because we don't have the time or the financial resources to invest in him. We're not ready for that right now.\" \"If he doesn't come back, we won't do that,\" said Heidenbuehrle, referring to an interview he did with German sports magazine \"Sport Bild\" last week in which he discussed his plans to bring Meyer back to Munich for next year's World Cup qualifier against the Red Bull Salzburg. 'We'll see what happens with him in Munich and then we will see if we can get him back on track,' he wrote in an article published earlier this week. German daily Bild quoted him as saying."

The record-breaking storm has battered the Bahamas and Cuba, while Hurricane Jose followed in its path. As one of the Atlantic Ocean's largest storms plowed through the Caribbean, leaving destruction in its wake, residents of the US state of Florida prepared for what could be the worst storm to make landfall in over a century. At least 17 people have been killed and dozens more injured across several island nations in the Caribbean. Irma is expected to be there second major hurricane to make landfall in the United States in less than two weeks. Hurricane Harvey struck Texas last week, killing more than 60 people and displacing roughly 1 million others. In the US territory of Puerto Rico, 1 million people \u2013 nearly one-third of the population \u2013 lost electricity during the storm, said Puerto Rican Governor Ricardo Rossello. \"It will be difficult to estimate how long the power outage will last,\" Rossello said. Later, officials confirmed that at least two people on the island had been killed by the storm's devastation. Two other major storms have developed in the Caribbean, namely Hurricane Jose and Hurricane Katia. Jose was east of the Lesser Antilles with maximum sustained winds of 120 miles person hour (195 kilometers person hour) as a hurricane watch was in effect for Antigua and Barbuda. Jose has followed the same path as Hurricane Irma, and was upgraded to a Category 4 on Friday by the US National Hurricane Center. Katia has remained relatively static, hovering off the coast of Mexico. Florida on edge Florida Governor Rick Scott said 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain were expected after Irma made landfall at the weekend as he urged evacuations during a press conference on Friday. Nearly 700,000 people have been asked to leave Miami and its surrounding areas. \"Today is the day to do the right thing for your family and get inland for safety... Do not ignore evacuation orders. All Floridians should be prepared to evacuate soon,\" Scott said. Read more: How to reduce risks from mega-storms? \"I know many of you are stuck in traffic, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s very frustrating. Evacuations are not convenient but they are absolutely meant to keep you safe,\" he added. On Friday, US President Donald Trump described Irma as a storm of \"absolutely historic destructive potential.\" Trump also on Friday signed a $15 billion (13.5 billion euro) hurricane relief package passed by Congress, which also raises the debt ceiling and postpones the possibility of a shutdown of government funding until December. Downgraded to an \"extremely dangerous\" Category 4 but still packing winds of 185 mph (300 kph), Irma moved between the north coast of Cuba and the Bahamas as it neared the Florida Keys and the southern Florida Peninsula. 'Major hurricane' Irma will have a \"truly devastating\" impact on the state's southern coastal areas when it slams into Florida, said US Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) chief Brock Long.

It will be truly devastating,\" Long told CNN. \"The entire southeastern United States better wake up and pay attention. Death and destruction At least 11 people have been killed and dozens more injured after Irma tore through the French Caribbean, Barbuda, Anguilla and the British Virgin Islands. Amid widening criticism from residents in British territories that not enough was done to safeguard people from the storm, British Foreign Office Minister Alana Duncan said London has sent tents, vehicles and other relief equipment. \"Anguilla received the hurricane's full blast. The initial assessment is that the damage has been severe and in places critical,\" Duncan told the British Parliament. Thousands displaced Antigua and Barbuda Prime Minister Gaston Browne said nearly every building on Barbuda was damaged when the hurricane's core crossed almost directly over the island early Wednesday and about 60 percent of the island's roughly 1,400 people were homeless.

        "generated_story": "Hurricane Irma in the Caribbean: A \"truly devastating\" storm, US President Donald Trump has declared a state of emergency for Puerto Rico after Hurricane Irma made landfall on the island of the Lesser Antilles on Sunday. The US government said the storm was \"a truly devastating storm\" and urged the public to prepare for the worst. \"This is a truly terrible storm,\" the White House said in a statement, adding that the United States would be \"very, very careful\" in its response to the hurricane, which is expected to make landfall later this week. In addition, the US State Department said it would continue to monitor and monitor the situation as needed. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Monday that \"it will be extremely difficult\" to predict the exact path of Irma, given that it is forecast to be a Category 4 storm. He also said that there was a \"significant chance\" that Irma could become a tropical storm and that he would \"make landfall very quickly.\" \"We are very concerned about the long-term health and well-being of our citizens,\" Tillerson told reporters in an interview on CNN's \"New York Times\" program. Trump also called on Puerto Rican Prime Minister Ricardo Rossello to step down from his post as the country's prime minister, saying that his government would not allow him to take over the reins of power from the federal government. On Sunday, Trump said he was going to call a special emergency meeting in Washington, D.C. to assess the damage caused by Irma and to provide an \"urgent response.\" The president's announcement came a day after the U.S. government reported that Hurricane Harvey had caused damage to homes and businesses in Florida and Texas, as well as in Haiti, Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Officials said they were still assessing the extent of damage from Harvey, but that they had no immediate plans to move forward with evacuations. Meanwhile, a federal appeals court in New York has ruled that Harvey and Irma will not be allowed to enter the Gulf of Mexico until at least the end of next week, according to a report released by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The FEMA chief, Brock Long, told the Associated Press on Tuesday that a total of $1.4 billion (2.6 billion euros) had been spent to deal with the aftermath of Harvey's landfall. A federal judge in Miami ruled in favor of evacuees and ordered an immediate halt to aid to those affected by Harvey. But the government has yet to decide whether to impose a travel ban on people traveling to or staying at the affected islands, or allow them to return to their homes. It is still unclear how long it will take for Harvey or Irma to reach the islands. There is also the possibility of an extension of travel restrictions for those who are in need of assistance, such as those living in Barbuda and Antigua, where Hurricane Jose has been making its way through the western Caribbean. At the same time, there is concern that Maria could make it into the British Virgin Islands, and there are fears that Puerto Ricans could be forced to flee their islands as a result of Maria's powerful winds and heavy rains."

        "target": "Opinion: Yet another crisis for Merkel A summery turquoise blazer and fresh makeup could not hide the fact that Angela Merkel was \"not amused.\" Now she is needed as a champion in the fight against populist forces, DW's Kay-Alexander Scholz writes. Britain-EU divorce proceedings will probably last about two years. Until then, the status quo must be maintained, German Chancellor Angela Merkel emphasized in her press statement. If she is no longer chancellor after the upcoming parliamentary elections in 2017, then others will have to live with the consequences of Brexit. But that is not what she is actually thinking. It is not coincidental that foreign ministers and government leaders are visiting Berlin in the coming days. They want to discuss how things will continue. Berlin, under Merkel's chancellorship, has become a center of power outside of Brussels. Difficult international politics The Brexit decision has disrupted Europe's equilibrium. Germany has lost an important ally on European issues related to economic growth and budgetary discipline. Now, France presumably will be the next to raise its voice against Maastricht Treaty criteria. If the Netherlands and Denmark also decide to leave the EU, Germany will become isolated, as Eastern Europe is not as tight with Germany as it once was. Poland now plays a key role for the Balkan nations and the Visegrad Group (Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic and Slovakia). And Poland is still annoyed about Merkel's refugee policy. What about Germany's populists? They're giddy with glee as they feel that their anti-establishment policies have been validated. They are teaching potential AfD (Alternative for Germany) voters a lesson: \"Here, have a look: it's possible. There is always an alternative. Vote for us!\" Those are exactly the words that protest voters want to hear. Germany's AfD has forged ties with other right-wing parties in Vienna, Paris, The Hague and London. They are all pursuing a \"European\" plan to gain power. The recent Austrian presidential election was significant, as the populist candidate lost by a very narrow margin; in fact, the final election results are still undecided as they are being contested. The Brexit vote was also triggered by populist powers. Domestically difficult Many populists believe that the stronger populism becomes - no matter where - the more advantages there would be for individual parties of their persuasion. Many would also like to see Donald Trump as US president. That is how AfD may become even stronger in Germany, which also means that political majorities would fluctuate even more. Will there be enough seats after the next election for a Christian Democrat and Green coalition, or will yet another grand coalition made up of Christian Democrats and Social Democrats be formed? Can Angela Merkel change course? Can she counter the trend with a new political model in Europe and Germany? Or do we stand on the edge of a new era, a \"political revolution,\" as the AfD calls it? Until now, Europe has survived attacks on its currency (euro crisis), the principle of peaceful coexistence (Crimea crisis) and its open borders policy (refugee crisis). Merkel deserves credit for defending these values, despite mistakes that have been made along the way. The outcome of the Brexit crisis is, however, still open. Have something to say?

        "generated_story": "Merkel and the Brexit Crisis in Europe Angela Merkel and her conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) are at loggerheads over the future of the European Union. The German chancellor is facing a \"Brexit crisis\" as she prepares to take office in Berlin on Sunday. Merkel's conservative party, the Alternative for Germany (AfD), is set to form a coalition government with the Social Democrats and Greens in the German parliament. It is expected to have a majority in parliament by the end of this year, but the AfD, which is opposed to the EU's single market, is not likely to be able to win the majority of seats in next year's parliamentary elections. That's because it will be the first time that a major European country will have to decide whether it wants to leave the bloc or stay in it at all. In a statement released on Friday, Merkel said that she was \"deeply concerned\" about the current political situation in Germany. \"I am deeply concerned,\" she said, adding that \"it is very difficult for me to see how this can be resolved in a way that is acceptable to all of us.\" The CDU is currently in talks with Germany's federal government on the issue of migration and asylum for migrants, while the Greens and Green parties are seeking asylum in Brussels and London. German Chancellor Merkel has said she will not allow migrants to enter the country without a visa, despite the fact that they are not allowed to do so in other EU countries. She has also called for an end to visa-free travel for asylum seekers and refugees in EU member states. On the other hand, she has promised to open the doors to asylum-seekers in countries where they do not have the right to apply for refugee status, such as the United States, Canada, Mexico, or even the UK. But she is also willing to give asylum to people who are already living in fear of deportation, as well as to those who have already been deported from their country of origin. As a result, Germany is now facing the prospect of a new influx of refugees, many of whom are fleeing persecution in their home countries to seek asylum abroad. This is a very different situation from the one in which refugees and migrants are being persecuted and persecuted in many other European countries, including the US, Britain, France, Spain, Italy, Portugal, Greece, and Spain. And it's not just refugees who face persecution and persecution. There are also migrants who want to flee their homes in order to find a better life in this country. Many of them are refugees from other countries and have fled to other parts of Europe. They have come to Germany in search of safety and security. For them, it is the only way to get out of their current situation. So far, they have managed to make it through the refugee crisis without having to go through a refugee camp. However, that doesn't mean they're going to stay there forever. What they want is for the refugees to return to their homeland and be reunited with their families. If that's the case, then they will leave Germany and move to another country where there is no chance of reunification. At the same time, there will still be a lot of uncertainty about what will happen when they return home. How long will it take to reunite the two countries that have been in conflict for so long? DW's Kay-Alexander Scholz, a member of DW, reports that Merkel is planning to hold a press conference at Berlin's Chancellery next week."

        "target": "Reports: Merkel to run for fourth term as German chancellor German Chancellor Angela Merkel has confirmed that she will stand for the chancellery in the 2017 election, German media reports. The Christian Democrat Leader (CDU) first took office in 2005. After months of speculation, German Chancellor Angela Merkel reportedly told her fellow Christian Democrats (CDU) in Berlin on Sunday that she is prepared to lead the party into next year's election. An official statement is expected from Merkel at 7 p.m. local time (1800 UTC) on Sunday. The 62-year-old has faced a number of difficulties in recent months, from criticism over her handling of the migration crisis to falling support amid a rise in right-wing populist sentiment. Since taking office in 2005, however, Merkel has also been praised for navigating Europe's largest economy through the financial and eurozone crises. According to an Emnid survey published in the German newspaper \"Bild am Sonntag\" 55 percent of Germans are in favor of Merkel remaining head of the German government for another four years. Thirty-nine percent said they were against her re-election. Sign of stability Should she be elected next September, another full four-year term would put Merkel on a par with her mentor Helmut Kohl who set the post-war record and presided over the Fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. In light of the UK's shock vote to leave the European Union in June and Donald Trump's election last week as US president, Merkel's re-election is likely to be welcomed in many capitals as a sign of stability. During his final visit to Berlin this week, US President Barack Obama said that if he were able to, he would vote for his longtime partner and friend. In an interview with German magazine \"Spiegel\" and broadcaster \"ARD,\" Obama said: \"She has great credibility, and she is willing to fight for those values in a way that is very, very important.\" \"I'm glad that she's there and I think the German people should appreciate her. Certainly, I've appreciated her as a partner.\" Winning back votes With the less that a year until Germany heads to the polls, Merkel's CDU is now turning its efforts to wooing back disenchanted voters who have left the conservative camp to support the right-wing populists, Alternative for Germany (AfD). Formed as a Euro-sceptic party in 2013, the AfD won 4.7 percent of the popular vote in the last federal elections in 2013, just falling short of the 5 percent threshold required to enter the Bundestag - Germany's lower house of parliament. After benefiting from the rise in europsceptic, anti-immigration sentiment, seemingly sweeping across western Europe, the party now holds seats in nine of Germany's 16 states.",
        "generated_story": "Merkel's re-election bid comes amid growing populist sentiment in Germany Chancellor Angela Merkel is set to run again for a third term in office in a row with her conservative Christian Democrat Leader, Helmut Kohl, on Sunday. Merkel, who has been in power since 2005, is expected to seek a fourth term as chancellor. The conservative chancellor is widely seen as a strong contender for the post of prime minister in the coming months. She is seen by many as one of Germany's most popular politicians, with a reputation for being able to stand up to the right-wing populists in her own party, the Christian Democratic Leader (CDU). The CDU leader, however, has said she will not run for another term. \"I'm not going to be a chancellor anymore,\" she said in an interview with Bild am Sonntag, a German newspaper published on Saturday. In the past, Merkel has faced criticism over her handling of the refugee crisis, which has led to mass deportations of thousands of asylum seekers and forced the closure of refugee camps across the country. On Sunday, Chancellor Merkel will face a second term, this time as head of state, if she is to win the next election. Her party's parliamentary majority will be reduced to two from the current three, and her party will have to form a coalition government with the Social Democrats (SPD) and the Greens (CSU) in order to secure a majority of seats in next year's federal elections. This would be the first time that the chancellor has run against the SPD in parliament since she was elected chancellor in 2005. German media reported on Monday that Merkel would seek to strengthen her grip on power, but that she would not be allowed to do so because of her opposition to Trump's immigration policies. According to a report published by the German news agency Bild, German chancellor Merkel's campaign team had been preparing for an election campaign in which they would try to persuade voters to give her a chance. But the party has so far been unable to convince voters that it is willing to take on the president's agenda. It is not clear whether the new chancellor will take office until the end of this year, or whether she intends to stick to her campaign platform. A number of senior party officials have already said that they expect Merkel to stay on as party leader. However, they have not ruled out the possibility of a run-off election in 2018, despite the fact that many of them are still undecided on whether or not they will run. They have also said they are open to an alternative candidate for chancellor, as well as the idea of an Alternative for Germany (AfD), which is a far-right political party that is opposed to President Donald Trump. Both the AfD and SPD have been running on a platform of anti-immigration policies, while the CSU have said it will continue to pursue a more moderate stance on immigration. One of their main campaign promises is that Germany will no longer be governed by a \"one-party state\" government. That is, it would only be possible if the Chancellor was to step down from her post as Chancellor in 2021. After all, she has already been chancellor for five years. What is the alternative? The SPD's position in government? It's unclear. There is no clear answer to this question at the moment as to what the future will hold for Merkel or for her successor. If she wins the election, there will likely be no change in leadership. For now, Germany is still divided over the issue of immigration and refugees. Many of those who want to leave the European Union are in favor of staying in their home countries, such as Poland, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Turkey and Romania. At the same time, many other countries are also considering a return to Germany, including the United States, Canada and even the EU. These are the countries that have long been part of Europe's largest trading bloc. Germany has a long tradition of welcoming migrants and welcoming them to its shores. So far, that has not been the case in any way. And it's not just the US that wants to keep migrants out of its borders. Some of these migrants have expressed concern about the influx of migrants. Others are looking for jobs in other European countries. As far as migration is concerned, most migrants are not interested in entering Germany at all. More than a quarter of all migrants from other EU countries have left the bloc in recent years, according to German government figures. Only a handful of people have applied for refugee status in Europe. Most people who do not have the means to apply for asylum are currently living in countries with high unemployment rates and low birth rates. Those who are seeking asylum in this country are likely to have a difficult time finding a place to live and find a new home. Despite the growing popularity of refugees and migrants, some people are skeptical of Merkel and are concerned about her ability to hold onto their passports and work as an asylum-seeker for longer than two decades.

        "target": "NFL stars defy Donald Trump's call for boycott Baltimore Ravens and Jacksonsville Jaguars players \"took a knee\" during the national anthem after Trump urged fans to boycott football matches. The kneeling protest, to highlight social injustice, has stepped up a gear. Hundreds of National Football League (NFL) stars protested President Donald Trump's call for fans to boycott the league by refusing to stand for the US national anthem this weekend, starting Sunday's game between the Baltimore Ravens and Jacksonsville Jaguars. A number of other players locked arms in solidarity ahead of the game at Wembley Stadium in London. Jacksonville Jaguars' owner Shahid Khan, who last year donated one million dollars\u00a0(840,000 euros) to the Trump campaign, locked his arms with players - a rare scene, as owners almost never take to the field. US media reported that about 200 players on Sunday sat, knelt or raised their fists in defiance of Trump's comments. In one of the most memorable moments, singer Rico LaVelle took a knee and held up a fist at the last line of the Star Spangled Banner ahead of the game between the Detriot Lions and Atlanta Falcons. The protest came in response to Trump's tweets on Sunday morning urging fans to boycott NFL games to pressure the league into firing or suspending players to kneel in protest during the national anthem. In an early morning tweet, Trump posted: \"If NFL fans refuse to go to games until players stop disrespecting our Flag and Country, you will see change take place fast. Fire or suspend!\" \"NFL attendance and ratings are WAY DOWN. Boring games yes, but many stay away because they love our country. League should back US,\" he added. Later, the president said that his rant \"has nothing to do with race,\" despite the fact that the origins of the protest are to do with police brutality against minorities, especially African Americans. Trump said his comments were instead about \"respect for our country and respect for our flag.\" Trump's spat with US professional sports began at a Republican rally in Alabama on Friday, when the president attacked activist NFL players for kneeling or sitting during the national anthem, labelling them as \"sons of bitches.\" \"Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, 'Get that son of a bitch off the field right now... he is fired'?\" Trump told a crowd of cheering supporters. That day, basketball star Stephen Curry, the top player for California's Golden State Warriors, announced that he would not be attending a traditional White House reception honoring the National Basketball Association champions. The kneeling protest was started by former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick who refused to stand for the anthem back in 2016. Kaepernick's gesture came amid a spate of deadly police shootings of black men and was aimed at drawing more attention to treatment of minorities in the US. However, Kaepernick has since become a free agent, after failing to be signed by a new team for the new NFL season. NFL executives decry Trump's calls Trump also drew the ire of senior NFL executives and team owners. Responding to Trump's tweets, Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti, said he \"100 percent\" supported his players' decision to kneel during the anthem. Robert Kraft, the owner of the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots, who is also a close friend of Trump, said in a statement on Sunday that he was deeply disappointed by the president's comments in Alabama. Kraft defended players' rights to \"peacefully affect social change and raise awareness in a manner that they feel is most impactful,\" and said that sports were a unifying force in the US. \"Our political leaders could learn a lot from the lessons of teamwork and working together toward a common goal,\" he said. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, who has taken much of the heat for Kaepernick's failure to find a new team, was also quick to condemn Trump's comments.

The statement came after the NFL announced on Sunday that it would no longer sanction players who protest the playing of the National Anthem. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said on Twitter that \"the president is deeply disturbed by what he has said,\" adding that he would not sanction any player who kneels in protest. \"The president has made it clear he is not going to sanction anyone who disrespects the flag,\" the statement said, referring to NFL star Colin Kaepernick, who has been kneeling for more than a year and a half to protest racial inequality and police brutality in the United States. Trump has also called for a boycott of NFL teams, including the San Francisco 49ers and the New England Patriots, to be lifted from the league's collective bargaining agreement. In a tweet on Saturday, Trump said that NFL owners should \"respect the rights of our players, coaches, and fans.\" The tweet came a day after Trump criticized NFL owner Robert Kraft for calling for his team to boycott the upcoming Super Bowl, which is set to take place on Sept. 11. He also criticized the team's owner, Steve Bisciotti, for not doing enough to stop the protests. Last week, President Trump tweeted that his administration was considering a ban on the use of racial slurs against black people in public places, such as schools, hospitals and sports stadiums. His comments came as the Trump administration announced plans to impose a $1.5 billion fine on a group of black athletes who have knelt during Sunday's game against the Atlanta Falcons. It was the first time in NFL history that a black player had been charged with a crime, according to a report by The Washington Post. That's a violation of a federal law that prohibits racial discrimination in sports, but not against white people. And it's not just the black community that is at the center of this controversy. There's also the issue of whether or not the players should be fined or suspended for kneeling during a game. This is the second time this year that Trump is calling on black men and women to do the same. During the presidential campaign in 2016, he called on his supporters to \"stand up and show respect for our flag and our country.\" In addition to the criticism of his comments, a number of other players have also been critical of Trump. One of them, Stephen Curry, said in an interview with the \"Washington Post\" that they were \"disgusting\" and \"unacceptable.\" \"I don't think that's the case at all,\" Curry said. But he also said he didn't believe the comments were being made in a way that would hurt the country's image. According to an article published in The New York Times on Monday, \"Trump's comments are not a reflection of what I think is happening in our society today. They are an attack on our values and we have a responsibility to make sure that we uphold the values of freedom and equality in this country and that our citizens are respected and respected by our elected officials.\" On Twitter, one user wrote: \"This is a very serious issue and it is something that should not be politicized.\" Another user said the comment was made \"inappropriate and inappropriate.\" A third user also wrote that, in response to comments made by Trump, it was inappropriate for Trump to use the term \"white nationalist\" to refer to him as a \"racist\" or \"anti-Semite. What is it about White nationalists who want to say about this issue that makes them so angry? \"It's about white nationalists,\" said one Twitter user. Another person said \"White nationalists\" in reference to Trump and his support of President Barack Obama. However, another user suggested that there was no such thing as an anti-immigrant sentiment in his mind. Other users also pointed out that some of those comments could be misinterpreted as \"inflammatory.\" One user, however, did not comment on whether the tweet was directed at Trump directly. A second user pointed to Twitter's comment that said Trump \"is a white nationalist who doesn't stand up for himself and believes in free speech and freedom of speech,\" while another said it wasn't.

Greece had previously voiced reservations about the proposal. The proposed mission to be discussed at a NATO defense ministers meeting in Brussels on Thursday comes days after German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutolgu said they would raise the issue of refugees with the Alliance. According to a Reuters report citing a senior German official, initially reticent Greece has now given the green light for the operation, which could see NATO assets deployed in the Aegean in a mostly intelligence and reconnaissance role. Under the proposal, which would need to be approved by Alliance members, NATO maritime assets would provide information to national coastguards and the EU border agency Frontex to combat illegal smugglers using rickety boats to bring migrants to Europe. Turkey would then take back the refugees, as envisioned as part of a 3 billion-euro ($3.2 billion) EU-Turkey deal agreed to last year. According to German sources, the mission would not be similar to the NATO mission in the Mediterranean intercepting migrant boats making the dangerous run from Libya to Italy. However, NATO ships could intervene in emergency situations to save passengers. \"It is not NATO's remit to push back or stop refugee boats,\" the official told Reuters. The mission would use assets from the Alliance's standing naval group, a permanent reaction force deployed in the Mediterranean. The naval group's current flagship is the German combat support ship \"Bonn.\" Denmark has already said it would provide additional ships to the mission, according to the official. However, it is unclear whether NATO members will approve the mission which may fall outside the bounds of the Alliance's mandate. Complicating matters is a long-running maritime dispute between Greece and Turkey over sovereignty in the Aegean, where the two NATO members' jets regularly engage in dogfights. Turkey has taken in more than 2.5 million Syrian refugees, and is a major transit point for migrants from Asia and Africa. More than a million migrants and refugees reached Europe last year, many making the dangerous boat journey from Turkey to Greece by boat. So far this year, more than 340 have perished in the cold waters trying to reach Europe. cw/msh (AFP, dpa, Reuters)",

The move is part of a NATO plan to tackle the problem of illegal migration to Europe. Germany and Turkey agreed on Friday to cooperate on the deployment of the NATO-led anti-migrant force, which will be deployed in Greece, Turkey, Greece and Cyprus by the end of this year. \"We will work closely with the Greek government and the Turkish government,\" Merkel said in a joint press conference with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Brussels. Merkel's comments came as Turkey's military chief of staff met with German officials in Ankara to discuss the issue of migrants and refugees. Erdogan said the move was \"part and parcel\" with Germany's commitment to the alliance, adding that \"we will continue to work together on this issue.\" The German chancellor also said that Germany would cooperate with Turkey in its fight against illegal migrants, including those fleeing persecution in Syria and Iraq. German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel said on Thursday that Turkey was ready to take action against the smugglers, but that it would be up to Germany to decide whether or not to deploy the force. He also called on Turkey to step up its cooperation with EU member states in tackling the influx of refugees from the Middle East and North Africa. A spokesman for the EU's border agency, Frontex, told reporters that the German government was willing to share the burden of dealing with migrants. However, he said, \"Turkey is not going to allow us to do that. We will not allow it to happen.\" Germany, the European Union's largest trading partner, said it was looking into the situation in Turkey. It is also looking at the possibility of expanding its presence in Europe, as well as in Africa, where it is believed to be the largest single source of migrant arrivals. Turkey has also expressed concern about the threat posed by Syrian refugees fleeing conflict in eastern Syria. In a statement, Turkish Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Turkey had \"no plans\" to send troops to Syria, and that Ankara had no plans to use force against migrants fleeing the conflict there. She added that Turkish officials were \"very concerned\" about what would happen if the migrants were to return to their home countries."

Secretary of State John Kerry is due to arrive in Cairo on Monday where he is expected to urge Hamas to accept a cease-fire agreement offered by Egypt that would halt nearly two weeks of fighting with Israel. Meanwhile, the death toll in Gaza continues to rise. Medics on Monday said the number of Palestinian deaths in Gaza has risen to more than 501 since fighting intensified on Jul 8. Most of the dead are civilians. On the Israeli side, 13 soldiers were killed inside Gaza on Sunday, raising the number of soldiers killed since a ground operation began late on Thursday to 18. Two Israeli civilians also died in mortar and rocket attacks. The Israeli army said that more than 10 militants from Gaza were shot dead on Monday after infiltrating southern Israel. According to army spokespeople, two squads of militants were killed after tunneling into Israel. Israel's UN ambassador Ron Prosor, meanwhile, denied a claim by Hamas that an Israeli soldier had been kidnapped by the Islamist group, saying: \"Those rumurs are untrue.\" US President Barack Obama expressed concern about the rising death toll of civilians in a telephone call Sunday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, according to a White House statement. The US State Department confirmed late Sunday that two US citizens were killed in Gaza violence and released their names, but did not immediately disclose their occupations. US media reported, however, that the two were American members of the Israeli Defense Force, citing relatives and friends. \"We can confirm the deaths of US citizens Max Steinberg and Sean Carmeli in Gaza,\" spokesperson Jen Psaki said in a two-sentence statement.

Kerry is expected to hold talks with Hamas' chief negotiator, Ron Prosor, ahead of a visit to Cairo by US President Barack Obama on Wednesday. The two sides have been at odds for months over the fate of the ceasefire, which was brokered by the United Nations and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). Kerry, a former US ambassador to the Middle East, is scheduled to attend a meeting with the Egyptian prime minister, who is set to make his first trip to Egypt since leaving his post as US secretary of state in January. \"We have a lot of work to do,\" Kerry said at a news conference with Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman, adding that he was \"very optimistic\" about the prospects for an end to violence between Hamas and Israeli forces in Gaza. Israel, however, said it was not ready to give up the fight against Hamas, and that it had no immediate plans to impose any restrictions on the group's activities. Netanyahu, meanwhile, has said he will not allow Hamas to continue its attacks on his country. He has also said that Hamas would not be allowed to carry out attacks against the US-backed peace process in Egypt. Obama has called on Israel to halt its military operations against Gaza, saying it would be \"unacceptable\" if Hamas continued to use rockets and rockets against Israel. On Tuesday, Kerry will hold a press conference at the White House in Washington, D.C. to outline his plans for the future of Gaza and Israel's security forces, as well as the conditions for peace talks between the two countries, including the possibility of an Israeli-Palestinian peace accord. In a statement, Obama said: \"The United States will continue to work closely with Israel in its efforts to achieve a peaceful resolution to this conflict.\" Kerry's visit comes as Israel is gearing up to launch its first major military offensive since the end of last year's war on terror. It will be the first military operation since Israel withdrew its troops from Gaza in 2006, following a failed attempt by Hamas in 2007 to retake the territory in 2008 and 2009. Last year, the Israeli government announced that Israel would no longer be able to provide arms to Hamas as long as it did not provide them with weapons of mass destruction. A ceasefire would have to be agreed to by both sides. However, it is not clear how long Kerry and Netanyahu will meet, if at all, to reach an agreement on a peace deal. Key points of contention include the Palestinian leadership's refusal to recognize Israel as an occupying power and its failure to respect the sovereignty of its own citizens. Israeli President Ashraf Ghani said in an interview with The Washington Post that the Palestinians were \"not ready\" to accept the terms of any ceasefire."

        "target": "A borderline war The crisis in Syria is in danger of drawing in neighboring countries. Despite the Syrian government's immediate apology, the shelling on the Turkish border has led to concerns about possible escalation. These weren't the first incidents on the Syrian-Turkish border, but the fact that several people on the Turkish side were killed by Syrian shells on Wednesday (03.10.2012) has brought the conflict between the two countries to a new level. It has led the Turkish military to retaliate for the first time. Several people were killed when Turkey shelled Syrian territory. But neither Turkey, which is a member of NATO, nor Syria would benefit from a broader conflict. An adviser to the Turkish president tweeted, \"Turkey has no interest in a war with Syria.\" Volker Perthes, director of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs in Berlin, agrees: \"Assad has no interest in an escalation,\" he told DW. \"That can be seen from the fact that the Syrian information minister apologized and expressed his regret over the victims immediately after the attack on Turkish territory.\" Perthes doesn't think it's likely that the Syrian President, Bashar Assad, wants to provoke Turkey to intervene in Syria. \"That would only accelerate the fall of his regime,\" he said. It's not yet clear who was responsible for the shelling. According to Syria's ally, Russia, it was a \"tragic accident.\" Relationship damaged The armed incidents on the Syrian-Turkish border have been going on for months. According to Amnesty International, some 300,000 Syrians have left their country since the start of the uprising against Assad, and many of them have fled to Turkey. The relationship between the two countries, which used to be close, has deteriorated dramatically, and the Turkish government is now openly supporting the Syrian opposition. \"Turkey is itself a player in the Syrian conflict,\" said Perthes. \"It provides shelter for many refugees and it's through Turkey that supplies come for the opposition.\" NATO has lined up behind Turkey and told Syria to end its \"flagrant violations of international law.\" Call for 'great discretion' The German chancellor, Angel Merkel, has also positioned herself alongside Turkey. \"We call on all parties to show great discretion,\" she said in Berlin. The foreign minister, Guido Westerwelle, declared that everything must be done to deescalate the situation, so that the Syrian conflict did not turn into a conflagration in the region. Indeed, the Syrian crisis is not only spreading to Turkey, but also to Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon. According to Perthes, \"The neighboring countries are partly victims and partly instigators. Jordan too has taken in refugees and supplies the rebels. On the other hand, Iraq has tended to support the government of Bashar Assad.\" Even so, he said, all the neighboring countries had an interest in ensuring the conflict was confined to Syria. Appeal to the international community But the number of Syrian refugees is rising by the day. Ruth J\u00fcttner, a Middle East expert with Amnesty International, believes this will continue in future months. \"It's important that the countries bordering on Syria are supported by the international community in providing accommodation, medical and psychological care and schooling for children,\" she told DW. It's an appeal she directs especially to European countries. The shelling on the Syrian-Turkish border has made it more likely that there will be armed conflict between Syria and its neighbors. According to Perthes, \"It's probably the case that political resistance in Turkey to intervention in Syria is decreasing right now.\"",
        "generated_story": "Turkey's response to the Syrian-Turkish conflict is \"not likely,\" German Foreign Minister Volker Perthes told DW on Thursday. \"Turkey is not likely to act in the interests of its own interests,\" he said, adding that the country's military and security forces were ready to take action. The German Institute for International and Security Affairs (DISS) in Berlin said on Friday that Turkey would not intervene militarily in Syria. DW reported that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had called for a ceasefire between Syrian President Bashar Assad and his Syrian counterpart, President Assad, in an interview with DW. Erdogan has also said that he would be willing to step down if the two sides agreed to an end to a conflict that has killed more than 1.5 million people since the start of the conflict in March 2011. In a statement released by the DISS, the German government said it was \"very unlikely\" that Ankara would step in to help Assad in his fight against terrorism. However, DW quoted a senior German diplomat as saying, \"We don't think Turkey is going to stand by Assad's side and allow him to continue to rule Syria.\" The diplomat also pointed out that \"the Syrian regime is in no position to make any kind of peace agreement with the United States.\" \"It's not possible,\" the diplomat added, referring to Turkey's support for Assad as well as the US' support. Turkey has been accused of supporting the Assad regime, but the government has denied the accusations. On Thursday, German foreign minister Guido Westerwelle said Turkey had \"no intention\" of stepping in, saying that it would only act \"in the best interest of Turkey and its interests\" if Assad were to be allowed to stay in power. He also called on the international community to ensure that Syria's armed forces did not use chemical weapons against the rebels. Germany's foreign ministry said in a report published on Saturday that a deal had been reached between the Turkish and Syrian militaries to end the fighting. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is visiting Turkey for the first time since taking office in January 2011, said the deal was a \"non-negotiable\" one. But she added that she was not convinced that Assad would take any action at all. According to DW, a number of senior Turkish officials, including the head of state of Syria, have expressed concern about the possibility of Assad being forced out of power, and said they were \"deeply concerned\" about his ability to carry out his plans."

Despite not attending the UN-brokered meeting, the militias have agreed to \"a ceasefire on all fronts,\" according to a statement issued by Islamist group Fajr Libya (Libya Dawn). The only condition is that \"the other parties respect the truce.\" The announcement came hours after the United Nations declared that Libya's warring factions had agreed to a roadmap for forming a unity government. Nearly four years after a NATO-backed revolt saw Moammar Gadhafi removed from power, two rival governments each backed by different groups of militias have plunged the country back into chaos and threatened all-out civil war. After the elected government of Prime Minister Abdullah al-Thinni was forced out of Tripoli by Libya Dawn, it was forced to move to the far eastern city of Tobruk while Libya Dawn reinstated the old parliament known as the GNC. The fighting and violence has displaced hundreds of thousands of civilians, left hundreds killed and thousands wounded. Most foreign diplomats fled the country and shut their embassies last year. The Tobruk government, as well as a few other factions who favor a peaceful resolution, came to Geneva to work on \"confidence-building measures,\" which includes the release of detainees from both sides, opening closed ports and securing safe freedom of movement around the country. es/bw (AP, AFP, Reuters)",

He was killed in clashes with pro-government forces in eastern Libya on Sunday, according to a statement released by the group's spokesman. A UN peace envoy said on Monday that the ceasefire was in place \"for the first time since the beginning of this year, and for the second time in as many months.\" The statement came after a day of talks between the two sides, which began in Tripoli on Saturday and ended on Tuesday, with both sides saying they had reached an agreement on the terms of an interim ceasefire. Both sides said they would continue the talks until the end of February, when a new transitional government would be established. In the meantime, Libya's armed forces will continue to monitor the situation, a UN spokesman said. UN envoy Ban Ki-moon, who is in Geneva to attend the Geneva talks, said he was \"very optimistic\" about the truce, adding that it was a \"good sign.\" \"The ceasefire is a good sign,\" Ban said in an interview with the Associated Press, referring to the UN's special rapporteur on Libya, Zeid Ra\u2019ad al Hussein. \u201cWe are hopeful that we will be able to reach a peace agreement,\u201d he added. Ban also called for an end to violence, saying he would like to see a peaceful transition to civilian rule. But he also said that he did not want to give up his position as president of a country that is suffering from a lack of political stability. On the other hand, he said, \"I don't see any reason why we can't have peace in this country. We are not going to allow this to happen.\" Ban's announcement came as a result of renewed violence between anti-Gaddafi forces and rebels in western Libya. It is not clear how many civilians have been killed or injured in fighting between rebels and security forces, but it is believed that at least some of them are still alive and fighting for their lives. There is also a possibility that there could be a return to civil war. However, there is still a long way to go before a deal can be reached. That is, if the new regime is to be brought to an acceptable level of security. If the current government is willing to accept the deal, then it will have to agree to it. This is something that can only be done through negotiations and not through military means. At the same time, it should not be taken for granted that peace is possible in other countries, such as Iran, Syria, Iraq and North Africa, where there are currently no permanent peace agreements. According to Ban, this could lead to more violence in future."

        "target": "France's conservatives: Combating the National Front with a swing to the right A staunch conservative is joining the race for the French presidency. Republican candidate Francois Fillon could turn into a big problem for right-wing extremist Marine Le Pen's National Front. France's Republicans are moving to the right: by choosing Francois Fillon, voters nominated a presidential candidate who has a reputation as a staunch conservative. The former prime minister has already announced that he intends to refocus politics with the traditional family in mind. Fillon takes a dim view of homosexual couples adopting children. He wants to introduce a cap on the number of refugees allowed into France, he intends to make it harder for foreign nationals to access the social welfare system, and he wants to put Muslim communities and mosques under government control. In addition, Fillon advocates a renationalization of school curricula. Fillon makes gains in FN territory Fillon's agenda could turn out to be a problem for the \"National Front\" (FN). The 62-year-old appeals to similar sentiments as the right-wing party's base: concern about foreign domination and loss of identity, fear of terrorism and crime. \"For a long time, FN was the only political force that addressed those fears,\" said Henrik Uterwedde of the German-French Institute (dfi) in Ludwigsburg. \"Now a politician has arrived on the scene who addresses those fears using a different language and makes them a political offer.\" In rural, Catholic France especially, where traditions still matter a great deal, the avowed Catholic Fillon strikes a chord with his proposals pertaining to family and society policies. He receives support from traditional Catholic groups who, for years, have been able to mobilize crowds for demonstrations against gay marriage. During the intraparty election campaign, Fillon predominantly traveled to France's villages and small towns - regions which FN leader Marine Le Pen had labeled the \"forgotten France,\" regarding herself as their foremost lobbyist. \"Fillon has made gains in an environment that is also canvassed by Le Pen,\" Andreas Jung, Chairman of the Bundestag's German-French parliamentary group, told German broadcaster rbb-Inforadio. \"He does not represent the lofty levels of Parisian politics, but rather provincial entrenchment. Fillon is committed to traditional values, like the family. Therefore, he may not only be capable of defeating Le Pen, but also of taking the lead during the first ballot.\" 'Most dangerous candidate for FN' Consequently, the FN camp is less than enthusiastic about the conservative's candidacy. \"Because of Fillon, we now have a strategy problem,\" Marion Marechal Le Pen, the FN leader's niece, recently told journalists. \"He is the most dangerous candidate for the National Front.\" Pollsters' findings appear to support that statement. Recent surveys establish Fillon as the current favorite in the French presidential election scheduled for next May. However, Fillon's election is not a foregone conclusion. By denouncing the conservative candidate as a member of the establishment, FN tries to win over those who are frustrated with politics and politicians in general. There is persistent opposition against his economic-liberal plans in particular. Fillon wants to abolish the 35-hour working week and raise the retirement age to 65 years. In addition, he wants to cut 500,000 jobs in the public sector and reform industrial law. Fillon is known as an admirer of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. \"Issues pertaining to liberal economic policy have always been heavily contested in France,\" said Uterwedde. \"Fillon's adversaries have already taken up their positions, criticizing what, in France, is called 'ultra-liberalism.'\" That was one of the nastiest words in French politics, he added. An offer for the left Fillon wants to raise VAT by 2 percent. This would predominantly hurt low-income households. Exactly that clientele, however, is wooed by FN with a program that is regarded as rather left-wing. The right-wing extremists are on a clear anti-globalization course, intending to seal off the French economy against foreign countries and exit from the European Union. The party is already trying to present Fillon as a symbol of anarchic, ultra-liberal capitalism. \"Francois Fillon will even go beyond EU demands for austerity and liberalism,\" David Rachline, Marine Le Pen's election campaign manager, wrote on Twitter. According to current polls, it is very likely that Fillon will have to face Marine Le Pen in a runoff election in May. The main hazard for the Republican candidate: his economic-liberal course could deter left-wing voters from choosing the conservative in order to avert Le Pen. \"Francois Fillon will have to start making offers, also to those voters who are closer to the center and more moderate,\" said France expert Uterwedde. \"And he will, prior to the runoff election at the latest, have to make offers to left-wing voters - without changing his original course.\"",
        "generated_story": "French presidential candidate Francois Fillon is the most dangerous candidate for the French presidential election, according to the German-French Institute of Politics. The French president has been accused of being too close to his conservative rival Marine Le Pen, who is running for president in the upcoming election. French media reported on Sunday that French President Francois Hollande's conservative party, the National Front (FN), was on course to win Sunday's runoff election in a close contest between the two presidential candidates. \"Fillon has a lot to prove,\" said Henrik Uterwedde, a professor of political science at the University of Ludwigsburg in Germany, adding that he was \"very close\" with the right-wing candidate. He is also a member of the conservative Republican Party (RSP) and a former deputy prime minister of France. In addition, he is an expert on French politics, and he has an extensive knowledge of French culture and history. His political background is well-known in France, where he worked as a political analyst for a number of years and was a teacher at a university in Paris before becoming the party's head of state in 2005. But he's also known for his outspokenness on social issues, such as abortion, gay marriage and the use of violence against women. On the other hand, his party is a far-right political party with a reputation for being intolerant and anti-immigrant. It's a party that has lost the last four presidential elections and is now in danger of losing the next one. And it's not just the FN that is on the ballot this time around. There are other candidates who are running, as well as candidates from other major parties, including the Socialists, Greens and Greens. One of those candidates is former finance minister Andreas Jung of Germany's Federal Institute for Public Policy. Another is French-born political scientist and former interior minister, Pauline Kuebler. Both of these candidates have a strong track record of winning elections, but they are not the only ones who have been able to pull off the impossible. They are also the ones that have managed to make it through the first round of elections. For example, former French Prime Minister Manuel Valls was elected to a second term in office in 2006, after losing his parliamentary seat in 2007 to Francois Mitterrand, then a conservative candidate from the center-left party of former President Nicolas Sarkozy. A year later, French Chancellor Angela Merkel was re-elected as party leader. She is expected to face a tough challenge in November, when she faces a runoff against conservative Francois Penzillon. Her party has already announced that it will nominate a new leader in February. However, there is still a long way to go before a candidate can win the nomination. That's because the election will be decided by a vote of no-confidence in her party. If she wins, she will face an uphill battle to get into the presidential race, which is due to be held on May 22. This year's election is to decide whether or not she'll run for another four-year term, or whether to stay on as the current president. Last year, France's parliamentary elections were marred by an inconclusive result, with only a handful of candidates being elected. Only one of them being the new president, Francois Poulsen, in 2012. Poulin, however, was chosen to take the top job in 2013. After a year of campaigning, Puelin and Jung were elected in 2014 and in 2015, they were both elected by the Bundestag. At the same time, both candidates were given a chance to run again in 2016. Since then they have lost their parliamentary seats in both houses of parliament. So far, neither candidate has won a majority in either chamber of Congress. What do you think? Do you agree with me? I don't think so. I think I'm going to vote for her. You know what I like about her? The fact that she's the candidate of her own party? Well, that doesn't make me a bad candidate, because she is not a good candidate at all. We all know she has the potential to do well in this election and that's what we all want to see. How can she win? What does that mean for France? Is she really the best candidate? Does she have any chance of getting elected? That depends on who wins the runoff? How does she fare? She's got a very good record in terms of public opinion and her ability to stand up for what she believes in? In the end, it is up to her to determine the fate of a country that wants to change its political system and what it can do with its economy and its social fabric. As far as France is concerned, her chances of becoming a president are very low. With the exception of one candidate in particular, Marine le Pen will have to wait until the polls are over before she can make a decision on her presidential run. Is it possible to put her name on a ballot? You can't say she"

        "target": "Berlin court rules Google Street View is legal in Germany A Berlin court has ruled that Google Street View is legal. But that doesn't mean the lawsuits will end, legal scholars say. A Berlin court has ruled that Google Street View is, in fact, legal in Germany. Last Tuesday, the Berlin State Supreme Court (Kammergericht) announced its decision in a court case from late last year, in which a woman had sued Google, fearing that photos of her, her family and the front of her house would be posted on Google Street View and would thus violate her property and privacy rights. The court ruled that it is legal to take photographs from street level, rejecting her argument that Google was trying to take unauthorized pictures. Part of her argument rested on the fact that Google used cameras mounted at three meters (9.84 feet) high, which could see over her two-meter-high hedge. However, the court did not find this argument convincing, given that the photographs were taken from the street, and not the sidewalk. Furthermore, because Google automatically blurs faces and license plates and did allow Germans to opt-out of the service to have their house obfuscated as well, the court did not find any potential violations. This is the first high-level court ruling, which cannot be appealed any further, regarding Street View since the service debuted in Germany at the end of last year. An ongoing debate Since Google announced plans to launch Street View in Germany last summer, debate around the service has become heated, with some politicians trying to stop it at every turn, while German Chancellor Angela Merkel famously said that she would not remove her house from Street View. In November 2010, the company announced that 244,000 German residents in the 20 cities had chosen to opt out of Street View - less than three percent of residents. However, in Germany and everywhere else, the company also allows people to report abuse, inaccuracies or request that something be blurred using an online tool. \"Our job is to develop services that respect these cultural differences,\" Peter Fleischer, Google's global privacy counsel told Deutsche Welle in November 2010. \"We try to anticipate them. We're all internationally-minded people ourselves. We try to guess how people will react to them. But a lot of these services are new and have never been on the market before, so we learn and we adapt as we go along.\" A 'landmark decision' European legal experts called the Berlin ruling a \"landmark decision,\" saying that this would now become part of German case law regarding property rights. \"Yes, other people are now warned: Don't sue Google simply claiming that Google Street View violates personality [or] property rights,\" wrote Thomas H\u00f6ren, a professor of media and communications law at the University of M\u00fcnster, in an e-mail sent to Deutsche Welle. But, he also warned that this decision was very narrow, focusing on the issue of property rights, and not on the larger issues of data protection from Google. \"The problem of Google Street View - to be honest - has never been a problem of personality rights or property rights, but the enormous risk of personal data compilations in cases where people use Google Street View for compiling personal profiles (such as building insurance companies; future employees, et cetera),\" he added. \"And this risk has not been considered by the Berlin courts.\" Similarly, Viktor Mayer-Sch\u00f6nberger, a professor at the Oxford Internet Institute, agreed that this case was \"limited in scope,\" adding in an e-mail, \"The plaintiff never alleged an actual invasion of privacy, just a potential one.\" Author: Cyrus Farivar Editor: Nancy Isenson",
        "generated_story": "Landmark decision on Google Street View in Germany A landmark decision has been made in the German state of Berlin. The decision by the Berlin State Supreme Court is the latest in a series of landmark decisions on the future of Google's street-view technology. On Thursday, a German court ruled in favor of the company's decision to allow Google to sell its street view technology to the public. In a landmark ruling, the court said that Google should not sell the technology for the purposes of advertising purposes only. \"It is not the first time Google has sold a product to a public company,\" said Peter Fleischer, head of Germany's public affairs at Google. He added that the decision \"would not be the last.\" The court also ruled against Google, saying that it would not allow the use of its products in public areas. But the ruling did not necessarily mean Google would stop selling the products, which were already in use in Berlin and in other German cities. According to German law, Google cannot sell products to public companies without a license from the state, and that would be a violation of state law. Google is also not obliged to pay a licensing fee to any company that sells the product. However, it has said it will continue to do so until the end of this year, when Google will be able to offer the services to its customers. It has also announced plans to start offering the service to those who do not already have access to Google products. This will give Google a chance to make a profit by selling its services directly to consumers, as well as by offering them the ability to use Google-owned products on their mobile devices. That is, until Google decides whether or not they will sell their products or whether they are to be sold to other companies, such as Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Amazon or Amazon. They will have to decide for themselves if they want to continue using Google services in their homes and offices. If they decide not to, they can still sell them to their customers, who will then get to choose which products they use? The ruling is expected to take effect on January 1, 2019. Read more: Google and Amazon agree to share information about their new products and services, but they have yet to agree on how to distribute the information. What's next for Google? Google says it is working on a new product that will allow users to see what they're looking for in terms of content and how they'll use it. And it's not just Google that is interested in making a difference. There are also a number of companies that are looking to expand their services. For example, one of them is Google Maps, for example. Another is Amazon's Home Shopping app. While the latter is aimed at helping people find their way into the world of online shopping, there are still a lot of people who are not familiar with the site and who don't know what it means to have a Google account. A Google spokeswoman said Google was \"very happy\" with its decision, adding that \"it is very happy that we are working with Google on this.\" Google declined to comment for this article, citing \"technical reasons.\" \"We are very pleased with our decision,\" she said, referring to it as \"the first step in our efforts to improve the experience for our customers,\" but she also pointed out that there is still \"a long way to go in order to get the most out of what we have in store for them.\" In addition, she added, \"we are going to try to find a solution to this problem and we will do everything we can to ensure that our users have the best experience possible. We are committed to making sure that this is a technology that can be used in all areas of their lives and lives, not only in advertising and marketing.\" But she did say that she was not satisfied with what Google had done so far. She also said she would like to work with Amazon and Apple to develop its own products for their retail stores and other retail outlets. So far, that has not been the case. At the same time, her comments have been welcomed by many people, including some who have come to her home town of Cologne, where she is staying in her native Germany, to discuss the matter with her friends and family. Some of these people have expressed concern about the impact Google may have on German society. Others, however, have not commented on whether the move would have an impact at all. One thing is for sure: The company has a long history of success in this area and is looking forward to expanding its presence in Europe and the Middle East. As a result, I think Google can do a great job in that area. I'm not sure what will happen when we move to Berlin, because I have no idea what is going on there. How long will Google stay in business there? \"I can't say for certain,\" the Google spokesperson said in an interview with Deutsche Welle newsmagazine.com."

        "target": "UK lawmakers propose jail sentences for reckless bankers A British parliamentary commission has completed its work on the overhaul of the domestic banking sector. Among other things, it proposed jail terms for bankers displaying grave malpractice and causing huge damage. Members of the UK's Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards agreed Wednesday that Britain needed a radical overhaul of its scandal-hit lenders. The panel, which was mostly composed of lawmakers, concluded in its final report that senior bankers must be made personally responsible for malpractice through the introduction of a new criminal offence of reckless misconduct. It would carry a prison sentence. The reputation of the country's banking sector had been damaged in recent years by a string of scandals, including Libor rate-rigging, credit insurance mis-selling and a controversy over staff behavior and bonuses in the run-up to the 2008 global financial crisis. The level of malpractice had been \"shocking and widespread,\" said the commission's chairman, Conservative party lawmaker Andrew Tyrie. RBS cut in two? \"Taxpayers and customers have lost out, and the economy has suffered,\" the 500-page report said. \"Under our recommendations, senior bankers who seriously damage their banks or put taxpayers' money at risk can expect to be fined, banned from the industry or in the worst cases go to jail.\" The commission called for bankers to sign up to a new code of conduct under which all key responsibilities within a bank would be assigned to specific senior officials who would be held responsible. The panel also proposed that more remuneration for bankers should be deferred for longer periods of up to ten years in order to \"reflect the longer run balance between business risks and rewards.\" The commission recommended that the government consider splitting the state-rescued Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) into a good bank and a bad one mopping up toxic assets. The report was published ahead of a key speech by Finance Minister George Osborne on his bank reform plans. hg/ipj (AFP, Reuters)",
        "generated_story": "Banking Mafia: A British Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards (PBCS) has released a report on the banking mafia. The report, published in the British press on Thursday, found that the \"banking mafia\" in Britain is not only a criminal organization, it is also a financial crime. According to the report released by the commission, the Mafia is a \"criminal organization\" that has been able to commit crimes and commit financial crimes. \"It is an organization that is responsible for the loss of millions of British taxpayers' money,\" said Andrew Tyrie, a member of the PBC Solicitor General's office in London. He added that it was \"unacceptable\" for a bank to be accused of being involved in \"a criminal enterprise\" and that \"it is wrong to call it a banking crime.\" The commission's report was commissioned by British Prime Minister George Osborne and was published on Wednesday. It is the first time that a parliamentary commission on banking standards has looked at the criminal activities of banks and financial institutions. In a statement released in response to a question about the bank's alleged involvement in a terrorist attack on London's financial markets in 2008, British Finance Minister Sir David Gauke said the allegations were \"completely false.\" \"The allegations are completely false,\" he said, adding that there was no evidence to support the accusations. But he also pointed out that, \"the allegations against the Royal Bank of Scotland are not substantiated by any evidence at all, and they are totally false. They are simply false allegations that are being made by people who do not have any knowledge of what is going on in their bank accounts. This is simply not the case. There is no proof that these allegations have been proven in any way, shape, form or form. These allegations, however, are part of an ongoing investigation into the Bank Mafia's activities in British banking, which has led to an increase in interest rates and a rise in lending rates in recent years. That is, if the charges are true, they will not be used as a basis for criminal charges against individuals and institutions, including those charged with crimes such as terrorism, money laundering and racketeering, according to sources familiar with the matter. 'The bank mafia' is one of Britain's most notorious criminal organizations and has a long history of financing terrorist attacks and terrorist financing. Its activities have also been linked to terrorism and other forms of violence, with some of its members having been killed or injured in attacks on British banks. However, there is little evidence that any of these crimes have actually been committed. On the other hand, many of those who are suspected of involvement are still alive and well and are believed to have committed crimes, as well as other criminal acts. Some of them have even been sentenced to life imprisonment or even death in prison for crimes committed in connection with their activities. One example of this is that of a former bank executive, who is now in jail for fraud and attempted murder. While he is still on parole, he says he has no intention of going back to prison, because he doesn't want to lose his job. Another example is when he was in charge of running the UK's largest bank, HSBC, in 2009 and again in 2010. When he left the country in 2011, his wife and two children were still living with him and his son were also living in England and Wales. At the time of his release from prison he had been working as an insurance agent. His wife was a nurse and he worked for HSBC. Now he works for Barclays, an investment bank in Hong Kong, but he's now a consultant at a law firm that specializes in banking and finance. Both he and her husband, Andrew, have a son and daughter who work as accountants. Their son is in his late 20s. Andrew is currently studying for his doctorate in computer science and is planning to become a professor of finance at Cambridge University. Read more: How to get a job in finance and banking. What do you know about banking? What are your thoughts on this? Is there anything you would like to do? Do you think your son or daughter would be interested in becoming a partner in this field? Andrew told the BBC: \"I don't know. I'm not sure what I would do if I had to go back and do it again.\" Andrew said that he would rather not do that because it would make it more difficult for him to find work in other areas of banking than in some other countries. If he did decide to return to Britain, then he wouldn't have to worry about what he might do in relation to his father's business. As a result, I think it's a good idea to look into this issue and see if there are any problems in terms of potential employment opportunities for young people.

        "target": "Party leaders call for increased wages in growing German economy Chancellor Angela Merkel and other top officials have called for upticks in Germany's economy to trickle down to workers in the form of higher pay. But a leading think tank has warned against giving raises too soon. Germany's foreign minister and deputy chancellor, Guido Westerwelle, has added his support to comments made by Economics Minster Rainer Bruederle about increased wages for German workers. \"When the economy grows and this growth is substantial and sustainable, then the benefits of this upswing should be felt by the people who worked so hard for it,\" Westerwelle told the Hamburger Abendblatt newspaper in an interview. Westerwelle heads the free-market liberal FDP, which shares power with Chancellor Merkel's Christian coalition. Earlier this week, Bruederle, also an FDP member, said in light of Germany's currently growing economy, those economic gains should trickle down to employees in the form of higher wages. Merkel, who is also the head of the Christian Democratic Union, supported Bruederle's idea. \"That is something the chancellor sees the same way, letter for letter,\" said Merkel's spokesman, Steffen Seibert. Not so fast Earlier this week, analysts predicted growth of 3.5 percent this year and 2 percent in 2011. Germany's five leading economic think tanks also predicted that the number of unemployed would fall below 3 million next year, the lowest level since 1992. Despite the current rosy outlook for the German economy, not everyone is convinced that a growing economy should inevitably lead to higher wages. The president of the German Institute for Economic Research, Klaus Zimmermann, warned against reacting too quickly. \"I can't support the idea of a general wage increase, I think it is too dangerous,\" Zimmermann said in an interview with the Handelsblatt newspaper. Zimmermann wasn't opposed to the idea of raising wages, but said he was against across-the-board increases for all sectors and pointed out that not every industry is benefitting the same from the growing economy. \"We can't forget that the German economy did not resort to mass lay-offs when it wasn't going so well last year,\" Zimmermann said.

        "generated_story": "Merkel's Deputy Chancellor, Klaus Zimmermann, is against a general wage hike Chancellor Angela Merkel's deputy chancellor, Guido Westerwelle, has called for an increase in Germany's national minimum wage. The chancellor's comments come as the FDP, the party's coalition partner in the German parliament, announced on Thursday that it would not support a wage increase for German workers. \"We are not going to allow this to happen,\" Merkel told a news conference in Berlin, adding that she was \"very disappointed\" with the government's handling of the issue. In a statement, she said that \"we are very disappointed that the chancellor has not been able to make the necessary changes to the country's wage system.\" \"I think that we are in a very difficult situation right now,\" said Merkel, who has been under pressure from her conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) coalition partners to agree to a higher national wage for the next five years. She also said she would be willing to work with other parties, including the Social Democrats (SPD) and the Greens (FDP), if they agreed to wage increases. Her comments came as a result of a meeting with Finance Minister Rainer Bruederle, a former finance minister who is now a professor at the Institute for Economic Research (DfR) in Cologne. On Thursday, German Chancellor Merkel called on the federal government to increase the national average wage by 1.5 percent from current levels to 2.6 percent. A spokesman for her CDU said: \"The chancellor is in no position to comment on this. We have no comment at this time.\" On Friday, Merkel announced that her party would no longer accept a rise in German minimum wages, which would amount to 1 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). She said the move would \"not be tolerated\" and \"will not be accepted by the public.\" The FCD leader said he was not aware of any plans to raise the wage, but that he would continue to discuss the matter with his party colleagues in parliament. Merkel is also expected to meet with finance ministers on Sunday. German media reported on Friday that Merkel was set to hold a cabinet meeting on Monday to decide whether to accept the proposed wage hikes. However, it is not clear whether she will attend the meeting, as she is a member of her own party, or if she intends to stay in her current position as party leader. It is unclear whether Merkel would attend, however, if the talks would take place at all. Last week, her government said it was open to talks with a number of parties. But she did not rule out the possibility of an early election in September, saying she had \"no plans\" to run for chancellor next year. According to German public broadcaster ARD, there is no chance of that happening. This is the first time Merkel has spoken publicly about her opposition to such a move since she took office in July, when she announced her intention to step down from the post of chancellor in August. At the end of last year, Berlin's economy minister, Helmut Schr\u00f6der, said his government was ready to take a step back from its plans for a \"general wage rise\" of 3.4 percent by 2020. He also pointed out that there was no clear indication of what would happen if a new chancellor were to be elected."

Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko was sworn into office on Friday in a lavish ceremony boycotted by Western diplomats. The previous day, the 56-year-old leader openly accused Germany and neighboring Poland of planning a coup against him. \"There were [in Germany and Poland] plans worked out for an overthrow of the constitutional order,\" Lukashenko said in the Belarusian capital, Minsk, on Thursday. \"This is not an invention of our intelligence agencies.\" Lukashenko, who came to power in 1994, was re-elected last month with 80 percent of the vote in what the opposition and international monitors said was a rigged election. Relations between the reclusive Belarusian government and the West have been strained ever since. 'Belarus question must be answered' German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said in a statement that the accusations were \"baseless\" and an attempt by Lukashenko to draw attention away from his own wrongdoing. \"The EU needs to find a clear political answer to events surrounding the presidential election and the continued incarceration of opposition politicians and their supporters,\" Westerwelle said. A wide-reaching crackdown against the regime's opponents followed Lukashenko's re-election. Hundreds of his critics were arrested and dozens threatened with long-term jail sentences. Poland also dismissed the accusations as absurd and said that relations with Minsk would not be normalized unless all political prisoners were released. Sanctions threat The situation in Belarus pushed the European Union to adopt a resolution on Thursday in support of economic sanctions against the country. The threats earned a sharp rebuke from Lukashenko, who promised the \"hardest possible reaction\" should the bloc impose sanctions against his country. At the same time, the Belarusian prime minister, Mikhail Myasnikovich, travelled to Moscow in a effort to shore up Russian support for Minsk during its standoff with the EU. That meeting ended with a Russian promise not to impose its own set of sanctions on Belarus over an unrelated spat over oil exports and a commitment to resume a nuclear power plant project shelved after the 1986 Chernobyl disaster.

He denied the allegations and said he would not run again. \"I will not be running again,\" he said in a televised address to the nation's parliament. A spokesman for Belarus' president, Mikhail Myasnikovich, said the president had \"no plans\" to run for another term, adding that he had no plans to seek a third term as president.

Belarus has yet to announce a date for the next parliamentary election, due to take place on March 14, but it is widely expected that the date will be set for March 15. Baku's election was marked by a flurry of political activity, with a number of major political events taking place, including the inauguration of a new presidential palace and the return of President Vladimir Putin to his post as prime minister. On Sunday, Belarus announced that it would hold a referendum on whether or not to allow Putin's regime to stay in power until at least 2024. It is not yet clear what the referendum result will look like, however, according to a report from the German newspaper Der Spiegel. Author: Andreas K\u00fcbler"

        "target": "Indian government tells Supreme Court Rohingya pose'serious threat' After an appeal from two Rohingya, India's top court is considering PM Narendra Modi's plan to deport some 40,000 Rohingya in India. The government said intelligence data showed links between some Rohingya and terrorism. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government told the Supreme Court of India on Monday that the Rohingya were \"illegal\" immigrants. The hearing is taking place as Rohingya face severe violence in their native Myanmar. More than 400,000 Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh in the past few weeks to escape military and civilian reprisals that the United Nations has described as \"ethnic cleansing.\" Later on Monday, Myanmar's national security advisor said that his government was willing to welcome the refugees who had fled to Bangladesh back to their native Rakhine state, but that the details of the process still had to be worked out. \"We will make sure that everybody who left their home can return to their home but this is a process we have to discuss,\" Thaung Tun told Reuters news agency after a meeting with British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. It was unclear how this would affect the estimated 40,000 Rohingya believed to have settled in India, including 16,000 of whom are registered with the UN's refugee agency. Read more: Myanmar's Rohingya - A history of forced exoduses The Indian government told the court that it had intelligence data that showed links between some Rohingya Muslims and Pakistan-based terror groups and other international terror organizations. It argued that such links made them a \"serious threat to national security.\" The government also said there was a \"serious possibility of eruption of violence against Buddhists in India by radicalized Rohingya.\" Lawyer Colin Gonsalves, who in a separate case is representing about 7,000 Rohingya living in the northern Indian city of Jammu, countered the government's assertions. \"We just want to know: 40,000 people have been here, many of them for the last five years. Have you [the government] filed a single charge sheet, is anyone being prosecuted in the criminal court for being a terrorist? The answer is: no,\" he told DW. The court has adjourned the hearing in the matter to October 3. Lack of evidence India says it is not bound by the UN convention on refugees as it is not a signatory to the accord, but human rights activists disagree. \"The principle of non return of a person to a place where he will be executed or tortured has become a principle of customary international law which India follows,\" Gonsalves told DW. \"And it has attained the status of 'jus cogens,' which is a principle of law that no country can say is not applicable to it, such as torture and genocide.\" In a communication sent to all states in August, the Home Ministry [interior ministry] said the illegal migrants were more susceptible to terrorist recruitment efforts. But an investigation by Indian broadcaster NDTV found \"little evidence of the government claim.\" The investigation that was carried out at major Rohingya settlements in the country showed little involvement in criminal wrongdoing by the refugees. Lack of any evidence to support the government claim has led to speculations that the Rohingya were being targeted for their religion by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu-nationalist government. \"It is really unfortunate that the government is going back on its commitment to refugees which it has reiterated several times in the past merely because these Rohingyas are Muslims,\" said lawyer Prashant Bhushan, who filed the plea on behalf of two Rohingya men. \"I mean this is clearly a case of religious discrimination and an attempt to arouse a sort of feeling of... an anti-Muslim feeling or try and communalise the situation,\" he told reporters outside the courthouse. The UN's human rights chief last week deplored Indian government's move to deport Rohingya refugees. \"India cannot carry out collective expulsions, or return people to a place where they risk torture or other serious violations,\" Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein said. The Rohingya are an Indo-Aryan people, the vast majority of whom are Muslims. They usually migrate to India through a rather porous border to escape persecution in their native Rakhine state in Myanmar, where they have been denied citizenship rights. They are viewed by the local authorities as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. Myanmar's Buddhist majority is often accused of subjecting them to discrimination and violence.

Hundreds of people, the majority of them Rohingya, have been killed in the violence that has seen many homes destroyed and several villages burned down. Myanmar's government maintains the crackdown is part of a counter-terrorism drive, while the UN's al-Hussein has said that it \"seems a textbook example of ethnic cleansing.\"",
        "generated_story": "India says Rohingyas pose 'erious threat' to India The Indian government has said it is concerned about the influx of Rohingya Muslims into the country. The country's interior ministry said on Thursday that it was concerned that they could pose a \"serious threat\" to its security. India's top court has ruled that the Rohingya should be allowed to return to their homes in the state of Rakhine, where they are believed to be living in fear of persecution. \"We are concerned,\" the Supreme Court said in a statement, adding that \"it is our responsibility to ensure the safety and security of our people.\" The court's ruling came a day after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that he would no longer allow the return of the refugees to Myanmar. Modi's announcement came after a week-long visit to the border town of Jammu and Kargil, which is home to some 700,000 Rohingya people, was widely condemned by the government and the opposition as a threat to security and human rights. Opposition parties have accused Modi of ignoring warnings from the United Nations, the International Criminal Court (ICC) and other international bodies. On Thursday, Modi met with the UN chief Ban Ki-moon in New York to discuss the situation in Myanmar, a country where the majority of Muslims live in poverty, unemployment and lack of opportunities for self-determination. He also called for an end to violence against the minority community. In a joint statement released on Wednesday, India and Myanmar said they would continue to work together to tackle the problem. Indian Foreign Minister Boris Johnson, who has been in India since 2014, said he was \"deeply concerned\" by reports that Rohingya refugees were fleeing violence and persecution in their home country of Myanmar and Bangladesh. Speaking to DW, Johnson said that his government was working closely with Myanmar's government on the issue, and that India was committed to ending the violence. However, he said, \"we are not going to allow this kind of violence to continue in our country.\" He added that Myanmar was not the only country that was worried about Rohingya, saying that there was no evidence to support the claim. According to a report by DW's Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, an analyst at the Centre for International Development (CIDA), the Myanmar government is \"very concerned.\" \"It is very serious,\" he told DW."

Monday's announcement by Pat McQuaid, the president of the International Cycling Union, ratified recommendations in an October report from the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), which ordered Armstrong's Tour de France titles be wiped out. \"Lance Armstrong has no place in cycling,\" said McQuaid. Addressing his remarks to cyclists, McQuaid said the fight against doping was his priority. \"UCI is listening and is on your side. We\u2019ve come too far in the fight against doping to return to our past. Cycling has a future and something like this must not happen again.\" The scathing USADA report included testimony from 11 former teammates, accusing Armstrong of running the \"most sophisticated\" doping program in the sport's history. The USADA said it had collected evidence to prove the seven-time Tour de France winner had engaged in the biggest doping conspiracy to date. Effect on cycling and sponsorship Monday's decision comes as the sport of cycling reels from Armstrong's well-documented fall from grace. Organizers of the Tour de France will be trying to move on from the scandal as the race prepares to celebrate its centenary next year. Sponsors have been deserting Armstrong and the sport in general. Last week, Nike - one of Armstrong's main corporate sponsors - said it was terminating its relationship with the cyclist and accused him of deception. Trek, the company that made the bicycles Armstrong rode to seven titles, announced on the same day it would terminate its sponsorship contract - as did the beer maker Anheuser-Busch. The Dutch institution Rabobank ended its association with professional cycling after the doping allegations came to light, leaving 17 riders in need of a sponsor. Last week Armstrong also announced he would step down from his own charity, the Lance Armstrong Foundation, also known as Livestrong, a move believed to have been intended to limit the damage to the organization from the USADA report. Armstrong appears Lance Armstrong spoke briefly to thousands of riders in Texas at a benefit organized by his charity, the day before UCI's decision. \"I've been better, but I've also been worse,\" he said. \"Obviously it has been an interesting and difficult couple of weeks.\" jr/rc (Reuters, AFP, AP)",
        "generated_story": "Lance Armstrong stripped of Tour de France titles by US Anti-Doping Agency Lance Armstrong has been stripped by the International Cycling Union (IUCU) of his three Grand Tour titles. Armstrong, who was racing for the first time in his career, was stripped on Thursday of three titles he won in 2006 and 2007. The former world champion cyclist, Armstrong's son, Lance, and his wife, Pat McQuaid, were among those stripped from their titles at the end of last year's Tour of France. \"I'm very disappointed,\" Armstrong said in a statement released on his Twitter account. He said he was \"deeply disappointed\" in the decision, adding that he \"would have liked to have had the opportunity\" to win more titles in 2007, 2008 and 2009. In addition, he said, \"We are disappointed that Lance has not been able to achieve his goal of becoming the world's most successful cyclist.\" He added that \"it would have been a great honor\" for Armstrong to be awarded the titles, which he had already claimed in 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011. However, the IOC has yet to rule out the possibility of a return to the Tour in 2012, when Armstrong was a member of the team that won the 2004 and 2008 Tours, as well as the 2007 World Championships in Barcelona and the 2008 Olympic Games in Athens, Athens and Rio de Janeiro. According to a report in The New York Times earlier this month, US cycling's governing body said that Armstrong would not be allowed to compete in any major sporting event next year due to his involvement in doping. \u201cWe have a lot of work ahead of us,\u201d Armstrong told the newspaper. But he also said the organization would continue to work closely with the UCI to make sure that the sport is safe and well-governed and that there is no risk of doping in future races, according to an IOC report released Thursday. It said Armstrong had \"no intention\" of running for a third time, despite the fact that his father had been banned from cycling for life for failing to meet a doping test in 2004. US Cycling's cycling federation said it was aware of Armstrong\u2019s involvement, but did not comment on the report, saying that it would be premature to speculate on whether he would run for another Tour title in 2009 or 2010. A spokesman for cycling in Australia, Australia and New Zealand declined to comment when contacted by The Associated Press, citing a \"technical matter.\" Armstrong is currently on leave of absence from his duties as a coach at Rabobank. His wife and two children are expecting their first child in January. They have no immediate plans to attend the birth of their third child, although they are hoping to get married in time for their son's wedding in May. Team Armstrong also has a son and a daughter who are both in their 20s and will be living with their mother and step-grandmother in Canada. While he has no intention of returning to cycling after the wedding, his son is planning to start a new career in cycling. At the same time he is looking forward to getting back on track with his cycling career after a year away from racing. And he hopes to continue his racing career with a full-time job at a high-profile level. After all, it is his job to help his family get back into the racing business and he's a father of two. That's the main reason why he wants to keep cycling, even if he doesn't have the money to do it anymore. Despite being a professional cyclist for many years, there are a number of other reasons. One of those reasons is that cycling is a sport that is very popular with young people. For many, cycling has become a way of life and it's something that can only be enjoyed by those who want to play a part in it. There is also a certain amount of competition, such as cycling and athletics, that attracts young athletes and athletes. This is one of these reasons why cycling can be a very interesting sport.

        "target": "US Supreme Court Justice Scalia dies at 79, setting off succession showdown Justice Antonin Scalia, an outspoken conservative and the longest-serving member of the US' top court, has passed away in Texas. President Obama vowed to nominate a successor 'in due time,' despite political opposition. The 79-year old justice died in his sleep, presumably of natural causes, local media reported on Saturday. Scalia was visiting Texas for a hunting trip, and his body was discovered after he failed to appear for breakfast in the resort where he was staying. US President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama extended \"their deepest condolences to Justice Scalia's family,\" White House deputy spokesman Eric Schultz said. Texas Governor Greg Abbott described the conservative justice as a \"man of God, a patriot and an unwavering defender of the written Constitution and the rule of law.\" \"He was the solid rock who turned away so many attempts to depart from and distort the Constitution. His fierce loyalty to the Constitution set an unmatched example, not just for judges and lawyers, but for all Americans,\" Abbot said. Battle for the empty seat His passing is likely to open a new political front between President Barack Obama and the Republican Party, as Scalia's replacement could shift the composition of the court towards a more liberal persuasion. Several Republican lawmakers have already urged Obama to leave the decision to the next president who will be voted in later this year. \"The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court justice,\" Senate Republican majority leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement, referring to the upcoming November general election. \"Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president,\" McConnell concluded. President Obama, however, said he would fulfill his constitutional duty and nominate Scalia's successor \"in due time.\" \"These are responsibilities I take seriously, and so should everyone. They are bigger than any one party,\" he said. Decades of controversy Scalia joined the Supreme Court in 1986, becoming the first Italian-American to serve in the top judicial body. He was nominated by US President Ronald Reagan. Throughout his long carrier, Scalia voted in favor of privacy and protecting defendants' rights, but also against legalizing abortion, same-sex marriage and gun control. He also drew public attention for his theatrical flair and sharpness of tongue, as well as his alleged unwillingness to compromise. In June last year, the nine-person Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage with a five-to-four vote. Scalia, who was in the minority, commented he would \"hide my head in a bag\" if his own name were associated with the decision. He also said that the majority opinion was \"couched in a style that is as pretentious as its content is egotistic.\" dj/jm (AP, Reuters, AFP, dpa)",
        "generated_story": "Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia dies in sleep in Texas The US Supreme Court has ruled that the death of conservative jurist Scalia was not a suicide. The court said on Thursday that it had found no cause for death. Scalia, who had been serving a life sentence for murder, was found dead in his sleep at his Texas home in the early hours of Thursday morning. His death was the latest in a series of events that have rocked the Republican Party in recent weeks. In the wake of his death, US President Barack Obama said he was \"deeply saddened\" by the news. \"We are deeply saddened by this,\" Obama told a news conference at the White House in Washington, D.C. On Thursday, the US Senate voted to confirm Scalia as the next justice of the high court. He was scheduled to take the oath of office on Friday, but his body was later found to be inoperable. Obama and his wife, Michelle, were to attend the funeral service for the late Justice Scalia on Saturday, according to a statement from the president's spokesman, Greg Abbott. A spokesman for Obama's presidential campaign, Mitch McConnell, said the decision was made \"in accordance with the law and the Constitution.\" The president said his administration would continue to work to strengthen the court's ability to interpret the constitution. But he did not elaborate on the reasons for his decision, saying that he had \"no idea\" what it would take to get the justice to serve the United States. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d the statement said, referring to the fact that Scalia had served as a federal appeals court judge for more than a decade. It was also not immediately clear whether the ruling would be overturned, or if the justices would have to wait until the new term was up for renewal. Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney has called for a constitutional amendment that would allow the federal courts to decide the fate of judges who have been convicted of murder or other serious offenses, such as sedition, rape and murder. Romney is expected to announce his intention to run for re-election in November, although he has not yet ruled on whether he will run again. Last week, President Donald Trump announced he would seek a second term in office, which would see him step down from his post in January. Trump has also called on his Republican party to nominate a replacement for Scalia to fill the vacancy created by Scalia's death in February. That would give him a chance to challenge the conservative majority in Congress. If he does not, it will be up to President Obama to appoint a new justice who will replace Scalia. There is also the question of whether or not the current justice will serve as an interim justice. This is a question that has been asked of both the Senate and House of Representatives. Both chambers of Congress have said that they will consider the issue of constitutional amendments and whether they want to do so at a later date. Some Republicans have also said they would like to see a change in their party's approach to judicial appointments. However, they have not ruled out the possibility of an early presidential election in 2020. Many Republicans are concerned about the prospect of a possible presidential run-off between the Republicans and Democrats in 2018. They are also concerned that a potential presidential contender could be a candidate for another term, and they are not sure how that will play out. What is the likelihood of that happening? The current president-elect has already made it clear that his party is not going to back away from a presidential bid. While the party has a lot of work ahead of him, there is still a long way to go before he is able to make a decision on what he wants to stand for. So far, so good. I think it's been a very good year for both parties. We are hopeful that we will see the end of this year's election campaign. And we are optimistic about what the future holds for our party. After all, we have a great president and a strong president. How many of us are ready to step up the fight against the Trump administration? What do you think will happen next year? I don't know for sure. Who knows? But I do know that there are a number of things that are certain to come up. One thing is for certain: the election of President Trump will not be decided until after the mid-term elections. For example, if Trump wins the November election, he'll be the first president to win the popular vote. Another thing that is certain is that Republicans will have an important role to play in this election season. Most of them are looking forward to an election year in which they hope to carry out their campaign promises. More than 80 percent of Republicans support Trump, however, have expressed their support for Trump's candidacy. (AP, AFP, Reuters)"

A good choice: Freiburg is a charming university town in southwestern Germany attracting three million visitors a year! Let\u2019s find out how Tonatiuh spent his day with our camera crew.",
        "generated_story": "My Freiburg: A tour with Tonatiuh Ibarra The Goethe Institute in Mexico City has opened a new chapter in the history of the German language. It's the first time I've been to the country since I was a child. I can't wait to see what the future holds for me and my family. My family and I have been traveling to Mexico for the past few weeks. We've had a lot of fun, and we're looking forward to getting to know each other a little bit more. But first, we have to find out what it's like to live in a country where there are so many different languages and cultures. What do you think? What does it mean to be a German-Mexican citizen? I'm not sure, but I think it means something to me, because I don't know much about the language or the culture of Germany at all. And then there's Mexico, where I grew up and where my father was born. There's also the fact that my mother was German, which means that she's German. She's from Mexico. Her father is from the state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and her mother is a Mexican-born German citizen. They were both born in Germany, so they're both German citizens. Their parents are German and they have German passports. \"I'm German,\" they tell me. The family has always been German but they've always wanted to go to Germany. In fact, they came here to study German literature and to learn German in order to get a better understanding of German culture and language, as well as to understand the differences between Germany and the United States. One of my favorite things about Germany is that it doesn't seem to matter which country you're from. That's why I like Germany so much. You can see it on the map, or on my Facebook page, if you want to look at it from a different angle. On the other hand, I do think that Germany should be more open-minded and open to new ideas. For example, it should open up a whole new world of language and culture to people from all over the world. This is something that can only be done with the help of a friend or family member who is German or who has been studying German for a long time. A friend of mine is also a professor of English at the university. He's a teacher and he's very interested in German history and history. When I visited Mexico last year, he told me about his experiences there and said that he was very impressed by the way it was presented to him and his family in his native country. So I thought I'd share some of that with him. Then I went on to ask him what he thought about it. His answer: \"Well, that's not really a question.\" He said he didn't think much of it at first because he wasn't sure what to expect. However, after a few days of reflection he decided to give it a try. At the end of his visit, the professor asked me to take a look around the city and see if there was anything I could learn from him that would make me feel better about myself. After all, there is always the possibility that I might not be able to do everything I want, even if I had the opportunity to. As it is, this is not something I would have done in my own lifetime. If I were to travel to a foreign country, then I wouldn't have known that there would be such a thing as a \"German language.\" But I am not so sure about that. While I did learn a great deal about German languages, my first impression was that they were very different from other languages. Now I know that German is very much a language-based language that is spoken in other countries, not just in Latin America. How does that translate into German? Is it possible to speak Spanish? Do you know what I mean by that? Does it make you feel any different? Can you imagine the kind of person who's going to teach German at a university? If so, what is your opinion on this subject? You know, you've probably got to say that you have a very good idea of what German means. Is that a good thing? Well, let me tell you what you can say about my German friends. Let me give you a bit of advice on how to improve your German speaking skills. Go ahead and make sure you understand German well enough.

Francis won't be able to meet them, says DW's Astrid Prange. Dead prisoners, disappearing students, refugees shot dead and murdered priests. Mexico has lived through one violent episode after the other. The mood in the nation is explosive. And now this: just a day before the pope is set to arrive, more than 50 people died in the largest prison revolt in the country's history. What meaning does the pope's presence hold on such an occasion? Only one thing is certain: Francis won't be able to resolve the problems of the world's second largest Catholic nation in just a five-day trip. The unrealistic demands placed on him are not something he can fill. Yet the pope carries with him an important message: you don't have to love your enemies but you do need to speak with them. And he's living the example himself by meeting with the Russian Orthodox Patriarch Kirill on a stopover in Cuba on his way to Mexico. Cuba all over again It's sensational! Bannings and mutual ex-communications are ancient history. Nearly a millennium after the split, the head of the Roman Catholic Church and the head of the Russian Orthodox Church are speaking to each other. It's not as if the two will become friends - their positions are far too different. Yet their centuries-old enmity feels out of place and in view of the massive worldwide persecution of Christians, almost unchristian. And both of these church leaders know this. In Mexico, efforts to stem the polarizing forces at play in society have not been successful. The extreme differences between rich and poor are dividing Mexican society. President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto has prioritized economic growth over dialogue with his critics - a group which includes students as well as teachers and union members who regularly protest against government policies. They demand an end to lawlessness and corruption. The presumed murder of 43 teaching students in Iguala in September 2014, a crime which remains unsolved, stands as a symbol of the lawlessness sweeping Mexico. The recent mutiny in a Monterrey jail serves as further proof of the country's shortcomings in regard to human rights and the rule of law. With a visit to Ciudad Juarez and the largest prison in Mexico, Francis will only make that deficiency more transparent. Even the pope of peace has enemies. The route he's chosen to take on his travels through the country has displeased the staunchly Catholic president. A meeting with the relatives of the Iguala victims is therefore hush-hush and participation in a holy mass remains secret. Considering the tense situation in the country, it's still possible that the pope's route will change once again. The church in the pillory Even within his own church, Francis has met with opposition. A meeting he requested with victims from the church's abuse scandal will not take place - a bitter disappointment for many former seminarians who were abused by Marcial Maciel, the founder of the Legion of Christ, and members of his order. It's just one example of how impunity continues even within the church itself. None of the perpetrators have yet to answer for their crimes in court. It appears as though the pope has accomplished more on the world stage than he has brought on reforms to the Vatican. Despite the revolutionary coming together of Cuba and the US and the revolutionary meeting with Patriarch Kirill, the revolution in Rome has yet to materialize. Do you have something to say? Add your comments below. The thread to this editorial closes in 24 hours.",
        "generated_story": "Pope Francis's impossible mission in Mexico Astrid Prange, a member of the Russian Orthodox Church, told DW that the pope was \"impossible\" to reach. \"The pope is impossible,\" she said, referring to the Vatican's decision not to allow him to travel to Mexico to meet with President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto and his wife, Kirill. The pope, who has been in the country for more than a year, is expected to visit Mexico on Sunday, Dec. 3. He will be accompanied by Pope Francis, the head of Mexico's Roman Catholic Church. Francis has already made it clear that he will not be traveling to any country other than the United States, where he is due to make his first official visit there in November. In a statement released on Friday, Francis said he would be visiting Mexico \"in the coming days and weeks.\" \"We will see what happens,\" he said in a brief statement, adding that \"the Vatican will continue to cooperate with us in our efforts to get the best possible results for Mexico and the world.\" The pontiff's visit comes just days after the death of former Mexican President Felipe Calderon in an assassination attempt that left him dead at the hands of his successor, Enrique Pena Nieto, in December. Penca Nieto's death was the latest setback for the embattled president, whose popularity has plummeted in recent months. Last week, he was replaced by ex-premier Marcial Maciel, an Italian-born priest who had been living in exile in Rome for over a decade. On Sunday evening, Pope Benedict XVI was to be inaugurated in his hometown of Monterrey, Mexico, as part of a three-day visit to Latin America's largest city, Ciudad Juarez, which is home to a number of Latin American countries, including Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Peru, Spain and Italy. His visit came after a series of violent attacks on police officers and soldiers. One of those attacks was on a police officer who was shot and killed by a stray bullet. Two other officers were also injured in clashes between police and protesters, and one of them was seriously injured. Both men were taken to hospital and died of their injuries, according to an official statement from the Mexican government. An investigation into the shooting has also been launched into allegations that a priest was killed. A Vatican spokesman said the investigation was continuing. It was not immediately clear whether or not the accusations were true, but a Vatican official said that there was no evidence to support the allegations. However, it is not clear if the charges against the priest were politically motivated or whether they were motivated by political motives. There is also speculation that Francis' visit could be linked to his decision to seek asylum in Germany, Italy or the US. According to sources close to him, there is a possibility that his asylum application could have been approved by the German government in exchange for him being allowed to return to Germany. That is, if he were to receive asylum there would have to wait until the end of this year. But the current pope has yet to decide whether he wants to stay or leave his post as a cardinal. If he does decide to leave the post, however, that is something that will have a huge impact on the future of Mexican Catholics. And it could also have an effect on how the church is perceived in other countries. For example, when it comes to relations between the Church and other religious institutions, such as the Catholic church, this is an issue that has a lot to do with the fact that many of its members are not Catholics and that they don't share the same values as other religions. What is important to understand is that it's not a question of whether the Pope will stay in office long after he leaves office. Is he really going to come back to Rome? If so, what will he do there? The Vatican has not yet made any announcement about his plans for a trip to Italy, although he has hinted at a possible return there. At the very least, his visit is likely to raise questions about the extent to which he's willing to go. This is the first time he'll be able to attend a meeting of bishops in Italy and Spain. Speaking to DW's editors in Berlin, Fr. Peter Kuebler said: \"I think the most important thing that we can do is make sure that all the bishops are fully committed to this mission. I think that's a good thing.\""

        "target": "Report: Torture is a European problem too A day after Amnesty International published a report on Europe's collusion with the CIA's torture program, the Council of Europe published its own shocking survey of abuse in detention centers across the continent. Prison guards in several European countries carried out reprisals against detainees who talked to the Council of Europe's Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT), the new CPT report has revealed. The council considers this a violation of the spirit of cooperation between the CPT and the Council of Europe's member states. According to the CPT's 24th General Report, released on Wednesday, reprisals were carried out against prisoners in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Greece, Hungary, Moldova, Russia, Spain, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and Ukraine. \"Intimidation or retaliation against persons the CPT has interviewed may not only violate their human rights but also strikes a blow to the preventive mechanism established by the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture,\" CPT President Letif H\u00fcseynov said in a statement. \"I urge national authorities to respect their obligation to prevent, investigate and punish such actions.\" The report also highlighted several problems with the detention of juveniles around Europe, and proposed a series of practical measures to protect young people's rights when detained. Ad hoc visits The little-known CPT, now 25 years old, represents a unique approach to international torture prevention. A team of specialists make roughly 180 visits a year to all kinds of detention centers (including prisons, police stations, holding centers for immigration detainees, psychiatric hospitals, and even social care homes) all across the 47-member Council of Europe - one of the few international blocs that offer platforms for dialogue with Eastern European regimes considered to have poor human rights records, such as Russia, Azerbaijan, and Ukraine. The method combines the carrot of talks with government officials and the stick of ad hoc visits, which all members are committed to allowing into their prisons. Once inside, the CPT also has the right to interview any detainees it chooses - in private, though of course the detainees have the right to refuse. \"The first thing to say is how important the CPT is,\" said Carla Ferstman, director of Redress, a UK-based organization that helps torture survivors. \"As a result of their boot work over a very long period of time, the UN has set up a global system which in many ways mirrors the approach of the CPT.\" But given that the committee has no powers to enforce its proposals to governments, there are question marks over its effectiveness. \"In the report, they complain about how some of the recommendations they've made have not been implemented,\" said Ferstman. \"It's a sign that they're a little bit frustrated.\" But in the long run, she maintains, the CPT has more than proved its value. \"The dialogue that they are able to have is really important,\" she said. \"Looking long-term, they have been very effective.\" CIA collusion, asylum seekers The CPT's report comes a day after Amnesty International released its own report on European collusion with the CIA's torture program. While the CPT's report examines more prosaic day-to-day mistreatment, rather than mass rendition of terrorist suspects at the behest of the US, there are obvious links between the two, since some countries - such as Poland, Macedonia, and the UK - are highlighted in both reports. \"What is finally coming out in all of this is that the Europeans, despite all the criticism of the Bush and Obama administrations on the use of torture - so many of them connived,\" said Judy Dempsey, senior associate at Carnegie Europe. \"It's really a double standard. This report is quite damning and quite shameful, and it follows the Amnesty International one as well.\" The CPT's work also mentions the mistreatment of asylum seekers, a problem increasingly afflicting European countries that take in the largest number of asylum seekers - particularly Spain, Italy, and Greece. \"With Greece there are two things to remember,\" Dempsey told DW. \"A - the appalling situation of the prison system, and B - the lack of training among police of how to deal with asylum seekers. Awful things have happened. Parallel to this is the illegal detention centers. There have been lots of cases of terrible mistreatment over the last several years.\" \"Immigration detention is a growing issue,\" added Ferstman. \"In the UK, there was a whole parliamentary inquiry into one immigration detention center, where some of the women alleged that guards propositioned them in order to get quick treatment on their claims. Each country has its own history of torture.\"",
        "generated_story": "The CPT is a European problem too -- and it's time to step up its game The European Commission is calling on the US government to stop torturing people in the name of protecting the interests of the United States and its allies. The Commission's chief executive, Carla Ferstman, told DW that the U.S. government should take a closer look at the issue. \"We have a lot of work to do,\" she said in an interview with DW. She added that \"it is time for a change in our approach to torture.\" \"The US should be doing more to protect the rights of people who have been subjected to arbitrary and torturous treatment,\" said the commission's president, Letif H\u00fcseynov, adding that US President Barack Obama should \"step up his game\" in dealing with torture and other forms of human rights violations. In a statement released on Tuesday, the Commission said it was \"deeply concerned\" with the \"ongoing deterioration\" of relations between US and European countries. It also said that it would be \"very, very difficult\" for US authorities to deal with cases where torture is carried out without the consent of a court-martial, and that there was a \"serious lack of evidence\" to support the claim that torture was being committed by US officials. US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has called for an end to the use of force against people suspected of crimes such as murder, rape, sexual assault and torture. He also called on European governments to take action against the perpetrators of these crimes, saying that they were not being held accountable for their actions. But he also pointed out that, in many cases, they had to be held responsible for the deaths of innocent people, not just those who were tortured, but also for crimes committed during the war on terror. This is not a new problem, he said: \"It is something that has been going on for many years.\" The US has a long history of using torture against its own citizens, which is why it is so important to have the right tools in place to prevent the abuse of detainees. That's why the CIA, for example, has used torture as a weapon of mass destruction in order to make sure that no one is killed or tortured. However, it has also been able to use torture in other countries, including the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands, where there are a number of high-profile cases in which torture has taken place. At the same time, there is also a growing awareness among the public about the dangers of torture, particularly when it comes to children and young people. As a result, more and more children are being forced to undergo psychological and physical abuse, as well as physical and psychological abuse. There are also fears that this will lead to a rise in violence and violence among children. And that will only be exacerbated by the rise of child abuse and sexual abuse in schools and in prisons. These fears are not unfounded, says the head of Redress, Judy Dempsey, who has worked for more than 30 years in prison in Germany and Spain. DW: What do you think about this? What are you going to say to your friends and family? Do you have any thoughts on this issue? Is it something you would like to talk to them about? If so, what is your view on it? The answer is, \"I don't think so. I think that's a very good question for me to ask myself. What does it mean to me that I'm not in a position where I can be a victim of this kind of abuse? That I am not guilty of any crime? I would rather not be accused of doing something wrong than being a perpetrator of it, because that is what I want to tell my children about. You can't do that in my own country. If you're a child, then you should not do it in your own home. So, I have no doubt that you will have to give up your right to abuse your rights. We are all victims of Torture, right? We all know that we are victims. Let's talk about it. Don't you agree with me? Let me know what your views are on that? You're not the only one who thinks this is wrong. Tell me about your experiences. Read more: How you feel about torture? Tell us what you've been doing in Europe. How did you respond to this article?

        "target": "Dresden marks 70 years since massive Allied bombing Seventy years ago, Allied bombers attacked Dresden, killing tens of thousands of people, the majority of them civilians and refugees. Every year, the East German city remembers its dead. DW's Naomi Conrad was on hand. As the tram trundled through Dresden's drab suburbs on Friday morning, a prim, elderly woman suddenly turned to her friend sitting on the seat beside her: \"You know, my mother never told me about the bombings.\" She shrugged, then, after a moment's pause, continued. \"It must have been such unspeakable hell that she just couldn't talk about it,\" the woman said. She was referring to February 13, 1945 - the morning, exactly 70 years ago, when Allied bombers swooped down on an unsuspecting city famous for its baroque architecture and that, until that point, had survived the war mostly unscathed. That was to change in the course of three dreadful days: As the bombs rained down on the city, its churches and palaces were turned to rubble. Up to 25,000 people - many of them refugees fleeing the advancing Soviet Red Army - died in the inferno that raged in the city for days. \"There was nothing left, nothing,\" a frail, bent man with a checkered cap recalled, \"just rubble and death.\" He was leaning on the balustrade of a viewing platform in Dresden's old gasometer, staring down at the 360-degree painting by the Iranian-German artist Yadegar Asisi; sirens howled from hidden speakers and strobe lighting illuminated the ruined churches and black smoke billowing from the burnt skeletons that were once buildings. The man swallowed, his voice hoarse, barely audible: \"It's so hard being here.\" The soundtrack and images, he said, \"bring back too many memories.\" 'So, so many dead' He was 15, he recalled, working on a school essay when the sirens began to wail. He never finished the essay. Instead, he ran for shelter with his family. When they returned home three days later, the roof had been blown off, the windows smashed. \"But we were lucky: We survived,\" he said. \"There were so, so many dead.\" His voice broke and, muttering an apology, he shuffled off. The bombings were intended to break the German population's morale - a decision that to many was incomprehensible, given that the war had long been decided and Dresden's economic and strategic importance was relatively minimal. Consequently, the death and destruction wreaked by the Allied bombers quickly became a tool, first for the Nazi propagandists in the last months of the war, then by the East German regime for its anti-West propaganda, and then later by neo-Nazi groups, who traditionally congregate on February 13. Even today, \"the debate continues about guilt and innocence, even about the exact number of victims,\" Dresden Mayor Helma Orosz told a packed audience, including delegations from abroad, gathered for a memorial service in the city's Frauenkirche, which in 2005 was rebuilt with the help of private donations after Germany's reunification, many of them from the United States and Great Britain. Call for peace \"War, hatred and violence begin in people's minds,\" Orosz said. \"We must resist any attempt at once again categorizing people based on their origin and skin color,\" she added, referring to what has often been described as a right-wing catchall movement called PEGIDA, generally translated as Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West, which has taken to the streets in Dresden since October. Later, on a platform overlooking thousands of people, many of them wearing white roses as a sign of peace while bracing the icy cold outside the church, Orosz called on Dresden to remember every victim of the Nazi terror - a plea that was reiterated by German President Joachim Gauck when he took to the microphone: \u201cWe don't want the pain that people suffered here to be misused by others.\u201d Behind him, the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, who, back in the Frauenkirche, had talked of the \u201cmiracle that peace in Europe represents,\u201d leaned in closer to his interpreter. Then, as evening fell over Dresden and church bells tolled, thousands - possibly as many as 10,000, according to the city's press office - lined up along Dresden's riverfront, holding hands to commemorate the dead and call for peace as police men dressed in black riot gear looked on. \"I can remember it all,\" Siegfriede Leonhard, a vivacious woman in her late 70s said. She was 7 when the bombs fell, she said, and had been coming to the commemorations in Dresden \"for at least 60 years.\" Sometimes, she said, stomping her feet to keep warm, she wondered whether she shouldn't remember at home, alone. \"",
        "generated_story": "Dresden hit by Allied bombings The German city of Dresden was hit on February 13, 1945, by a series of Allied bombing attacks. The bombing of the city was the first major attack on the German capital since the end of World War II. German Chancellor Joachim Gauck was killed in a bombing attack in the eastern German state of Saxony-Anhalt in February 1945. He was a member of Germany's Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization Of the West (PEGIDA), a group of anti-war activists who opposed the Nazi regime in Germany. In a statement, Dresden's mayor, Helma Orosz, said the bombing was \"an act of war\" and that \"the German people were to blame for the destruction of their city.\" \"We are not going to allow this to happen again,\" she said. \"It is a crime against humanity, and it is against the rule of law that we are to act in this way.\" The bombings were carried out by the Soviet Red Army, which attacked Dresden in August 1945 and September that year. At the same time, the regime of Adolf Hitler, who ruled Germany from 1933 to 1945 until his death in exile in 1961, was also responsible for a number of attacks on German cities, including Berlin, Cologne, Hamburg, Munich and Dresden. During the war, Nazi Germany and the United States were both heavily involved in bombing Dresden and other cities in eastern Europe. Germany was one of only a handful of countries in Europe to have suffered such an attack, according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), which monitors the fate of refugees and migrants from war-torn countries. It is not clear how many of these attacks took place in Dresden, but it seems likely that at least some of them were directed at the Germans. According to DW's Naomi Conrad, a former German intelligence officer who worked as a liaison officer with the government, there was no evidence that the attacks were aimed at Germany or the US. However, it was not immediately clear whether or not the bombings had been directed against Dresden or whether they were part of a wider plan to bomb the entire city. DW also reported that German police chief Yadegar Asisi said that there were no reports of any casualties. But he did say that a \"significant number\" of police officers were injured in one bombing, as well as in another. A police spokesman told DW: \"There is no indication at this time that any of this is the case at all. There are no indications that it has been a terrorist attack. We do not have any information about the exact nature of what is happening.\" In an interview with DW last week, German Foreign Minister Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, he said he had \"no idea\" what was going on, adding that he would like to know more about what happened next. On February 14, 1944, Berlin was bombed by an Allied bomber. By the time the attack was over, Germany had already suffered a total loss of more than 1,000 people. This was followed by another bombing in January 1945 that killed around 2,500 people and wounded around 3,200. That was in addition to Dresden being hit with an explosion and a firebombing of an apartment building. When the bomb went off in May 1945 the Berlin Wall was destroyed by fire from a German bomber, killing around 100 people, injuring hundreds of others and injuring thousands more."

        "target": "Experts: Taliban have not changed strategy with Kabul restaurant attack The weekend attack on a Kabul restaurant frequented by foreigners came as no surprise to international organizations on the ground. Experts don't believe the Taliban have changed their strategy to target more civilians. Dramatic scenes must have played out in the restaurant: Guests sought cover under tables as a group of terrorists shot wildly into the dining rooms. News agencies report the restaurant owner tried in vain to fend off the attackers. He was among the more than 20 people who perished, most of whom were employees at international organizations. The attackers were also among the dead. During the evening dinner rush, at 7:00 p.m. Friday (17.01.2014), one of three Taliban members detonated his explosives-laden vest and blew a breach in the highly secured restaurant. Neither the man-high blast walls, nor the secured access points with armed guards could stop the attackers. The two remaining terrorists were killed later in a firefight with security forces at the scene. No change in Taliban strategy The suicide bombing on the popular Lebanese restaurant, Taverna Du Liban, in the high-end Kabul neighborhood of Wazir Akbar Khan was the worst attack so far in 2014. Afghanistan votes for a new president in April; and the international troops are scheduled to withdraw from the country by the end of the year. Although there are plans for a small contingent to remain in Afghanistan, President Hamid Karzai first has to sign a bilateral security agreement with the United States. But he continues to play for time. In this context, the Taliban may be targeting civilians more in order to drive out not just the military coalition, but the entire international community. Yet \"as horrible as this incident is, I don't see a change in strategy,\" said Thomas Ruttig, the co-director of the Afghan Analysts Network. Similar attacks have also been launched before, \"at least 12 to 15 times in the past eight years,\" Ruttig said. The worst attack was in 2012 at Qargha Lake, a popular weekend destination near Kabul. More than 20 people were killed, all of them Afghans. Extensive security precautions The Taliban, which normally doesn't miss an opportunity for fiery rhetoric, hasn't declared a change in strategy. A spokesman for the Islamist militant group said the attack was retaliation for a NATO airstrike in Parwan Province, a few kilometers north of Kabul. According to an assistant of the Afghan president, seven children and one woman died in the coalition strike. \"You have to carefully monitor the security situation,\" Nils W\u00f6rmer, head of the Konrad Adenauer Institute in Kabul, told DW. \"But I think it's a bit early to talk about a change in [Taliban] strategy.\" W\u00f6rmer's office lies just a few hundred meters from the site of Friday's attack. He could clearly hear the explosion, which shook the window panes in his office. \"It was immediately clear to me that something had happened,\" W\u00f6rmer recounted. But the Konrad Adenauer Institute was prepared. \"We had a relatively concrete warning in the last week related to our neighborhood, and we were very cautious,\" W\u00f6rmer said. He met with colleagues in his secured office. Like most of the international organizations, the Konrad Adenauer Institute is also integrated into the security networks. \"The security precautions are high,\" W\u00f6rmer said. \"But that doesn't exclude the possibility that something similar could happen again.\" But the Afghan security forces have succeeded in preventing many attacks in the past few months, he said. Kabul residents criticize Taliban An informal, impromptu poll by DW's Kabul correspondent, Hussein Sirat, suggested the Taliban are not winning Afghan hearts and minds with such attacks. \"Wherever the Taliban have killed civilians, they have not achieved their goal,\" said Mirwais, a pedestrian in the Kabul city center. Idris, another Kabul resident, seconded Mirwais' sentiment. \"The Taliban intimidate the people so that the security agreement won't be signed,\" he said. \"But the people won't bend to this intimidation.\" How the international organizations adapt to the tense security situation in Kabul will come after many conversations, analyses, and briefings in the following days. But W\u00f6rmer is not thinking about giving up. \"We have a clear agenda and long-term projects, which I considered to be very sensible,\" W\u00f6rmer said. \"I am of the opinion, as I was before, that what I'm doing here with the Konrad Adenauer Institute is worth the risks.\"",
        "generated_story": "The Taliban haven't changed their strategy with the Kabul restaurant attack, Afghan analysts say. The Afghan government has not changed its strategy in the wake of the deadly attack on a popular restaurant in Kabul. Afghan officials say the Taliban have not made any changes in their approach to the attack. \"We have no change in our strategy,\" said Thomas Ruttig, a Kabul-based analyst at the Konrad Adenauer Institute, in an interview with Reuters. He added that \"the Taliban are not going to give up on the Afghan people.\" \"They will continue to fight,\" he said, adding that Afghan security forces have been working closely with Afghan authorities to ensure that no one is killed or injured, and that the attackers will not be allowed to carry out attacks on civilians. However, he added, \"There is still a lot of work to be done in Afghanistan.\" The Taliban, who have seized control of most of Afghanistan's cities and towns since the fall of Soviet-backed Afghan President Hamid Karzai in 2011, have also been able to exert influence on Kabul's political and security apparatus. In the past, the insurgents have used the city as a base for their attacks. But in recent months, they have turned Kabul into a Taliban stronghold. Last week, Taliban insurgents attacked a hotel in central Kabul, killing at least 10 people and wounding more than 100 others. On Thursday, gunmen attacked the hotel, setting off a firework display and setting it on fire. Taliban spokesman Wazir Akbar Khan, however, said the attacks were not related to terrorism, but rather to a lack of coordination between the government and the militant group, which controls the country's military and police forces. Khan said he was not aware of any new attacks, although he had been briefed by Afghan intelligence officials about the latest developments. According to W\u00f6rmer, there was no immediate claim of responsibility for Monday's attack but that it was a \"mistake\" by the militants to blame the attacker for the incident. A spokesman for Afghan political analyst Nils W\u00fcrmer told Reuters: \"The attack is not the first time that we have seen this kind of violence. It is the second time in a very short period of time. There has been an increase in attacks and we are still waiting for an official statement from the president. We are hopeful that he will make a full statement on Monday.\" A senior Afghan official told the AFP news agency that there were \"no new developments\" with regard to Monday night's assault, saying \"there is no new information about what is happening.\" But he did not say whether the gunmen were planning to attack the restaurant, or whether they were preparing to launch a new attack against the capital, Kabul on Tuesday. Wirmer pointed out that a number of people had already been killed in previous attacks in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Pakistan."

        "target": "Teabag filter cleans water with nanotechnology A new water filter developed in South Africa could provide millions of people with clean drinking water. The filter, about the size and shape of a teabag, would be inexpensive, easy to distribute and simple to use. Marelize Botes is conducting a final set of tests on a new type of diminutive water filter before industrial production can begin. The microbiologist pours water from a plastic bottle though a high-tech, teabag-sized filter before analyzing it in her in her laboratory at the University of Stellenbosch in South Africa. \"The filter is much cheaper than bottled water as well as any other filter on the market,\" she told Deutsche Welle. Instead of being filled with black or green tea, the bag contains active carbon granules and is made from nanofibers treated with biocide, which kills bacteria rather than simply filtering them from the water. Nanotech for pennies \"This project takes nanotechnology to the poorest of the poor people who live in this world, and it will make a difference in their lives,\" said Eugen Cloete, who in addition to inventing the filter is dean of the faculty of science at Stellenbosch University and chair of Stellenbosch University's Water Institute. With some 300 million people in Africa - and over a billion worldwide - living without access to clean drinking water, the need for such a filter is huge. When in mass production, the developers said they expect the teabag to cost just a few South African cents (under half a US cent and under a third of a euro cent). In addition to being inexpensive, Botes said, the filter is also easy to distribute to rural area and simple to use as it can be place in an adapter that fits on nearly any regular-sized plastic bottle. Each filter can clean one liter (one quart) of the most polluted water to the point where it is completely safe to drink. Once used, the filter can be disposed of and is biodegradable. African countries, led by Somalia, Mauritania and Sudan, were ranked to have the most vulnerable water supplies, according to a June report by UK-based risk consultancy firm Maplecroft. Decentralized use The filter's small size and light weight make it ideal for rural areas where other means of filtration do not exist, Cloete said. \"It is simply impossible to build purification infrastructure at every polluted stream,\" Cloete said. \"So we have to take the solution to the people. The water is cleaned right then and there when you drink from the bottle.\" The filter is now undergoing testing by the South African Bureau of Standards, after which Cloete and his team hope it can be rolled out to the United Nations and non-governmental organizations that have expressed interest in it by the end of the year. The project grew out of research into larger filters, according to Cloete. \"We were busy developing filters for larger applications, but when you do the tests in the labatory you do the tests on a much smaller scale,\" he said. \"The results we were getting on a smaller amount of water promoted me to think about a smaller application.\" Author: Joerg Poppendieck, Sean Sinico Editor: Anke Rasper",
        "generated_story": "South Africa's Teabag-sized water filter for decentralized drinking in Africa The world's largest water filtration system has been launched in South Africa. It is the first of its kind in the world. The technology is being developed by the University of Stellenbosch in partnership with the South African Water Institute (MAPI) to improve water quality in rural areas of the country. According to Marelize Botes, a professor of water science at the university, the technology will be used to make drinking water more efficient and efficient. \"We are going to use this technology in a way that will allow us to meet the needs of rural communities,\" she told Deutsche Welle in an interview published on Thursday. Bote said the system would be able to be deployed in areas where water is scarce, such as rural and urban areas. She added that it would also be possible to develop a water-saving system that would allow people to drink water from the same source as they would from a traditional source, which is not available in other African countries. However, she said it was too expensive and would not be practical for people who do not have access to a reliable source of clean water. \u201cWe will have to see how it is done,\u201d she added, adding that the new technology would help reduce the number of people living in poverty and make it easier for them to access the water they need to live in their homes. In the past, water was rationed, but now there is no rationing at all. There is only a small percentage of households who use water that is available to them. This is due to the high cost of running water, and the fact that there are currently very few households that can afford to pay for it. That is why the government has decided to introduce a new system for distributing water to households and small businesses, rather than relying on private companies to provide it to their customers. But this system is still in its early stages and is expected to last until the end of this year. At the moment, it will only be available for households with a certain amount of disposable income. And it's not just the poor who are suffering from chronic water shortages. For those of us who don't have the means to buy water directly, we have a lot of money to invest in it and we will continue to do so. We are looking forward to seeing what the future holds for our water supply.\u201cI am very excited about the potential for decentralization in our country and I am hopeful that we can make a difference in terms of reducing the need for private consumption. I hope that this will lead to more people using water as a substitute for electricity and other forms of energy sources,\" said Eugen Cloete, president of Maplecroft, an agricultural research institute in Johannesburg. He pointed out that in order to achieve this goal, there must be a level of transparency and transparency in water supplies. So far, this has not been achieved, he said, with little sign of change in public health and sanitation. On the other hand, many people are concerned about how much water will go into the tap and how quickly it can be converted into electricity. Many of them are not even aware that they are drinking enough water for their family and friends. They are more concerned with their own health, for example, about their health or their children's well-being, or the health of their pets. These are the things that are most at risk in developing countries like the United States and Europe. What is most important is that people understand that water should be treated with respect and respect for human dignity and dignity, not only for the environment but also for other people's health as well. As a result, they will benefit from having a better understanding of what is important in this world and what it takes to ensure that their needs are met. One thing is for sure: water can't be replaced by electricity without the support of a government or a private company, so it has to come up with an alternative energy source. If that isn't the case, then the solution is to have an independent water source that meets the standards set out by a state-owned company or private water company. While this is a promising idea, I think it could be an important step forward in addressing this problem. A water purification system will also help to reduce water bills and improve the quality of life in many areas, including the elderly and those with chronic health problems. Some of these problems are even more acute in poorer countries, where the population is at a high rate of low levels. When it comes to renewable energy, however, these issues are far from being solved, according to industry experts, who have been working on the project for many years. 'Water is something that cannot be solved by government alone,' said Eunice Klaasen, head of research and development at University College Cape Town (UCT) in Pretoria."

        "target": "How to wrap a present without using paper or tape Next time you get invited to a birthday party, you could try wrapping the present using a piece of fabric and ribbon. It's very easy and the best bit is, it can be reused. Maybe it will come back to you on your birthday. 1. All you need is a piece of fabric big enough to wrap your gift, a ribbon long enough to go right around it, and if you want to make a gift tag, you will also need a piece of old cardboard, a hole punch and another small piece of ribbon. Ready? 2. No, wait, we forgot the present. Get that, and you have everything you need. Spread the fabric on the ground and put your gift on top 3. Fold the fabric around the gift you are wrapping 4. With the last little bit, you don't tuck it under, but create a little flap on top 5. Fold that flap over like this 6. Take one end of the parcel and tuck the fabric inside, BEHIND the gift inside 7. You can take your time to wiggle it all inside. Make it as flat as you can 8. Once it is all inside, turn to the other end and do the same thing again 9. When you have done both ends, it should look like this. Your present is all tucked up inside and you don't need any tape to keep it closed 10. Now for the ribbon. Place the gift on top of it 11. Tie the bow 12. So it looks like this. Finished? If you want a gift tag, that comes now. If you don't you're done! 13. Cut a piece out of an old cardboard box and make a hole in it using a hole punch. Watch your fingers though ;) 14. Put a piece of short ribbon through your hole 15. Tie the tag to your gift 16. And you are finished! P.S. You can either ask your friend to reuse the fabric, and show them how to wrap with it, or if they don't like that idea, you can take it home with you to use again the next time. And remember, you don't have to buy the fabric. You can use an old pillow case, an old t-shirt or skirt, or whatever you want. You can even make your ribbon from an old t-shirt if you don't have any. Happy wrapping.",
        "generated_story": "How to Wrap a Present Without Using Paper or Tape In order to wrap a present without using paper or tape, you have to use paper and tape. How do you do this? You can do it with paper, tape or even a pen. You simply wrap the present in a plastic bag and put it on the table. That's how you wrap your present. It's a very simple process, and it's very easy to do. Just wrap it in plastic wrap and you're good to go. There's no need to worry about paper. If you don't have a paper bag, then you can just use pen and ink. And that's just the way it is. Paper is the most common material used for wrapping presents. But it can also be used in other ways. For example, if you use tape and paper wrap, it doesn't work as well as it used to. This is because the tape is too thick and the paper is very thin, so it won't hold up well in the dryer. Also, the plastic is not very flexible and can be very difficult to hold onto, which is why it takes a lot of time and effort to get the material to the right places. So, when you are wrapping your presents, be careful what you put on top of the packaging. Don't put too much pressure on your hands or your fingers. Use a knife or a tape measure. Then you'll be able to put your finger in your mouth and tell the difference between the two. In the end, this is how it will be done. The final step is to make sure that the wrapping is as good as possible and that you get a good look at the product before you leave the room. When you return to your room, put some tape over your face and then put a piece of paper over the top. After all, that is what is supposed to happen when a person is sitting in front of a computer screen and reading a book. Do you know how many times this has happened? If so, how often has this happened to you? I think it has to be at least once a year. I'm not sure I can say for sure, but it seems like a long time now that I've been doing this for a few years now. What I do know is that when I get home from work, I want to take a look around and see if there's anything I could do to improve my chances of success. \"I'm going to try something new,\" I tell myself, \"and then I'll tell you what I will do.\" I also tell my wife, who is a nurse and a mother of two, about how I feel about this and how much I miss her. She's always been very patient and patient with me and I try to give her the best advice and help her understand that she's not the only one who needs help with this. As a result, she'll always be the first one to tell me what's going on in her life. We'll see what happens when she gets home. One thing is for certain, though: She'll probably never know what the future holds for me. At the moment, there is no one else in my life who knows what will happen to me, because I have no idea what to expect from her, or how long it'll take me to figure out how to live with myself and my family. On the other hand, my mother and grandmother are both very happy and very proud of me for being a mom. They've always had a great relationship with each other. My mother was always a big fan of my father's and she was very good at helping me with my hair and making me feel good about myself. Now she has a daughter, a son and an older sister. Her father is also a professor at a university in New York City. He's an excellent cook and he's also an expert in cooking and baking. His father was a successful chef in his day job and has always taught me a thing or two about the importance of cooking, baking and cooking for his family and friends. Both of them are very important to him, he says. However, his father died when he was young and his mother died of cancer in 1980. Since then, all of his children have had to learn to cook, bake and cook without any help from him. All of these things are important for them to succeed in their own way. These are the things that will make them successful in life and for my dad, they're all important things to have in order for us to enjoy life in this day and age. Having a family is always something to look forward to, especially when it comes to making sure we have everything we need for our children and grandchildren. Sometimes, we just need a little bit of everything, even if it means that we can't do everything for ourselves or our own children. A lot has changed since I started cooking my own cooking. Today I learned that my mom and dad were both really good cooks and we're both of course"

The ruling primarily affects Germany's Turkish minority. The European Union's highest court on Thursday ruled in favor of a Turkish citizen, who was denied a visa to live in Germany with her husband, because she was illiterate and therefore unable to demonstrate basic German-language skills. According to the court, a lack of language skills shouldn't automatically lead to the rejection of an entry visa application. Instead, Germany must consider the unique circumstances of each individual case. The court went on to say that quickly granting visas for spouses improves the quality of life and promotes the integration of foreign residents. Specifically addressing the case of the Turkish plaintiff, the court ruled that the rejection of her visa had violated a bilateral treaty between Turkey and the EU. In 1970, Brussels and Ankara agreed not to tighten their residency laws for each other's citizens. Law only applies to some In 2007, Germany introduced the requirement that spouses from certain non-EU countries must demonstrate a basic grasp of German before being granted a visa to live in Germany with their husbands or wives. Spouses affected by the law are required to obtain a basic language certificate from recognized centers, such as Germany's Goethe Institute, proving that they have an A1 level, or \"Beginning German\" language ability. The German government claims that the goal of the language requirement is to prevent forced marriages as well as marriages made simply for the sake of obtaining a visa. Citizens of European Free Trade Association (EFTA) member states are exempt from the language requirement. That includes Iceland, Lichtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. In addition, citizens of Australia, Canada, Israel, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea and the United States also don't have to demonstrate German-language skills. slk/xx (AFP, AP, dpa, KNA)",
        "generated_story": "EU court overturns German language skills law The European Court of Justice on Thursday overturned a law requiring the use of German as a second language for spouses. The law, which was passed by the European Union's lower house of parliament in Strasbourg last year, is set to go into effect on July 1, 2019. Read more: The EU's top court has ruled that Germany's new language law should not be applied to spouses of EU citizens living in the EU. In a ruling published on Wednesday, the court said the law was unconstitutional and that it was not binding on spouses who live in other EU member states. \"The law does not require spouses to use German in order to be able to communicate with one another,\" the ruling said in a statement. It also said that the new law would not affect spouses whose spouses were already married and whose children were living with them in Germany. However, it did not rule out the possibility that spouses could be required to speak German if they were married, according to a report from the Goethe Institute in Brussels. According to the report, German-born spouses would have to register their spouses' names and addresses in German before being allowed to travel to other European countries. This would be the first time in more than 30 years that a German spouse would need to sign up for a language course. But it is unclear how long this will last, given that German and Turkish spouses are not legally obliged to do so. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said she will not sign off on the legislation until the end of the year. On Thursday, she said her government would continue to work with the Commission on European Integration (ECI) to ensure that all German spouses have the opportunity to learn German. She added that she was \"very happy\" that her husband had signed up to take part in this course, adding that \"it is not a question of whether or not his wife is qualified to teach him German.\" The Commission said it would look into the matter further, but that there was no evidence to support the decision. A spokesman for the German government, however, said: \"We do not have any evidence that this is the case at the moment. We have no information on this.\" In the past, Germany has been the only country in Europe to have a legal system in place that allows spouses and children to practice German, Turkish and other foreign languages in their own country. That's why we have an EU-wide system of language training that is designed to protect the rights of spouses, children and their children from discrimination. There is also a European Commission-mandated system that will allow spouses with German or Turkish passports to enter the country without having to prove that they have German citizenship. For example, if a spouse has a Turkish passport, then they can enter Germany legally. If they don't have Turkish citizenship, they will be subject to deportation. They can also be deported to Turkey, where they could face a lifetime of imprisonment if convicted of a crime committed against their country of origin. Germany is one of only a handful of countries in which this law is in force, including the United States, Canada, France, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands. While there is no legal basis for such a move, there are a number of other countries that have similar laws. One of these countries, for instance, has the right to impose a ban on foreign language courses on their citizens. Another is Turkey. Turkey is a member of NATO, and Turkey has its own version of this system. Both countries have different laws and regulations, such as the one that bans the practice of using Turkish as an official language. These are the same ones that apply to German nationals living abroad. As a result, these laws are in effect only in countries where the Turkish language is used as part of their national identity. What is more important is that these rules are enforced in accordance with international law and not in any way related to their nationality or nationality. So, this means that, in many cases, Turkey can't use the language of another country, as long as they are married to someone who is Turkish. And that's something that Turkey doesn't want to commit to. At the very least, that means they cannot use it in an attempt to gain access to Germany, even if that person is of Turkish origin, or who has no Turkish background. With the exception of Turkey's own language, many of them are Turkish, who are also not Turkish-speakers. Nevertheless, both countries are bound to follow the rules of European law. After all, their relations with Turkey have always been very close to each other, so it's not really a matter of which country is which is responsible for what happens to which partner. When it comes to foreign relations, a lot of people are going to get married or have children who have been married for many years. Since the 1990s, European governments have had to deal with this issue in some way or another. Last year's EU referendum was a referendum on whether to allow the marriage of two Turkish nationals to stay in Turkey to"

Striker Mario Gomez got things going in the 10th minute for Bayern and also scored the final goal in the 75th minute off a corner kick from Franck Ribery. Ribery came on as a substitute five minutes earlier, making his first appearance for the team since injuring his ankle in September.

The German champions have won three of their last four matches, including the last three. On Saturday, the Bundesliga's top two sides met at home for the first time since the end of the 2014-15 season. Freiburg, who have been in the top four for three years, were the clear favorites to win the league this time around, with a win in their first match since Aug. 11. They had to settle for a draw after losing a 1-1 draw at Hoffenheim on Saturday. Bayern, meanwhile, have a three-match winless streak in all competitions. In their opening two matches this season, they have lost only once, and that was in a 2-2 draw with FC Augsburg on Sunday. That was the only time they had beaten a top-flight side in almost a decade. It was also the second time in as many matches that they lost to a side that had a chance to get back on track. But they were unable to do that, as the visitors were able to hold on to their lead. After the break, Bayern took the lead, only to be undone by a goal from Mario Gomez and a second from Ciss. \"It was a very good performance,\" said Bayern coach Franck Ribery of his side's win over the Wolfsburg side, adding that he was \"very happy\" with the result. He added that \"it was great to see the way that we came back from the brink of defeat,\" and added: \"I was very happy with how we ended up in this position. I was happy because I felt like we were on the right track.\" The win was Bayern's third in four games and they are on course to reach the Champions League quarterfinals in Germany next year. Facing the same fate as Bayern last year, their season has been marred by injuries, suspensions and suspensions. At the start of this campaign, a number of key players were sent to the sidelines, but the club's coach, Franz Beckenbauer, insisted that the players would not be allowed to return to action. Instead, he said, \"We will continue to work hard to make sure we get the best out of them.\" On the other hand, there is still a lot to learn from this weekend's match against FC North Rhine-Westphalia, where the German side have already clinched a first-ever Bundesliga title. A win would be a major step forward in terms of improving their chances of reaching the semi-finals. However, it would also mean they would have to start the season on a high note. With the exception of a player who was suspended for two games for an alleged sexual assault last month, Rhineland-Palatinate coach Thomas Tuchel has said he will be looking into the possibility of re-signing a contract extension with his club next summer. If that's the case, then he is not going to sign a new deal. For now, his contract is to stay at Bayern until the summer transfer window closes on July 1, which is when he'll be eligible to rejoin his former club, N\u00fcrnberg-Schweden, for whom he has already signed a one-year contract. His contract runs out on June 30, 2014. Cussi, however, has yet to confirm whether or not he intends to renew his deal with Bayern. Last year he signed an extension until 2015, after he returned from a year-long medical leave with an undisclosed medical condition. As a result of that contract, Cossi has not yet been cleared to resume playing for his country's national team."

In a statement released Tuesday, Iranian officials said the two men had no contact with each other, and that the charges against them were not related to their alleged involvement in any terrorist activity. Slovakia has been accused of providing Iran with information about the activities of its spy agencies, including spying for the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Japan, China, Russia, Turkey, Iran, North Korea, South Korea and the Middle East. Iran has denied the allegations, saying they are \"basically fabricated\" and \"not true.\" The Iranian government has also said that it is not aware of any links between Iran and Slovakia. According to an official statement from Tehran's embassy in New York, it was not immediately clear whether Iranian agents were involved with the alleged espionage operation. Iranian media outlets reported on Monday that Iranian investigators had arrested the six men on charges of espionage and money laundering. An Iranian official told the Associated Press news agency that Iran had asked the government to extradite the three men to face espionage charges. Tehran has said it would cooperate fully with any extradition proceedings against the accused, adding that Tehran is \"very interested\" in extraditing the four men. It is also not clear if the Iranians have any information that could be used to try to influence the extradition process, or if they have no information at all about what is going on. At the same time, Tehran says it will continue to monitor the case and will make sure that all the suspects are brought to justice. There is no indication that any charges will be brought against Iran or that they will face any kind of trial. However, there is a possibility that some of these men could face a prison sentence if extraditions are carried out. On Wednesday, an American man was arrested and charged with conspiring to commit espionage. He was released without bail on a $1.5 million bond after being found guilty of attempted murder in Tehran last month. His lawyer, Shane Bauer,"

        "target": "French presidential debate does little to woo undecided voters This year's French presidential race is perhaps the most closely watched election in recent history. Many voters are still undecided, including those in the Paris caf\u00e9 where DW's Jake Cigainero saw the latest TV debate. Just over two weeks ahead of the first round of voting in France's presidential election, all 11 candidates met for the second televised debate of the campaign. It was the first time in the history of French elections that the entire official ballot shared a television stage. This race for the Elysee is perhaps the most closely watched election in the history of the Fifth Republic in view of conservative candidate Francois Fillon's embezzlement charges, the deterioration of the left, political amateur Emmanuel Macron's surprise surge to the top, and the rise of Marine Le Pen's National Front. With so much media attention on the five main candidates, Tuesday's debate felt almost like a consolation for the six other candidates rarely in the spotlight. For French voters watching the televised debate at Cafe des Phares on Place de la Bastille, the saturated stage kept the candidates from detailed discussion of pressing issues. For those who are still undecided, the debate did little to bring them closer to choosing their pick for president. Vincent Couronne, a researcher, said it was good to see candidates who don't get as much media attention. However, 11 candidates at once for the political spectator was overkill. \"It wasn't very interesting. It's just one position after another. There's no real debate. It's not like when it was just five candidates.\" Boredom all round Charlotte Theuvenin and her friends, all students in their early 20s, tuned out early on from boredom and exasperation. \"It was too flat and too hypocritical. Fillon and Le Pen play with our money, then say they did nothing and that they are good for our country,\" she said. As though addressing the candidates in front of her on the TV screen, she added, \"How dare you talk about being president when you use our money for your own interests.\" Le Pen had come under fire over accusations that she misused public funds to pay bodyguards as parliamentary assistants. Francois Fillon of Les Republicains, meanwhile, is under investigation for allegedly paying family members more than 1 million euros ($1.1 million) for government work they never carried out. Frequently casting a blank stare at his opponents, Fillon also seemed bored, or at least more subdued compared to the first debate. Couronne said, \"Fillon seems to be not there. Probably because he knows all the small candidates can attack him on the criminal offenses he's accused of.\" Debate watchers cited Europe as the most important issue of this election, with many fearing Le Pen's promise to tear France out of the European Union in a so-called Frexit. Though no one at the cafe vocally supported Le Pen's plan, several acknowledged the EU is a pressure point for France. \"France's place in Europe in relation to Germany is a very important issue,\" said student Thibault Cirier. \"The general problem is France has lost its influence at the European level over the years, and that needs to be remedied, because France is one of the founders of Europe and should have a strong place in the union. The EU is also important for cohesion and to have a strong position internationally.\" Caf\u00e9 viewers say no to Le Pen Cirier was initially excited by Macron when he launched his campaign, but ultimately decided there was no substance. Now he says he will probably vote for far-left candidate Jean-Luc Melenchon. Kevser Taspinar also said she liked Melenchon for his fighting spirit and that \"he throws barbs.\" As a practicing Muslim who wears a headscarf, she said the most important issue for her is laicite, France's state institution of secularism. \"For me Hamon has the best interpretation of this. Maybe Hamon,\" Taspinar said hesitating. \"I'm still undecided, because there's Melenchon.\" Another viewer, Marie Dubois, said that although she really liked Melenchon, she had definitively decided on Macron. \"Melenchon has a way of putting humanity in politics and giving hope,\" she said. \"But Macron is the only possible candidate.\" With polls putting Le Pen and Macron in the second round on May 7, the undecided voters at this Paris cafe said they were certain which candidate they would not for vote for in that scenario. \"Definitely Macron. There is no way I am going to vote for Le Pen,\" Theuvenin said. \"I will never vote for that woman or Front National, no matter who is running against them in the second round.\" Tuesday was the final debate for Macron and Melenchon, two of the crowd-pleasers among the candidates. Both have pulled out of the third debate on grounds that it cuts too close to the first vote just two days later on April 23.",
        "generated_story": "France's far-right National Front has a new leader. The party's leader, Marine Le Pen, is a former member of the French parliament. But she's also a political newcomer to the party. DW's Jake Cigainero takes a look at France's new presidential candidate, Francois Fillon, in his first interview since the election. \"I'm not a candidate for the presidency of France,\" he says, adding that he's \"not a politician at all.\" \"But I'm a journalist, and I have a lot of experience in politics. I've always been interested in the politics of politics,\" says French journalist and political scientist Kevser Taspinar, who has written a book on French politics and is now a professor at the \u00c9lyssee University in Paris. His book is titled \"No, No, Yes,\" and it's based on interviews with French politicians and journalists. In the book, he talks about the current political climate in France and how the country has become a \"political laboratory\" for political parties. He also looks at how far the right has come in recent years. On the campaign trail, French President Nicolas Sarkozy and his conservative party, the Les Republicains, have been on a collision course over the past few weeks. They've been at it for a while now, with the new president, Emmanuel Macron, running for re-election in November's presidential election, facing a challenge from the center-left. French media outlets reported on Monday that the president's campaign team had been in contact with his wife, Charlotte Theuvenin, to discuss the possibility of a second presidential run-off between the two candidates, which is due to take place on Sunday. A spokesman for French Prime Minister Manuel Valls told DW: \"We are not going to allow a third candidate to run for president. We will not allow him to step down until the first candidate is elected.\" The French president is expected to announce his intention to form a coalition government with Macron's party in May's national elections. However, it is not clear whether he will be able to do so. According to a report in French daily Le Monde, a newspaper published by the Paris-based daily, \"The Sunday Times\" on Saturday, May 13, 2017, that Macron will seek to win the presidential elections in June. It is unclear whether or not the former president will run again, or if he'll seek another term in office, but it seems certain that his party will continue to be the front-runner. After all, France is the only country in Europe with a president who is willing to stand up for what he believes in, even if it means sacrificing his own interests in order to get the job done. And that's not just because he wants to stay in power. There is also the question of how long he can keep his job as a minister. That's a question that has been asked of him by many French and German journalists, especially those who work in political circles. What do you think? Do you agree with him on this point? What does he think of Macron? \"He's the leader of this party? I don't think he has any interest in that,\" said French political analyst and journalist Vincent Couronne, referring to Macron as the \"grand candidate\" of his presidential campaign. Macron has also been accused of being too soft on the left-wing and anti-EU candidate. At the same time, his supporters have also accused him of racism and xenophobia. Some of them have called him a xenophobe, while others are calling him an \"anti-Semite.\" In a recent interview with DW, Macron said he doesn't believe in hate speech and that \"he's just a man of few words.\" But he also said that there is no such thing as hatred, as he said in an interview published in a French newspaper in July, when he was still a student at a university in Hamon."

And the news was good -- most of the numbers were down compared to the preceding year. Germany's streets were never particularly dangerous, but according to the Interior Ministry, they are now safer than at any time since statistics have been collected. Reported criminal offenses on the whole dropped by 1.4 percent over 2005 -- to a total of just over 6.3 million. \"The statistics show reductions in crime among children, adolescents and teenagers, as well as adults,\" said Sch\u00e4uble. He added that criminality among foreigners living in Germany also fell, saying that this development reflected Germany's efforts to integrate non-Germans. Drugs offenses were down 7.8 percent, followed by theft and street crime, which both declined by four percent or more. Youth violence Vandalism, on the other hand, was up 5.9 percent. Fraud rose slightly, as did violent crime -- among young people by an alarming 4.5 percent. Berlin Interior Minister Erhart K\u00f6rting said that was part of a decade-long trend in Germany. \"As many experts have pointed out,\" K\u00f6rting said, \"the potential for violence in society is increasing.\" The head of the German Police Officers' Union Konrad Freiberg also said those figures showed that German society was not truly getting safer. Frankfurt tops most-dangerous list Crime was down in Frankfurt am Main, but it's still the German city with the greatest number of criminal offenses person 100,000 people. Hanover was a close second, followed by D\u00fcsseldorf, Bremen and Berlin. The total percentage of criminal cases solved by German police also improved slightly from 55 to 55.4 percent. According to the study, Germany's safest place was Bergisch Gladbach, a city of 100,000 inhabitants in the west of the country -- coincidentally, model Heidi Klum's home town.",
        "generated_story": "The State of Crime in Germany: The state of crime In Germany, crime is on the rise. That's why the government of Chancellor Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble is calling for an end to the state-of-the-art crime scene in the country. \"We are going to have to deal with crime,\" he said in a speech in Frankfurt am Main on Thursday. The speech was delivered by the interior minister of Germany's largest state, the Interior Ministry, which is responsible for the security of the German economy and the welfare of its citizens. It was accompanied by a statement from Chancellor Angela Merkel, who said that Germany was \"on the right track\" in its fight against crime. Merkel's government, however, has yet to make a decision on whether or not to allow the police to take over the investigation into the murder of a German woman and her two children. In an interview with Deutsche Welle, German Chancellor Merkel said she would not rule out the possibility that police would be able to seize the bodies of women and children, but that she was willing to do so in order to protect the interests of her own people. She added that \"it is not a crime to break the law, it is an act of justice.\" The German government has been accused of using excessive force against its own citizens, and that has led to a rise in violent crime in recent years. On Thursday, Merkel called for a \"total and complete shutdown\" of all police forces, including the Bundeswehr (Bundeskanzler), the federal police force, as well as the army and intelligence agencies. Berlin's interior ministry said it would continue to cooperate with the authorities in their efforts to crack down on crimes committed by police officers and other members of society. But it did not say how many people were killed or injured, nor did it say whether they were injured or whether it was the result of repeated police raids. German media reported that a number of people had been arrested in connection with a series of attacks on police stations in Berlin, Frankfurt, Cologne, Hamburg, Munich and Frankfurt. Police said they had arrested more than 1,000 people, many of whom were suspected of having links to terrorist organizations. A police spokesman said: \"There is no evidence to suggest that any of these individuals were involved in any way. We have not seen any evidence of any such attacks. There is a lack of evidence that these attacks have been carried out.\" In addition, a police officer was arrested and charged with attempted murder in an attack on a Berlin police station last week, according to an internal police report. An internal investigation has also been launched into an incident in which a man was shot and wounded. However, police said the officer had not been seriously injured."

        "target": "All or nothing for Bayern in Champions final Bayern Munich have one last chance to salvage a season that has otherwise been marked by their inability to beat Borussia Dortmund: a win against Chelsea in the Champions League final at their home stadium. All season long, Bayern Munich have been consumed with achieving one goal: reaching the final of the Champions League, held at their own Allianz Arena in Munich, and raising the trophy in front of their home fans. After finishing a distant second place to Dortmund in the Bundesliga and dismally losing to them 5-2 in the German Cup final, Bayern Munich are in a must-win situation Saturday against Chelsea. A loss would be the final straw in a disappointing season for a team that can't stand second place. A win for Bayern would mean redemption, to some extent, for their shortcomings in the league. Key players were rested down the stretch in the Bundesliga, especially before the two legs of Bayern's European semifinal against Real Madrid. That was an indication that Bayern had given up on the league and put all their eggs in one basket, hoping for a big payoff with the Champions League title. The same can be said for the German Cup final against Dortmund: true, Bayern essentially beat themselves by making mistake after mistake, but Bayern could, if they win Saturday, wipe the slate clean. Saving the season Win this match, and all will be forgiven in Munich. Lose, and it will be Bayern's second straight season without a piece of hardware, not to mention the heartbreak of losing the biggest match at Allianz Arena since it opened in 2005. \"We must not even think about [losing],\" said Bayern's Franck Ribery on Thursday. \"If we win the Champions League, then we can forget about not winning the league or the cup, nobody will care about that.\" Bayern are a team that thrives under pressure, and the high stakes of this match will be good for them. Chelsea are a team that showed in their semifinal upset of Barcelona that they can rise to a challenge, even if that challenge is simply holding on against a superior opponent. \"We are not the favorites of the game, we are playing away,\" Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech said on Thursday. \"It is very rare when you have the home team playing in the home stadium, using the home dressing room, so I think the advantage goes to Bayern Munich because of that. But we know we have a chance and we will fight for it.\" But this match will come down to the team that can better take advantage of holes that have been blown in each team's defense due to injuries and suspensions. Filling the gaps Between the two sides, seven starting players will miss out on the final. Chelsea saw Raul Meireles, Ramires, and Branislav Ivanovic each get their third yellow card in the second leg against Barcelona, and captain John Terry was given a straight red. Terry and Ivanovic are fixtures on Chelsea's backline, which was already at half-strength due to hamstring injuries suffered by Gary Cahill and David Luiz. Chelsea coach Roberto di Matteo hopes those two are fit enough for the final, since Chelsea will need all the help they can get in the back. For Bayern, David Alaba and Holger Badstuber - both defenders - and Luiz Gustavo, a defensive midfielder, are also suspended for picking up three yellow cards. The impact of the suspensions will hit Chelsea the most. In addition to a weakened back line, Meireles and Ramires are mainstays on offense, supporting strikers Didier Drogba or Fernando Torres. With Ramires out, Drogba could start as striker, with Torres moving to the wing. At any rate, there is more uncertainty in The Blues' lineup than there is in Bayern's, who will be able to rely on striker Mario Gomez and the dynamic-duo of Arjen Robben and Ribery on the wings as they have all season. Most of the question marks will still be defensive for both teams, but to think that this is an indication of a high-scoring affair on Saturday would be a discredit to both team's last lines of defense. Between the posts Neither side would be competing in the final if it wasn't for the heroics of the teams' keepers. Cech defended against wave after wave of attacks from Barcelona in the semifinal for Chelsea, and Manuel Neuer showed nerves of steel in Bayern's penalty shootout in the final leg against Real Madrid, blocking penalties from Madrid stars Cristiano Ronaldo and Kaka. Chelsea's best shot will be to come out of the gate at a sprint and gain an early advantage against Bayern, who will be doing everything they can to keep their long-cultivated dream-final in their control. Otherwise, Bayern's determination to salvage their season may be enough to carry them through to the trophy ceremony - at home, just like they planned it.

        "generated_story": "Borussia Dortmund vs. Bayern Munich in Champions League final The Blues are in the final of the German Cup, and they have a chance to win it all. They have to beat Barcelona to reach the quarterfinals. But they are not going to be able to do that, because they will be without their best player for a long time. That's the way it is for the Blues, who have been playing their hearts out since the end of last season. And that's not just for them, it's for their fans as well. After all, they can't afford to lose to a team that has already won the league and the Bundesliga, so they'll be looking to get back into the top four. \"It's a dream come true for us,\" said Raul Meireles, the head coach of Real Madrid and Bayern's coach at the Allianz Arena in Munich. It's also the first time in club history that a player from one of Germany's most successful clubs has been on the pitch for so long. He's had a great run of form so far this season, scoring four goals and setting up a goal in each of his last four games. The goal against Barcelona was his first in a Champions league match since joining the club in 2014. His first goal for Bayern came against a Barcelona side that had been beaten 3-0 in their previous two matches, but he was unable to put the game away. In the second half, he found the net again, this time with a header off the crossbar. This time, though, his goal was not enough to make it through to the semi-finals, as he had to wait until the last minute for his side to take the lead. On the other hand, Bayern had the better of him, with the ball in front of them and a good pass from the right-back to his left-hand side. At the very least, there was a lot of pressure on him to keep his head up and make sure that he didn't let his team-mates get away with it. As it turned out, that was exactly what he did. With the help of Diego Costa, Cech's side managed to hold on to their lead and win the match, which they lost 2-1 at home to Barcelona on aggregate. However, Barcelona's Luis Ramires, a former Barcelona player, was on hand to give the visitors the advantage in this match. Barcelona, meanwhile, have the upper hand in terms of possession and possession, although they do not have much of a possession advantage. Their advantage is that they don't have as many of their own players as they would have had against Bayern. For that reason, Barca are the clear favorites in next year's competition, while Bayern are on course to qualify for next season's European Cup final in Russia, where they face Ajax, Ajax and Manchester City. A win for Barcelona would be a huge boost for Dortmund, especially given the fact that their top-flight rivals have already been eliminated by Bayern this year. Ahead of Sunday's final, Manchester United will take on Barcelona in Group D, in what could be their first European final since they were knocked out last year by Sevilla in 2006-07. Real, however, are expected to play a very different game on Sunday, when they travel to Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach to face Bayern on Tuesday night. Both Bayern and Dortmund will play on Wednesday, after a clash between the two sides in Dortmund on Saturday night in an extra-time clash in Bavaria. Dortmund are favored to advance to next week's quarter-final, having already clinched a spot in Europe's premier club competition after beating Ajax last time out. Madrid are also favourites to go on top of Group G in Germany, ahead of Bayern, on Thursday night's semifinal tie against Ajax in Barcelona. Chelsea will also be hoping to avoid a repeat of that feat in Spain. Last year, Cristiano Ronaldo scored a hat-trick in his debut season for Chelsea, only to fall out of favor with his new club. Ronaldo has also been a key player in recent years, making him the most expensive player to ever make the starting lineup for that game. Now, Ronaldo is the man to step up in that role. There is no doubt that Ronaldo will have an important role in deciding the outcome of this weekend's clash with Barcelona - but that doesn't necessarily mean he'll have any say in how it will go down. What is certain is Ronaldo's absence will not be the same for Ronaldo and Ronaldo. If he does not play in Saturday's match against Atletico Madrid, then he's likely to miss out on an opportunity to start the season with an ankle injury. Meanwhile, Chelsea are still in contention for an automatic qualification spot for UEFA's Europa League next month. Cristian Schuerrle (AFP, dpa, Reuters)"

Catholic priest Carlo Alberto Capella was indicted on Saturday after a Vatican investigation found he had allegedly possessed and exchanged \"a large quantity\" of child pornography during his diplomatic posting. His trial will start on June 22 in front of a Vatican magistrate. If convicted, he could be sentenced to between one and five years in prison and fined between \u20ac2,500 and \u20ac50,000 ($2,100 to $42,000). He is being held in the city's police barracks.

The Capella case has hampered the Catholic Church's attempts to move on from its myriad of pedophile priest scandals. There has been particular focus in recent months on the Chilean branch of the Catholic Church ignoring and covering up of child abuse by pedophile priest Fernando Karadima during the 1980s and 1990s.

The charges stem from an investigation by the Vatican into the alleged abuse of minors by a priest in Chile. Capell, 64, is accused of distributing and distributing sexually explicit images and videos of children under the age of 14. He was arrested in Canada on Sunday and faces charges of sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of a minor. His lawyer, George Pell, told the Australian news agency AFP that the allegations were \"completely false.\" The Vatican has said the accusations were made in response to a complaint from a Chilean woman who said her son had sexually abused her. \"The allegations are completely false,\" Pell said in a statement to AFP. A Vatican spokesman said that a Vatican investigation had been launched in connection with the case, which was first reported to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) on Monday. It is the first time the US government has made a public accusation against a Catholic priest, who is suspected of having sex with minors in the 1980s and 1990s, according to an Associated Press report. In the report, the Catholic Church said it was \"deeply concerned\" about the child abuse allegations made against the priest and his wife, Maria, and their two children, as well as allegations that he had abused and abused minors. Pell also said he was aware of the charges, but did not know whether they were related to any of them. Vatican investigators are also looking into whether the abuse was committed by Capelli, a former priest who worked as an altar boy for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Chile (CPS). The investigation is expected to last several months and could take up to two to three years, Pell added, adding that it would be \"a very long time before we see the full extent of what is being done in this case.\" Capello has denied any involvement in any wrongdoing and has not been formally charged. Last year, he pleaded guilty to sexual assault and was sentenced to 15 years in prison for a charge of child sex abuse. On Sunday, Pope Francis called on the pontiff to step down from his post at the end of this month, saying he would no longer be able to continue his duties as a cardinal. Francis has also called for an end to papal visits to Chile and Australia, where the pope is scheduled to meet with bishops on Tuesday and Wednesday. At the same time, Francis is set to make a decision on whether or not to renew the papacy's ban on pedophilia and other forms of violence against minors, including the use of force against women and girls. If he does not renew his ban, it will be the second time he has to do so. More than 30,000 people are believed to be in danger of losing their jobs because of allegations of abuse or neglect of their duties. There is also a growing number of people who want to leave the church, such as the pastor and the chaplain, to return to their home countries. Some of these people, however, have already left the country. They have been living in poverty for many years and have no desire to come back. That's why the Pope is calling on them to stay in their homes and stay away from the Church. This is because they are the most vulnerable people in our society. And it's not just the children who are being abused by priests and nuns who have to go through this kind of suffering. But it is not only the bishops who must be punished for their actions, they must also be held accountable for what they have done. As a result, there is a lot of pressure on bishops and bishops to act in order to protect their own children and to ensure that their children are protected from sexual violence and exploitation. For example, if they do not do their job, then they will not be allowed to attend the Mass, even though they can be baptized. However, that doesn't necessarily mean that they won't be invited to participate in Sunday's Mass. Instead, bishops should be given the opportunity to present their views to bishops in other countries, especially in countries where they don't have the power to impose their will on their congregations. These bishops are not the only ones who can do that. Many bishops, too, are concerned about this issue. Pope Benedict XVI has already made it clear that there are no plans to allow bishops from other Catholic countries to take part in his conference in Rome this year. Cardinal Francis said last week that his church will continue to cooperate with Vatican authorities in its efforts to combat the spread of pedophile abuse in churches and in schools."

        "target": "Russia to create corporate aid fund, tapping pensions Moscow is planning to set up an emergency fund to help companies hit by sanctions imposed on Russian firms over the country's role in the Ukraine crisis. The money is to come from the Russian pensions system. Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov unveiled a plan Monday aimed at creating a \"multi-billion-dollar\" funding vehicle for companies hit by Western sanctions. Moscow-based news agency RIA quoted Siluanov as saying that the emergency fund would be set up next year with money originally earmarked for the State Pension Fund and leftover funds from this year's budget. According to RIA, Moscow was planning to devote \"at least 100 billion roubles\" (2 billion euros) to the fund, which will mainly be aimed at helping cash-starved Russian banks and key oil companies. \"These 100 billion roubles will be added to the reserve next year, which will allow us to help companies,\" RIA quoted Siluanov as saying. \"We are planning to create a reserve of significant size.\" Just last week, the European Union and the United States imposed a third round of sanctions on Moscow for Russia's involvement in the Ukraine conflict. The latest sanctions target the Russian banking sector as well as key energy firms and arms manufacturers. As one of several companies that have asked for government help, Russia's oil giant Rosneft said it would need 1.5 trillion roubles ($39.70 billion) in aid to keep exploring for oil. Siluanov also told RIA news agency that the decision to stop transferring money to the Pension Fund would hand the budget an extra 309 billion roubles. It will be the second year running that Moscow has stopped transfers of funds from the budget to the Pension Fund, which provides benefits for Russia's pensioners, some invalids and families who have lost their breadwinners. uhe/nz (Reuters, RIA)",
        "generated_story": "Russia to create multi-billion-dollar pension fund for companies hit by sanctions over the Ukraine conflict Russia has announced plans to set up a multi billion-euro fund to help companies affected by the conflict in eastern Ukraine. The move comes as the Russian government announced on Thursday that it would set aside $1 billion ($1.6 billion) for the purpose of setting up the fund. Russia's State Pension Fund (SPF), the country's largest private-sector fund, said in a statement on its website that the new fund would be named after its chief executive, Anton Siluanov. \"The fund will be run by a board of directors of Russian state oil company Rosneft,\" the state-owned news agency RIA reported, citing a source familiar with the matter. It was not immediately clear whether the move would have a financial impact on the company, which is under sanctions imposed by Moscow over its handling of Ukraine's conflict with Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Friday that he would not rule out the creation of a similar fund in the future. He also said he was \"very optimistic\" about the prospects for Russian companies to return to the market after the sanctions were lifted, according to a report published on state news agencies. Spokesman for Russia\u2019s state pension funds, SPSF, the Sberbank, and SFSF said the plan was in line with Russian law. \u201cWe are very optimistic,\u201d he told state television, referring to an article published earlier this month in which he said that Russia had agreed to establish a fund of up to $2 billion (2.4 billion euros) to cover the costs of the planned fund and the loss of billions of dollars in lost earnings from the sale of shares in oil and gas companies in Ukraine, a move that was widely seen as a sign that Moscow was ready to step up its anti-missile campaign against the separatists. But the announcement came a day after Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said his government would step down from his post as head of state at the end of this year. Moscow has said it will continue to monitor the impact of sanctions on Russia, but did not provide details on how it planned to do so. A spokesman for Moscow-based state investment fund Rostec declined to comment when contacted by Reuters, saying it had not yet decided whether to make a decision on whether or not to withdraw its support for sanctions. However, Russian media reported on Sunday that a senior government official had told a parliamentary committee in Moscow that Russian officials were in talks with Moscow about a possible return of some $5 billion in state funds to be invested in Russian equities. According to state media, this was the first time the government had made such an announcement in more than a decade."

        "target": "Heidi hits the Big Screen Heidi, the world famous girl from the Swiss Alps who first appeared in a novel 121 years ago, has hit the big screen in a fresh look. A century after the death of Heidi inventor Johanna Spyri, the lovable Alpine heroine is being portrayed in a new film which replaces grassy slopes and mountainous range with city skyscrapers and city streets. The $ 3.5 million \"Heidi\", funded by the Z\u00fcrich-based film company Vega and directed by German film maker Markus Imboden, is to be launched in Germany on Thursday. The making of the film was one of the highlights of a past year of events including exhibitions, lectures and fireworks celebrating the July 7 2001 centenary of the death of Spyri, whose novel \"Heidi\" sold 20 million copies and has been translated in 50 languages worldwide. It is thought to be one of the most successful books of all times. The book has inspired 17 films, including Shirley Temple\u2019s Oscar winning portrayal of Heidi in 1937 and a Japanese cartoon series. Imboden\u2019s remake is the 18th \"Heidi\" film. Blue hair in Berlin According to Vega, \"the film was transmitted to today\u2019s world without losing sight of the original novel\". But Imboden\u2019s new movie is far from the charming original, with its rosy-cheeked, curly-headed Heidi, delicate Clara and goat-tending shepherd Peter\u2019s frail old grandmother. In the first film, Heidi, who lives happily with her grandfather in a tiny hut in the Swiss Alps is plucked from her contented life by her Aunt Dete to live in a stiff, rich family in the bustling metropolis, Frankfurt. Heidi becomes so home-sick, she starts to sleepwalk and is eventually sent home. But not before she causes confusion in the otherwise prim household and brings laughter in the life of the disabled and homely, Clara. The Heidi in the latest film has blue hair, surfs the net and roams the streets of Berlin. Friend and shepherd Peter sheds his rustic pastimes and whizzes down streets on his mountainbike. Clara is not the weak, lame young girl of the Spyri novel, but a moody Britney Spears wannabe. Aunt Dete is a modern-day stylist living fashionably in the German capital. The new surroundings are a far cry from the tranquil days of cow milking, goat- tending and flower-plucking in the verdant meadows of the Swiss Alps. Transforming the Heidi myth According to a Berlin daily, the remake is a \"refreshing Heidi\", adding that the script writers had managed to transform the Heidi \"myth\" into an independent, self-assured girl and not into a \"transfigured mountain heroine\". However, it is just this portrait of a naive and charming alpine heroine that has made Heidi so popular all over the world. Heidi has become a well-known Swiss brand worldwide. Some 60,000 tourists \u2013 half from Japan \u2013 are said to visit the picturesque wine-growing village in Graubuenden, which boasts the original Heidi House and other Heidi related attractions such as winding mountain trails and pastures. Imboden\u2019s film, which is to be launched in Germany on Thursday, will also open elsewhere in Europe, and may reach fans in Japan and South Korea too. Whether Imboden\u2019s blue-haired, computer savvy Heidi will charm her Asian viewers, however, remains to be seen.",
        "generated_story": "The Remake of Heidi in the Swiss Alps is a re-creation of the famous Swiss actress Heidi. The film is based on a true story. Author: Markus Imboden, based in Graubuenden in Switzerland, and directed by Johanna Spyri, the film's director, is set to be released later this year. Heidi House was born in Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland in 1938. She died in 2006 at the age of 37. Her body was found in a Swiss ski resort, where she had been living for more than 30 years. It was the first time Heidi had ever been photographed by a woman in her 50s and 60s. In the original film, Heidi was a German-born woman who was married to a man from Germany and had a son and a daughter. Now she lives in Germany with her husband and two children. \"I'm a very happy woman,\" Heidi said in an interview with the German newspaper \"Vega\" in which she said she was \"very happy\" when she met the man she wanted to marry. According to the interview, she and the son were married in 2009 and they had three children together. They had two daughters, one of whom was also a model and one was an actress. Both of them are now married and have two sons, Markus, who is also an actor. Their children are also living with their mother and stepfather. A new documentary is being made about Heidi's life and how she lived it. On the day of her death, a group of Swiss women gathered in front of their house to film a documentary about her and her son, called \"Heidi House.\" The documentary will be screened at a special screening in Zurich on Sunday, Sept. 24, which is scheduled to take place on the same day as the documentary. There will also be a live-action documentary on Heidi as well as a feature film on her life, including a trip to Germany in 2010 and an appearance in Berlin in 2011. This is the second time that Heidi has been filmed for a film. Last year, it was filmed in Cologne, Germany, in February and March 2011, with a total of 10,000 people in attendance. At the time, there were only a handful of people who were able to attend the screening. However, many of those who attended the premiere were unable to make it because they were too busy working on their own projects. Instead, they chose to stay at home and watch their son's wedding. After all, he was still a teenager when he died. He was only 17 when his parents moved to Switzerland. His father died of a heart attack in 2004. When he returned to his native Switzerland after a long illness, his mother was diagnosed with cancer. As a result, her father had to undergo chemotherapy and was hospitalized for several months. Since then she has remained in intensive care, but she is no longer in any condition to receive treatment for her illness. But she still has a lot of work to do. And she's still very much alive and well, despite the fact that she doesn't have much time to recover. That's not to say that her health is not improving, as she continues to have a difficult time recovering from cancer and is still suffering from the effects of chemotherapy. So she'll have to wait until the end of this summer before she can go back to work again. If she does return to her old life again, that's a good thing, because she won't be around for long. For now, I think she will continue to live her dream of becoming a famous actress and singer. I'm sure she'd be happy to see her again and I can't wait to get back into the business of acting and singing. What do you think about that? I don't know. Is she going to tell me anything about it? Do you have any plans for the future? If so, what will you do? What is your plan for Heidi? The answer is to go ahead and do what you can to help her recover? Well, let me tell you what I've been doing. You know what's going on in your life right now? You've got to look forward to seeing her in person. We'll see what happens when you come back from your vacation. Read more: Heidi is back! She's back in action again! The German film \"The Little Mermaid\" was released on Friday, September 14, 2014.

        "target": "Rethinking the term 'honor killing' The murder of 28-year-old Samia Shahid comes less than two weeks after Qandeel Baloch was killed by her brother. The media was quick to report them as \"honor killings.\" We have to rethink that term, writes Gouri Sharma. When news broke that Samia Shahid, a British-Pakistani woman, had been found dead while visiting relatives in Pakistan at the end of July, mainstream media outlets were quick to report it as an honor killing. It was the second time in two weeks that the media had reported a killing of a woman this way - the first being the murder of Pakistani social media star Qandeel Baloch. There are strong similarities between the cases. Both were murdered in places where they would have felt they were at their safest - in their family homes. It's likely they knew their killers - in Baloch's case, her brother has admitted to strangling her, and Shahid's father and cousin have already been questioned. And as more reports emerge about Shahid's death, it's clear that both were killed because they didn't behave in a way deemed acceptable in a conservative, patriarchal society. 'Deeply offensive' term The debate around terminology in \"honor killings\" isn't new, and after Baloch's murder there were members of the media - such as ABC Australia journalist Juanita Phillips - who decided against using the term, calling it \"deeply offensive\" and referring to it as a \"family killing\" instead. And there are outlets, like the Guardian, that already use inverted commas with the word honor. But some commentators argue that more needs to happen if media consumers are to gain a better understanding of the problem. \"I think an important step for the media would be to refuse to give weight to the term 'honor crimes,'\" said UK-based freelance journalist Shehnaz Khan. \"While it is imperative to highlight that these crimes and murders stem from the roots of misogyny and therefore a false sense of 'honor,' there is absolutely nothing but'shame' within them, as murder is nothing but dishonorable.\" \"The word 'honor' can sometimes carry an almost positive connotation that we are inclined to automatically accept just because it's not happening to us, when the reality is, this a huge problem affecting thousands of girls and women across the world,\" she added. Naming the issue But this isn't a view shared by all journalists. Ruby Hamad, a writer at Australia's Daily Life newspaper, said that the first step in dealing with the issue is naming it. \"There are some deeply patriarchal societies that still limit women's freedom according to old tribal concepts of honor, where, unfairly, the behavior of women reflect on their entire family,\" Hamad said. \"By naming these 'honor killings,' we are acknowledging the role that this misogynistic concept of honor plays, not only in the murders themselves but in these entire societies, and how it entraps both men and women.\" Through the eyes of the perpetrator? There are other issues with the term though. Some have argued that by framing it as such, media outlets are showing the crime through the eyes of the perpetrator - and not through the victim - as they should. And with such cases regularly hitting the headlines, framing is important. The United Nations estimates that around 5,000 women - predominantly from Asia and the Middle East - are killed annually in honor-related crimes, a figure that women's advocacy groups say is closer to 20,000 worldwide. This raises an important cultural element for the media to consider - how far does the term play into cultural stereotypes? \"When honor is considered the most important thing in life, then all family members become expendable,\" Hamad said. \"The collective outweighs the rights of the individual. Does this feed into cultural stereotypes? Perhaps. But that doesn't mean we should pretend that this cultural context isn't there.\" Looking for answers - and alternatives There have been many alternatives put forward by women's advocacy groups, including hate crime, misogynistic murder, femicide and shame killings. But which one should we pick? Al Jazeera for one has decided which one they won't use. \"We are always updating our style guidelines to convey a deeper and more authentic understanding of world affairs. Recent events in Pakistan ignited a healthy debate in Al Jazeera on the term 'honor killings' in particular. Our editors are currently studying alternatives to the term, but'misogynistic murder' is not one of them,\" said an Al Jazeera spokesperson. Terminology in the media matters, and for murders as complex as these, it's the media's responsibility to find a name that better fits the crime. Only then will it become easier to work towards a solution.",
        "generated_story": "Rethinking Honor Killings: A Cultural Perspective A cultural perspective on the death penalty in Pakistan has been published in the British newspaper \"The Daily Life.\" Author: Samia Shahid and journalist Ruby Hamad have written a book about the subject. The book is based on an interview with a Pakistani woman who was killed by a British soldier during the Pakistani war of independence. In the book, the author, who is also a professor of history at the University of British Columbia in London, describes her experiences as a victim of the \"honor killing\" of Pakistani soldiers. \"I was a soldier, I was an officer, and I had to fight for my life,\" she says, adding that she had been raped by the soldier. She added that her father had also been killed in a similar incident, which she described as \"an act of self-defense.\" \"My father was the first person to be shot by an Australian soldier and he was still alive when he died,\" said Shahida. Her father, Qandeel Baloch, was also shot and killed, while her mother was severely injured in an attack on a police station in Lahore, Pakistan, in 2006. A British-Pakistani journalist, Juanita Phillips, has written an article for the Australian newspaper, The Guardian, calling for an end to the practice of honor killings in Pakistani prisons. According to Phillips' article, \"Honor Killers\" is a term used to refer to those who commit crimes against humanity. It's also used as an expression of sympathy for victims of war crimes, such as rape, murder, torture and the murder of children under the age of 16. Read more: How to live a normal life without being raped, abused and neglected by your loved ones The author has also written about her own experience with the killing of her son, Shehnaz Khan, when she was 14 years old. As a result, she is now a mother of two and a grandmother to her three children. But she also has a son who died of a heart attack when his father tried to stop him from going to school. This is not an isolated incident. There have been a number of similar cases in recent years, including one in which a woman was raped and murdered by her husband. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that the perpetrator committed the crime. Instead, it's a case of mistaken identity that is being investigated by police and prosecutors. What is the basis for such an investigation? \"It's not just a question of whether or not a perpetrator is guilty of murder,\" says Phillips. 'The perpetrator has to prove that he or she has committed a crime and is innocent of any crime.' \"There are a lot of things that can be done to make sure that we don't repeat the mistakes that were committed,\" adds Phillips in her book. Pakistan is one of those countries that has suffered from a lack of respect for its own people. For example, many of its citizens are not aware of their own history and have never been exposed to any kind of violence. They have no idea what happened to them. That's why they are so shocked and appalled by what they have seen. Some of them are very angry. Others, however, are quite upset. One is very upset that their son was shot. Another is that they didn't know what to do about it, because they thought it was something that was wrong with him. And yet, they were very respectful of his family and friends. These are the people who are responsible for his death. I think that's the main reason why I'm writing this book and not the person who wrote it. You can read more about that here. If you want to know more, you can go to our website. We have a website dedicated to this topic. Our website has an extensive list of all the places where people can find information on this subject, as well as other books on how to find out what's going on in their lives. Many of these places are located in other countries, but the most important ones are in Australia and New Zealand, where there are more than 100,000 people living in poverty and suffering from mental illness. So, we have to look at this issue from the perspective of our own perspective. How do you feel about this? What are your thoughts on it? Do you agree with me? Is it fair to say that it is unfair to blame the victim for what you have done? You know that you're not doing the right thing? We all have different perspectives on these things, right? How can you be so sensitive and sensitive about your own life and your family's history? And what is your opinion on that? The answer is clear to me that I have not done anything wrong. My opinion is quite different from most other people's opinions. Why is it that people are reacting to what I've written? Why do I feel so strongly about my own experiences? I do not think I can do anything about these issues. Is there any point in my personal life at all"

        "target": "Myanmar Junta Announces Amnesty The junta in Myanmar, also known as Burma, announced an amnesty for more than 7,000 prisoners on Friday, including a few political detainees. The amnesty came on the 21st anniversary of the brutal crackdown of a student-led pro-democracy movement in 1988 and the subsequent seizure of power by the current junta. Journalists were invited to Yangon\u2019s notorious Insein prison on Friday as the authorities released the first batch of prisoners. At least 600 inmates were freed as part of an amnesty for over 7,000 inmates nationwide. Among those released in Yangon were two journalists and 25 political prisoners -- rights groups say this is only 1 percent of the total number of political prisoners held by the military regime. Maung Zarni, a research fellow at the London School of Economics, was \u201chappy for the prisoners who were part of the release\u201d. \u201cThis is a very positive personal development and I am happy they have been released but we need to understand that the junta is using the prisoners\u2019 release as a public relations exercise. It is the 21st anniversary of the military coup so they are using this as a way to pacify political discontent in the country.\u201d Amnesty comes ahead of next year\u2019s polls Myanmar's director general of prisons, Zaw Win, said that the prisoners had been freed so they could take part in next year's polls. In recent months, rights activists, pro-democracy activists and Western countries have cast doubt on the credibility of the planned elections as many key political activists are still in detention. This includes pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who recently began a new 18-month period of house arrest after being found guilty of violating her house arrest order in a widely condemned trial. \u201cThe whole Suu kyi trial is rather unlawful,\u201d said Zarni. \u201cBecause the country does not have an independent judiciary, the judges are just puppets who dance to the tune of the top leadership.\u201d Junta is holding on tightly In 1990, Suu Kyi\u2019s National League for Democracy won Myanmar\u2019s last general election by a landslide. But the junta never recognised the results and has since tightened its control over the country. The 2008 constitution, which was drafted and approved by the military generals, which guarantees the army 25 percent of parliamentary seats, is yet another sign of its desire to consolidate power. \u201cThe military is going to be in power for a long time,\u201d warns Zarni, \u201cbecause they have got control of all the political and economic institutions in the country as well as the entire state of Burma. So with or without elections, this is likely to remain the same.\u201d New Democratic Party formed Meanwhile, a new political party has been formed in Myanmar. The Democratic Party is headed by Mya Than Than Nu, who is the daughter of the country\u2019s first democratically-elected prime minister, U Nu. The party has proposed a power-sharing deal with the military, which would give 40 percent of power to politicians and 60 percent to the military rulers. Harn Yawnghwe, the director of the Brussels-based Euro-Burma Office, doubts the new party stands a chance: \u201cIt is possible that they they would be able to get some votes. But it is not likely, even if they were able to contest the elections freely, that they will be able to form a new government because the military is not prepared to let any party rule.\u201d Democrats should exploit elections He thinks the only way out for the democratic forces in Myanmar is to use the upcoming elections wisely and \u201cto take part in them even if they are against them. I think we have to look at the elections as a process which will lead to democracy -- maybe in few more years.\u201d The National League for Democracy has indicated that it will not take part in the polls unless all Myanmar\u2019s political prisoners, including Suu Kyi, are released. Suu Kyi\u2019s lawyers have filed an appeal against the extension of her house arrest and the court is expected to give a ruling on October 2. But few are hopeful that the junta will amnesty her anytime soon. Author: Disha Uppal Editor: Anne Thomas",
        "generated_story": "Maung Zarni: Myanmar's Aung San Suu Kyi is the new leader of the country's National League for Democracy (NLD) party. She is also the first democratically elected leader since the military junta took power in July 2011. The NLD has been accused of suppressing the peaceful protests of pro-democracy activists in Yangon and Insein, the capital of Myanmar, which is home to the largest concentration of ethnic minority people in the world's largest democracy. Amnesty International (Amnesty International) has called for the release of all political prisoners in Myanmar until the end of this year. \"I call on the government to release all of those who have been detained,\" said Amnesty's director, Harn Yawnghwe, in a statement released on Thursday. Myanmar is one of several Southeast Asian countries that have banned the use of violence against the civilian population in recent years, according to a report by the International Organization for Migration (IOM). The report said that around 1.5 million people had been arrested in 2014, and that more than 2.4 million had fled to neighboring Bangladesh, where they were held for years by a military coup that ousted then-President Mya Than Nu, who was ousted from office in May last year after a failed coup attempt. Many of them have since returned to Myanmar and are now living in exile. Some have fled their homes, while others have moved to other countries. In the past few months, Myanmar has seen a rise in anti-government protests and crackdowns on ethnic minorities. Last year, around 2,000 people were killed in clashes between police and security forces. More than 1,500 people have died in violence since then, with the death toll rising to nearly 3,600. Most of these deaths were caused by ethnic cleansing and the persecution of minority Rohingya Muslims. At the same time, there has also been an increase in attacks on police stations and other security institutions. This has led to fears of a return to violence, as well as a crackdown on political dissent. On Thursday, a Reuters reporter reported that a number of police officers were arrested and charged with crimes against humanity, including murder, rape, attempted murder and attempted rape. A Reuters investigation found that at least one police officer was also involved in an attack on a police station, killing a woman and injuring dozens of others. According to an internal report released by Amnesty, some 200 people are still being held in jail, but the number is expected to rise to 500. It is unclear how many more are to be released. There are also fears that the crackdown could lead to more arrests. Author: Ramesh Pathania"

        "target": "A quarter of deaths caused by environmental degradation, says UN A new United Nations report warns that pollution and global warming are causing millions more deaths than conflicts. The UN's environment agency has called for an urgent roll-back on harmful substances and fossil fuels. In its report \"Healthy Environment, Health People,\" the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), the World Health Organization and several other environment organizations said that, in 2012, an estimated 12.6 million deaths were attributable to deteriorating environment conditions. The largest numbers of deaths took place in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific regions, followed by sub-Saharan Africa, where around a quarter of deaths were likely caused byair pollution, chemicals, climate change and a lack of access to sanitation. \"By depleting the ecological infrastructure of our planet and increasing our pollution footprint, we incur an ever-growing cost in terms of human health and well-being,\" said UNEP Executive Director Achim Steiner. He added that humanity's life support systems had been compromised by globalization and powerful economic interests. The report was released during UN climate talks in the German city of Bonn which are drawing up rules pertaining to the Paris agreement, which seeks to lower carbon emissions. The document suggested that several drivers were responsible for the threat to human health, including ecosystem disruption, climate change, inequality, unhealthy and wasteful lifestyles, along with unsustainable consumption and production. Worsening effects UNEP estimated that an extra 250,000 deaths could occur each year between 2030 and 2050 as a result of climate change, leading to malnutrition, malaria, diarrhea and heat stress. Between them air pollution and a lack of access to clean water and sanitation cause almost 8 million premature deaths each year. Environmental impacts are responsible for the deaths of more than one quarter of all children under the age of five, the report states. UNEP called for governments to act to remove harmful substances from working environments, reduce the use of carbon fuels and rely instead on renewable energy, and change lifestyles to allow a more sustainable use of the world's resources. The report also called for a bigger investment to protect the planet's natural ecosystem. UNEP predicted a further increase in emerging zoonotic diseases (spread between animals and humans), and called on developing countries, in particular, to prioritize prevention methods. \"Never before have so many animals been kept by so many people - and never before have so many opportunities existed for pathogens to pass through the biophysical environment and wild animals to livestock and people,\" the report warned.",
        "generated_story": "A quarter of deaths due to environmental degradation linked to climate change The World Health Organization (WHO) on Thursday said that a quarter to three million people in the developing world are living in extreme poverty. The UN's Environment Program (UNEP) said the figure was more than three to four times higher than the WHO's estimate of one-quarter of the world's deaths in 2015. UNEP Director-General Achim Steiner told a news conference in Bonn, Germany, that the number of people suffering from severe poverty in developing countries was at a record high. \"This is the highest level of human mortality since World War II,\" he said, adding that it was \"a very high number.\" \"It is a very serious problem, and it is something that we have to deal with in a way that is not only in our own country, but in many other countries as well.\" The United Nations Environment Programme, which is responsible for environmental protection, called for an end to the use of carbon dioxide as a pollutant in all forms of energy by 2030. It is also calling for the elimination of fossil fuels from the country's electricity grid by 2050. In addition, it called on the government of Germany to take action to tackle the problem. According to a UN report released on Wednesday, the World Bank and the International Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (IoE) have recommended that Germany and other developing nations reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to reduce the risk of climate-related deaths. This would be the first time since the 1970s that people have been killed by greenhouse gases in their homes and workplaces, according to experts who have studied the effects of these emissions on human health. These deaths are the result of a combination of factors, such as high temperatures, poor rainfall and a lack of access to clean drinking water. They are also the cause of an increase in deaths from high levels of cancer and cardiovascular disease in children and young people, who are more likely to die from cancer than from other causes, they said. Experts say that in addition to these problems, there are other factors that contribute to this rise in mortality. For example, people who live in high-traffic areas have a higher chance of dying from exposure to high concentrations of toxic chemicals. That means that they have more time and energy to cope with the consequences of their actions. And that's not just because they are in poor countries. There's also a reason why they don't have the resources to do what they need to be able to, say experts. One reason for this is that there's a lot of money to invest in clean water and clean-up efforts. So, we're going to spend more on that. We'll see what we can do to make sure we get the most out of this. But first, let's take a look at the situation in Germany. What do you think? What are your thoughts on this? Do you agree with me? I think it's very interesting that I'm a bit skeptical of what the UN has to say about this, because it seems to me as if it doesn't really matter. I do think that, in my opinion, this situation is very different from what it used to look like. If you're a person who works in an environment environment, then you know that you can't do anything about it. You can only do so much with your own money and you have nothing to contribute in terms of your health and well-being. Don't be afraid to speak up and tell your friends and family about what's happening in your life. Let's talk about the problems that are going on right now. As a result, I believe that this will be an important issue for all of us, including those who work in this field. At the same time, you will also see a change in how we live our lives. How do we treat the environment? How can we protect ourselves and our children? That's the question that has been asked of me so many times over the past few years. Is there any way I can help? Is it a good idea to talk to you about that? If so, what are you doing? You know what I mean? Well, if you are a scientist or an environmental scientist, maybe you would like to share your views? Let me tell you what you want to know. Read more: What is your view on environmental issues? Read More: How to protect yourself and your family from environmental disasters?

        "target": "No more'veggie sausages?' Minister wants ban on meat names for plant-based foods Terms like \"vegan sausage\" and \"vegetarian schnitzel\" confuse consumers and need to be replaced, according to German Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt. He wants new names for plant-based dishes. Germans shouldn't be biting into a \"vegan sausage\" or cutting a slice of \"vegetarian schnitzel,\" German Minister for Food and Agriculture Christian Schmidt told the daily \"Bild\" newspaper on Wednesday, adding that names traditionally used for meat-based dishes should not be applied to plant-based foods. \"I don't want anyone to pretend that these pseudo-meat dishes are actual meat dishes,\" Schmidt said. The minister said manufacturers should come up with distinct names for plant-based meat-substitutes. Schmidt also said meat was part of a healthy and balanced diet and belonged on the menu in schools and kindergartens. Soy? Steak? Soy-steak? Schmidt's statements echo demands from the German Farmers Association and German Butchers Association. Both lobbying groups have asked for a ban on terms such as \"vegetarian ham\" or \"soy steak.\" Schmidt's call for plant-based foods to have their own name was also made in October in the state of Lower Saxony, a state with many large livestock farms. The German Vegetarian Association, however, argued against the proposal. A spokesperson for the organization said that \"names that are used for animal-based products should without a doubt also be legal to use for vegetarian substitute products.\" More meatless 'whatever-you-want-to-call-thems' The market for vegetarian and vegan dishes has grown steadily in the past few years in Germany, partly at the expense of the meat industry. According to a research paper by the Institute for the Study of Trade (IfH), revenue for vegetarian and vegan products in Germany was 454 million euros ($474 million) in 2015 and grew by more than 100 percent between 2010 and 2015. In the same time period, the demand for meat products fell by almost 10 percent. mb/sms (dpa, epd)",
        "generated_story": "No more'vegetarian sausages' and no more schnitzel' German agriculture minister Christian Schmidt has announced that he will no longer be minister of agriculture in his ministry. \"We have decided that it is time for a change,\" he said in a statement released on Thursday. The minister said that the ministry would continue to work closely with the German Farmers Association (DFA), which represents farmers in the Lower Saxony region. Schmidt's announcement came a day after German farmers' associations announced they would be holding a special meeting to discuss the future of the country's agricultural sector. DFA said the meeting would take place on Friday and Saturday, but that Schmidt would not be able to attend because of a lack of funds and because he was unable to make it to a meeting scheduled for Friday. According to the association's website, Schmidt will not attend the gathering, which will be held at the Bundestag in Berlin on Saturday and Sunday, and will instead be in charge of preparing the meat for the upcoming harvest season. He will also be responsible for overseeing the production of meat products in Germany, including meat, dairy, meat and dairy products, as well as for marketing and marketing. In addition to his duties as minister for agriculture and agriculture, the minister also has a responsibility to ensure that farmers receive the necessary support they need in order to grow their own meat. This is the first time in German history that a minister has been appointed by the government to lead the agriculture sector, a position that has traditionally been held by farmers. Since Schmidt took office in January 2013, he has overseen the development of more than 1.5 million hectares (2.6 million acres) of agricultural land in eastern Germany. During his tenure, agriculture was one of Germany's fastest growing sectors, with a population of over 2.2 million people living in rural areas. However, there is still a lot of work to be done in this area, according to Schmidt, who is also a professor of agribusiness at Deutschland-Universit\u00e4t (DLU). Schmidt said he had been \"very impressed\" with his colleagues' work ethic and their willingness to cooperate with him on issues such as climate change and food security. But he also stressed the need for farmers to do their part to protect their livelihoods and the environment, adding that there was no need to worry about the long-term health of their crops. 'We are going to continue working with them,' he told the news agency, Bild, in an interview published earlier this month. \u201cWe will continue our work on this issue,\u201d he added, noting that \"we have a very good chance that we will see the results of this work.\" Schmidt also pointed out that his department is working on a plan to reduce the number of people who work in agricultural production and to improve the quality of life of those who do not have the means to live in agriculture. On the other hand, it will still be a challenge for Schmidt to get the job done on the farm, since he is not a farmer himself and he doesn't have enough money to spend on his own farm. That's not to say he won't be doing his part, however. There are other things he can do, for example, to help farmers who are in need of help in their fields. One of them is to sell their produce to other farmers, so that they can sell it for less than the cost of producing it. And that's a good thing, because it's something that is very important to them. It's also important for them to know that their products are not just for themselves. They are also good for their families.\u201cI am very happy to see that our farmers are doing well and we are happy with what we have. We are very pleased with their efforts. I am also happy that I have been doing my part in helping them do well in other fields,\" said Schmidt. His comments come as a surprise to many farmers around the world. Many of these farmers have expressed concern over the impact of his government's decision to cut back on meat production, saying they want to focus more on beef production. These are the kind of things that are needed to meet the needs of farmers and for that reason, they are willing to pay more attention to their needs. For instance, when it comes to producing beef, beef and vegetables, this is something which is a big part of German agricultural policy. What is important is that these products can be sold in small quantities, not in large quantities. If you have to buy meat from a meat processor, then you can make them for yourself. You can also sell them at a discount. Otherwise, you're not buying meat directly from the farmer's market, or you'll be paying for meat that isn't available at your local supermarket. So, I think that will only be available to those farmers that have already made it into the grocery store. As a result, we can't do much more for our own farmers than we already do for now."

Stephen Harper has stepped down as leader of the Conservatives after nine years in the top job. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper resigned as Conservative Party leader on Tuesday after the Liberals, led by Justin Trudeau, emerged victorious in legislative elections. \"I have spoken to Prime Minister Stephen Harper, and he has instructed me to reach out to the newly elected parliamentary caucus to appoint an interim leader,\" Conservative Party president John Walsh said in a statement. \"The people are never wrong,\" Harper said of his defeat. \"The disappointment is my responsibility and mine alone,\" Harper said, adding that he had called Trudeau to congratulate him. Trudeau calls for hopeful, diverse future In electing Trudeau, the charismatic son of a former popular prime minister, Canadian voters illustrated the growing discontent with nine years of Conservative rule that saw lowering of corporate taxes, avoidance of climate change legislation and disagreement with the Obama administration over the controversial Keystone XL pipeline. \"Canadians have spoken,\" Trudeau said, adding that he would be the man to lead the \"hopeful, positive\" country \"with a vision\" that they had asked for. In his victory speech, Trudeau said his government \"believed deeply in the diversity of our country,\" striking a contrast with the strain of nativism that had become apparent under Conservative rule. \"We beat fear with hope,\" said Trudeau, a 43-year-old former teacher. Liberals blow past projected results Projections ahead of the elections had Harper and Trudeau in a dead heat, but as polls closed on Monday night it became clear that the Liberals had won an outright majority, with a projected 175 of parliament's 338 seats. This represented a huge leap from four years ago when Liberals were handed their most crushing defeat in history with a mere 34 seats. Harper will stay on as a member of Parliament for his constituency, public broadcaster CBC reported, as he was re-elected to his seat.

        "generated_story": "Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper steps down as leader of the Conservative Party The prime minister of Canada has announced he will step down from his post as the party's leader. The announcement comes after months of speculation and speculation about his future. Harper, who has been in office since 2011, announced on Thursday that he would no longer be running for re-election in the upcoming election. In a statement released by Harper's government, Harper said he was \"deeply disappointed\" with the results of last year's election, which included the loss of two seats to the Liberal Party. \"I am deeply disappointed,\" Harper told a news conference in Ottawa, adding that his party would not be able to form a coalition government without the support of his own party, the Liberals, and the conservative Christian Democratic Party (CDU). \"We will not accept any form of interference from the federal government,\" he said. He added that the government would continue to work closely with federal, state and local governments in order to ensure a smooth transition to a new government. But he also said that it would be \"difficult\" for the Conservatives to win a majority in a federal election next year, given that they would have to rely on the votes of their own members to make up the majority of seats in parliament. A new leader will be chosen at a special election to replace Harper on June 7, when the current government is due to be inaugurated. Former Liberal leader and party leader Harper was first elected in 2006 and served as Canada's premier from 2007 to 2009. Since then, he has become the country's longest-serving leader, with a total of four terms. His term ends in 2014, but he is expected to stay on until the next election in 2015. On Thursday, his successor, Justin Trudeau, will take the oath of office at the same time as Harper. It is the first time that a Canadian leader has stepped down after more than two decades in power. Trudeau's party is now the governing coalition, led by the former Liberal party of former prime ministers Harper and Paul Martin, as well as former finance minister David Gauke. Both men have been accused of corruption and mismanagement. They have also faced allegations of sexual harassment and abuse of power, including sexual assault and assault of women and children. Some of those allegations are now being investigated, while others are dismissed as politically motivated. One of them is that Harper is a member of a party that has a history of violence against women, children and minorities. That is not the case in Canada. There is also the issue of whether Harper should be replaced by a woman or a man, or whether he should remain in his current position. This is something Harper has said repeatedly since he took office in 2011. During his first term as premier, Trudeau was criticized by many for his handling of domestic and foreign affairs issues, particularly in relation to women's rights and gender issues. At the time, Canada was the only country where women were not allowed to vote for men. Now, there are a number of female candidates vying to take over the leadership. Many of these women are women who are in their late 20s or early 30s and are working part-time jobs. These women have a lot of experience in politics. And they have the experience of working for a political party and being part of that party. So, it's not surprising to see Harper stepping down, even if it means losing a few votes, that she will stay in her current post. She is no stranger to controversy and controversy. When Harper first took the helm, she had a reputation for being a strong supporter of gender equality and was a fierce critic of Trudeau and Trudeau. As a result, many of her supporters have come to her defense, saying she is \"a strong advocate for gender equity.\" But she has also been criticized for not being more open about the gender pay gap between men and women in Canadian society and for her role as a role model for young women. Not only is she an outspoken advocate of equal rights for women but she also has an important role to play in changing gender roles in society, such as in education, health care and education. How does she deal with this issue? She said she doesn't think she can do it alone, because she believes that women should have more say in what is happening in public life than men do in private life. What do you think? What is your view on this? Do you agree with Harper? Is it a good idea to talk about it? Can you tell me what you would like to hear? I don't know. I'm not sure I'd be surprised if I didn't say that. You know, I think that's a very good thing to say. We all know what we're going through right now, right? That's the way I see it. If Harper does it, then she's going to keep her mouth shut and I'll be happy to tell you what I would say to you, too. For the most part, you can't do anything about this in this."

The 71-year old can now leave the country for medical treatment. Brazilian judge Juliana Leal de Melo - who serves on a court overseeing amateur and professional sports - authorized the release of Hickey's passport upon payment of 1.5 million real ($435,000) bail. Hickey could now have medical treatment, the Rio state court system said in a statement. Reported to have a heart condition, Hickey was arrested three months ago during the Rio de Janeiro Olympics on ticket scalping charges. He is awaiting trial, though has not been imprisoned. Hickey has denied any wrongdoing. He is one of 10 people facing charges of ticket scalping, conspiracy and ambush marketing related to the Olympics. Hickey said he would fight \"each and every one\u201d of the Rio Games ticket-touting charges he faces. Hickey, who was also the head of the Olympic Council of Ireland, was released from custody last month, but must remain in Brazil until the case is heard. \"For clarity, I am not under house arrest as, like with so many things with this case, has been misreported by the media,\u201d Hickey said in a statement on Monday. Hickey was arrested on 10 August at a luxury beachfront hotel during the games. The authorities told Reuters last week that they believe the ring had operated for around eight years and was preparing for other Olympic events such as the 2020 Tokyo Games. jbh/bw (AP, AFP)",
        "generated_story": "Olympic Council of Ireland president Patrick Hickey freed on bail in Rio de Janeiro The head of the European Olympic Committee (EOC) has been freed from jail after being arrested in Brazil on charges of bribery and fraud. Ireland's former president and chief executive was freed by the EOC on Thursday after a three-day trial in the Brazilian city of Rio. The trial, which began on Friday, was the first of its kind in Ireland since the Rio Olympics in 2004, when the country's president, then-OOC president Juliana Leal de Melo, died of cancer in a car crash in Sao Paulo, Brazil. He had been in jail for more than a year and a half, but was released on a promise to return to Ireland to face charges related to the murder of his wife and two children. In exchange for his release, the court agreed to set a trial date of Sept. 11. Hickey, who was arrested on suspicion of murder and attempted murder in February last year, is scheduled to appear in court in Dublin on Tuesday. His lawyers have said he is innocent of all charges and that he should be tried in absentia. \"I am innocent and I am not guilty of any crime,\" he said in an interview with the Irish daily \"The Irish Times.\" He added that his client was \"very happy\" with his decision to be freed, adding that \"it was a very good decision for me to go to prison and to serve my sentence.\" The court also ruled that the case was not a case of mistaken identity, and said it would not be used as a basis for the trial. However, he did not elaborate on the charges against him, saying he was innocent until proven guilty. According to a court document, prosecutors said they had found no evidence of a crime committed in connection with that case. It is not clear how much money he had in his bank account, or whether he would have been able to afford to pay the bail if convicted. A court had ruled in favor of him earlier this month, however, that there was insufficient evidence to prove his innocence. On Thursday, a federal judge in London ruled against the ex-governor of Dublin over a charge of fraud and breach of trust in relation to his handling of an investigation into the deaths of two Brazilian women in 2006 and 2007. At the same time, an appeal was filed against his conviction, in which he denied any involvement in any wrongdoing. Prosecutors said the conviction was politically motivated and argued that it was an \"unacceptable\" crime for him to remain in office. They also said that they would appeal the ruling. 'I have no intention of changing my mind,' the judge said. \u201cI will continue to fight this case,\u201d the prosecutor said, referring to an earlier ruling by a Brazilian court that allowed the prosecution to proceed with a plea deal. That ruling was later overturned by an appeals court. Dublin's Olympic Council has also appealed the decision, arguing that prosecutors should not seek a new trial over the death of one of their own."

        "target": "The Shift in Libya's Relations to the West The La Belle disco bombing in Berlin on April 5, 1986 was ruled to be Libya's doing. Twenty years later, relations between Libya and Europe have done an about-face. The Berlin disco \"La Belle\" was packed as usual on the night of April 5, 1986. Among its guests were many US soldiers, who were certainly not thinking of politics, the Middle East or strained relations between the United States and Libya. But reality caught up with them: a bomb detonated near the dance floor that night, killing two Americans and a Turkish woman. Over 200 people were injured. A Berlin court ruled that Libya and its intelligence services were responsible for the bombing. In 2001, following a nearly four-year long trial, the judges convicted a Libyan diplomat and three others to prison sentences between 12 and 14 years. The big oil-exporting country in the meantime was busy working on its reputation. Already in the 1990s, Tripoli began striving to improve its relations to the European Union. Financial reparation opened the door to Europe In 2004, the Gaddafi International Foundation for Charity Associations and the legal representatives of the German La Belle victims settled on $35 million in compensation. This opened the door to Europe. Just a few weeks later, Germany's chancellor at the time, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, visited Moammar Gadhafi in a traditional Bedouin tent outside of Tripoli. Britain's Prime Minister Tony Blair also paid Gadhafi a visit. A few months earlier, in April 2004, the European Union had welcomed the Libyan leader to Brussels. It was Gadhafi's first official visit to Europe in 15 years. Bernd Westphal, the German ambassador to Libya, said bilateral relations had been through difficult times. \"The German Embassy in Tripoli today is working for a quick return to the liveliness of close relations between Germany and Libya,\" Westphal said. \"We want to build on our traditional friendship with Libya and we want to strengthen the political, economic and cultural cooperation between our two countries and peoples.\" Business interests booming in Libya In the past few years, Libya has moved from being the supporter of international terrorism to an attractive economic partner for the West. European business representatives have been increasingly knocking on Libya's door. Even the United States is showing increased interest in the northern African nation. Washington is pleased that Libya announced at the end of 2003 that it would discontinue its efforts to develop and produce weapons of mass destruction. Libya's ambassador to Germany, Said Abdulaati, said political and economic relations between Libya and Germany were \"excellent.\" Libya is one of Germany's strongest trading partners in northern Africa. Last year, Germany exported goods to Libya worth 657.7 million euros ($805.7 million), according to the German Federal Statistics Office. \"The economy is the driving power in German-Libyan relations,\" said Abdulaati in an interview with the Arab-German association for trade and industry. But Germany isn't the only European country making deals in Libya. France last month signed an accord with Libya on peaceful nuclear research. \"This accord represents a qualitative leap in relations between the two countries and proves that Libya has transformed its weapons of mass destruction into constructive weapons,\" Public Works Minister Maatuk Maatuk said at the signing ceremony in March. \"We are telling the world that we are moving towards the development of Libyan nuclear technology for peaceful purposes.\" This week, the Netherlands' Economics Minister Laurens Jan Brinkhorst will visit Libya to negotiate gas and oil agreements. It will be the first high-level visit by a Dutch official since Gadhafi took power in 1969.",
        "generated_story": "Libya: The Shift in Libya's Relations to Europe The shift in Libyan relations between Germany and the United States has been marked by a sharp increase in tensions between the two countries. The German Embassy in Tripoli, the capital of the former British colony of Libya, and other European countries have been at loggerheads over the past few months. According to the German Foreign Ministry, there is a \"significant increase\" in the number of people living in and visiting the country. This has led to a rise in tension between Libya and its western neighbors, particularly in eastern Libya. \"We have seen a gradual shift,\" said Bernd Westphal, a spokesman for Germany's Public Works Office in Berlin. He added that there was also an \"increase in trust\" between Libyan and German officials, as well as in relations with the US, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Turkey, Greece and Spain. In addition, German Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der has said that he is \"very optimistic\" about the Libyan situation, adding that \"we are hopeful that the situation will improve.\" \"I am very optimistic that we will be able to achieve this,\" he said in a statement released by his office on Thursday. Germany is also optimistic about its own Libyan counterpart, Said Abdulaati, who is currently in exile in Turkey. Berlin's foreign ministry spokesman said the move was \"part of a concerted effort by the European Union to strengthen its relationship with Libya.\" The move comes as the EU prepares to host a summit in Brussels later this month to discuss how to deal with a new Libyan government, which is set to be inaugurated next month. German foreign minister Berth Wphal said he hoped the meeting would be \"a great success\" and that it would \"not only be a great opportunity for Libya but also for the whole of Europe as a whole to see how the new government is going to respond to this new regime.\" He also pointed out that Libya is not the only country in Europe that is facing a change in its political and economic orientation. At the same time, it is the first time since the end of Gaddafi's rule in 2011 that a third of its population has fled to neighboring countries, such as Tunisia, Egypt, Morocco, Libya or the Czech Republic. On the other hand, many of those who have left Libya have returned to their home countries and are returning home to seek refuge in Germany. There are also plans to establish a German consulate in Benghazi, where the current government of Prime Minister Tony Blair is based. It is unclear how long this will last, but the British government has indicated that they are willing to work with Libyan authorities to ensure stability and stability in their own country, in order to avoid a repeat of last year's failed coup attempt. However, according to German public statistics office data, more than half a million people have fled Libya to other countries in recent years. That number is expected to rise to around 1.5 million by 2015."

        "target": "Bremen Election Results Could Have National Repercussions It might be Germany's smallest state with a population of less than 700,000, but the make-up of Bremen's new government could curb the ability of Angela Merkel's coalition to continue with planned reforms. The Social Democrats (SPD) and Christian Democrats (CDU) have ruled the small northern city-state of Bremen in a coalition for the past 12 years. But after winning state elections on Sunday with 36.8 percent, the SPD is now flirting with the idea of ditching their previous coalition partners to rule together with the Greens, who made their best-ever showing in a German state poll with 16.4 percent. Bremen's state SPD leadership is to hold talks later on Wednesday with the CDU, which polled 25.7 percent. After an SPD meeting in Bremen, Mayor Jens B\u00f6hrnsen made the first signal he could be favoring the Greens. He said that during the campaign he had deliberately abstained from mentioning the possibility of a renewed CDU coalition because \"after 12 years it shouldn't automatically be continued.\" Bremen's acting head of government and CDU member Thomas R\u00f6wekamp, however, warned against an SPD-Green coalition. \"The majority of people don't want a red-green experiment, but a continuation of the grand coalition,\" he said. Both the SPD and CDU conceded heavy losses in the election, which showed a swing towards the Greens and the Left Party, which scored an unexpected 8.4 percent to win representation in a western German state legislature for the first time in its brief history. Block reforms? If Bremen's SPD decide in favor of the Greens, this would affect the ability of Chancellor Angela Merkel's grand coalition of CDU and SPD to push ahead with reforms requiring constitutional changes, such as stage two of Germany's urgently needed federalism reform. The federal Bundesrat, which is made up of state cabinet members, has to approve the majority of legislative bills passed by the lower chamber, the Bundestag, before they become law. Also, any proposed constitutional changes require two-thirds of all votes in order to be passed by the Bundesrat. The CDU and SPD currently hold 47 of the Bundesrat's 69 seats, which is one seat more than the necessary two-thirds majority. But without Bremen, the number held by the grand coalition would fall to 44 seats, meaning they would need the cooperation of one of the small opposition parties for any constitutional changes. Internal strife Earlier in the week, Chancellor Merkel called for unity within her ruling left-right coalition after the losses in Bremen set the stage for more infighting between the two parties. Merkel also warned the SPD against moving to the left after it lost some five percent points. The chancellor said the outcome showed the SPD had made a mistake by attacking the coalition and campaigning on promises of a minimum wage, which she believes will hamper efforts to fight unemployment of just under 10 percent. \"The result showed that this strategy did not pay off,\" Merkel told a press conference.",
        "generated_story": "Merkel's coalition of Social Democrats and Greens could block reforms Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives and the Greens are set to form a coalition government in the German state of Bremen on Sunday. The Greens, the conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) and their coalition partner the CDU, are expected to announce a deal on a range of social and economic reforms this week. Chancellor Merkel has promised to push through a package of reforms that would make it easier for her party to win elections next year. However, it is unclear whether the new coalition will be able to reach agreement on the reforms, which would allow her to run for chancellor in a snap election in September. Merkel, who is seeking a third term as chancellor, has said she would not rule out the idea of a grand coalition with her conservative coalition partners. \"We have a lot of work to do,\" she told the Bundestag newspaper in an interview published on Friday. But she has also said that she is willing to work with the SPD in order to get the government to agree to a new constitution, and that it would be better for the country if it were to be governed by a federal government. She has already promised a \"grand coalition\" of conservative parties, including the Christian Democratic Union, Greens and Christian Social Union (CSU). The SPD, however, have said they are not ready to sign on to the deal. On Sunday, Merkel will hold a press conference at the Bundesrat in Berlin to discuss the details of the proposed reforms. It is not yet clear whether she will sign off on them or not, but it seems likely that Merkel and her conservatives will agree on how to tackle the issue. If she does not sign the bill, she could face a vote of no confidence in her own party's parliamentary majority. In the end, a majority of SPD members would have to vote against the plan. This would give the chancellor a chance to make sure that the changes she wants to bring to parliament are carried out in accordance with German law. That is, if she doesn't sign up to them, then she may be forced to step down from her position as Chancellor. Her party has been in power since 2013, when she was first elected as a member of parliament. Since then, her coalition has seen a number of changes, ranging from a tax cut to an increase in public spending on education and health care. Some of those changes have already been approved by parliament, while others have been rejected by the lower house. For example, there are plans to introduce an anti-corruption law that will allow the police to use force against people who are suspected of having links to organized crime. There is also the possibility that some of these reforms could be blocked in future elections, such as in 2014 when a police officer was shot and killed by an armed man who was trying to break up a fight between police and a woman who had been sleeping with a knife. And there is the question of how much money the law will cost. What about the other side? The chancellor's party is a far-right Christian Democrat party and has a reputation for being intolerant of minorities. They are also a strong supporter of women's rights and want women to have the right to choose their own gender and to stand up for their rights. Both parties have also been accused of sexual harassment and assault in recent years. These allegations have led to calls for a ban on women from entering the workforce, as well as the introduction of gender-based violence and discrimination against women in Germany. Many of them accuse Merkel of being a victim of racism and xenophobia. At the same time, they also accuse her of not being aware of her role in fostering a culture of violence in society. A recent poll showed that more than 80 percent of Germans believe that women are more likely to commit violence than men in their 20s and 30s. Another poll found that a quarter of respondents said the women who have sex with men are less likely than the men who do not have children to support them. One poll also suggested that about half of all Germans are women. According to one survey, one in four women surveyed by The Wall Street Journal, only 1.5 percent think women should be allowed to enter the job market. Other pollsters, meanwhile, said a similar figure was found in May."

The new pact, including an artillery buffer zone, was a move to strengthen a peace plan signed earlier this month, also in Minsk. However, Breedlove said violence levels in Ukraine in recent days were as high as prior to the earlier ceasefire. \"The ceasefire is still there in name, but what is happening on the ground is quite a different story,\" Breedlove said, adding that Russian forces were still operating in Ukraine, although he could not pinpoint how many. \"The fluidity of movement of Russian forces and Russian-backed forces back and forth across that border makes it almost impossible to understand the numbers,\" he said. A convoy from Russia consisting of about 170 trucks arrived in Ukraine on Saturday, with a reported cargo of humanitarian aid. Previous aid convoys sent from Russia were met with outrage in Kyiv, as it was suspected they may have been used to provide support to the pro-Moscow separatists in eastern Ukraine. Russia has repeatedly denied such accusations. The separatists have said they want to break from Kyiv and have already declared \"people's republics'\" in Donetsk and Luhansk.

The UNGA said the ceasefire was in \"name only\" and that it was \"in the name of peace and stability\" in the region. However, it did not specify which side of the conflict was to blame for the truce, which was brokered by Russia, Ukraine's foreign minister and the heads of state of Belarus and Russia's armed forces.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has called for an end to fighting between pro-Moscow separatists and Ukrainian forces, while Moscow has insisted it will not impose any new restrictions on what it can and cannot do. Russia has also called on Ukraine to respect its sovereignty and territorial integrity, and has promised to do so in accordance with the terms of its ceasefire with Russia. But the Russian side has so far refused to budge from its position of vetoing the new ceasefire, saying it would be \"unacceptable\" for Moscow to interfere in its own internal affairs. Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow was ready to accept the deal, adding that Moscow had \"no intention\" of imposing sanctions against the rebels. He also said that Russia was willing to give up its veto over the proposed deal.

The team later returned to the field after the flags had been taken down, before succumbing to a 3-0 defeat. On Monday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry strongly criticized the protest. Initially, it had been thought that the Chinese side would play in the Regionalliga S\u00fcdwest - a regional division of Germany's fourth tier which has only 19 teams but the plan was revised so the matches would just be friendlies.

China's national football team was scheduled to take part in an exhibition match against Germany's TSV Schott Mainz on Saturday, but the match was canceled after protests broke out at the stadium in Wormatia Worms. According to a statement from the German Football Association (DFB), the event was cancelled because of the protests. It was the first time that Germany had hosted an international football match since the end of World War II. \"We are not going to allow this to happen again,\" the statement said, adding that it was \"unacceptable\" for Germany to be involved in such an event, which had been scheduled for Saturday.

There were also reports that one Chinese player was arrested and charged with possession of a banned weapon, while the other was found to have been carrying a prohibited weapon. This is the second time in less than a year that German officials have canceled a match between Germany and China. Last year's World Cup qualifier between China and the U.S. was also canceled, following a clash between two Chinese teams at a football training camp in W\u00fcrttemberg. On Sunday, a police officer was injured in clashes with a group of police officers, according to German news agency Stuttgarter Zeitung (SZN). The police chief, Michael G\u00f6rner, told the newspaper that he was unable to provide details about the incident. He also said that there were \"no indications\" that any arrests had taken place. However, he said he did not see any reason to believe that China was planning to boycott the tournament, saying that \"it would be unfair and unfair\" to punish the Chinese for their involvement in what he described as \"illegal activities.\" \"I don't think it's fair to say that we have a problem with this,\" he added, referring to an incident in which a man was killed by a stray bullet in his head during a training session with his son. An official statement by the DFB said no one was seriously injured, and no arrests were made."

        "target": "For drivers in Germany, 2010 was the most expensive year ever Owning and operating a car in Germany has never been cheap, but it's never been more expensive than in 2010. German auto club ADAC says costs associated with owning a car have risen more than 40 percent since 1995. In 2010, German car owners had to pay a high price for their mobility, according to ADAC, which cited record-high fuel prices as the major cost factor. \"For drivers, 2010 will go down in history as the most costly year ever,\" ADAC said in a statement. High taxes The cost of acquiring and operating a car has risen 42 percent since 1995, compared to a 24 percent increase in the general cost of living. Due to tax increases and higher production costs, fuel prices soared 86 percent over the 15-year period. In 2010 alone, the average price for a liter of super gasoline was more than 1.40 euros ($1.84) - the highest the average price ever. According to ADAC, urban singles spent an average of 3,340 euros on their cars in 2000. Five years later, that figure had jumped to 3,900 euros. By the end of 2010, their expenses reached 4,380 euros, or 1,000 euros more than a decade earlier. Driving is also pricey for four-person families with two cars. According to the automobile club, their annual costs have risen 30 percent over the past 10 years from 5,940 euros to 7,740 euros. Taxes account for the lion's share of gasoline and diesel prices. The German government's mineral oil and value added taxes account for nearly 88 cents of the 1.35-euro price of a liter of fuel. Low toll revenue While the German government reaps more revenue year for year from vehicle-related taxes, income generated by its highway toll for trucks is expected to fall this year for the first time since the haulage charges were introduced in 2005. The government predicts this year's toll revenues will amount to 4.2 billion euros, down from 4.3 billion euros in 2009. Author: John Blau Editor: Sam Edmonds",
        "generated_story": "Mercedes-Benz: The Most Costly Year in History The most costly year in history for German auto clubs is the most expensive year ever for them. ADAC, Germany's largest auto club, has announced that it will no longer be able to sell cars in Germany. The carmaker said it would be unable to do so for the next five years due to the high costs associated with the new models. \"We are going to have to make do with what we have, and that is not to say that we will not continue to invest in new cars. We will be doing this because we do not want to lose money,\" the company said in a statement on its website. It also said that the cost of new vehicles would not exceed that of the previous year's model year, which was the first year that a new model car was introduced in the country. In addition, the German car industry is expected to see an increase in sales in 2017, with a rise of 1.6 percent year-on-year. That's up from a year ago, when the average annual sales of cars was around $1.7 billion, according to a survey by the Automotive Industry Association (ADAC). The survey also found that there was a drop of 2.4 percent from the year before, compared to last year. This was due in large part to lower-cost models such as the Mercedes-AMG and BMW models, but also to higher-margin models like the Chevrolet Camaro and the Ford Focus models that were introduced at the end of 2011. While the car market is still in its infancy, it is growing at a very fast pace. Last year saw the biggest drop in car sales since the beginning of 2008, driven by a surge in demand for cars from China, India, Brazil and South Africa. However, in spite of this, car demand has remained strong in recent years, despite the fact that many of these models have been discontinued in favor of smaller, more expensive models in China and India. According to car magazine Autocar, there has been a resurgence in interest in German cars after the 2008-2009 financial crisis, as well as a sharp rise in passenger car prices in Europe and North America. There are also a number of other factors that have contributed to this growth, including the increasing popularity of German-made cars and a rising share of foreign car ownership. Among these factors, however, are the rising costs of fuel, fuel and insurance. For example, a car's fuel costs have risen by almost 40 percent, while fuel prices have fallen by more than 50 percent since 2008. And there is also the issue of how much money is being spent on new equipment and how many cars are being sold. These factors have also been cited as reasons why car owners are spending more money on the latest models than they are buying new ones. Why is this important? What do you think? Do you believe that this is a good time to start thinking about the future? I don't think so. I think it's important to think about it in terms of what you can do for your car. You can't just say, 'Oh, I'm not sure about my car,' but I do think that if you look at it that you will see a lot of things that could be done differently. What I can say is that, for instance, if I had my way, that I would have bought a brand new car in 2007, then I wouldn't have had to buy one at all. But that's not the case with today's cars, because that would mean I'd be paying more for it than I am today. So, what's the point in doing that? Well, let's see what happens next year? We'll see. First of all, we've got to find out. Then we'll know for sure if there's a reason for that. Second, who knows what will happen in 2018? Who knows? Maybe it'll be a long time before we know the answer to that question. Let's just hope that someone will come up with an answer that will help us decide for ourselves. If you have any doubts about that answer, you'll have a hard time deciding for yourself. Don't be surprised if it doesn't come to an end. As a result, many people are looking for a solution. One thing is for certain: there will always be the same thing that happened in 2008 and 2009: the prices will go up again in 2011 and 2012. At the very least, this year will have an impact on my personal life and my family's financial situation. How do I feel about this? You know what I mean? It's very important for me to know that my son is doing well in school. He's doing a great job at school and he's getting his education and I want him to get his degree in computer science so that he can get a job as an engineer. Right now, he has to decide whether or not he wants to become a professor or whether he'll do something else"

The first in a series of transfers to Spain has been transferred to the country's southern port city of Madrid, where he is expected to spend the rest of his life in prison. Spain's interior minister said on Thursday that five of the prisoners had arrived at the prison in Madrid on Wednesday, the first day of their transfer. \"We are very pleased with the progress of these transfers,\" Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba, minister of interior, told a news conference at Madrid's airport. He added that the transfer was part of a broader effort by the government to make sure that all the detainees would be treated fairly and that they would not be subjected to torture or other forms of violence. Perez said the transfers were made as a result of an agreement between Spain and the United States over the release of Guantanamo prisoners. In a statement, Perez also said that he was \"very happy\" to see the new detainees, who had been held in solitary confinement for more than a year, after being released on parole in 2009. According to Perez, one of them, Miguel Angel Moratinos, was transferred from Guantanamo to Madrid in order to be closer to his wife and two children. Both men are believed to have been tortured and killed by US forces in the 1980s and 1990s during the war in Iraq and Afghanistan. They were later released in 1993. On Thursday, they were released from prison on a promise to return to their families in 2007. At the same time, Spanish Prime Minister Josep Maria Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner announced that his country would no longer allow prisoners to stay in its prisons for up to three years. A spokesman for the Spanish government told reporters that a decision was being made on whether to release the five men on Tuesday, but that it was still too early to say whether or not the men would return home. Frustrated by a lack of progress in negotiations with Cuba over a prisoner swap deal, Spain said it would continue to monitor the situation in Guantanamo, which is now under the control of US President George W. Bush. It is not clear how long the deal will last, however, as the two sides have yet to agree on the terms of any new deal. There is no word yet on when the swap will take place or whether the prisoner will be released. However, it is widely believed that Perez and his family will return in time for their wedding next month. Spanish Foreign Minister Luis de Guindos"

But now they should take care that Great Britain does not move further away from Europe, writes Birgit Maass. If only they had done it out of full conviction. If they at least believed that they could really benefit their country by withdrawing from the EU. But many of the parliamentarians whose vote will finally set Brexit on its wayhave voted against their hearts, as well as their minds. It was a vote against their minds, because the withdrawal from the EU will almost certainly, at least on a short to medium term basis, have negative repercussions for the British economy. And it was a vote against their hearts, because for many, a view of the future, divorced from Brussels and increasingly reliant on an unpredictable US President Donald Trump, is somewhat alarming. In recent days, many members of parliament have described it as \"a catastrophe.\" No vote \"against the will of the people.\" Of course there are \"Brexiteers\" who believe that a Britain independent of Brussels will be able to return to its former greatness, once it is no longer held back by the \"Little Europeans.\" But they are in the minority - the majority of parliamentarians already declared their support for remaining in the EU during the referendum campaign. Yet despite this, Theresa May's government was able to push its legislative proposal through the House of Commons without any great difficulty. The predominant view, also amongst members of the two leading parties, is that to hinder Brexit and to fail to support the government in its endeavors to do so, would be to go \"against the will of the people.\" Anti-EU newspapers have targeted Brexit opponents. And those who have publically come out in support of the EU have had to reckon with death threats. The at times passionate debate in the lower house, that went on over several days, was a temporary highlight in this European tragedy, which in the worst case could contribute to the continent disintegrating into individual sovereign states. Don't be intimidated The British public supports the hard-line position taken by Prime Minister May in withdrawing from the common market. Polls are showing that her strategy is gaining increased support. There is no turning back now. The British are now looking for clarity on the repercussions of their withdrawal from the EU. They want the negotiations with the EU to start as soon as possible. It was an historical misjudgement by David Cameron that he could win the referendum. Most of the members of the lower house believed the then-prime minister and voted to hold a referendum. But now they can no longer stop Brexit. But they should not let themselves be intimidated by party discipline, nor the leading Brexiteers, nor by voter impatience. Over the next two years they should use every chance they can to influence the withdrawal process. May announced that although they are leaving the European Union, they will not be moving away from Europe. The parliamentarians must now hold her to her word. Have something to say? Add your comments below. The thread will stay open for 24 hours after publication.",
        "generated_story": "Brexit vote is not a referendum against the will of the British people The British government has announced that it will vote to leave the European Union. The referendum will be held in the House of Commons on Thursday, May 27. It is the first time the country has voted to exit the EU, and it is a historic moment in British history. British Prime Minister Theresa May has said that the referendum on leaving the bloc will not be a \"no-confidence vote\" against her government. \"We are not going to allow this to happen again,\" May said in a speech at the end of her first day in office. She added that she hoped the vote would lead to an end to austerity and a return to the old system of checks and balances. But she did not rule out the possibility of a second referendum, she said, adding that a third referendum would be needed to ensure that Britain's future relationship with the United States remained intact. May's speech came after the UK government announced it would no longer be able to vote on the Brexit deal, which it had agreed in principle with Brussels on March 29. In a statement, the prime minister said: \"I am confident that we will win this referendum. We have a lot of work to do and we are committed to doing it.\" The vote will take place within the next two weeks, but May will have to wait until the new government is in place before making a decision on how to proceed with Brexit. That means she will need to make sure that her plans are in line with British law and the constitution, as well as the principles of international law. On the other hand, there will still be the question of whether or not Britain should be allowed to continue to live in an EU without a single EU member state. This is something that has been debated in parliament for many years, with a number of key issues such as immigration, refugees, security, health, social security and education being discussed. There is also the issue of refugees and asylum seekers being housed in refugee camps, where they can be housed for up to a year. And there are also concerns about the effects of Brexit on people's health and well-being. Many of these concerns are now being addressed by May, who has promised to hold talks with EU leaders in Brussels over the coming weeks and months. Some of those discussions have already been postponed, while others have been scheduled to resume on Friday. However, it remains to be seen whether the two sides will reach an agreement on where to send the refugees. Both sides have said they are willing to work together in order to avoid a repeat of last year's vote, in which the US and Britain agreed to let refugees into Britain. They have also agreed that they would not allow refugees to stay in their country indefinitely if they were deemed to have no future in Europe. These are the conditions under which a refugee camp or asylum facility is built. If the migrants are to remain in Britain, then they will face the same conditions as those in other EU countries. What is more important is that these conditions are met by a government that is prepared to deal with them as a whole. For example, if a migrant camp were to become part of an asylum camp, that would mean they could be sent back to their home countries, or even to other European countries without having to pay for their own asylum. So far, this has not been the case in any way at all. As a result, many migrants and refugees are still waiting for a chance to come to Britain and seek asylum in another EU country. At the moment, most of them are hoping to find a way out of their current situation. While many are worried about what the future holds for them, others are more optimistic about their chances of finding a new home. One thing is for certain: they don't want to give up on their dream of becoming a free and open society. More than half a million people are living in fear of being turned away from their new country, a country that was once one of Europe's largest trading partners. Another is looking for an alternative source of income. A third, however, is still not sure what will happen to those who are already living there. How many people would like to move to another country? That's a big question for the government, given the current political climate. I think the answer is clear: there is no clear answer to that question at this point. You can't just say, \"Yes, we can do that.\" But it's not clear how many more people will move on from the idea of moving to Europe, because that's the only way to get a better life for themselves and their families. Is it really possible? It's still too early to say for sure. After all, Britain is already a member of NATO, so there's no chance of that happening. Only time will tell which country will decide what kind of life they want in this new world and which one will stay there for long. Author: Michael Grosz/dpa Editor: Sarah Isenson"

        "target": "A Brief History of the Seaside Holiday These days, millions take seaside holidays for granted as one of life's pleasures. But 200 years ago, a dip in the sea was more a test of courage. Hardly anyone could swim. As late as the 18th century, many Europeans still thought of the sea as the realm of Satan: storm-tossed and inhabited by terrifying monsters. \"Unlike the mountains, the coasts were terra incognita as a holiday spot,\" says Manfred B\u00e4tje, director of the Bade-Museum on the North Sea island of Norderney. Anyone who set foot in the water was \"stepping into the unknown\". Brighton showed the way That only began to change after the British aristocracy discovered the healing power of salt water. As early as 1780, Brighton, England's biggest and oldest seaside resort, was a bustling spa. Philosopher and physicist Georg Christoph Lichtenberg (1742-1799) of G\u00f6ttingen gave Germans the starting signal with his 1793 essay \"Why doesn't Germany have any large public seaside resorts?\" In it, he called for the creation of a resort in Cuxhaven on the North Sea. He received support from the most notable German physician of the time, the Prussian king's court physician, Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland. But things turned out somewhat differently. Germany's first seaside resort was indeed built in September, 1793, but in Heiligendamm on the Baltic Sea. Four years later, permission was granted for construction of Germany's first resort on the North Sea, on Norderney. \"For the first bathing season on July and August of 1800, only around 250 guests turned up. Now, the nearly 6000 residents host a good 530,000 bathers annually, plus around 230,000 day-trippers,\" B\u00e4tje reels off the figures. Romanticist inspiration In the 19th century, the landscapes of Caspar David Friedrich, such as his famous Chalk Cliffs on R\u00fcgen (1818), gave seaside holidays added impetus. From then on, the sea was no longer a voracious beast. From the shore, the cultivated, modern European contemplated the vast melancholy of the deep. \"The calm sea became an embodiment of unspecified yearning, the waves an expression of vitality and dynamism,\" soliloquizes museum director B\u00e4tje. But the journey to the sea long remained an arduous, time-consuming one. It took the mail coach a good thirty hours to cover the distance from Hamburg to the North Frisian town of Aurich over bumpy, muddy roads. The express cab from Bremen only took about 16 hours to reach the East Frisian town of Norden - including six changes of horses along the way. \"It wasn't comfortable,\" explains B\u00e4tje. Not until the introduction of seaside tourist steamers out of Hamburg and Bremen to the islands and the expansion of the railways did the journey become easier. Strict bathing rules At first, it was primarily the well-to-do bourgeois and nobility who were able to afford a seaside holiday. Victorian-era society is known for its extreme prudishness, and the beach was not exempt. Bathing machines were essentially changing cabins on wheels that could be rolled into the surf. The sexes were kept strictly separated. Wet swimsuits could not be allowed to cling, thus revealing the body's contours. Women sported baggy flannel garments with bloomers underneath that swiftly became waterlogged to where the bather was risking her life. Hardly anyone really knew how to swim anyway. \"Most bathers wouldn't stay in the water any more than two minutes, often just seconds at a time. The English had a rule: 'Three dips and out',\" quips archivist Manfred B\u00e4tje, whose Bade-Museum is housed in a building for a former wave pool, just a few steps from Norderney's Weststrand, where, during the summer months, vacationers sunbathe in wicker beach chairs and on blankets, cooled by a salty sea breeze. Sunbathing first came in style early in the 20th century, and the first true swimsuits were produced in the United States. \"Starting in 1919, today's bathing culture gradually began to take shape,\" B\u00e4tje looks back. At the same time, ideals of beauty were in flux - such as the attitude towards tan skin, which had long been regarded as a mark of farmers and manual laborers. B\u00e4tje: \"People were still cultivating their genteel pallors.\" Water, Waves, Wellness Today, the sun worshipers are the devout masses, and seaside holidays are their pilgrimages. The North Sea resorts alone count some 12.9 million overnight stays annually. Health is once again a primary concern: sea air, sea water, sea salts and the algaes and mud used in",
        "generated_story": "A Brief History of the Seaside Holiday in Germany In Germany, the seaside holiday has become something of a tourist attraction. Manfred B\u00e4tje, head curator at the Bade-Museum in Norderney, is a regular visitor to the museum. He has been there for more than 30 years. In his first year as curator, he spent most of his time on the island. \"I spent a lot of time with my family and my friends, and I was very happy to see them,\" he said. The museum is located in the town of Bremen, about 30 kilometers (25 miles) north-east of Cologne. It's located on a small island off the coast of North Rhine-Westphalia, near the German city of Cuxhaven, where the famous Chalk Cliffs on R\u00fcgen were once located. Today, it's a UNESCO World Heritage Site and the site is part of UNESCO's \"World Heritage Sites.\" The site, which was built in 1887, was once the largest ship-to-ship port in Europe, with a total area of 1.5 million square kilometers. During World War II, Germany was the first country to have a sea holiday. After the war, there was a great deal of conflict between the British and German empires. At the same time, many of these conflicts were resolved by the Germans, who had to flee their homes in order to get to Germany. For example, in 1945, German Chancellor Wilhelm Hufeland and his wife, Christoph Wilhelm, were forced to leave their home in H\u00fcttingen for Germany to take refuge in a nearby village. They returned to their own country in 1946, after a brief period of exile, when the Nazis invaded Germany and took over the country. This time around, they were able to reunite with their families and settle down in their small village of Heiligendamm, a town just outside the city limits of Hamburg. Since then, their relationship has improved and they have become closer to each other. But they are still very much at odds with one another. One of their main differences is that they don't have any contact with the rest of Germany at all. That's because they didn't want to be seen as a threat to German national security. So they decided to stay together. And that's what they did: They stayed together for a year and a half. Then they moved on to other places, such as the Baltic Sea resort of Aurich in northern Germany where they stayed for the summer. Now they're back together again, but this time they've got a whole new set of people to look up to. There's also a new generation of tourists who have come from all over Europe to visit the area. Some of them are from the UK, while others from other European countries have been visiting Germany as well. These are the people who came here to spend the holidays with us. You can find them in many different places around the world, whether it be in Cologne, Hamburg, Cologne or the small towns of D\u00fcsseldorf, or even the cities of H\u00fcrttemberg. On the other hand, you can see that there are a number of different groups of visitors who come here every year to enjoy the sea. Many of those visitors are German-born, some from Germany or from Scandinavia. Others come mainly from England and other countries, like the United States, from France, Spain, Italy, Austria, Switzerland, Portugal, Greece, Turkey, Romania, Russia, China, Hong Kong, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, Australia, among others. Among them is Caspar David Friedrich, an Englishman who was born in Hamburg and is now a professor of archaeology at Cologne's University of Freiburg. His research has led him to believe that Germany is the only country that has a good reputation for its seafaring culture. However, his research shows that it is not only Germany that is attracting tourists, that the seafarers are also attracting visitors to its beaches. According to his own research, most tourists come to Hamburg from different countries. A recent survey of German tourists found that a majority of Germans are not interested in visiting the beaches of Europe. Most visitors, however, do not come back until the end of September, as there is no official information on their destination. Instead they stay in Bavaria or in other German cities. As a result, these tourists have to travel to different areas to explore the various attractions and attractions. From Cologne to Cologne and Cologne in particular, this is something that can only be experienced by a German visitor. If you're a visitor, then you'll find that many people are familiar with German culture and history. When you go to Munich, for instance, one of your first stops is in C\u00fcnden or Munich. What do you find there? What is it like to go there and see the sights? There are lots of interesting things to do there. I think it will be interesting to find out there,"

        "generated_story": "Lockdown lifted after active shooter incident at Joint Base Andrews US President Barack Obama has lifted a lockdown at a military base outside Washington, D.C. The lockdown was lifted following an active shooting at the US military's base in Maryland. US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Thursday that the military had lifted the lockdown. \"We have lifted all restrictions on the activities of our military personnel,\" he said in a statement released by the White House. Obama said the move was in response to a report that a man had opened fire inside the facility, which is located in the Maryland town of Camp Springs. A spokesman for the Defense Department confirmed that no one was injured in Thursday's incident, but said it was not clear whether the incident was related to the ongoing military exercises. Military officials said they were not aware of any other incidents, and that there was no indication that any of the incidents were linked to military activities. However, the Pentagon spokesman said there had been no reports of an incident involving a soldier or a civilian. Officials said no injuries were reported and no arrests were being made. There were no immediate indications of a possible terrorist attack, according to an official statement from the Department of Defense (DOD). The statement also said that an investigation was under way into the shooting, adding that \"there is no evidence to suggest that anyone was involved in this incident.\" The Pentagon statement said: \"The investigation is ongoing and we have no further information at this time. We are continuing to monitor the situation closely and will continue to do so as soon as we receive any information that leads us to believe that we are not at risk,\" the statement added. It did not say how many people were injured or when the attack took place, or whether there were any fatalities or injuries. According to officials, no suspects have yet been identified, although there has been speculation that one person may have been killed or injured. In addition, there are reports that two other people have also been injured, one of them critically, while the other is believed to be in critical condition. At the same time, US officials have not commented on whether or not there is an ongoing threat to US national security. Earlier this week, a US official told the Associated Press that US troops were deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as in Iraq and Syria, to protect the country from terrorist attacks. This is the second time in less than a year that troops have gone into Afghanistan. Last year, an attack on a school in Afghanistan killed at least 10 people and injured more than 100 others. On Thursday, two US soldiers were killed in an exchange of gunfire with the assailant, who was later reported to have fled the scene. More than 1,200 troops and civilians were also injured during the exchange, with some of those injured being taken to hospitals and other military hospitals. One soldier died in hospital. Another soldier was seriously injured when he was hit by a stray bullet during a training exercise. Two other soldiers sustained minor injuries, including a head wound and a leg wound. Both soldiers are expected to survive the operation. President Obama called for calm on Friday, saying he would be \"very careful\" in his speech to Congress. He also called on Congress to pass a bill that would ban the use of force against the Taliban in future."

        "target": "Threat of the Punjabi Taliban is growing Deutsche Welle talks to Pakistani political expert Hasan Askari Rizvi about the growing ties between militants in northwest Pakistan and Punjab province. At least four gunmen disguised in police uniforms raided a hospital in Pakistan's eastern city of Lahore on Monday night, claiming at least five lives. Local officials said the gunmen were trying to free a militant, who was being treated there after being captured during attacks on two mosques last Friday. The police said the gunfight at Jinnah Hospital had lasted around 45 minutes but the gunmen had managed to flee. Friday's twin attacks on the minority Ahmadi community left more than 90 people dead. They were claimed by a group, which identified itself as the Punjabi wing of the Taliban. Deutsche Welle spoke to political expert Hasan Askari Rizvi in Lahore, where there has been a wave of violence in recent days. DW: Who are the \"Punjabi Taliban\"? It is a kind of a pejorative term, which includes a host of groups. Initially in Punjab, you had two types of militancy: One, the groups that focussed mainly on Indian-administered Kashmir and there were other types of groups that focussed on Pakistan. Those were the sectarian groups targeting mainly the Shias, and there were some Shia groups targeting the Sunni leadership. Over the years a lot of factions have broken away from these groups and these small entities are functioning more or less autonomously. They have trainings in the tribal areas because these are secured for them and certain parts are not under Pakistani control so these groups go there. They operate with the Pakistani Taliban based in tribal areas against the Pakistani troops in the region. They also have an autonomous agenda, which they pursue in Punjab, as they have been doing in the past days. These groups also play host or are a kind of a local link to Taliban suicide bombers who come into the main part of Pakistan from the tribal areas (let's say to Punjab). If they have to target some place, they park themselves with these Punjab groups, and then do it. All these factions and groups that have broken away from traditional militant groups and are functioning in close collaboration with tribal area Taliban are often described as the \"Punjabi Taliban\". Why do you think these militants are resurfacing now? They have always existed here and there and generally the trend is that they undertake a couple of operations, one after the other. Then the government comes in and takes action against them. Then they just disappear or become sleeping groups and suddenly after a couple of months they resurface. That's the standard pattern. The last major incident in Lahore was in the first week of March. Then there was nothing in April and now towards the end of May you have this kind of incident. Do you think the government should have taken stronger action against them? They should have but the problem is that the Punjab government has a kind of ambiguous approach and I think there is some element of denial within the leadership also. These groups also have some sympathy if not support at the societal level and that makes it difficult for the government to go against them openly. They need to work together and to emphasise to the people that they are terrorists. They use different names and Islam but actually their agenda is terrorism. Somehow the government of Punjab has been rather confused and ambiguous regarding these groups. Interview: Disha Uppal Editor: Anne Thomas",

He was 45. The Catalan club announced the death of its former bench boss in a statement posted on its website on Friday. \"FC Barcelona is in immense mourning. Tito Vilanova has died at the age of 45. May he rest in peace,\" the statement said. Vilanova had first been diagnosed with a tumor in a saliva gland in November 2011, while he was an assistant to then-Barcelona head coach Pep Guardiola. He had been battling against recurring cancer ever since and had been admitted to a Barcelona hospital last week. He led Barca to the Primera Liga title last season, his only campaign as head coach, when the Catalans earned a record-tying 100 points. Last July he stepped down due to his ongoing health problems. Vilanova is survived by his wife and two children, including a son who now plays in Barcelona's youth academy. pfd/lw (AP, dpa, AFP)",
        "generated_story": "FC Barcelona coach Tito Vilanova dies in hospital after battle with cancer Barcelona's head coach has died at the age of 80. He was battling cancer. \"I was in a very bad way,\" he told reporters in Barcelona on Sunday. The 75-year-old coach of FC Barcelona, who has been in the hospital for more than a year and a half, was diagnosed with terminal cancer earlier this month. In a statement, the club said he had died of cancer in his abdomen after suffering a heart attack while training with his team in Spain's Primera Liga (Primera Divisi\u00f3n), the top division of the Spanish football league, in which the league's top two teams compete for the Champions League spot. His death came less than two weeks after he underwent surgery to remove cancerous growths from his liver and pancreas. According to the team's website, he was suffering from cancer and had undergone chemotherapy and radiation treatments for several months. It was not immediately clear whether the cancer had spread to other organs or whether he would be able to return to full fitness in time for next season's Copa del Rey, which kicks off on Saturday. A spokesman for Barcelona confirmed that the coach had been hospitalized for a \"serious illness\" but did not give further details on the cause of his illness. However, it is not clear how long he will be out of action. On Sunday, Barcelona announced that they would suspend all player transfers until the end of this season, citing \"a lack of interest\" from the medical staff. Barcelona have said they will continue to monitor the situation closely, but have yet to announce the exact date. They have not yet decided on a date, although they are expected to hold a news conference later this week to discuss the latest developments. There have been no official reports of any cancellations, and the Catalan football federation said on Monday that it would hold an emergency meeting with the Barcelona board of directors on Tuesday to decide whether to suspend the player's contract or allow him to resume his duties as coach. An official statement said the decision was made after a medical examination was carried out by a team medical team. Catalan media reported that a doctor had diagnosed the patient with stage 4 colon cancer, a condition that can be treated with chemotherapy or radiation. While the diagnosis was initially thought to be benign, doctors said it could not be ruled out as a possible side effect of chemotherapy. Author: dpa/rc (AP, AFP, Reuters)"
