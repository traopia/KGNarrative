        "story": "Pakistan Submits Preliminary Report on Mumbai Attacks A senior Pakistani official has admitted for the first time that last year's attacks in the Indian city of Mumbai were partly planned in Pakistan. Interior Ministry chief Rehman Malik said that several suspects are now being held and a case has been filed which may lead to their prosecution. At least 173 people were killed in November's attacks. Tensions between between India and Pakistan rose after Delhi said all 10 gunmen were from Pakistan. Pakistan denied any responsibility in the immediate aftermath of the attacks, but later it admitted that the sole gunman captured alive was a Pakistani national.",

        "story": "EU Signs Pirate Deal With Kenya The EU has signed an agreement with Kenya that provides for the handover of pirates seized by the German Navy off the coast of Somalia -- but no decision has been made whether the pirates would be transferred to Kenya. The agreement was signed in Nairobi on Friday, March 6, by Kenyan Foreign Minister Moses Wetang'ula and the Czech ambassador to Kenya, said a Foreign Office spokesman. The Czech Republic holds the rotating presidency of the EU. The pirates are on board the German frigate Rheinland Pfalz, which apprehended them on Tuesday when they attacked a German merchant vessel off Somalia with anti-tank missiles and firearms. The frigate is part of the EU's anti-piracy mission Atalanta in the Gulf of Aden, which Germany joined in December. The foreign office spokesman said no decision had been made whether the nine pirates captured by the German Navy would be transferred to Kenya. Exploring unchartered territory First, independent prosecutors in Hamburg need to decide whether the men should face trial in Germany. The German navy has given them all its evidence, and it is now up to them to say whether German interests were at stake during the attack. A specially convened commission, representing Germany's Interior, Foreign, Defence and Justice ministries, met this week to discuss the legal status of the pirates -- hitherto unchartered legal territory. The Hamburg court, which is responsible for maritime legal issues, will provide Berlin with more time to decide on what to do with the alleged pirates. A spokesperson for the court has already said that the decision to open the probe meant in no way that the nine men would be brought to Germany for processing. \"The government is studying in-depth whether the suspected pirates could, if necessary, be handed over to a third country for prosecution,\" the government said Thursday in a statement. This is the first time in Germany's modern history that its navy has made any apprehensions at sea. One possible destination for the nine men could be Kenya, which on Thursday received seven suspected Somali pirates captured Feb. 11 by the US guided-missile cruiser Vella Gul. The seven men will face prosecution under a bilateral pact between the US and Kenya. Prosecution uncertain The German Navy frigate Rheinland-Pfalz took part Tuesday in a dramatic rescue after the nine Somalis, allegedly armed with anti-tank rocket launchers and firearms, were said to have attacked a German merchant vessel off the Somali coast. The MV Courier, owned by a Bremen-based shipping company, had been sailing under an Antigua and Barbuda flag. No German nationals were on board. The Interior Ministry said Wednesday that there were no grounds for a German prosecution of the captured men, because no German interests were judged to have been endangered in the attack. Germany currently has no agreement with third-party countries under which captured pirates could be prosecuted. Under European law, which applies to the German naval mission, pirates can be held for up to 12 days. The men are to stay on board the Rheinland-Pfalz until a decision is reached. In 2008, pirates seized more than 200 ships off the Somali coast, demanding millions of dollars in ransom.",

        "story": "NATO Troops Killed in Roadside Afghan Blast Five NATO-led troops, three Afghan civilians, two Afghan police officers and five militants were killed in a series of blasts and clashes in Afghanistan. A sixth NATO soldier died in a traffic accident, officials said. In the latest incident, four NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) soldiers were killed in a roadside bomb blast in eastern region of the country, the alliance said in a statement on Sunday, March 15. \"On behalf of ISAF, I offer our sincere condolences to the families and friends of our fallen soldiers,\" Brigadier-General Richard Blanchette, an ISAF spokesperson said in a statement. \"These dedicated professionals have risked their lives for a safe and stable Afghanistan,\" he said. The statement did not disclose the nationalities of the soldiers, nor say where exactly in eastern region the incident took place. Zabiullah Mujahid, a Taliban spokesman said that their forces attacked a US military tank in Kot district of eastern Nangarhar province on Sunday afternoon. It was not immediately clear if the Taliban and NATO statement were referring to the same incident. Meanwhile, a French soldier was killed in a Taliban attack in an area east of Kabul city on Saturday, French Defense Ministry and NATO military in Kabul said. The sixth NATO fatality was a German soldier, who was killed in a traffic accident in northern Afghanistan, the German Defense Ministry said. A British soldier was also killed in an insurgent attack in southern province of Helmand on Saturday, bringing the total number of NATO fatalities to seven in the past two days. Meanwhile, a suicide bomber detonated an explosives-packed vehicle near a convoy of foreign forces in the Afghan capital Kabul on Sunday afternoon, killing two civilians and wounding 14, including several children, Zemarai Bashary, spokesman for the Interior Ministry said. In the south of the country, a roadside bomb targeting Kandahar city's mayor on Sunday killed one bystander and wounded six more civilians, Abdul Khaliq, a senior police official in the province, said. In a separate incident in the same province, US-led coalition forces said they killed five suspected Taliban insurgents and detained four more in an operation in Maiwand district of the province on Sunday morning. The Afghan forces bear the brunt of Taliban attacks in Afghanistan. More than 2,300 police forces were killed in the past two years. Seven years from the ouster of their regime, Taliban militants continue to grow stronger and extend their writ to wider swathes of the country.",

        "story": "Bonn Conference to Set Agenda for New UN Climate Deal The UN's climate chief urged industrialized countries to lead the way on controlling climate change as a new round of UN talks aimed at replacing the Kyoto Protocol got underway in Bonn on Sunday, March 29. Around 2,600 delegates from 175 countries gathered in the former German capital over the weekend for the first of several meetings ahead of December's Copenhagen summit, at which new global targets on emissions are to be set ahead of the 2012 expiry of the Kyoto agreement. The Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement on stabilizing the output of greenhouse gases, entered into force in 2005. Yvo De Boer, who heads climate change initiatives at the United Nations, said developing countries would only agree to a new climate pact if industrialized nations set clear targets for the reduction of greenhouse gases. Additionally, those nations have to be prepared to offer financial support to poorer countries. A challenge for big polluters The new agreement to replace the Kyoto Protocol sets a challenge for industrialized nations, with a call for an additional target of a 25 to 40-percent reduction in greenhouse gases by the year 2020, compared to 1990 figures. By the year 2050, output is to be reduced even more, with a targeted emissions cut of 50 to 80 percent. That cut is needed to keep the overall increase in world temperatures within 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 F). These targets will be haggled over in the months leading up to December's Copenhagen summit. Many industrialized nations are hoping to tweak their domestic economies as little as possible, perhaps by using compensatory projects, such as rain forest preservation, to help them meet targets. De Boer said the debate needed to move forward during the 10-day Bonn conference, as a draft proposal was needed by June in order to meet the Copenhagen deadline. \"The clock is running and the states have a great deal of work ahead,\" de Boer said. All eyes on the US The United States' position will be keenly observed in the coming days, since Washington recently changed tack on climate change with the inauguration of President Barack Obama. Former US President Bill Clinton signed the Kyoto Protocol, but it was never ratified. The White House on Saturday invited the UN and 16 major economies to Washington to prepare for international efforts to reduce climate changing greenhouse gas emissions. \"The US will be powerfully and fervently engaged in this process,\" Obama's climate negotiator, Todd Stern said on Sunday. But he cautioned against unrealistic expectations that the United States could \"wave a magic wand\" and find solutions to all problems. \"I don't think anybody should be thinking that the US can ride in on a white horse and make it all work,\" he said. The Chinese puzzle In particular, Washington wants to see China increase its commitment to emissions reduction, since the country's economic growth made it one of the biggest greenhouse gas contributors. China and the US between them account for more than 40 percent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions. \"If you do the math, you simply cannot be anywhere near where science tells us we need to be if you don't have China involved, as well also other major developing countries,\" he said. The Kyoto protocol was lenient on developing countries such as China, India and Brazil. This is to change in the document to be signed in Copenhagen. De Boer welcomed Obama's initiative, saying it could be \"useful\" to find a political solution to the climate change talks.",

        "story": "German Social Democrats pledge more money for low-income earners Leaders of Germany's Social Democratic Party (SPD) have unanimously approved an election manifesto ahead of September's federal poll, hoping the promise of more cash will win over voters. Key points of the center-left SPD's platform are tax cuts and state handouts for low-income groups and families with children. These promises would be partly financed by a tax on the rich and a levy on stock transactions. \"We know that crisis management is necessary, and that is the core of this program,\" the Social Democrats' candidate for the chancellery, Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, told journalists on Saturday, April 18. The SPD is seeking to distance itself from Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) as Germany's two coalition partners gear up for a parliamentary election on Sept. 27. This year's election campaign is expected to be dominated by the fallout from the financial crisis, which has hit key sectors of German industry and put tens of thousands of workers on reduced hours with less pay. Other key issues for the SPD will be a move to ban the right-extremist National Democratic Party (NPD), as well as a complete phasing out of nuclear energy by 2021. The Social Democrats have also promised to prevent the privatization of Germany's national rail operator Deutsche Bahn until the next election. The much-disputed initial private offering planned for last year was put on hold due to the slide in global markets. Turn to the left? The party platform, which Steinmeier will officially unveil on Sunday, includes a 300-euro ($390) tax rebate for people on low wages, in return for not filing a tax return. The SPD says the plan will not just help low-income earners, but also help cut red tape. But the proposal has already generated ridicule from opposition parties on Thursday, when the German daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung leaked the plans. Chairman for the Christian Social Union party's association of small and medium businesses, Hans Michelbach, said the bonus would hinder rather than help. He said it would only complicate people's taxes, and labeled it \"the worst form of rip-off.\" Secretary-general from the business-oriented Free Democratic Party, Dirk Niebel, described the scheme as typically socialist. His deputy, Carl-Ludwig Thiele, said the rebate would give tax authorities the added task of monitoring whether taxpayers applying for the bonus were earning a secondary income. The Social Democrats are also proposing to reduce the lowest-income tax bracket by four points to a rate of 10 percent. Families with children would also receive a 200-euro tax break. The measures would be financed by an increase in the top tax bracket - raising it to 47 percent for people with incomes of 125,000 euros and more, as well as a half-percent levy on stock exchange transactions. The party estimates their economic plans would generate 5 billion euros in extra revenue. The campaign trail begins The Social Democrats currently share power with their main political rival, Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU), in a right-left \"grand-coalition.\" Both sides, however, seem ready to sever ties after September's election, although influential voices in both camps argue that, especially in difficult times, the grand coalition is the most prudent option. The conservative CDU opposes tax increases on the wealthy and wants to lower income taxes after the poll. \"Tax increases during a time of economic crisis is simply irresponsible,\" CDU campaign manager Ronald Pofalla said last week. \"Tax increases are poison for the economy and would endanger jobs.\" The SPD currently trails the CDU by about eight percentage points.",

        "story": "Final four square off in German Cup semifinals Bremen's unprecedented four-match battle with Hamburg gets underway with the Cup semifinal on Wednesday. But before that Leverkusen try to seize their last chance for some silverware against Mainz. Among the high hopes Leverkusen carried into this season, one is still alive. If they can get past second-division Mainz, the underachieving squad will book a place in the Cup finals in Berlin on May 30. After topping the table for parts of the first half of the season, coach Bruno Labbadia's charges have been wretched of late, winning only three of their last 10 matches and dropping down to ninth in the league. One reason is that, with their own stadium undergoing renovations, they've had to play their home matches in Duesseldorf. That's also the case with Tuesday's semifinal. Still, Leverkusen have to fancy their chances -- with no major injury problems against an opponent from Division Two. And winning the Cup would go a long way toward salvaging a disappointing season and probably save Labbadia's job. Mainz, for their part, are certain to pack defenders into their own half and hope for a late goal, a strategy that worked well in their quarterfinal upset of first-division Schalke in early March. Epic rivalry The other Cup finalist will be determined when Bremen travel to Hamburg on Wednesday. It's the first of a four-game series between the Northern German rivals -- with a UEFA Cup semifinal tie and a league match to follow later in April and in May. Bremen, who have slipped down to tenth in the Bundesliga table, have been on cruise control in the league. But it will be a different story in the two cup competitions, with titles and a spot in international competition up for grabs. Bremen goalkeeper Tim Wiese has promised his side will try to \"get on Hamburg's nerves\" and win all four matches. The visitors will be bolstered by the return of superstar playmaker Diego who was rested with a perhaps fictional injury in the league last weekend. Hamburg, meanwhile, are third in the league and have an outside shot at winning a triple. But they should beware, if they think they're bound to be victorious in something. As recently as 2002, Leverkusen had a chance to win the Bundesliga, the Cup and the Champions League -- only to emerge, in the end, empty-handed. Author: Jefferson Chase Editor: Trinity Hartman",

        "story": "UN criticizes Israel over Gaza bombing A United Nations investigation into attacks by Israeli forces on UN installations during the Gaza war four months ago has strongly criticized Israel for gross negligence and recklessness. The report, produced by a four-member inquiry board appointed by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, found that the Israeli army failed to protect UN personnel and civilians sheltering in UN buildings. Israel has rejected the report as one-sided and biased. The UN inquiry led by Briton Ian Martin, a former head of rights group Amnesty International who later joined the United Nations, investigated nine incidents of damage to UN property. It found Israel to blame in six incidents when people sheltering in UN buildings were killed or injured. Report highlights Jabalia incident The report highlighted the firing of artillery shells near a UN-run school in Jabalia where Palestinians had sought refuge on January 6. Seven people were wounded inside the school, but an estimated 30-40 people were killed nearby. In several cases, the report found Israel had \"breached the inviolability of United Nations premises,\" had not respected UN immunity and was responsible for deaths and injuries. The board of inquiry also criticized Israel's use of white phosphorus shells which the UN says damaged the UN's main food warehouse in Gaza. The UN report says the Israeli military took \"inadequate\" precautions to protect UN premises and civilians inside and recommends further investigation into possible war crimes. Israel rejects allegations Israel's deputy UN ambassador, Daniel Carmon, called the report one-sided and unfair. \"We were really shocked to see a report where the board is limiting itself to the facts of the damages only, ignoring the context, ignoring that there is war against terrorism,\" he told Reuters. UN Chief Ban Ki-moon said he would seek compensation from Israel for damage to UN property, estimated at more than $11 million, but would not follow the panel's call for further investigations.",

        "story": "Lufthansa closes in on Austrian Airlines takeover More than 85 percent of Austrian Airlines shareholders have reportedly accepted a public takeover offer by Germany's Lufthansa. But rival airlines continue to object to the move as being unfair. Lufthansa has cleared an important hurdle in its bid to take over cash-strapped Austrian Airlines. Lufthansa holds well over the 75 percent of shares in the company, according to Austrian Airlines (AUA). Shares of AUA rose by more than 12 percent to 4.19 euros ($5.70) after Tuesday's announcement. Austrian Airlines said exact acceptance figures would be made public on Thursday. Lufthansa shares dropped 3 percent on the announcement before recovering to end the day down by one percent. At the end of last year, Lufthansa agreed to buy a 41.6-percent stake in AUA from the Austrian government for 366,000 euros. In exchange, Vienna agreed to assume 500 million euros of the struggling airline's debt. The European Commission opened an investigation after rival airlines complained about Austria's agreement with Lufthansa. The commission is scheduled to rule on the issue by June 17. Lufthansa is reportedly also interested in raising its stake in the British airline BMI to 80 percent this year.",

        "story": "Russia and Japan Expand Energy Ties Russia and Japan agreed on a series of energy deals during Prime Minister Vladimir Putin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s visit this week. This includes a key pact on civilian nuclear co-operation. But the two sides once again failed to resolve their long-running diplomatic dispute. Japan and Russia have been locked in a territorial dispute for decades. It focuses on a chain of islands between the two countries which are called the Northern Territories by the Japanese and the Southern Kurils by the Russians. The islands were occupied by Soviet army in the last days of World War II and are claimed by both sides. During a recent meeting between Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and his Japanese counterpart Taro Aso in Tokyo this week, both sides said they would study all options to end the row, but fell short of announcing any breakthrough. The two countries also reaffirmed that they want to bolster bilateral co-operation and engage in joint energy projects. \"Russia-Japanese relations have been worrying for years, including the cold-war period. But in recent years things have changed rapidly. And I think economic relations have become more important for them,\" explains Professor Nobuo Shimotomai, an expert on Japan-Russia relations at Tokyo's Hosei University. Nuclear pact One of the major highlights of the Putin-Aso meeting was a nuclear energy pact. The agreement will allow the transfer of Japanese technology to Russia. In return, Japan will get the much-needed nuclear fuel. It will also pave the way for joint uranium mining in Russia, a crucial step for the Russian uranium and nuclear industries, says Marcel Vi\u00c3\u00abtor, an expert on energy policy at the German Council of Foreign Relations in Berlin: \"The Russian uranium and nuclear industries have been in a critical situation for almost two decades. They are in dire need of new contracts to develop power plants and they are looking for international partners. And now it seems they have found one in Japan. And if it is ratified by both parliaments, this will be a wonderful deal for the Russian nuclear sector.\" Co-operation in gas sector Japanese and Russian energy companies have also agreed to jointly develop two major oil fields in eastern Siberia. The project is likely to cost over 150 million dollars. A Memorandum of Understanding was signed between Russian energy giant Gazprom and its Japanese partners to explore ways to process natural gas near the Pacific city of Vladivostok. Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller told the media in Tokyo that a 2,000-kilometre pipeline from Sakhalin island to Vladivostok was likely to be completed by 2011, which could possibly supply natural gas to consumers in the Asia-Pacific region as well, including Japan. Energy expert Vi\u00c3\u00abtor says the move, if successful, would considerably help Japan, which is currently heavily relying on Middle Eastern oil. \"Until today the Japanese get their oil and gas imports from the Middle East. But of course they are cautious about the political developments there and if, for whatever reasons, the shipments of oil and gas from the Middle East are interrupted, the Japanese industries will suffer. So they are very much looking forward to establishing other transportation routes and since Russia is close to Japan, it will suit the Japanese industries very well.\" In February Russia opened its first Liquefied Natural Gas or LNG plant on the Pacific coast. The plant supplies Japan also with millions of tonnes of gas annually. Author: Disha Uppal Editor: Grahame Lucas",

        "story": "Opposition to Kashgar Demolition Plans A plan to demolish the historical centre of Kashgar in China's westernmost Xinjiang region has drawn opposition from the Uyghur community, which makes up the majority of the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s population. According to the government, the buildings in the city centre are dangerous and thus need to be demolished and rebuilt. 900 families have been moved into government housing. Despite an influx of Han Chinese in recent decades, Kashgar is mainly populated by Turkic-speaking Muslim Uyghurs and other Central Asian groups that consider Kashgar as one of the cradles of their culture. According to the old city's demolition plan, 49,000 homes will be destroyed. Henry Szadziewski, the manager of the Uyghur Human Rights Project in Washington DC, expressed great concern stating that Kashgar is one of the centres of Uyghur culture. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe destruction of Kashgar old city would be a catastrophe for the maintenance of Uyghur traditions. Many of the residents of Kashgar have built their homes and their businesses in the same area. So moving them out of Kashgar old city to very regimented living arrangements, roughly eight kilometres way from the old city would also remove them from their livelihoods too,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. Attempt to assimilate Uyghurs into dominant Han Chinese culture Szadziewski also doubted the official explanation and assumed that this was a move by the Chinese authorities to assimilate the Uyghurs. Attempts to assimilate the minority group into the dominant Han culture date back to well before 1949. Gardner Bovingdon, an expert on Xinjiang politics at Indiana University in the United States, said the demolition of Kashgar\u00e2\u0080\u0099s old city showed familiar patterns and compared it to the destruction of the old Uyghur quarter in Xinjiang\u00e2\u0080\u0099s capital Urumqi, which he witnessed in the mid-1990s. He said that it was \u00e2\u0080\u009caimed at transforming neighbourhoods that were under Uyghur control into neighbourhoods that were more susceptible of police control which is generally Chinese control, more susceptible of scrutiny by the government and so forth. And I think those aims are important in Kashgar as well.\u00e2\u0080\u009d No open protests because of political oppression There was a lot of violent conflict in the region in the 1980s and 90s but public protest has declined recently. The demolition of Kashgar\u00e2\u0080\u0099s old city is only openly opposed by exiled Uyghurs. Gardner Bovingdon said that there might be some justification for arguing that a growing Uyghur middle class and economic growth in Xinjiang had satisfied some people in the Uyghur community but he thought that \u00e2\u0080\u009dthe more important explanation is that political oppression has increased in the region in the 2000s.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Some parts of the old city will be maintained for tourists Kashgar, a traditional trading point on the ancient Silk Road, has a long and interesting past with a history stretching over 2000 years. Its beautiful setting in a fertile oasis to the north of the Pamir Mountains and on the western edge of the Taklamakan desert, along with its ancient buildings has made it a major tourist attraction in Central Asia. Marco Polo recorded a visit in the 13th century. Chinese officials have commented that some parts of the old city will be kept for purposes of tourism but this will probably be only a very sanitised version like a kind of \u00e2\u0080\u009copen air museum,\u00e2\u0080\u009d feared Szadziewski. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is a pattern that we see in other places in China where old parts of cities are destroyed and then some pieces are left, so that tourists can benefit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d At this point, it is still unclear what exactly will take the place of Kashgar\u00e2\u0080\u0099s old city but its original Uyghur inhabitants will certainly not live there for much longer.

        "story": "Opinion: The biggest loser of the polls is Europe itself Europe has voted and not even half of the electorate bothered to cast their vote. That's shameful. So little commitment for the only democratically-elected institution of the European Union is alarming. The supranational parliament of 27 states is unparalleled in the world. But this unique chance doesn't seem to matter at all to most Europeans. It's not just lazy voters who are to blame for the debacle, European politicians are also largely to blame. As is normally the case, 27 national election campaigns were fought, with little evidence of any specific European election campaigns. At home politicians tend to lay into those politicians in Brussels, although they often share responsibility for decisions taken at EU level. In Eastern Europe's younger democracies the situation is even worse. There seems to be no comprehension of how important the European Parliament is in all areas of daily life. As in previous EU elections, governments are punished with only a few exceptions. The results of the European elections themselves point towards continuity. Victory for the conservative and center-right parties. The Socialists remain the second strongest force and the liberals stay the third strongest block. The Euro-sceptics and right-wing extremists might have caused uproar in a few countries, but they do not play a large role in the general make-up of the European Parliament. Even if they were to form into a parliamentary grouping, they do not have any major influence. EU Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso has even reason to celebrate. The conservative politician can remain in office for another five years, because it's usually the case that the Commission President comes from the same political family as the majority party represented in parliament. In the largest EU member state, Germany, it was the same story as in the rest of the EU. National topics dominated the scene. The election winners from the conservative CDU, the Left Party, the liberal FDP and the Greens declared the election a test for the federal polls in September. The election losers, the Social Democrats, though, dismiss any idea that Sunday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s outcome will affect the national vote. It's the same old story after every election. But because of the exceptionally low electoral turnout it is indeed hard to make a reliable prediction for Germany's upcoming national elections. One thing's for certain: The election loser is Europe, because far too many voters are not interested in European politics. Author: Bernd Riegert Editor: Andreas Illmer",

        "story": "War crimes spokeswoman on trial over Milosevic secrets A former spokeswoman for the tribunal set up to deal with Yugoslav war crimes was has gone on trial there herself. She is charged with contempt of court over the publication of classified information. Florence Hartmann, who was spokeswoman for the former chief war crimes prosecutor, Carla Del Ponte, between 2000 and 2006, is accused of having disclosed confidential information about the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in a book and an article published after she left her post. The publications allegedly cite confidential documents and court decisions made during the trial of former Serbian leader, Slobodan Milosevic, which implicate the Serbian state in the 1995 massacre of thousands of men and boys in the Bosnian town of Srebrenica. In his opening speech, ICTY prosecutor Bruce MacFarlane said he would show that the accused had consciously published information from classified documents. But Hartmann's lawyer, Guenael Mettraux, says she did no wrong as the information referred to in her article and her book, entitled \u00e2\u0080\u009cPeace and Punishment: The Secret Wars of Politics and International Justice\u00e2\u0080\u009d was already in the public domain when her work went into print. Online support The journalist's supporters, many journalists themselves, are running an internet petition which calls for the case to be dropped. They say Hartmann was merely doing her job \u00e2\u0080\u009cby rigorously searching for and publicizing the truth.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The petition goes on to say that making Hartmann appear before a court established to try those guilty of genocide \u00e2\u0080\u009cwill tarnish the image of the international justice system.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hartmann, who could face seven years in prison or a fine of \u00e2\u0082\u00ac100,000 ($139,000) if found guilty, declined to enter a plea on either charge. The court entered two pleas of \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot guilty\u00e2\u0080\u009d on her behalf. The trial is expected to continue until Wednesday. tkw/AFP/AP/dpa Editor: Jennifer Abramsohn",

        "story": "EU deplores recent events in Iran The European Union has released a statement expressing serious concern after the deaths of Iranian protesters and called on Iranian authorities to allow peaceful demonstrations. Iran's state media had announced that seven protesters were killed when a massive rally against the disputed re-election of Mahmoud Amhadinejad turned violent. A spokesman for the European Commission urged Iranian authorities to allow peaceful demonstrations in the country where civil unrest appears to have reached levels unseen since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. \"The commission is indeed very concerned,\" said spokesman Amadeu Altafaj Tardio. \"We regret the violence and the loss of life and we call on the Iranian authorities to respect the right to demonstrate in a peaceful manner. \"We underline the right to protest in a peaceful way, which must be respected by the Iranian security forces,\" he added. The Iranian Foreign Ministry summoned a senior European diplomat on Tuesday to complain about the EU's reaction to the fatalities in the capital Tehran. \"Neither the European Union nor other countries are in a position to have the right to make rude and interfering remarks against Iran, especially about our glorious election,\" the Foreign Ministry told the Czech charge d'affairs, Josef Havlas. A willingness to recount An Iranian state television broadcast said on Tuesday that the country's supervisory body, the Guardian Council, was ready to carry out a recount of some votes, and added that this could lead to changes in candidates\u00e2\u0080\u0099 tallies. But council spokesman Abbasali Kadkhodai rejected a call from the main opposition challenger, Mir Hossein Mousavi, to annul the vote. \"Based on the law, the demand of those candidates for the cancellation of the vote, this cannot be considered,\" Kadkhodai told state television. The results of the presidential poll have been met with fury by opposition supporters. On Monday night, hundreds of thousands of Mousavi's followers took to the streets to decry what they say was foul play at the ballot box. Iranian state radio said the 'illegal' rally turned violent towards the end, when a military post was attacked with the intention of looting the weapons inside. \"Illegal demonstration\" The broadcast said thugs taking part in the \"illegal\" demonstration in Tehran had \"attacked and vandalized a number of public and government buildings,\" in what it described as an \"organized and coordinated\" event. \"Unfortunately, seven of our citizens were killed and a number of them injured,\" the radio broadcast stated. A source told the AFP news agency however that the emergency services claimed eight had been killed and many more injured in the incident. An unnamed nurse at a city hospital said 28 people with bullet wounds had been brought in, and that eight of them had died. State television has since said that authorities have arrested the \"main agents\" in the post-election unrest, but it did not say how many had been detained. Planned protests Earlier, Mousavi's supporters announced plans to hold another rally on Tuesday, this time at the same central Tehran square where President Ahmadinejad celebrated his controversial re-election victory on Sunday. But following calls from hardliners loyal to Ahmadinejad for a counter protest in the same place just one hour earlier, Mousavi has appealed to his supporters to protect their lives by not showing up. A spokesman for Mousavi said the \"moderates' rally\" had been cancelled. But the pro-Ahmadinejad rally is expected to go ahead. An organization affiliated with the government was quoted on Iran's Fars news agency as saying it would be held \"in protest against the recent agitation and destruction of public property.\" Call for peaceful action Meanwhile the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s top dissident cleric Grand Ayatollah Hossein Ali Montazeri has appealed to opposition followers to act peacefully. He issued a statement to the \"noble and oppressed Iranian nation,\" in which he appealed to everyone, but especially the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s youth, to pursue their rights with \"patience and restraint.\" He said protesters should preserve the \"calm and security of the country and avoid any violence,\" adding that their presence at public demonstrations was a clear show of support for defeated presidential candidates in pursuit of the \"violated rights.\" tkw/sjt/AP/AFP/reuters Editor: Susan Houlton",

        "story": "Steinmeier calls on Syria and Lebanon to take part in Middle East peace process German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier is in Lebanon as part of a whirlwind Middle East visit centered on restarting negotiations in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Steinmeier congratulated Lebanon's new prime minister, Saad al-Hariri, and wished him success in forming a new cabinet, after talks between the two men in Beirut on Tuesday. His election was an encouraging sign of stability in the country, Steinmeier added. Steinmeier said that he and al-Hariri \"agreed that we must use the opportunities presented by US President Barack Obama\" in furthering the Middle East peace process. The German foreign minister arrived in Lebanon for a three-hour visit after meetings in Syria and Israel. Steinmeier and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad were not able to come to an agreement on resuming contact between Israel and Syria during their talks in Damascus, along with Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem. \"Syria has an objective interest in the success of the Middle East peace process,\" said Steinmeier, \"and I call on Syria and also my counterpart Mr. al-Moallem to do its part.\" Contact between Israel and Syria was suspended after Israel's military offensive on the Gaza Strip this past winter. Al-Moallem reiterated that Syria would not give up its claim on the Golan Heights, which Israel has occupied since the Six Day War in 1967. Steinmeier specifically named Hezbollah as an obstacle to the peace process. The Lebanon-based organization relies on Syria for some financial support. The talks were also meant to focus on the issue of human rights in Syria, as the European Union has promised to support Damascus in its efforts to improve its infamous record. Steinmeier said he would call on Syria to continue its trend of openness, which he said had improved in recent months. Another hot topic is Syria's close relationship with Iran. During meetings with Israeli President Shimon Peres on Monday, Steinmeier was given harsh words to pass on in Syria. Peres asked Steinmeier to tell Syrian President Bashar al-Assad that, if Damascus continued to have such close ties with Iran, Israel would hesitate to return the Golan Heights to Syria. Talks in Israel Steinmeier had traveled to Syria from Jerusalem, where he'd met with the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, on Monday. The German foreign minister welcomed Netanyahu's recent acceptance of the need for a two-state solution and called the removal of road blocks restricting the movement of Palestinians in the West Bank a \"small start.\" He added that the \"road to stability in the entire region leads only through talks with the Palestinian side. My personal conviction is that a guarantee for stability can only come through the realization of the two-state solution.\" Reciprocity Netanyahu had initially balked at the idea of openly supporting the two-state solution, but finally made a public endorsement of a demilitarized Palestinian state in a June 14 policy speech, following intense pressure from the US and Europe. Despite this, Netanyahu had refused to accept demands for a complete freeze of construction in Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank, which the Palestinians along with nations including Egypt and Jordan, have made a condition for any resumption of peace negotiations.

        "story": "Hertha Berlin are hoping cleverness can make up for lack of cash Money=transfers=success. That's the football formula last season's fourth-placed team is trying to disprove. DW-WORLD's Jefferson Chase looks at whether Hertha Berlin can solve a tough equation. There won't be any record signings in the German capital this summer. In 2008-09, Hertha Berlin broke out of the mid-table doldrums and earned more points than ever before, but if you think that would be cause for a spending spree, you don't know Hertha's books. The \"old lady,\" as the club is known, is bent on reducing its personnel costs by five million euros ($7 million). That's led to the departures of the squad's two top strikers, Marko Pantelic and Andriy Voronin, and the consensus choice for the Bundesliga's best defensive player last year, Josip Simunic. In fact, Hertha only have around 25 million euros in total for players - significantly less than one-third of what Real Madrid paid to pry Cristiano Ronaldo from Manchester United. Conventional wisdom would say that Hertha are heading for a precipitous fall this autumn. But the club thinks it can build on last season's success and balance the books - thanks to a new general manager, a no-nonsense strategist as a coach and at least one very unorthodox acquisition. Second chance for King Artur Hertha's main move thus far - other than selling Simunic for seven million euros - is to bring back one of the most reviled former players in recent years: striker Artur Wichniarek. The Polish forward spent two hapless years in the capital from 2003 to 2005, scoring just four goals in 44 appearances. Hertha have chosen to ignore that bleak bit of the past for two reasons: Wichniarek's record at his former club Bielefeld is impressive - 83 goals in 207 matches - and he's keen. King Artur's lack of success in the capital reportedly gnawed at him so much that he was willing to fork out a quarter of a million euros of his own money to buy himself out of his Bielefeld contract and take another crack at conquering Berlin. Hertha also have two promising but largely untested young forwards - Valeri Domovchiyski and Armine Chermiti - who they hope can make quantum leaps in 2009-10. But the weight of expectations - and the habitual skepticism of Hertha's supporters - will be on Wichniarek, who ended his last tenure in Berlin in utter acrimony and whose return was only made possible by the departure of a former enemy. Hoeness out, Preetz in Hertha's first move of the off-season was to oust Dieter Hoeness as its long-time general manager. When the former Bayern striker came to the club in 1996, it was struggling to stay in the second division. Under Hoeness, Hertha quickly established itself in the top flight and once even qualified for the Champions League. But Hoeness came under increasing pressure for some expensive transfer flops (chiefly Brazilian strikers) and for his propensity to make grandiose pronouncements in the media. The fact that impecunious Hertha were willing to part with a million euros to get him to resign in June is a sign of how much the club wanted him gone. Hertha's all-time leading goal scorer Michael Preetz has taken over, inheriting both Hoeness' achievements and some 25 million euros in debts that he racked up while trying to heave Berlin into the upper echelons of European soccer. During his career on the pitch, Preetz was known as an efficient, but also affable and intelligent player so there's reason to believe he can be convincing with potential signees. But more importantly, he gets on well with the man who has now been given unprecedented power to form the squad - coach Lucien Favre. Lulu's baby In only two seasons with the club, \"Lulu\" Favre has completely remade Hertha. Only five players remain from the squad he took over in 2007, and the Swiss coach has focused on building up a multi-talented, young midfield. Serbian Gojko Kacar and Brazilians Cicero and Raffael in particular impressed last season, scoring 19 goals between them. Manchester United are rumored to be keeping Kacar under observation and are said to believe that the 22-year-old all-rounder is worth at least 12 million euros. Hertha also reportedly turned down a 10-million-euro offer from French side Olympique Lyon for Raffael. Basically Hertha believe that with that trio, plus German national defender Arne Friedrich and rock-steady keeper Jaroslav Drobny, the squad has a solid core capable of improving next season. And Favre's insistence that his charges be capable of playing multiple positions means that he's better able to compensate for injuries and suspensions than most coaches. Still, expectations are one thing, and results another, and many teams have been burned when younger players didn't make the progress their bosses envisioned for them. If Hertha are able to maintain or surpass their level of play last season while cutting the budget, it will solidify Favre's argument that he is building a team of the future. But if the goals don't come up front, or the back four folds without Simunic, or the midfield trio stagnates, Hertha could find itself having to borrow some money in mid-season just to stave off collapse.

        "story": "A face with wrinkles and blemishes: the moon is aging with dignity The moon is more than 4 billion years old and people used to think there were large areas of water as well as lunar species. But there are no settlements yet and the moon's \"seas\" are bone dry. The Earth's satellite looks really old. It's turned completely grey and its face is marked with numerous wrinkles, stains and scars. It's visible: it's been through a lot in its lifespan. But given it's been around for some 4 and a half billion years, the moon has aged with dignity. Getting a facelift is out of the question. And it's not even necessary \u00e2\u0080\u0093 as every four weeks during the new moon phase, the moon is veiled in darkness and can't be spotted from earth. We can see many big dark and lighter areas on the face of the moon. This is due to the varied landscape on its surface. Some people see a face up there, others claim the pattern looks like a hopping rabbit. At the time of astronomer Galileo Galilei, the first observers looking through their telescopes euphorically baptized the dark spots \"maria\" - the Latin word for the seas. They imagined huge bodies of water sloshing about what poets called the \"watery planet\", and they imagined a very special lunar species living on the moon. All that has become legend, and although astronomers still talk about \"maria\", it's quite clear that the moon is dry as a desert. Just like an old bookshelf, the moon is covered in thick dust. Today, it has completely congealed. However our celestial companion looks back at a very turbulent past. In the first billion years of its existence, just like Earth, it was exposed to a tremendous bombardment. Leftover debris from planet formation was abundant, and huge meteorites and whole asteroids were colliding with the surface. Even today, the numerous craters on the moon bear witness to the dramatic impact. The biggest craters gradually filled up with liquid lava and welled up from what then was the hot liquid core of the moon. So the dark spots on the moon are actually due to volcanic activity. And the maria of the moon probably came about roughly 3 billion years ago. That's when the worst bombardment with space debris was over, which is why there are relatively few craters in the maria. The lighter-coloured regions of the moon are called \"terrae\", or more commonly just highlands, since they are higher than most maria. The soil samples collected by the Apollo space missions are evidence that once upon a time there was indeed volcanic activity on the moon. It's still unclear though how the lava reached the surface of the moon. Possibly it came up through cracks created by the impact of meteorites in the craters. Even the first scientists observing the moon have come up with colorful names for the maria, full of longing for the supposedly paradisiacal conditions on the moon: there are for instance, a sea of mirth, of nectar, of crisis, of clouds and also a 'mare fecunditiatis', or the sea of fertility. However, the most well-known dark spot in the near side of the moon \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the right eye in the moon's face \u00e2\u0080\u0093 is called mare tranquilitatis, or the sea of tranquillity. That name is an obvious misconception because four and a half million years later the lunar peace has well and truly been disturbed. On July 21, 1969, Neil Armstrong took his famous first step on the moon right in the sea of tranquillity. Author: Dirk H.Lorezen (ara) Editor: Neil King",

        "story": "Fires rage across Spain's Canary Islands Thousands of people have been evacuated on Spain's Canary Islands to escape forest fires sweeping across the islands of La Palma and La Gomera. Fire fighters and the military are trying to bring the flames under control. The fires raged for the second day on Sunday, devastating thousands of hectares of pine forest on the popular holiday island of La Palma. Around 4,000 residents and tourists had to flee their homes and were moved into a temporary shelter. Around 30 homes and several wineries have been burned down. Some 500 firefighters, forest rangers and military personnel, including from neighboring islands, were called in to deal with the fires. Spanish air force planes and helicopters are also involved in efforts to bring the blaze under control. The flames were fanned by strong winds and were spreading on several fronts while a fresh outbreak was detected on the smaller island of La Gomera. Spain has seen temperatures soar to well over 30 degrees Celsius. The fire has struck at the height of the holiday season \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the archipelago off the Atlantic coast of northern Africa entirely depends on tourism. Local authorities said they hoped to bring the blaze under control on Sunday. Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero is expected to fly to La Palma later in the day to oversee efforts to tackle the fire. Since the the start of this year, at least eight people have been killed by fires in mainland Spain. Fires have ravaged some 75,000 hectares of land, almost double the number as for the whole of 2008. ai/AFP/AP/Reuters Editor: Sonia Phalnikar",

        "story": "Franco-German \"war child\" granted German citizenship The son of a French woman and a German Wehrmacht officer, 66-year-old Daniel Rouxel on Wednesday became the first Franco-German \"war child\" to be granted German citizenship. The French retiree was granted German citizenship at a ceremony at the German consulate in Paris. Rouxel said the event helped to ease a lifetime of rejection and humiliation in a country whose wartime occupation remained a taboo topic for a long time. \"I'm German. I'm not a bastard any more. I'm a child like all the others. At last I've got the second half that I was so cruelly missing,\" Rouxel said. \"Children of the Boche\" Around 200,000 children were born between 1941 and 1945 as a result of liaisons between French women and occupying German troops. At the time, Nazi rules prohibited marriage with French natives - unlike with Norwegians or Dutch who were deemed to be \"Aryan.\" So the affairs were secret and often ended abruptly when they were discovered. After the war, the mothers were humiliated or sent to jail amid a flood of anti-German hostility. Their children were derided as \"children of the Boche\" - an abusive term for Germans. They were often left to struggle alone with the psychological effects of humiliation, rejection, persecution and ostracism. A figure of hate Rouxel's story was no different. He was born in Paris in 1943 during the World War II occupation. His mother worked in the canteen of the German airbase in the Brittany town of Pleurtuit where his father, Lieutenant Otto Ammon, was stationed. Ammon was killed during the Allied liberation of France and after the war, when his mother could no longer cope with raising him, Rouxel was taken in by his grandmother in a small Breton village. As the illegitimate son of the former enemy, Rouxel was a figure of scorn. He was forced by his own grandmother to sleep in a chicken coop and publicly mocked by local officials. Rouxel detailed his accounts in a book published in 2004 in France on the long-neglected generation of Franco-German war-children. Growing up in the Breton village of Megrit in the 1950s, Rouxel remembers the mayor making him stand up in front of the parishioners outside church one Sunday. \"Which one of you knows the difference between a swallow and a Boche?\" the mayor asked. I'll tell you. When the swallow makes its babies here in France, it takes them with it when it leaves. But the Boche - he leaves his behind.\" The incident left its mark on Rouxel. \"I cried a lot. I was only six years old and already I wanted to kill myself,\" he wrote. \"Symbolic significance\" For a long time, officials in both Germany and France refused to address the plight of war children. Recently, the two countries - which are now close allies - signed an agreement to recognize the children's parentage. Earlier this year, Germany said it would be generous in processing the claims by war children for dual citizenship. \"That's an honor for me whose father - a German - was an enemy,\" Rouxel said at the time. \"I idolized him as a child.\" But French historian Fabrice Virgili said he doubted whether the war-children generation - many of whom are well into their 60s - would apply for German citizenship. Virgili said for many of them the gesture was largely symbolic. sp/afp/ap/dpa Editor: Kyle James",

        "story": "Berlin continues to spin its wheels over Opel's future The tug-of-war over European carmaker Opel seems set to continue after talks between Opel's troubled parent company General Motors and the German government ended inconclusively on Tuesday. General Motors' chief negotiator, John Smith, was in Berlin Tuesday to talk about the future of Opel. GM reportedly used the meeting to assure the German government Tuesday that it still may sell Opel, an unnamed German government source told the Associated Press. Yet other media reports that GM is looking for ways to hold onto Opel after all. The Wall Street Journal said that General Motors' new board of directors has ordered management to consider new options for Opel, including finding three billion euros ($4.3 billion) in funding to overhaul GM's European operations rather than sell them. The newspaper cited three unnamed sources familiar with the matter as saying that GM Chief Executive Frederick \"Fritz\" Henderson had been instructed to prepare a new financial plan ahead of the US carmaker's next board meeting in early September. Meanwhile, The Financial Times reports that GM is exploring ways of securing funding from the British, Spanish and US governments in a deal its source described as \"feasible if complex\". A leading German labor representative said he hopes General Motors will make a decision about the future of Opel by Wednesday morning. Armin Schild, the leader of the IG Metall union in the state of Hesse, where Opel has its headquarters, said the fact that GM's options for Opel had come to light ahead of an official announcement means that they may be under serious consideration. \"I see that as a bad sign for the future of Opel,\" Schild told German public television station ZDF. Magna rejection The reports follow a meeting last Friday in which GM's board rejected Henderson's recommendation that Opel be sold to a consortium consisting of Canadian auto parts manufacturer Magna, Russian state-owned lender Sberbank and Russian carmaker GAZ. The move was an embarrassment to the German government, which has offered to throw 4.5 billion euros ($6.4 billion) worth of financial support behind the Magna bid. Lawmakers and unions fear that the rival offer from Belgian-based investment group RHJ International could lead to widespread job losses in Germany, which is home to about half of GM's 55,000-strong European workforce. But GM's board is reported to be wary of the Magna deal because it could see valuable technological know-how end up in the hands of its Russian competitors. Meanwhile, the absence of a foothold in Europe could harm the GM in the long run by leaving the company overly dependent on North American and Chinese markets. Sale or no sale, German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck suspects that GM favors the RHJ bid because managers in Detroit aim to maintain control of Opel in the long term. \"My impression is that some people at the heart of GM management prefer the RHJ International offer because it would make it easier to buy back Opel in a few years time,\" Steinbrueck told the Handelsblatt financial newspaper. \"Magna, in our view, has a clear industrial strategy, not just a plan for short-term gain and that is why the government will not give any financial aid to RHJ,\" he said. \"Aid will only be given to Magna.\" sje/dpa/AP/Reuters Editor: Chuck Penfold/Trinity Hartman",

        "story": "Vaccination timetable unclear as swine flu spreads Failing to reach agreement over funding the German government's plan to launch mass vaccinations remains riddled with uncertainties. Experts point to the new drugs' unknown side effects as another problem. The number of swine flu cases in Germany has risen by several hundred since the beginning of the week and now stands at close to 15,000 the Robert-Koch Institute reported on Wednesday. The institution officially in charge of recording the outbreak in Germany added that most new infections were caught by people travelling abroad. Faced with the growing extent of the swine flu outbreak in Germany, the federal government last week decided to launch the largest mass immunization program in the nation's history. Vaccinations are expected to start in October when sufficient serum is available, a Health Ministry spokeswoman said. Federal and state governments are aiming at obtaining a total of 50 million doses from drug company GlaxoSmithKline. Since every person has to be vaccinated twice, this would be sufficient for 25 million people. Delays due to unclear funding But, state health ministers, who have failed to reach agreement on how to pay for it, have not yet been able to place necessary additional orders, as planned. Public health funds will foot half the bill estimated at about one billion euros ($1.45 billion), but states and the federal government have not decided on how to split the remainder between them. As a result, vaccinations for all but the most vulnerable groups, such as children and pensioners, will only start in late fall. Health ministers are planning to hold a special meeting in Berlin in two weeks before placing the additional orders stalled so far. Side effects feared Experts are concerned about yet another problem due to the massive extent of the operation and the short time available for drug companies to develop and test substances against swine flu. \"We may have to reckon with a larger number of previously unknown side effects\", warned the Germany Association of Pediatricians (BKJV). A federal medical institute also pointed out that side effects like headaches or swellings may be more likely with vaccines against swine flu compared to those against seasonal flu viruses. The Health Ministry does not deny this and Minister Ulla Schmidt last week said she would not recommend vaccinating children until all medical studies have been completed. Another risk lies in the different methods of developing substances in Europe and the US, Wolfgang Becker-Br\u00c3\u00bcser told the German newspaper \"Muenchner Merkur\". The Munich-based medical journal editor said that US labs use common flu vaccines and adapt them to deal with the new virus. \"This method is safer compared to what the Europeans and Germany are doing\", he added. The latter's substances are based on the much less tested vaccine against bird flu. rri/Reuters/AP/dpa/epd Editor: Mark Mattox",

        "story": "Lights out for the incandescent light bulb? The Dutch town of Eindhoven is where the Philips brothers first began mass-producing light bulbs. Today though, the company is pursuing technologies they say will make the good old light bulb a thing of the past. The Philips brothers began producing the first light bulbs in a small brick factory in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, in 1887. The site is now home to a museum, where visitors can find out everything about the history of lighting. During the daily guided tours, visitors can see, for example, how workers made the carbonized cotton thread filaments encased in a bulb of glass. Philips became the world's biggest maker of light bulbs, and it turned Eindhoven into a city of light. Today, the company continues to be a pioneer in the field of lighting. But new developments promise to make the old-fashioned light bulb go the way of the horse and cart. \"Its fate is sealed,\" said Niels Haverkorn, strategic marketing director for light at Philips. \"The future belongs to LED lights and OLED lights - semiconductor light from light diodes.\" Four big advantages In light-emitting diode or LED bulbs, more than 50 percent of the energy is converted into light. In the case of energy-saving light bulbs, only 25 percent is converted into light, while the normal light bulb converts just 5 percent. Another advantage is that, in addition to dimming the light, consumers can also choose the color of the light to suit a certain atmosphere. Turn on a sunny yellow light while vacuuming, for example, or cozy red to accompany the evening meal. For designers, the tiny LED light sources also open up new possibilities. They can be more flexible when experimenting with forms and materials for lamps. But perhaps most importantly, an LED lamp burns 50 times longer than a normal light bulb: 50,000 instead of a mere 1,000 hours. The table lamp from Philips' new Ledino series, for example, looks like a shiny silver high-tech oyster that's just starting to open. And the new Daywave desk lamp is packed with special features, says Haverkorn. \"It adjusts to the amount of daylight and doesn't disrupt people's biorhythms, so people can work more efficiently,\" he said. Surround lighting The next step will be OLED, an extension of LED technology (the 'O' stands for organic). Although it's still in the beginning stages, OLED technology has the ability to be embedded in fabric, meaning that your rug, sofa or curtains could be transformed into light sources. \"Lamps will become obsolete,\" said Haverkorn. \"Light will be more like daylight, it'll come from everywhere.\" First though, the estimated 24 billion lamps worldwide equipped with standard light bulb fixtures would have to be scrapped. And besides, LED technology, though quite advanced, is not perfect. It's still relatively expensive, and sometimes, it's not strong enough. To replace a 75-Watt light bulb, for example, you're still better off with an energy-saving bulb. They're now available in all sizes, with different lighting effects, including dimmers. Those who want to stick with the classic light bulb shape can now opt for the Philips Retrofit bulb. It still looks like the good old light bulb, it fits in all the old fixtures, but it gives off LED light. The cost is between 20 and 40 euros ($28 - $57). \"But for that, it's environmentally friendly, it gives off a wonderful, warm light, and it'll burn for 50 years!\" Haverkorn said.

        "story": "Romania's shaky coalition government collapses Romania's center-left coalition government has collapsed after a group of Social Democrat ministers resigned in protest over the firing of the country's interior minister. After months of an uneasy cohabitation with its centrist Liberal Democrat (PDL) partners, left-leaning Social Democratic Party (PSD) leader Mircea Geoana said on Thursday that nine ministers from his party had quit the government \"in solidarity\" with Interior Minister, Dan Nica. The move ends the shaky nine-month tenure of a coalition consumed by bickering and corruption allegations just before presidential elections scheduled for November 22. Nica was fired by Prime Minister Emil Boc on Monday over comments he made about potential fraud in the run-up to the November poll. Nica's comments were widely interpreted as an accusation that Boc's Liberal Democrats might try to cheat to get President Traian Basescu re-elected. As an interim solution, Nica was replaced by Development Minister Vasile Blaga, who is the PDL campaign chief and a close ally of Basescu. Geoana has blamed the president for the crisis, saying \"nothing was sacred\" to him to ensure he wins another term in office. Coalition had a whole laundry list of problems Divisions between the PDL and PSD have festered since the beginning of the year after the Social Democrats accused President Basescu of interfering in the government decision-making process. Also in January, the PSD's interior minister, Gabriel Oprea, resigned in a dispute over the appointment of an intelligence officer considered too close to the coalition partners. In February, the newly appointed Liviu Dragnea quit the same post, citing insufficient funds allocated to his ministry. In September, Prime Minister Boc threatened to fire the leftist education minister unless she withdrew a controversial decision to allow political appointments in the education sector. Boc said the decision contradicted principles of newly adopted IMF-mandated legislation to reform the country's ailing education system. At the same time, the Social Democrats slammed massive job cuts planned by the government as part of a 20-billion-euro ($29 billion) IMF aid package, saying it would oppose the implementation of such a move. PSD support for parliamentary inquiries investigating PDL ministers Monica Iacob-Ridzi for fraud and Elena Udrea for abuse of power prompted the centrists to ask the PSD whether they wanted to be in government or in the opposition. As it stands now, with the presidential election in November, voters will have the option of sending a signal on which party should do what. gb/dpa/AFP/Reuters/AP Editor: Michael Lawton",

        "story": "Berlin's ex-finance chief probed for controversial immigrant remarks Thilo Sarazzin, Berlin's outspoken ex-finance chief who sparked outrage by making disparaging remarks about the capital's Arab and Turkish populations, is being investigated for suspicions of inciting racial hatred. A spokesman for the state prosecutor's office in Berlin said on Friday that investigators were looking into comments made by Sarrazin in an interview this week, criticizing certain immigrant groups in the German capital for not being productive enough. \"The authorities are examining whether the transcript of the interview crossed limits on free speech and whether there are initial suspicions for a crime,\" the spokesman told news agency AP. Sarrazin, an executive board member of Germany's federal bank, the Bundesbank, told magazine Lettre International that Berlin's large Arab and Turkish populations were unwilling to integrate and worsened the city's considerable economic problems. \"A large number of Arabs and Turks in this city, whose number has grown through bad policies, have no productive function other than as fruit and vegetable vendors,\" Sarrazin, 64, told the quarterly magazine. Citing Berlin's high jobless rate compared to the national average, he said part of the city's problems lay in the fact that 40 percent of births were among the \"lower class\". He also took aim at what he called a \"slob factor\" in the capital. \"I do not need to accept people who live on handouts from a state they reject and who are not adequately concerned about the education of their children, and constantly produce new, little headscarf-clad girls,\" he said. \"That goes for 70 percent of the Turkish and 90 percent of the Arab population of Berlin.\" Far-right party applauds comments The comments have triggered a storm of outrage across Germany. \"This is outrageous,\" Kenan Kolat, who heads the Turkish Association in Germany, told news agency dpa. Uwe Foullong of the Ver.di trade union called the comments \"scandalous\" and \"extreme right-wing.\" Sarrazin, a member of the Social Democratic Party (SPD), also faces calls for his expulsion. \"After these comments, Thilo Sarrazin can no longer be tolerated in the party,\" Eva Hoegl, a SDP member of the Berlin state parliament told newspaper Rheinische Post. Gerhard Schick, a parliamentarian from the Green Party told the newspaper Frankfurter Rundschau that Sarrazin had damaged the reputation of the Bundesbank with his controversial comments and had clearly violated the bank's rules of conduct. The Bundesbank issued a statement saying it distanced itself resolutely from Sarrazin's \"discriminatory remarks.\" Sarrazin said in a statement on Thursday he regrets the comments and did not mean to insult anyone. His remarks have however been applauded by the far-right NPD party. The party said that Berlin's former finance chief \"had hit the nail on the head when it came to Germany's development as a country.\" No stranger to controversy It's not the first time Sarrazin has stirred controversy with his outspoken comments which earned him the nickname \"Rambo.\" The belligerent 64-year-old established a reputation for criticizing the habits and slovenliness of Berlin's lower class during his seven-year term in political office in the city. At one point, he complained about people wandering the streets all day in jogging pants, and his department published a document demonstrating that the unpopular unemployment benefit known as Hartz IV still provided more than enough money for a well-balanced diet. sp/AP/dpa Editor: Andreas Illmer",

        "story": "Czech court keeps Europe waiting The Czech Republic's highest court said it will deliver a ruling next week on a complaint filed by Czech senators against the European Union's Lisbon Treaty, which could hold up reform of the unwieldy 27-member bloc. The Czech Constitutional Court heard the case Tuesday and will likely announce its decision on Tuesday, November 3, according to secretary-general of the court, Tomas Langasek. The proceedings at the Czech Constitutional Court have stirred intense international interest because the Lisbon Treaty, designed to streamline the administrative and decision-making processes in the EU, hangs in the balance. The Czech Republic is the only country yet to ratify the treaty. Without its signature, the European Commission, the EU's executive body, would be in legal limbo and unable to fill appointments set to expire at the end of this month. \"Only when we have legal clarity about the (Lisbon) Treaty can we decide about the new top posts in the EU,\" said Sweden's Minister for European Affairs, Cecilia Malmstrom, whose country currently hold the rotating EU presidency. The group of Czech senators who filed the complaint say the treaty undermines national sovereignty and is at odds with the Czech constitution. Czech President Vaclav Klaus has also been very critical of the treaty, demanding an \"opt-out\" clause with regard to the EU's human rights charter. Klaus has said that if the treaty were approved as is, it would allow ethnic Germans, expelled under the Benes Decrees in postwar Czechoslovakia to reclaim their property and file damage claims. Slovakia now eager to have the same privilege The move by the Czechs has led neighboring Slovakia to demand a similar opt-out. Foreign Minister Miroslav Lajcak on Monday said his country \"would insist on the same political and legal protections as the Czech Republic\" because it shares the same post-World War II law that deported millions of ethnic Germans and Hungarians from then-united Czechoslovakia. Most legal experts say the Czech court, which has already rejected one challenge by the Senate, will throw out the senators' appeal. It could issue a ruling on Tuesday, or take longer to do so. Czech Prime Minister Jan Fischer, who would like to see the Lisbon Treaty ratified, said on Monday that he did not expect the final ruling until later. Rejection of the appeal would give President Klaus the legal authority to sign the Lisbon Treaty. He cannot sign before the ruling. However, if the court accepts the appeal, the Czech constitution would have to be changed to allow ratification.

        "story": "German students protest university reforms Students throughout Germany are protesting reforms to the country's university system. But Germany's education minister says the changes will go ahead as planned - preferably sooner rather than later. German university students staged demonstrations across the country on Thursday to protest recent reforms to the country's degree system and tuition fees. They also complain that colleges are underfunded and understaffed. By 2010, Germany will follow the Bachelor-Master-Doctorate format as part of the Council of Europe's Bologna reforms, aimed at synchronizing Europe's higher education standards. But critics say the new system will be too intense, as the time to complete one's degree will be shorter. \"The students are protesting against the workload that results from this more condensed course and fear that a bachelor's degree will not be enough when entering the job market,\" said Susanne Schilden, a spokeswoman for the German Rectors Conference, a group representing 265 of the country's 300 universities. Demonstrators, who occupied lecture halls in 20 German cities, including Berlin, Hamburg and Munich, also said they want tuition fees to be scrapped. Police evicted around 200 protesters from a university lecture hall in Tuebingen. Inspiration from Austria Since 2005, German universities have been allowed to charge tuition fees, which now run between 100 to 500 euros ($150 to $750) per semester. \"No one can force an academic reform against the will of the students,\" a statement from the Munich students said. \"Therefore we call for rights of co-determination for all decision-making processes that affect studies at the university.\" Education Minister Annette Schavan has called for Germany's 16 states to quickly implement the planned reforms. \"The students need a clear signal that the corrections that have been decided are being incorporated into the academic system,\" Schavan told broadcaster Suedwestrundfunk. The demonstrations began on Wednesday. They were inspired by student protests in Austria that have been underway for the past three weeks. There, too, the students are protesting against the Bologna reforms as well as plans to introduce tuition fees and to limit admissions to certain courses of study. vj/AFP/dpa Editor: Nancy Isenson",

        "story": "Bhopal Gas Leak: 25 Years on Shortly after midnight on December 2, 1984, the Indian city of Bhopal witnessed the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worst industrial disaster. Toxic fumes escaped from a pesticide factory owned by the US firm Union Carbide Corporation and engulfed the homes of thousands of residents, killing many in their sleep. As many as 3,000 people died in a single night - over 22,000 in the days and years that followed. 25 years later, the catastrophe in Bhopal is far from over. While survivors still have to cope with the long-term effects of being exposed to the gas, the disaster also has consequences for the city's newer residents. A few kilometers away from the city centre in Bhopal, an abandoned factory lies in ruins. This factory, formerly owned by the US-based firm Union Carbide Corporation, gave off toxic fumes on the night of December 2, 1984 which killed over 3,000 people. Today the factory premises are unused. In 1989 a controversial court ruling cleared the firm of all liability with regard to the incident. For residents living in the slums nearby, the sight of the derelict factory is a constant reminder of the disaster that hit them on a dark night 25 years ago. Satinath Sarangi, the director of the Sambhavna Trust Clinic for gas victims, says the impact of the catastrophe is still there for all to see. \u00e2\u0080\u009cToday, in many ways the conditions are worse than how it was on the morning of the disaster. More than 100,000 people are suffering from chronic illnesses related to the toxic gas exposure. Then there are tens of thousands of children born to gas-exposed parents with a range of growth and developmental disorders. And also in the last 25 years people who lost their health also lost their ability to work and earn a livelihood, which has meant starvation conditions for thousands of families, because the government has not provided any kind of economic rehabilitation support.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Groundwater pollution But it is not just through the long-term effects of gas-exposure that the repercussions of the disaster are being felt. The Union Carbide Factory in Bhopal dumped thousands of tons of toxins at the site. The poison continues to pollute groundwater and thus expose the residents to still more danger. In an official statement on the disaster put up on its website, Union Carbide maintains that it has spent two million dollars on clean-up efforts at the site. Yet a study released on December 1 by an independent research organisation, the Centre for Science and Environment, shows that groundwater at and near the factory site contains almost 40 times more pesticides than the average for India. Soil and water samples taken in areas as far as 3 kilometres away from the site show harmful substances including heavy metals like mercury and chromium in high concentrations. The residents of nearby slums use hand pumps or bore wells to extract their drinking water from the ground. It is of course heavily contaminated and is having a negative impact on health, says Ram Bai, a resident of the area. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor 25 years we have been drinking this polluted water, we have no access to clean water,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Ram Bai. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are constant illnesses here. That is why we demand our right to clean water. We have lived most of our lives, but we want to secure a better future at least for the children now being born here.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Birth defects among newborns The high level of chemicals present in the water is leading to a rising number of birth defects in new-born children. This can be witnessed even among people who moved to Bhopal after the disaster and were not exposed to the harmful gas. According to Satinath Sarangi of Sambhavna Trust, more children are born with developmental defects in this area than in any other comparable population. Yet an alternate source of water is still not available. In 2004, the Supreme Court of India directed the state government in Madhya Pradesh to provide clean drinking water to the settlements near the factory site. Now a water pipeline has been built, but local activists say the water does not reach all of the settlements on a regular basis. Moreover, some of the slum-dwellers have been told it is a private water supply and that they have to pay to use it. Outside the premises of the Union Carbide factory, women have gathered to shout slogans in protest at the conduct of the Madhya Pradesh state government. A few days ahead of the 25th anniversary of the disaster, the state government went so far as to deny that there was any toxic contamination at the site. The women in these settlements now want the world to know that while the catastrophe may have occurred a long time ago, their struggle for basic rights like health care and clean drinking water is far from over.

        "story": "Climate activists receive Alternative Nobel Prizes An award for activism, dubbed the \"alternative Nobel prize\" has been awarded to four individuals for their work in fields such as climate change, medicine and preventing deforestation. Four activists were awarded the 2009 Right Livelihood award in the Stockholm parliament on Friday for \"offering practical and exemplary answers to the most urgent challenges facing us today.\" The so-called \"Alternative Nobels\" have been awarded since 1980. David Suzuki of Canada won an honorary award for \"his lifetime advocacy of the socially responsible use of science,\" as well as his contributions to highlighting the issue of climate change. He expressed concerns before the awards ceremony that the imminent Copenhagen conference would result in a contract emphasizing economics over the environment. \"The worst possible thing would be a half-hearted agreement,\" he told the dpa news agency, saying it was better to work for a better deal next year. \"We have partied as if there is no tomorrow, using things up and throwing them away without regard to the future,\" Suzuki said on Thursday. \"Well, the party's over and we have to sober up, clean up our mess, assess our situation and get on with acting for a future.\" He also admitted doubting the Canadian government's commitment to dealing with climate change, saying that Ottawa \"would try to prevent any hard targets and time frames and enforcement mechanisms.\" Prize winning activism Other laureates honored were Rene Ngongo, of the Democratic Republic of Congo, who won for his courage in establishing conservation efforts for the rainforests of the Congo. \"Climate change is the biggest threat our planet has to face right now,\" Ngongo said. \"The world must act now - if not, we risk suffering from growing and irreversible disturbances that will exceed our capacities to adapt.\" New Zealand's Alyn Ware won for his work promoting peace education and campaigns against nuclear weapons. In Ethiopia, Australian-born Catherine Hamlin, was awarded the prize for her 50 years of work dedicated to treating obstetric fistula patients. Co-winners Ware, Hamlin and Ngongo are to receive 50,000 euros ($73,000) in prize money. sjt/dpa/AP Editor: Sean Sinico",

        "story": "Fake medicines inundate EU market The EU's outgoing industry commissioner warns that the bloc has been swamped by spurious pharmaceutical products. Guenter Verheugen is calling for steps that will criminalize offenses and protect potential victims. The Industry Commissioner said in an interview published in the German daily Die Welt on Monday that the trade in counterfeit medicines in the European Union had exceeded the body's worst fears. Guenter Verheugen said the EU had seized fake tablets worth millions within a short period of time. \"In just two months, the EU seized 34 million fake tablets at customs points in all member countries. This exceeded our worst fears,\" he said. He told Die Welt that antibiotics, cancer treatments and Viagra were among the counterfeit medicines. Other fake drugs seized included anti-malaria medicines, analgesics and anti-cholesterol treatments. Verheugen is Germany's commissioner to the European Union and will hold the portfolio until commissioner-designate Antonio Tajani of Italy is approved and takes office early next year. Verheugen said the European Commission, the bloc's executive arm, was very concerned about the situation, adding that he expected the EU to take action to fight the menace of fake pharmaceutical products. \"The number of counterfeit medicines arriving in Europe ... is constantly growing. The European Commission is extremely worried,\" Die Welt quoted Verheugen as saying. An EU report in July said that many of the fake pharmaceuticals seized in 2008 came from India. Call to criminalize Verheugen said counterfeiting drugs should be treated as a serious crime and punished severely. \"Every faked drug is a potential massacre,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, adding: \"Even when a medicine only contains an ineffective substance, this can lead to people dying because they think they are fighting their illness with a real drug.\" The outgoing EU commissioner expressed optimism that there would be progress in tackling the problem of fake medicines in the coming year. \"I expect the EU will agree in 2010 that a drug's journey from manufacture to sale should be scrutinized carefully. There will also be anti-counterfeit markings on packaging \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in particular a barcode and seal, to show clearly if a package has been opened,\" he said. In June, EU health ministers gave a warm reception to a legal proposal aimed at stopping fake drugs entering the legal supply chain. The plan included stepped-up security measures on packaging, including barcodes, seals and holograms, as well as tighter controls on suppliers. Some analysts have welcomed the proposal, saying it could help to better regulate distributors. rb/AFP/AP/dpa Editor: Kyle James",

Members of Deutsche B\u00c3\u00b6rse AG, the company that runs the stock exchange, are due to discuss the proposal of introducing the TecDAX to the current market system on Tuesday. If the integration is agreed upon, the new indices will be launched on March 24. TecDAX to showcase technology companies The TecDAX, which will track the 30 largest equities, will offer companies from the technology sectors greater exposure and it is hoped it will contribute to an economic recovery for Germany. Volker Potthoff, the Deutsche B\u00c3\u00b6rse executive board member responsible for the cash market, said in an official press release: \"The new index completes the new equity market segmentation with which we are creating the highest transparency standards in Europe and thus making investors the focus of market organization.\" Current Nemax index will offer support Once the TecDAX is up and running, a parallel calculation of the Nemax 50, the current index for the 50 largest equities in the technology sectors, is expected to continue until the end of 2004, in order to maintain continuity for financial products already based on this index. While the DAX will be unchanged, Deutsche B\u00c3\u00b6rse will differentiate between those companies below the DAX. For the companies from classic sectors, it will calculate the MDAX index, a senior index of companies, which is being reduced from 70 to 50 equities. The SDAX will continue to comprise 50 equities as the selection index for smaller firms ranked immediately below the MDAX. Skepticism from financial professionals Professionals from the financial sector are skeptical about the new TecDAX market and its worth. \"I can hardly believe that this new market index sector will bring a real change,\" said Eberhard Weinberger from analysts Dr. Jens Erhard Kapital AG. \"First, you must develop better frameworks in Germany, then that will be the time for big decisions.\" The air of caution may be justified. The B\u00c3\u00b6rse's New Market, its equivalent of the Nasdaq index, failed to make an impact and lost almost all of its value over a two-and-a-half year period. Germany's stock exchange operator announced the New Market's closure in September 2002 and planned an early 2003 timetable for it to be absorbed into the main market, along with the small-cap SMAX segment.",

        "story": "Germany aims to make 2006 World Cup \u00e2\u0080\u009cGreen\u00e2\u0080\u009d Germany's World Cup organizing committee has launched a \"Green Goal\" campaign that promises to make the 2006 soccer championships the most environmentally friendly sporting event ever. At a press conference in Frankfurt on Monday, former national team captain and president of Germany\u00e2\u0080\u0099s World Cup organizing committee Franz Beckenbauer and German Environment Minister J\u00c3\u00bcrgen Trittin unveiled their vision for a tournament with little negative impact on the environment. \"The whole world will be watching Germany during the World Cup, so we also want to be a role model for the environment,\" said Beckenbauer, adding the effort will promote environmental management in four key areas: water, refuse, energy and transportation. \"Green Goal - the path to a sustainable 2006 FIFA World Cup\" will be backed by the German government, soccer's world governing body FIFA and members of the German business community. The organizers of the World Cup in Germany have set aside \u00e2\u0082\u00ac300,000 ($326,900) for ecological investment; a figure matched by a government sponsored environmental foundation. \"I congratulate the organizing committee on its decision to meet a wide range of environmental concerns with its 'Green Goal' initiative,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Trittin. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is an example of teamwork and tactics at its best. We will set new standards in the environmental sphere via a series of concrete measures.\" Water demand will be immense Resources will be under pressure to deal with demands for drinking water, utilities and irrigation, as fans from the 32 participating countries flock to Germany for the month-long competition. The stadiums used for matches will require alone approximately 42,000 cubic meters of water. Concrete measures designed to deal with this demand include increasing the proportion of water reserves derived from rain. Organizers intend for ecological sources to provide 20 percent of total water used at the tournament. Plans are also in place concerning the regular maintenance of appliances and pipe work to make the water delivery system more efficient. Refuse from food and drink sales is a problem for any major event. With visitors to the 2006 World Cup expected to number in the hundreds of thousands, the \"Green Goal\" operation considers the potential trash problem as top priority. As a result, spectators can expect to use reusable cups and china or plastic dishes rather than throwaway paper plates. This will be strongly enforced at every stadium involved in the tournament scheduled to begin on June 9, 2006. The \"Green Goal\" initiative also hopes to reduce the current energy consumption at the stadiums by 20 percent during the tournament by exploiting energy-saving potential. EnBW AG, one of three 2006 FIFA World Cup official energy suppliers, will supply electricity derived from renewable sources. Tougher targets In a statement, Germany's environment ministry stressed the importance of setting specified targets for water and energy use: \"These are more stringent than usual because, unlike the Olympic Games, the event will be spread across 12 cities in Germany and will generally have to rely on stadiums which already exist.\" In a bid to cut down on the effects of pollution from the exhaust fumes of cars and private vehicles making their way to the venues, the organizers are pushing an efficient and regular public transport network in the cities hosting games throughout the tournament. The target is that at least half of all visitors should arrive at the matches via public transport, compared with a current average of 40 percent for German first division soccer games. Despite the controls outlined by organizers, the 2006 World Cup is still likely to generate an estimated 100,000 tons of greenhouse gas emissions in Germany. In an attempt to address the most demanding goal of reducing negative effects on the global climate, these emissions will be balanced by investment in environmental protection in other areas.",

        "story": "Flu-Like Disease Has European Business on Edge European trade fair organizers, tourism companies brace for economic impact as SARS disease death toll rises. The phones have been ringing off the hook at travel offices run by the German company Rewe. Ever since the first reports of deaths in Southwest Asia and Canada linked to the flu-like disease SARS in Februrary, Rewe travel offices and company spokesmen have been seeking to calm harried would-be tourists. Company spokeswoman Antje G\u00c3\u00bcnther said there have been some cancellations and re-bookings but many more questions. \"We don't want to give any predictions,\" G\u00c3\u00bcnther, a spokeswoman for the trading company's tourism wing. \"It's something we need to measure day to day, week to week. The sickness isn't simple. You can't say it will be cured tomorrow and then Monday everything will be back to normal.\" Scientists from the World Health Organization travelled to Hong Kong on Thursday to determine the origin and cause of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). So far, the disease has killed 80 people and infected more than 2,300 people in 18 different countries, including a 72-year-old German man who was reported on Thursday to be in stable condition. As Europe braces for a potentially devastating economic impact, everyone from soccer teams to trade fair organizers are on edge. Trade fair bars Asian exhibitors Switzerland's health authorities have barred around 400 Asian exhibitors from a watch and jewelry trade fair that opened in Basel on Thursday. A spokesman for Germany's international Hanover Fair, which begins on Monday, April 7, says it has no plans to do the same. \"We survive on our worldliness, and just because there's some sort of flu in Asia, that doesn't mean we're going to bar the Asians from Hanover,\" Eberhard Roloff, the Hanover Fair's spokesman, told DW-WORLD. Roloff said the Fair has had no cancellations from Asian exhibitors. In fact, the number of exhibitors from Asian countries has increased from 409 last year to 565 in 2003. \"Unpredictable\" sickness keeps visitors away Visitors to Asian countries, however, have begun rethinking their trips. The Everton soccer club, of England's Premier League, is mulling whether or not to cancel a two-game tour in China planned for May 25-26. Ditto for cycling's governing body, the UCI. The body is talking with International Olympic Committee on whether to cancel the for August planned track championships in the southern China province of Shenzhen. The Goethe Insitut, Germany's cultural outreach organization, has put staffers in Asia on high alert but has yet to pull anyone out. The German Foreign Office has posted travel warnings to Germans heading to Hong Kong and the southwest Guandong province. The warnings, added to already in-place warnings to Northern Africa and the Middle East, are likely to further dampen a travel industry that's already suffered by the outbreak of war in Iraq. Dutch airline KLM said this week that SARS has had a more dramatic effect on its passenger count than the Iraq war. A spokesman said that in particular business passengers have cancelled trips because of fears surrounding the virus. German flagship airline Lufthansa said it was grounding additional planes rather than face the possiblity of running empty flights to Asia. G\u00c3\u00bcnther is concerned the SARS scare could do more damage to the entire travel industry than Iraq ever could. \"The war in Iraq was predictable and in some way measurable,\" G\u00c3\u00bcnther said in an interview with DW-WORLD. \"This came as a complete surprise and nobody knows how long it's going to continue and how much it will spread.\"",

        "story": "More Money than the Nobel Prize Germany is well-known for its many past scientific achievements, but today it struggles to keep up with international research. But two new science awards are leading researchers back to German labs. Ten years ago German immunologist Joachim Schultze started working at Harvard Medical School in Boston. Like many top German scientists, he had been lured to the United States because of the good conditions for research including excellent funding. And Schultze likely would have stayed at Harvard if he hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been awarded one of 43 research stipends worth a total of around \u00e2\u0082\u00ac36 million ($39 million). Now he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s back in Germany carrying on with his cancer research at the University of Cologne. Schultze and others have profited from two new German research prizes: the Wolfgang Paul award for scientists from abroad and the Sofja Kovalevskaja award for young scientists. Both were awarded for the first and only time in the autumn of 2001. The money for the awards came from the sale of German third-generation moblie phone licenses in 2000, which added \u00e2\u0082\u00ac50.5 billion to the government's coffers. The Alexander von Humboldt Foundation and the German Federal Ministry for Education and Research awarded the stipends, which were meant to finance years of scientific research in Germany. Individual prize-winners received up to \u00e2\u0082\u00ac2.3 million, twice the amount that Nobel prize-winners take home. Aims met Expectations were particularly high for the prize-winners, said Humboldt Foundation spokesman Florian Krebs. He said the first year and a half had been very successful. Russian physicist and Wolfgang Paul award laureate Alexei Khokhlov has also pleased with the results. The award has fulfilled its aim of introducing new prospects for research at German universities, he told DW-WORLD. With his prize-money Khokhlov has been able to establish a project dealing with research into polymer physics -- which deals with materials made up of large molecules -- at the University of Ulm. Khokhlov says one of Germany\u00e2\u0080\u0099s weaknesses in science is that universities can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t pick and choose their students. Instead institutions of higher learning, the vast majority of which are public, are obliged to accept any applicant with a German high school diploma. Undeserved reputation Germany doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t deserve its reputation as a bad place for science, said immunologist Schultze. But changes are necessary. For one, universities need not all have the same capacities, he says. He recommends the development of \"centers of excellence\" like in the United States with world-class universities like Harvard, Stanford and Yale. And Schultze points out that German scientists still have to learn a lesson their American colleagues figured out long ago: it pays to advertise. He said scientists should start using public relations to draw attention to their own high level research. Though Germany may never be able to compete with the United States for research funding, the new awards may just convince a few more scientists like Schultze to leave Boston for the likes of Cologne.",

        "story": "Europe Salutes Mideast Summit as 'Historic' First Step The Mideast Summit concluded on Wednesday with pledges from Israel and the Palestinians to support the international road map for peace. Europe applauded both sides\u00e2\u0080\u0099 commitment to the plan, but questioned its own role. In a historic meeting in the Jordanian coastal town of Aqaba on Wednesday, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and his Palestinian counterpart Mahmoud Abbas agreed to implement the so-called road map for peace as drafted by the Middle East quartet. European leaders lauded both sides\u00e2\u0080\u0099 commitment to the plan and expressed gratitude to United States President George W. Bush for his success in bringing Abbas and Sharon together. During the summit, Sharon said he was prepared to accept an interim Palestinian state and to dismantle \"illegal\" settlements in occupied Palestinian territories, but cautioned this could only happen if the Palestinians made inroads in stopping terrorism. Abbas, for his part, vowed that his government would \"act vigorously\" to end violence against Israel and pressure those militant groups who attack Israel to renounce terrorism. \"A historic chance\" German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer praised Sharon, Abbas and Bush, who spearheaded the one-day summit, for their \"courageous efforts\" in putting aside their differences and returning to peace talks for the first time since the process collapsed in 2000. \"Israelis and Palestinians are called upon to use this historic chance to create peace and security for both people,\" Fischer said Wednesday evening. \"Both conflicting parties have made important steps on the road to peace,\" he added, while warning that the will to peace should not be undermined by extremists. \"Terror and violence must end,\" he urged. Speaking on behalf of the German government, Fischer vowed to support the renewal of the Middle East peace process with all his country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strength. The foreign minister has been actively involved in the European Union\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attempts to bring Israel and the Palestinians back to the negotiating table. In April he met with Sharon and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to discuss efforts to speed up the adoption of the international road map to peace. Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s role in Middle East The road map, which was hammered out by the so-called Middle East quartet comprising of the United States, United Nations, the European Union and Russia details a series of steps aimed at creating a Palestinian state by 2005. What role the European Union is expected to play in the future of the peace process, however, seems to be a matter of discussion as the U.S. takes charge of the negotiations. Prior to the summit in Aqaba, France saluted the United States\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \"re-engagement\" in the Middle East, but insisted Europe must not be excluded from the negotiations. Speaking on Europe 1 radio on Wednesday, French Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin stressed, \"The road map means the quartet -- that is the U.N., Russia, the U.S. and the EU. And the EU has played a full role in recent months. It must continue to do so. To make peace succeed, everyone must act together.\" Lest the other players in the quartet forget what the EU brings to the negotiation table, the minister emphasized Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strengths in the region. \"Europe has a powerful influence. It is Israel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s main economic partner,\" he said. \"It is the biggest aid donor to the Palestinian territories. This is a strength. Let us use our strengths together.\" \"Everyone must act together\" Earlier in the week, French President Jacques Chirac alluded to EU plans to draft a new parallel \"road map\" for the Middle East to include Syria and Lebanon. The plan, which allegedly has the approval of EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana, is scheduled to be introduced at the European Union summit in Greece on June 20. If not carefully orchestrated, such actions could run up against Washington\u00e2\u0080\u0099s renewed interest in leading the peace talks. Although the U.S. has not come out with any comments to the contrary, it has also not specifically mentioned what role the EU would play in implementing the Israeli-Palestinian road map. One point of consternation between the two quartet players is Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s insistence on maintaining contact with Palestinian leader Arafat despite objections from the U.S. \"They [the Europeans] are going to, for their own political reasons, meet with Arafat. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s their choice. We basically say we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a good idea,\" a senior official traveling with Bush in the Middle East told Reuters. Both Israel and the U.S. have refused to deal with Arafat, who has been largely confined to his Ramallah headquarters since the recent wave of violence erupted in December 2001. European leaders, however, see Arafat as wielding a significant influence in the Palestinian territories and say he must be encouraged to work with and not against the quartet.",

        "story": "European Press Review: Where is the U.S. in the Middle East? European newspapers on Wednesday lamented the recent surge in violence in the Middle East and called on the U.S. to play a pivotal role in stopping it. Just one week after Israeli and Palestinian leaders at the historic Aqaba Summit pledged to work towards peace, the situation in the Middle East again spiraled out of control as violence erupted. On Wednesday, a suicide bomb detonated in Jerusalem, killing 16 people and injuring 80. Israeli troops retaliated in the Gaza Strip, killing 9 suspected members of the Hamas organization. European newspapers, commenting on the never-ending violence, said it is time for the United States to take a more active role in bringing about peace in the region. It is now up to U.S. President George W. Bush, as Italy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Il Messaggero put it, to take the initiative and make the next move. Condemnation and expressions of shock are no longer enough, the paper warned. De Volkskrant from the Netherlands wondered how far Bush will go if Sharon stays on his collision course. It will not be enough, the paper maintained, merely to urge both sides to stick to the peace plan. Britain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s The Independent noted that the aim of Hamas is to provoke Israel at every turn\u00e2\u0080\u0094and sadly, they have once again succeeded. But the Israeli actions, the paper continued, will not succeed in suppressing the terrorists and securing national security \u00e2\u0080\u0093 they never have, and they never will. The cycle of violence in the region seems set to resume, the paper lamented. It also said the United States should play a pivotal role, and that President Bush must use all his country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s political and financial leverage to keep Sharon on the road map to peace. The editors for Liberation from France were of the same opinion. President Bush should not hesitate to exert more pressure on Israel. The U.S. President must, the paper wrote, force Israeli Prime Minister Sharon to hold back despite further Palestinian bombing attacks. And, the paper added, Bush must apply pressure to the Arab world to throw its entire political weight behind Palestinian Prime Minister Abbas\u00e2\u0080\u0099 government, and oppose armed groups. The Daily Mirror also regarded Sharon as the stumbling block on the road to peace. The London tabloid said President Bush is faced with two choices: He must now decide whether he wants to give up his peace plan or take the obvious alternative step, and demand a change in the Israeli leadership to bring the peace he and the rest of the world want. Austria\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Kurier turned its attention to the situation in Afghanistan following the latest attack on German troops there. For a year now, the paper noted, Hamid Karzai has sat in the President\u00e2\u0080\u0099s palace, surrounded by U.S. bodyguards\u00e2\u0080\u0094but his influence hardly reaches further than the city limits. But even in the capital, one is not entirely safe. If there is an attack, the paper said, western politicians are quick to point a finger at al Qaeda. Observers believe this is meant to calm people, but what is reassuring about the idea, the paper wondered, if the enemies are still alive and kicking?",

        "story": "European Press Review: It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s All Greek To Me European newspaper editors led on Friday with editorials on the EU\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Thessaloniki summit and the growing problems American and British forces are having maintaining order in Iraq. With the leaders of the European Union meeting at a major summit, newspapers in European capitals on Friday commented on the major political issues being discussed at in Thessaloniki, Greece, as well as the hangover facing U.S. and British troops in Iraq. London\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Financial Times looked at British Prime Minister Tony Blair\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposals for EU immigration policies and noted: \u00e2\u0080\u009cBack in 1999 EU states set themselves the goal of creating a common system of asylum, now a common European approach is being attempted towards some of the roots of the refugee problem which of course lie outside the Union.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And who is leading the approach, the paper asked? \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is none other than Britain which during the 1990s in the name of national sovereignty fought German efforts to bring the EU into asylum policy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d According to the paper, the reason for the switch was obvious: \u00e2\u0080\u009cBritain has replaced Germany as the largest single EU destination for asylum seekers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d France\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Le Figaro focused on the first formal talks on a European constitution taking place at the Greek summit. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAn EU constitution will make the cooperation between member states much easier in many fields,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the paper said. It also saw a further opportunity arising out of the summit, suggesting: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAfter the conflict about the war in Iraq not only do transatlantic relations have to be redefined, it is even more important for the EU states to formulate a common position towards Washington.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Commenting on claims that the U.S. and Britain exaggerated the threat posed by Saddam Hussein\u00e2\u0080\u0099s weapon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arsenal before the war, the Italian daily Corriere Della Sera noted that the opponents of the war also made mistakes. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey predicted millions of refugees and hundreds of thousands of dead,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the paper wrote, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthey spoke of legions of guerrilla fighters who would join Hussein\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Republican Guards and they repeatedly predicted that the ordinary people would rise up.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But none of these fears ever came true, the paper pointed out. The Munich-based S\u00c3\u00bcddeutsche Zeitung noted that there was one aspect that might endanger the Bush administration even more than Saddam\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vanished weapons of mass destruction \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and that is Iraqi resistance that is leading to the murder of American soldiers almost every day. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFirst, American troops are to be worn down and therefore provoked to take ill-considered actions against civilians. Secondly, back in the U.S., doubts are to be planted about why young American men and women must risk their lives for a people that seems to be so ungrateful,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the paper wrote. Finally, the paper said the Iraqi resistance was pursuing a third goal: It wants to keep alive fear of Saddam and the revenge he will take if he returns. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is not a coincidence,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the paper concluded, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat the resistance carries the name \u00e2\u0080\u009cAl Auda\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the return.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The editors of Strasbourg\u00e2\u0080\u0099s La Derniere Nouvelles D\u00e2\u0080\u0099Alsace had an altogether different take. The resistance, they concluded, is not pursuing any precise military goals; nor is it comprised of fanatic adherents to Saddam\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Baath Party. Instead, the paper wrote, the attacks by Iraqi resistance fighters against U.S. troops is merely a result of the prevailing anarchy in the country and the hostility of the Iraqi population toward the occupying powers.",

        "story": "Germany's Bankrupt Cities to Get Some Relief The federal government plans to relieve cash-strapped German cities like Berlin and Frankfurt by introducing more taxes. Everything from services to swimming pools has been cut during the financial crisis. Frankfurt will close its ballet in 2004. One of Berlin's four major opera houses is also on the chopping block. The financial crisis both major cities find themselves in is being repeated ad infinitum across Germany, where swimming pools and day-care centers have been shut down over the summer months because of a lack of money. Now Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00c3\u00b6der wants to do something about it. Following a meeting with top politicians and his economic and finance ministers during his vacation in Hanover Monday, word leaked out that Schr\u00c3\u00b6der planned to relieve the financial burden of Germany's cities to the tune of more than \u00e2\u0082\u00ac4.5 billion ($5.1 billion). More taxes for business, self-employed Though details of the plan have yet to be formally announced, news reports suggested the government would close tax loopholes open to big business and distribute a large portion, some \u00e2\u0082\u00ac854 million in 2004 according to one report, of the value-added tax paid to the federal government each year to the cities. The government would also introduce an occupational tax for freelancers and self-employed. That, together with existing plans to role the social and welfare benefits the city pays its unemployed into one payment, should significantly ease the burden, government members told reporters Monday evening. Opposition politicians, who did not take part in the meeting with members of Schr\u00c3\u00b6der's coalition government, greeted the plan with suspicion. The general secretary of the conservative Christian Democratic Union told German television that the tax on freelancers and self-employed was especially curious. \"We can't punish\" those who are carrying the burden, Meyer said. No investment, more on the dole After years of expansion and building in German cities, the country's communities find themselves in a downward spiral. Less investment is coming in, meaning lower economic output. Fewer people are paying taxes and more are on the dole. In the past ten years alone, investment has dropped by \u00e2\u0082\u00ac11 billion, according to the German Association of Cities and Communities (DStGB). The most glaring example is the capital. Thanks to a corrupt former government and the collapse of a bank, Berlin is in debt to the tune of \u00e2\u0082\u00ac40 billion. Streets have become endless construction sites, where the money to complete the work has run out. Swimming pools have closed in the heat of summer, and fountains are drying up. \"If these developments continue like this and aren't stopped, then we'll have to cut a major part of these services,\" said Gerd Landsberg, of the DStGB in a radio interview. \"We will make clear that politicians\" have a responsibility.",

And the show's organizers, Igedo, said they expect the final tally for visitors will be in the region of 60,000. Low fashion profile Despite its no-frills image, Germany has produced a handful of internationally renowned fashion designers, such as Karl Lagerfeld, Jil Sander, Wolfgang Joop and Hugo Boss. And firms like Escada, Bogner, and Strenesse have enjoyed international repute for decades. But while fashion plays an important role in daily life in Germany, especially for young people, the attitude differs from that of classic haute-couture countries such as France and Italy. In Germany, high fashion does not have the status of a stand-alone cultural asset, like art, literature or architecture. Thus, some of the hottest young German designers, such as Dirk Sch\u00c3\u00b6nberger, Markus Lupfer, and Bernhard Willhelm, choose to work abroad. \"Germany is not a classic fashion country,\" says Peter Paul Polte, editor-in-chief of the textile industry magazine Textilwirtschaft (Textile Industry.) \"But German companies know a lot about marketing and production.\" Fashion exports According to cpd statistics, Germany is the largest and most important market for textile and apparel manufacturers in Europe. In 2000, Germany ranked as the third-largest textile importing country after the United States and Hong Kong. In 2001, German textile and apparel imports amounted to almost \u00e2\u0082\u00ac30 billion ($34 billion). As an exporter, Germany ranks fifth, after China, Hong Kong, Italy and the United States, with total exports of \u00e2\u0082\u00ac19.5 billion in 2001. Yet as with so much else having to do with Germany's economy, the picture is not entirely rosy. In 2002, the German textile and clothing industry had turnover of some \u00e2\u0082\u00ac23.9 billion , of which clothing accounted for \u00e2\u0082\u00ac9.6 billion \u00e2\u0080\u0093 down some 8 percent from the previous year. This year, with the economy faltering, fashion is once again on the ropes, with overall sales some 5 percent lower for the first five months of the year, from the same period last year, according to the Associated Press. D\u00c3\u00bcsseldorf, with its fashion trade fairs (in addition to cpd, there is a shoe trade fair and an international beauty fair,) supports 1,400 fashion-related businesses with a total turnover of about \u00e2\u0082\u00ac13 billion. The K\u00c3\u00b6nigsallee, or K\u00c3\u00b6, is one of the great shopping streets of Europe, lined with upscale designer boutiques. Fashion capital moves to Berlin? While industry insiders hope the fair will give German fashion sales a boost, D\u00c3\u00bcsseldorf officials simply hope the cpd will remain in their city. Since the wall came down in 1989, Berlin has steadily been securing its place as the country's culture capital, with increasing numbers of events moving there from smaller cities. Recent press reports suggested that the cpd may be the latest big trade fair to do so, but Harald Schartau, the economy minister of the state of North Rhine Westphalia (of which D\u00c3\u00bcsseldorf is the capital) denies it. D\u00c3\u00bcsseldorf will remain Germany's fashion capital, Schartau told the DPA news agency. \"The (cpd) benefits from a unique environment, from the many (locally)-based textile and clothing companies, designer-oriented shops and retailers, fashion centers, showrooms and order rooms, and a network of creative workers in advertising, design and fashion,\" he said. Yet even if cpd stays in D\u00c3\u00bcsseldorf, German fashion's cutting edge may already belong to Berlin. The BREAD & butter trade fair, showing \"urbanwear and street couture\", used to be in Cologne but moved to Berlin this year. And the \"No Dress?!\" public show in Berlin is a hot venue for small, innovative labels promoting young talent.",

        "story": "New Belgian Leader Gets Nod from Parliament Belgian members of parliament gave a vote of confidence Saturday to an incoming coalition government led by Flemish Christian Democrat Yves Leterme, sealing the end of a nine-month political crisis. The 97-48 vote, with one abstention, in the lower chamber of deputies, was not unexpected, with the coalition partners -- the Flemish and francophone Liberals and Christian Democrats, plus francophone Socialists -- in favor. Leterme, 47, succeeds Flemish Liberal Guy Verhofstadt with a mandate that should in theory run until 2011 -- but which could well be abbreviated, as his own party has set a July 15 deadline for more powers to be given to Flanders. \"That deadline will be respected,\" Leterme told parliament Saturday, a day after he and his 15-member cabinet were sworn into office by Belgium's King Albert II after protracted negotiations with other political groupings. Uniter, not a divider? Leterme has his work cut out to persuade Belgium's francophones -- concentrated in Brussels and the southern Wallonia region -- of his ability to unite the country in the wake of general elections back in June 2007. Flanders, home to Belgium's Dutch-speaking majority, craves more regional powers to reflect its prosperity. It also resents the dollops of euros it now pays to subsidise the poorer, French-speaking Wallonia region to its south. \"I fear grave institutional chaos\" if the government falls in July, said the new employment minister, Joelle Milquet, leader of the francophone centrists, adding that the danger of Belgium splitting into two nations was now \"real.\" For the international community, such a possibility would be serious, given that both the European Union and NATO are headquartered in the capital Brussels. The new prime minister has promised to raise pensions and offer tax cuts for low earners although government revenues have been lower than expected. His plans have come under increasing scrutiny by the opposition and the media. Leterme -- who once confused Belgium's anthem with that of France and failed in two previous attempts to form a government -- fueled inter-communal anger in 2006 by suggesting that French-speakers were incapable of learning Dutch.",

        "story": "Data Watchdog Questions EU's Controversial Fingerprint Plan A potential scandal over infringements on privacy rights has surfaced in Brussels after it was revealed that the EU is considering launching a fingerprinting drive which would involve citizens as young as six years old. The plans to add fingerprints to the new European passports and store them in a centralized database was launched in Brussels on Oct. 18 by EU Justice, Freedom and Security Commissioner Franco Frattini, the just as European leaders gathered for an important summit in Lisbon, the dpa news agency reported. But after Peter Hustinx, the head of the European data protection watchdog [EDPS], announced the watchdog agency's concerns on Thursday, march 27, EU officials worked to calm fears over the potential for privacy infringements. Hustinx's main concerns focus on controversial plans to fingerprint children as young as 6 years old and elderly people who would be physically unable to provide theirs, as well as the creation of a centralized database, which would hold a copy of fingerprints belonging to all EU citizens. Civil liberties advocates fear that such a database could be violated and used for criminal purposes. EU defends plan to fingerprint children Frattini's office on Thursday rejected calls for the 6-year-old exemption limit to be raised to include children under the age of 14 so that it may be brought \"in line with international practice,\" arguing that the measure was needed to prevent child-trafficking. Officials also said they were willing to address Hustinx's concerns about the centralized database and respond within \"a matter of weeks.\" \"We have just received the comments, and we want to take them serious,\" said Friso Roscam Abbing, Frattini's spokesman. \"Creating big databases poses data-protection challenges, nobody will deny it. However, precisely because we are aware of those challenges we will do everything that is needed to address them ... and ensure that we are taking duly into consideration all legitimate data protection concerns.\" Brussels claims citizens no longer hold concerns Officials in Brussels also argued that a growing number of EU citizens no longer fear being likened to potential suspects simply because their fingerprints are taken, noting that biometric data of this kind has become increasingly common, for instance as an added security measure in laptops. Slovenian Interior Minister Dragutin Mate, whose country holds the rotating presidency of the EU, acknowledged to reporters that the proposal will likely encounter difficulties when it is due to be discussed by the European Parliament and by member states.",

        "story": "Record Number of Germans Moving Abroad Despite an improved economic situation, more Germans relocated outside the country in 2007 than in any year since reunification in 1990, raising concerns over a demographic crisis in the near future. Figures released on Monday, May 19, by the Federal Statistics Office showed that 165,180 German citizens migrated elsewhere last year, an increase of nearly 10,000 from 2006. The top destinations were Switzerland, the United States, Poland and Austria. A total of 111,291 Germans returned from abroad in 2007, resulting in a net loss of 53,889 citizens, the third straight year in which more Germans have left the country than returned. Both the number of Germans leaving the country and the net loss of German citizens were the highest since reunification in 1990, adding to concerns that Germany is heading towards a demographic crisis. Population experts have long been warning that Germany's ageing, shrinking population will be detrimental to Europe's largest economy in future. Population dropped for fifth year in a row The Statistics Office reported that, with a net total of 101,691 foreigners moving to Germany last year, there was a net gain from migration of 47,802. Additionally, the country saw its first increase in the number of births in a decade, with some 690,000 births recorded. But these numbers combined were not enough to offset the estimated 825,000 deaths in 2007. Overall, this resulted in a drop in the German population for the fifth straight year. Experts have predicted that the German population could fall to as low as 69 million in 2050 from some 82 million today.",

        "story": "World Bank Spends Billions to Allay Food Crisis The World Bank on Thursday, May 29, launched a new $1.2 billion program to get emergency aid to countries suffering from global food shortages and surging prices. The new program will get at least $200 billion (128 billion euros) in grants to the poorest countries worst hit by the high cost of food, which the UN and World Bank have said is threatening to reverse nearly a decade of successes in reducing global poverty. Grants totalling $25 million were approved Thursday for Haiti, Djibouti and Liberia -- the first under the new facility. Haiti and others have suffered riots and even the dismissal of its government over food shortages. Another 10 countries have made requests for grants. The remaining $1 billion will be divided up through a mixture of grants and loans in a streamlined process that effectively bypasses the usual votes required by the bank's board of member countries. Plans to step up food production World Bank President Robert Zoellick said developing nations -- especially in Africa -- are seeking immediate resources for projects that could drastically increase food production, such as buying seeds and fertilizers for the upcoming harvest season. \"These initiatives will help address the immediate danger of hunger and malnutrition for the two billion people struggling to survive in the face of rising food prices,\" Zoellick said in a statement. Total World Bank support for agricultural programs will increase to $6 billion in 2009 from $4 billion in 2008, the development bank said. Zoellick said he will push for a clear action plan at a UN meeting in Rome from June 3-5 to tackle the food crisis and provide poor countries with immediate support. \"We don't need to reinvent the wheel. These leaders are asking for action now,\" he told reporters in a conference call from Japan.",

Meanwhile, Chirac still faces corruption accusations. Chirac will officially inaugurate the foundation at a ceremony in Paris on Monday, June 9, together with supporters like former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan and Nobel Peace Prize winner Mohammad Yunus. \"In the face of major world challenges, I still want to fight,\" said Chirac last week in an interview with the French daily Le Figaro -- his first public interview since leaving office last year. \"The foundation is the perfect tool for this. \"I want to stir and awaken consciences.\" Named after the 75-year-old former president, the foundation has begun half a dozen projects since it was legally established in March with a one-million euro ($1.57 million) endowment and a small staff. The endeavors focus on providing access to clean water and medicine, combating deforestation and preserving dying languages. Chirac is to announce the next set of projects on Monday. Under investigation The inauguration event marks a rare public appearance by the former head of state, who has been battling corruption allegations since losing his presidential immunity last year. He is under suspicion of embezzling city funds for political purposes during his time as mayor of Paris between 1977 and 1995. Last November, he was placed under formal investigation, a major step toward full criminal charges. Chirac denies the allegations.",

        "story": "Goalkeepers Could Be Key in Germany-Turkey Semi-Final Turkey may have stolen the show from Germany when it comes to fighting spirit at Euro 2008, but the Germans could still win their semi-final date because they appear to have the better goalkeeper. Jens Lehmann has defied the critics with good showings when it mattered, while Turkey have to cope with the suspension of Volkan Demirel and the erratic performance of his replacement Rustu Recber. Both men have spent long periods of the past season on the substitutes' bench, Lehmann at England's Arsenal and Recber at Fenerbahce. The 38-year-old Lehmann has risen to the occasion when it mattered, playing solidly in Germany's 1-0 win over Austria and also in Thursday's 3-2 quarter-final success against Portugal. \"The bigger the pressure the better Jens becomes. The last games showed that,\" said Germany goalkeeping coach Andreas Koepke. \"I didn't see Jens as critically as others. We have seen other goalkeepers make errors here. Jens was very strong against Austria. He played a very, very good match against Portugal. He is playing the way we expected him to do and is also a team leader.\" Lehmann has seemingly calmed down as the tournament progressed. He met the German media in a very aggressive mood at the start of Euro after criticism of his showings in tune-up games. In contrast, he was very relaxed earlier this week. Experience isn't everything While Lehmann only became Germany No. 1 ahead of the 2006 World Cup, Rustu's biggest moment was the third-place finish with Turkey at the 2002 World Cup. He is now only in goal owing to Volkan's red-card suspension and put in a mixed performance in the quarter-finals against Croatia, when he won his 117th cap. Rustu looked like he might be the villain of the piece when his blunder allowed Ivan Klasnic give Croatia the lead in the 119th minute, but Turkey levelled through Semih Senturk. Rustu ended up as the hero in the penalty shoot-out when his save from Mladen Petric clinched the upset in Vienna. \"Rustu is very experienced but not always good,\" said Germany defender Arne Friedrich of the 35-year-old. Rustu has said he will retire from the national team after Euro. Many in Germany expect Lehmann to do the same and give way to a younger man. New blood in training Currently, 30-year-old Robert Enke from Hanover and Bayer Leverkusen's Rene Adler, 23, are in the frame to continue Germany's tradition of great goalkeepers. Koepke readily admitted that the future was at stake and Enke and Adler were training hard in the Euro 2008 camp in case Lehmann gets injured. \"Both are doing a really good job. No one knows what happens after Euro. This is about positioning as well for after Euro -- and to be fully fit if something happens to Jens,\" said Koepke.",

        "story": "New Italian Law Grants Immunity to Premier Berlusconi Italy's lower house of parliament has passed a bill that will grant immunity to Premier Silvio Berlusconi, who has had his share of run-ins with the law over corruption allegations in connection with his media empire. The bill got 309 yes votes from lawmakers, with 236 opposed and 30 abstentions. The adoption of the new law is a victory for Berlusconi, who began his third round as prime minister in April. The bill gives legal immunity from prosecution to the president, prime minister and the speakers of the two chambers of parliament while in office, and is now expected to become law in record time when it advances to the Senate in late July. Judges and much of Italy's left-wing opposition opposed the law, which will suspend any statute of limitations to a case until the defendant leaves office. Italian Justice Minister Angelino Alfano said that the bill was a \"response to the need of those in the highest positions of state to work in serenity.\" Opposition leader Walter Veltroni, whose Democratic Party voted against the bill, commented last month that \"Berlusconi is in a big hurry on these matters,\" while the billionaire's lawyer Niccolo Ghedini said the prime minister was \"under constant attacks by judges.\" Long list of allegations Berlusconi, a self-made billionaire, has faced charges including corruption, tax fraud, false accounting and illegally financing political parties, but he has never been definitively convicted. On Friday parliamentarians will also vote on a bill to suspend thousands of trials for a year as a means of speeding Italy's notoriously slow justice system for the most serious cases languishing on the books. That law would keep the media tycoon out of the dock this month in a trial on charges of giving $600,000 dollars (380,000 euros) to his British lawyer David Mills in exchange for giving false testimony. Berlusconi is also seeking strict curbs on the use of wiretaps in judicial investigations and stiffer penalties for the publication of their transcripts.",

        "story": "German Athletes Feel the Pressure of Olympic Gold Swimmer Britta Steffen and gymnast Fabian Hambuechen feel the burden of the whole country as both look to give Germany Olympic gold in glamour sports at the Beijing Games. \"I am torn, everybody has expectations of me which I may not be able to meet,\" the 100m freestyle European record holder Steffen told DPA news agency. Germany's medals for a top placing in the medal table normally come from sports such as canoeing, rowing, fencing, equestrian and shooting - and not so much the big three of athletics, swimming and gymnastics. \"We will hopefully be helped by the sports in which we have traditionally been strong, such as canoeing or riding,\" said German Olympic Committee (DOSB) general director Michael Vesper. Germany came sixth in the Athens 2004 medal table with 13 gold medals, 16 silver and 20 bronze. Its overall score of 49 medals was good enough for joint fourth place with Australia, with the US leading the table with 36-39-27 medals and the overall list with 102 medals. \"We want to achieve a good result, finish at the same level as in our sixth-place finish in Athens, or even move up one position,\" said the DOSB's vice president, Eberhard Gienger. The German team of around 450 athletes also features table tennis ace Timo Boll, who hopes to scare the hosts at their number one sport. Other bright lights Canoeing 2004 champion Andreas Dittmer, dressage star Isabelle Werth, the men's field hockey and handball teams are also major medal hopes. Steffen, meanwhile, rose to stardom with four golds and one silver at the 2006 European championships although she had to settle for a bronze and a silver at the 2007 worlds. Now the 24-year-old is hoping to deliver Germany's first swim gold since 1992, in the 50m or 100m freestyle races. \"I am so scared to finish the 100m in second place and not to be happy with it. I don't even know if I could be happy with gold because that result would only confirm the expectations,\" Steffen said. Hambuechen won world championship gold for Germany on the horizontal bar, all-around silver and team bronze. The diminutive 20-year-old, known as the \"gymnastics professor,\" now hopes to cap his career in Beijing and said he will be not be to the forefront when it comes to criticism of China over human rights and other issues. \"I have a critical view of the political situation in China but at the Olympics in Beijing I will only think about my competition,\" said Hambuechen, the German Sportsman of the Year in 2007.",

        "story": "War Crimes Suspect Karadzic Appears at UN Tribunal Former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic has made his first appearance before a UN war crimes tribunal to answer genocide charges. He opted to delay his plea for 30 days and announced he would conduct his own defense. Karadzic, who was no longer sporting the beard and long hair that helped him conceal his identity for over a decade, waived his right to representation during the hearing on Thursday, July 31. When Judge Alphons Orie noted that he was alone, the wartime leader smiled and responded, \"I have an invisible adviser, but I have decided to defend myself.\" Orie, who said he expected the trial to last for many months, gave Karadzic 30 days to decide a plea at the initial hour-long hearing of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. The trial was adjourned until Aug. 29. Repeat performance? Karadzic said that -- like his former ally -- he intends to defend himself throughout the rest of the trial. Slobodan Milosevic, who was accused of crimes against humanity for his role in the Bosnian wars, used this as a delaying tactic to drag out his trial at the criminal tribunal in The Hague for years, dying in 2006 before it ended. Karadzic, who is the most prominent Balkans war crimes suspect to be arrested after Milosevic, said on Thursday that he would also reveal \"numerous irregularities\" related to his presence at the hearing. \"I will inform the court of the many mistakes and irregularities, like the mistaken date of my arrest,\" the 63-year-old said. He claimed that under the Dayton Accord, which ended the Bosnian war and brokered by former US Assistant Secretary of State Richard Holbrooke, an agreement was made that he would not be brought to trial if he withdrew from public life. Orie interrupted the former Bosnian Serb leader when he tried to read a prepared four-page statement about this, and said he should send the information to the court in writing. Chief prosecutor Serge Brammetz said lessons had been learned from the Milosevic case. \"Of course, it will take some months before the prosecution and defense will be ready to start,\" he told reporters. \"It will be a complex trial, but we are fully aware of the importance of being efficient.\" Some observers say he is likely to use the trial to illuminate claims that a shady deal with the West helped him avoid detention for so long. \"This is a political man, a former poet, he likes being the center of attention,\" international justice expert Heikelina Verrijn Stuart told AFP news agency. Charges include siege and massacre atrocities During Thursday's hearing, Orie read out the 11 war crimes charges that were first leveled against Karadzic in 1995. The majority of the charges against Karadzic focus on his role in the siege of Sarajevo and the Srebrenica massacre. Some 8,000 Muslim men and boys were killed in the UN safe haven of Srebrenica, while the siege of Sarajevo, which lasted over three years, is estimated to have left some 10,000 people dead. If convicted of the crimes, Karadzic faces life imprisonment.",

South Africa's Sunday Times presented the findings of what it said was a six-month investigation which showed that the company, identified as MAN Ferrostaal, had allegedly paid 30 million rands ($4.1 million) to Mbeki to guarantee it would receive the hotly-sought contract. Mbeki vehemently denied the allegation. \"The presidency would like to place it on record that President Thabo Mbeki has never at any stage received any amount of money from MAN Ferrostaal,\" a statement from his office said. Both Mbeki and Zuma bribed? The Sunday Times quoted a secret report compiled in 2007 by a British consultant, commissioned by an unnamed Central European manufacturer to investigate MAN Ferrostaal, which had launched a hostile takeover bid against it. According to The Times, Mbeki gave 2 million rands of the money to current Vice President Jacob Zuma and the rest to the ruling party, the African National Congress. The report was published as Zuma faces a fraud and corruption trial in connection with allegedly taking of bribes from arms dealers. Court proceedings are expected to take place this month. The statement from Mbeki's office called the newspaper report nothing \"but a hotchpotch recycling of allegations that have from time been peddled against the government's strategic defense procurement package. \"This time, the Sunday Times outdoes itself by placing a spurious allegation in the public domain, i.e. President Thabo Mbeki received a bribe of 30 million rands from MAN Ferrostaal,\" it said. ThyssenKrupp under investigation In a separate 1994 South African deal to purchase four German-made warships, or corvettes, German prosecutors are also investigating alleged kickbacks for South African officials. The company in question, ThyssenKrupp, part of a German consortium that produced the corvettes, confirmed in April that they had paid an African intermediary $22 million for \"the usual commissions\" but said they had declared it in their contract and there was no evidence of corruption. In that deal, the post-apartheid government in South Africa decided in 1994 to buy new warships, but the German consortium was scratched from the five-country shortlist of suppliers in December of that year. By that point, only British and Spanish suppliers were left in the race. But four weeks later, the Germans suddenly came back onto the shortlist, with then-vice president Mbeki announcing during a visit by a German minister and businessman that the issue was wide open. The Germans then moved to the front in a complicated tendering procedure and an order for the four warships was signed on December 3, 1999. The decision was criticized in South Africa, with an inquiry concluding in 2001 that the Germans should have been eliminated in the first round for failing to meet several requirements, according to German news weekly, Der Spiegel, in April.",

        "story": "German Criminal Police Chief Warns of Possible Terrorist Attacks Islamic militants trained in Pakistan and Afghanistan are planning attacks in Germany, although there is no evidence of any imminent threat, the country's top police officer was quoted as saying on Sunday. Joerg Ziercke, head of the Federal Criminal Police (BKA), told Der Tagesspiegel newspaper that more than 50 militants had traveled from Germany to training camps in Pakistan and Afghanistan run by the Taliban, al Qaeda and the Islamic Jihad Union (IJU). When asked by the German daily if it was safe for the nation to breathe easy again, Ziercke said that he was unable to sound the all clear, as Germany has repeatedly eluded catastrophe by a mere hair's breadth. \"Considering the statements from al Qaeda and the IJU, we are convinced it has been decided to mount attacks in Germany,\" he said. \"However, there is currently no concrete evidence of imminent strikes.\" 900 Hezbollah supporters The interview with Ziercke came on the heels of a secret report release by the BKA saying that the Lebanese-based Hezbollah movement has the capacity to undertake damaging attacks in Germany. The German weekly Focus reported that the militia had the logistics to carry out wide-scale attacks on physical and human targets. The BKA is reported to number Hezbollah supporters in Germany at around 900. Focus pointed to the case of a 29-year-old medical student at Germany's Goettingen University, who was detained in Israel last month. It reported the man was suspected of making contact with Hezbollah supporters in Germany and of having received $20,000 (13,300 euros) for espionage work. Germany untouched so far In contrast to European neighbors such as Spain or Britain, Germany has not suffered a major recent attack on its own soil. But Ziercke said German investigators had foiled seven plots, including attacks planned by three men arrested in the western Sauerland region last year who authorities believe were targeting US installations in Germany. Altogether, there are currently 200 investigations linked to Islamic terrorism being conducted by the BKA, Ziercke told Tagesspiegel, saying that the danger has therefore in no way diminished. \"A single-digit number of militants had returned to Germany from the training camps and were among around 100 suspects considered a threat,\" he said.",

        "story": "German Gymnastics Team Gets Boost from 33-Year-Old Medalist At her fifth Olympic Games in Beijing, 33-year-old gymnast Oksana Chusovitina finally claimed an individual medal. It's her story of determination and heartache that has won the hearts of viewers around the world. Oksana Chusovitina is one of a kind. Not only is she the oldest woman in over half a century to win an Olympic medal in gymnastics, she's been competing for nearly two decades already -- that's longer than many of her teammates have been alive. And she's competed in five Olympic Games under three flags. In 1992, just after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, she joined the unified ex-Soviet squad and in 1996, 2000 and 2004 she competed for her home country Uzbekistan, where she had already become something of a national hero. But this year, after claiming German citizenship in 2006, she is a member of the German team. Germany has traditionally not been shown particular strength in gymnastics and Chusovitina's silver on Sunday in vault was Germany's first Olympic medal in gymnastics in 20 years -- a much needed boost to the team. Son's illness shaped gymnast's path Chusovitina began her Olympic career in 1992 with a team gold in Barcelona. Besides coming up dry after that in Atlanta, Sydney and Athens, the 16-year quest for an individual medal was a rough one for the Uzbek athlete. In 2002, Chusovitina's son Alisher, then three years old, was diagnosed with leukemia. Since she already had close ties to the gymnastics team in Cologne, where she had competed in the German national league, she moved to Germany with her husband Bakhodir Kurpanov, a former successful wrestler, and their son. In Cologne, Chusovitina was able to train with the German team and seek medical attention for Alisher. She competed like mad in the years that followed, using her prize money to cover medical bills. Claiming German citizenship in 2006 allowed the gymnast and her family to stay in Germany for Alisher's follow-up examinations -- and it allowed her to strive for a fifth Games. Chusovitina hadn't abandoned her hopes for an individual. Ready for London in 2012 And Sunday's silver shows that, in a sport dominated by teenage prodigies, she has only improved with age. \"I don't feel 33, I feel 18,\" said Chusovitina. \"This medal is for my son. I can't say how happy I am.\" And she's not thinking about retirement. Instead, she's got the 2012 London Games on her mind. \"By then I'll be 37; if I can I'll do a sixth Olympics,\" she said.",

        "story": "German Wine Producers Discover the Art of PR After years of being thought of as cheap and sugary, German wine is enjoying huge international success. It owes its success to producers who are adapting to accommodate a new generation of consumers. As the first grapes of this year's harvest are due to be picked in the coming weeks, wine producers are optimistic about the 2008 vintage. But Raimund Pruem, who has been producing wine in the Moselle Valley for over 30 years, remembers a time when Riesling was not so prosperous. \"The bad reputation of German wine really hurt us,\" he said. \"I will never forget a blind tasting we did a while ago. The judges gave tremendous praise: Against South African and Australian wines, German Riesling did the best. But when they took off their blindfolds and saw the labels they started making excuses for their comments.\" Since then, however, German wine has made a comeback, particularly in the US after some Moselle Valley vintners earned the attention of the hugely influential American wine critic Robert Parker. A new generation of customers As German vintners don't tend to produce very large quantities of any one style of wine due to the varying conditions in the vineyards, most of their wine sold abroad goes through specialist retailers or online. Due to the steepness of the slopes virtually all Riesling in the Moselle Valley is hand-picked and despite being very labor intensive, high quality German wines remain relatively inexpensive -- a new reputation that is prized by vintners. But while Germany's sweet Rieslings are by far the most popular in the US, the German market decidedly prefers the \"trocken\" variety, the dry wines. Ninety-five percent of the wine the S.A. Pruem winery sells in Germany is dry Riesling. \"There is a generational problem, young people in Germany today do not drink the same wine as their grandparents anymore -- they drink only drier, more expensive wines,\" Pruem said. This is a relatively new development since a sudden change in German wine drinkers' pallets in 1976 switched the demand from very sweet Rieslings to bone dry. Such changes are not uncommon in the wine business as each generation of customers presents new demands. Producers stepping up Although Raimund Pruem's vineyards have been in his family since 1158 and his daughter is now sharing his marketing responsibilities, the art of winemaking is no longer something taught exclusively from one generation to the next. Virtually all top vintners around the Moselle have studied viticulture and vinification, gathering experience with many grape varieties and in some cases working in vineyards around the world. While Pruem's ancestors' jobs mainly consisted of winemaking, today German wine producers are increasingly spending their time promoting and selling their wines too. \"When people come here they don't want to meet the sales staff, they want to meet the producer,\" Pruem explained. \"Who else is a better promoter than the producer himself? That's something that has changed totally. My grandfather, my father and even myself when I was younger -- we saw how it doesn't work sitting here, waiting for customers, you have to be active.\" There has to be a connection between the producer and his customers, he added: \"Customers need communication.\" As a result, more and more producers are taking it upon themselves to host large group tastings, wedding receptions and to participate in international tasting events, touring the world with their wines. An artful business The change in approach is evident. Producers are experimenting and reaching out more and more: Bottles of other grape varieties such as Pinot Blanc and Chardonnay -- and even the occasional red wine -- are increasingly found on tasting lists around the Moselle Valley. But the demands of marketing are hard to keep up with. \"I have to sell my wine twice: first to the customer (the retailer), then to my customer's customer,\" Pruem said. \"You have to go with the retailer to ensure the wine is on the shelves and is being taken off the shelves and bought.\" Like most other wine producers, Pruem is carrying on the centuries-old art of winemaking: \"The art is to taste the juice from the grapes and produce a wine from it that shows the signals of the vineyard.\" But he is also introducing a new art -- that of public relations. \"My wines need to show character, if they don't show character then forget it.\" -- Pruem's statement reveals the bottom line for vintners like himself: If their wine fails to meet standards, then not only is their livelihood, passion and reputation at stake, but also their legacy.",

        "story": "On the spot: Paulo Guerrero Now a regular starter at Hamburg, the Peruvian striker spent two years on Bayern's bench. Guerrero hasn't made Hamburg fans forget club legend Uwe Seeler, but he doesn't put much stock in older role models. DWTV: Whose posters did you have in your room as a boy? Paulo Guerrero: I didn't like posters. DWTV: Stickers maybe? Paulo Guerrero: No. But I am a big fan of Zinedine Zidane, Thierry Henry and Ronaldo. They always fascinated me. They're my role models. DWTV: Hopefully you won't cut your hair like Ronaldo. Paulo Guerrero: No, everyone has their own look Guerrero not only has the hair, he's got the game too. He showed that by scoring five goals in his first four games for Bayern back in 2004. But he's never really managed to match that fantastic form since. Known as a shy and reserved player, he says the key to finding the net is confidence. Paulo Guerrero: I had already scored 21 goals for Bayern Munich's amateur side. I was very proud of that. So I came into those games with a lot of confidence, and the goals just happened. My coach Felix Magath always told me: Score your goal, score your goal! That's all he asked, for me to score a goal. And I believed in myself so I always scored one or two. DWTV: At the age of 18 you joined a squad full of stars like Michael Ballack, Lucio, Ze Roberto and Roy Makaay. Was that more intimidating or inspiring? Paulo Guerrero: They inspired me. They were very good players technically. I wanted to play at their level and get better. That also gave me the confidence to play alongside them. DWTV: You didn't start for Bayern so you went to Hamburg. But you had trouble there at first? Why was that? Paulo Guerrero: It was very hard for me to leave Bayern. It was very difficult after four years. I left my son and many of my friends behind. The first year in Hamburg was very hard. In my mind, I was still in Munich. I kept asking myself: \"Why did you come here?\" It was hard to get used to a new city so my first year at Hamburg wasn't that successful. DWTV: Was coach Thomas Doll part of the problem? Paulo Guerrero: No, definitely not. It wasn't the coach's fault. It was mine. I didn't have enough experience. I was only 22. It was hard, but that's in the past. Now I'm living in the present and I'm very happy in Hamburg. 2007/8 was Guerrero's breakthrough season. He scored 9 league goals and 5 in the UEFA Cup. And this time around his sights are set even higher. DWTV: Can Hamburg win the league this season? Paulo Guerrero: Most of our players are young and hungry for success. They want to get the job done. A lot of players here have attracted attention to themselves and play at a high level. In my opinion, we could win the title this year. DWTV: Do you have a clear target for the UEFA Cup? Paulo Guerrero: Of course. Last season we almost made the final and we put up a good fight in the Bundesliga too. We get along well as a team. We've got players with potential and we're hungry for success. Even as a teenager, Guerrero played for the national side in his native Peru. His first goal came as a substitute, but he's been a consistent member of the squad. DWTV: So what's more important to you, club or country? Paulo Guerrero: It's very different playing for Peru than playing for a club. You're not allowed to lose. I don't want to lose with Hamburg either, but when I put on the Peruvian jersey it's very different. Those are my people, my stadium. It's great playing in front of the crowd in Lima. What player doesn't want to play for his national side? DWTV: A lot of Latin American players dream of coming to Europe, something you did as a youngster. Wouldn't you have liked to play professionally in Peru as well? Paulo Guerrero: Of course, I would have, but Peruvian football isn't doing so well. There's no progress in the management, infrastructure and organization. In Europe, the situation is the opposite. So my parents always though I should go to Europe as soon as I got an offer.",

        "story": "Brussels Approves Financial Rescue Plans by Sweden, Portugal The European Commission on Thursday approved packages by Sweden and Portugal to protect financial institutions from the global credit crunch. In both cases, Europe's top state aid watchdog said that the plans respected its guidelines for helping the financial sector cope with the worst crisis in generations without distorting competition. Sweden's plan involves the state providing up to 1,500 billion Swedish kronor (153.8 billion euros, $201 billion) in debt guarantees to banks and other lenders. Portugal's plan envisages similar state guarantees worth 20 billion euros ($26 billion). Plans must follow strict guidelines But while Sweden's was cleared within just three days of it being notified to the commission, the Portuguese plan required negotiations with officials in Brussels over a two-week period. \"The Swedish measures were well-designed and needed little alteration to take full account of the state aid rules' requirements that such schemes are non-discriminatory and minimize potential distortions of competition,\" said Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes. The commission has issued clear guidelines on what governments can and cannot do to protect their countries' financial institutions. Rescue plans have to be limited in time and scope and they should not discriminate against foreign banks operating in the country. They should also be followed up by structural adjustment measures for the financial sector as a whole, while state money should not be used by beneficiaries to attract new business. The commission has already cleared similar rescue plans by Britain, Denmark, Germany and Ireland and is still considering those of, among others, France and Spain.",

        "story": "Germany to Send Intelligence Agents to India to Aid Terror Fight Germany plans to send intelligence agents to India as part of efforts to step up cooperation in the fight against terrorism, German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said Friday, Dec. 12. The two countries wanted to improve the exchange of information, the minister said after talks with Home Affairs Minister P Chidambaram and national security adviser MK Narayanan in New Delhi. Schaeuble said he had asked Indian authorities to allow Germany's anti-terrorism unit GSG 9 to make an intensive inspection of the scenes of last month's terrorist attacks in Mumbai. Germany would be prepared to help India in the fight against terrorist in any way it could, the minister said. Schaeuble said the Pakistan militant Lashkar-e-Taiba, which has been blamed for the attacks in Mumbai, had members in Germany, although the group had no organizational infrastructure there. The minister said there were no indications the group was plotting to target Germany despite \"obvious links\" to the Islamic Jihad Union, an Uzbek group accused of planning attacks on German soil. India has accused Pakistan of being behind the Mumbai bloodbath, which left more than 170 dead. The aim of the terrorists was to provoke India and increase tension with Pakistan, Schaeuble said. Internet terrorists an integral part of network In other security developments, Germany's prosecutor general said that Islamists who post fierce messages on the internet along with bomb-making instructions are becoming a key part of international terrorism. The internet served as a means of communications between different terrorist groups and as a source of information on how to mount attacks, Monika Harms said in Karlsruhe. \"The internet has become the home handyman store for the do-it-yourself terrorist,\" said Harms at a news conference. \"The desk man in front of a personal computer has become an essential component of the global jihad,\" she said, referring to the Arabic term for \"struggle.\" She said this had been proven with a trio of men detained in Germany earlier this year on suspicion of planning bombings. Her office is also investigating a German-language Islamist site, the Global Islamic Media Front (GIMF), and seeks to prosecute its writers on the serious charge of supporting of terrorism. Half the group are said to be German converts to Islam. This week, magistrates released two of the GIMF suspects on bail.",

        "story": "Amos Oz Receives German Literary Prize in Dusseldorf Israeli author Amos Oz was presented with a top German award for his political and literary work on Saturday, Dec. 13. Oz, 69, was honored by the city of Dusseldorf with the Heinrich Heine Prize on the 211st anniversary of the 19th century German poet's birth. The award, worth 50,000 euros ($66,000), has been presented every two years since 1972 to personalities who share Heine's values of tolerance, human rights and mutual understanding of peoples. The jury said it chose to honor Oz for his \"literary quality, political sensibility, his humanitarian engagement and his bold clarity and determination in trying to build bridges between Israelis and Palestinians.\" Oz, who was born in Jerusalem in 1939, is one of Israel's best-known authors and political voices. He is a co-founder of the Israeli peace movement and a prominent champion of Palestinian rights. In his acceptance speech, Oz said the Arab-Israeli conflict could only be resolved in the context of European values of tolerance, rationality and pragmatism. However, it \"is being kept alive by fanatics on both sides.\" Having fought in the Six-Day War and Yom Kippur War, Oz has said he does not regret his participation. But in his acceptance speech, he added that he has always drawn \"a very clear line between wars that deal with survival and wars that deal with interests.\" Last month, Oz joined other Israeli intellectuals and dovish politicians to establish a new political party that aims to unite the Israeli peace camp. A former professor of literature at Ben-Gurion University, he won the Israel Prize for literature in 1998, the Goethe Prize in 2005 and Spain's Prince of Asturias Prize in 2007. Among his best known works are \"A Tale of Love and Darkness,\" which appeared in 2003, \"Don't Call It Night,\" published in 1994, and \"Rhyming Life and Death,\" from 2007.",

        "story": "Simon Wiesenthal: The Life of a Nazi Hunter Some called him the Nazi Hunter, but in reality he was just a normal man looking to make sure that justice was served. On December 31, 2008, Simon Wiesenthal would have celebrated his 100th birthday. Simon Wiesenthal once said that his purpose in life was to warn the murderers of tomorrow that they will never find rest. If he couldn't do that, then millions of people died for nothing. He was referring to victims of the Nazi Holocaust of World War II. Wiesenthal was a voice for the survivors of the Holocaust, but also for those who lost their lives in the concentration camps. Wiesenthal worked most of his life making sure that these crimes against humanity would never be hushed up or whitewashed. Some people labeled him a \u00e2\u0080\u009cjustice fanatic\u00e2\u0080\u009d, others viewed him as a role model and hero. The early years Simon Wiesenthal was born on Dec. 31, 1908, to a Jewish family living in Galicia, which at the time was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He studied architecture in Lemburg and was able to pursue that passion until 1940, when the German army marched in and took over. Wiesenthal spent the next several years in countless forced labor and concentration camps. In 1945 Wiesenthal was among those freed from the Mauthausen death camp in Austria by the US army. It was shortly thereafter that he was reunited with the love of his life, Cyla, whose entire family was killed by the Nazis. Life's work It was in that same year that Wiesenthal started his real life's work: hunting down and capturing former members of the Nazi party. He was contracted by the US government to take on this task and drew on his experiences and memories from the war to accomplish it. He even recalled many of the perpetrator's names from his time in concentration camps. Two years later Wiesenthal, along with other survivors, founded a center for the documentation of crimes committed against European Jews in Linz, Austria. In 1961 a Jewish Documentation Center in Vienna was created. Soon the small office there was filled with documents, notes, memorabilia and evidence. The Americans followed the example, and by 1977 there was a similar institution established in Los Angeles named in Wiesenthal's honor. Nazi hunter Wiesenthal contributed to the capture of many prominent Nazis, including Adolf Eichmann, who was put on trial in Israel in 1961; Franz Stangl, Commandant of the Treblinka concentration camp; and Hermine Braunsteiner, who was responsible for the murder of hundreds of children at the Majdanek concentration camp. Simon Wiesenthal always considered himself a researcher who was simply working to make sure the Holocaust would never be forgotten and that the perpetrators would be brought to justice. Guilt, he always stressed, was individual. He never wanted to be a hate-driven Nazi hunter, saying that hate was a foreign emotion to him. For sixty years Wiesenthal collected, researched and documented \u00e2\u0080\u0093 living deep in his dark memories. He was been honored multiple times for his life's work. Simon Wiesenthal died on September 20, 2005 at the age of 96.",

        "story": "Mzoudi Verdict Postponed Amid New Testimony Al Qaeda is allegedly trying to assassinate Abdelghani Mzoudi, who is on trial in Germany for his suspected involvement in the Sept. 11 attacks, a witness said on Thursday. The expected verdict has now been postponed. Mzoudi had been released from jail on Dec. 11 after an anonymous witness said he was not involved in planning the attacks. A Hamburg court had been expected to announce its verdict on Thursday but in a surprising turn of events, judges agreed to hear new testimony that allegedly incriminates the 31-year-old. The new witness for the prosecution is a former Iranian intelligence agent, according to Mzoudi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lawyers. A police officer who interrogated the man said the witness claimed to have received an e-mail in which Mzoudi is named as a member of the outside circle of the Hamburg terrorist cell around Sept. 11 hijacker Mohammed Atta. According to the police officer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s testimony, the e-mail mentioned a person, who is on trial in Germany and has been released to help law enforcement authorities in their search for further members of the terrorist cell. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why al Qaeda was allegedly planning to \u00e2\u0080\u009celiminate\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mzoudi, the officer said. He added that the Iranian intelligence agent had asked for money to testify against Mzoudi. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe said he had to make a living,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the officer said. Allegedly the agent warned U.S. authorities of planned terrorist attacks prior to Sept. 11. The prosecution has asked the court to take a 30-day recess in order to evaluate the testimony. On Thursday, judges will also hear testimony from a federal prosecutor and another police officer who interrogated the man. Acquittal likely until now Mzoudi had been expected to leave the courtroom a free man after his Dec. 11 release from prison: An anonymous witness had cleared him of any involvement in planning the Sept. 11 attacks. Ramzi Binalshibh, the mastermind behind the attacks who is now in U.S. custody, is believed to be that witness. The defense has asked the court to acquit their client, while prosecutors are calling for a sentence of 15 years in prison for belonging to a terrorist organization and abetting murder in more than 3,000 cases. German authorities have said they plan to deport Mzoudi to his home country of Morocco in case of an acquittal. Mzoudi has been trying to stay in Germany, saying that he fears getting arrested in Morocco or facing extradition to the U.S.",

        "story": "Eastern Germany's EU Funds in Danger of Drying Up The EU's competition commissioner met with the heads of Germany's eastern states to discuss future financial support for the region, which may no longer be a top priority following enlargement. The heads of Germany's economically depressed eastern states could be forgiven for going on the defensive prior to their meeting in Brandenburg with Mario Monti, the European commissioner for competition. With 10 mainly former communist countries now in the European Union, eastern Germany's economic problems suddenly don't seem so bad. And that means the region is in danger of losing some of the EU's development aid that, together with the so-called \"solidarity payments\" from western Germany, have funded reconstruction projects in the former East Germany. Reconstruction far from over During the meeting on Monday, Brandenburg's premier Matthias Platzeck said it would be difficult to explain to people in eastern Germany that their region would have to take a funding cutback. All the progress that's been made in recent years is still very fragile, Platzeck said. Eastern Germany had been completely deindustrialized after the collapse of the GDR, and rebuilding the region is far from over, he added. There have been no concrete signs yet as to how big a cut in EU subsidies the eastern German states would have to reckon with. The European Commission is conducting a comprehensive review of its regional aid policy in order to introduce new guidelines and criteria to come into effect on Jan.1, 2007. No reason to worry Monti (photo) said it was important for him to talk with eastern German leaders about their worries. He assured them that they can be confident about their region's future. Eastern Germany has gone from the outer edges to the very center of the EU -- a development that would soon manifest itself in further growth and development, he said. Statistically speaking, eastern Germany is no longer among the poorest regions in the EU, now that the bloc has expanded eastwards to include several ex-communist states with struggling economies. However, unemployment in Germany's eastern states is over 20 percent, and despite an estimated \u00e2\u0082\u00ac1.25 trillion ($1.5) in aid, the economic gap separating east and west hasn't been closed. Platzeck said that parts of the European Commission's plan to reform its regional aid policy will only exacerbate the problem. The premier of Saxony-Anhalt, Wolfgang B\u00c3\u00b6hmer, said that without financial help from Brussels his state would face a budget emergency. Last month, a government-commissioned report came to the conclusion that the east German reconstruction project was a failure. But Platzeck said accusations of ineffectiveness are unfair. He said 47 of the 50 large-scale development projects in his state of Brandenburg were working very well. Brandenburg's state government has already divided the region into two zones, so that it can at least apply for the highest level of EU funding for the poorer northern half.",

        "story": "German Know-How For China's Energy Sector Energy is becoming a scarce resource in China and Beijing is looking for alternatives. On Friday, Germany's foreign minister inaugurated one of the largest German-Chinese joint ventures for solar energy there. The facility in Jinan is being billed as the largest solar collector plant in the world. The site in this eastern Chinese city, run by a Sino-German joint venture, produces solar collectors to heat water. It is a market that promises massive electricity savings in a country struggling with a potential shortfall this year of 30 million kilowatts. \"China has recognized the urgent ecological issues that go along with strong economic growth and the increasing need for energy,\" German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer told German business representatives at the inauguration ceremony. \"I am especially happy that China has made decisive steps towards using renewable energy and the development of a more environmentally-friendly energy sector,\" he added. Solar power instead of chocolate The joint venture is owned by the German vacuum tube solar collector manufacturer Paradigma, Karlsbad, and Chinese glass tubing producer Linuo in Jinan. Paradigma's major shareholder is Alfred Ritter, better-known for his chocolate company Ritter Sport. \"With this joint venture, we are following a strategy to go where the markets are,\" Ritter said. \"In China, we're producing for the Asian market, in Germany, for the European market.\" Germany sees the Shangdong Linuo Paradigma plant as the largest new venture in a virtually untapped market. \"There are extraordinary opportunities here not only for large corporations, but also for mid-sized and small German companies,\" said Fischer, who is currently touring Asia with a German business delegation. China's energy resources are running out China, the world's largest solar energy market, is facing its worst energy crisis since the 1980s. It has been set off by the rapid development of power-hungry industries such as automobiles, iron and steel, as well as rapid urbanization and a rise in living standards. Energy production relative to buying power is four times more expensive in China than in other industrialized nations. At the same time, it is drastically depleting its coal deposits and oil imports are soaring. The symptoms of the shortages are visible throughout China. In order to feed Beijing's growing energy needs, frequent blackouts occur across the country. Many companies have begun working at night and on weekends to avoid high-use periods and more than 6,000 companies in Beijing have ordered one-week paid vacations this summer to save energy.",

        "story": "German Reality Shows in Need of Reality Check Reality shows are increasingly attracting the ire of critics -- some who object to the way animals are treated on a new farm docu-soap, and others who worry about the effects such shows have on the human participants. \"Die Alm\" or \"The Alps,\" is a sort of alpine-reality-docu-soap, in which a slew of German B-list celebrities gets down and dirty with everyday life on an alpine farm. Of course, no alpine pasture would be complete without real live farm animals, which provide the celebs with countless opportunities to boost ratings by engaging in gross-out stunts such as having goats lick syrup off their bodies, or sucking milk from a cow's udder. But the last straw for German animal activists came when a recent episode showed a turkey being slaughtered. Now, the German Society for the Protection of Animals (DTB) says it's looking at taking legal steps against the show, which runs on Munich-based private broadcaster, ProSieben. \"We don't care if third-rate celebrities bathe in manure or throw themselves naked down a hillside,\" said DTB head Thomas Schr\u00c3\u00b6der. \"But animals can't say yes or no. The show has overstepped the legal and ethical boundaries.\" ProSieben is nonplussed but intends to continue airing the show as planned. Tuesday evening's episode includes showing the candidates how to empty the intestines of a freshly slaughtered pig, for later use as sausage casings. The executive in charge of the show, Christian Asanger, has even invited members of the animal society out to the mountain pasture. \"We have nothing to hide,\" he said. Makeover-shows also a target In a world where there's no such thing as bad publicity, experts say such protests are a welcome additional marketing strategy for the shows, which thrive on high ratings and advertising revenue. If that's true, then other German reality TV shows which feature plastic surgery and makeovers instead of farm animals can also expect a ratings boost. Cologne-based private broadcaster RTL II whipped up a storm of protest last week when it announced it would let candidates participating in its \"Big Brother\" reality show undergo cosmetic surgery. The German Association of Plastic Surgeons (VD\u00c3\u0084PC) objected, not just to \"Big Brother,\" but also to other makeover reality shows that recently hit the German airwaves. In MTV's \"I Want a Famous Face,\" teens put themselves at the mercy of plastic surgeons in order to wake up looking like stars such as Brad Pitt or Kate Winslet. ProSieben's \"The Swan\" is a reality TV-show format imported from the US, in which ugly ducklings are turned into\u00e2\u0080\u00a6well, swans, with the help of plastic surgeons, fitness trainers, nutritionists and psychologists. The most beautiful \"swan\" to emerge out of the 16 candidates wins a modeling contract. Don't blame plastic surgeons These shows are giving plastic surgery a bad name, according to the VD\u00c3\u0084PC. \"What we do is medical work. We treat patients. We don't sell the product 'beauty',\" said the association's senior president, Constanze Neuhann-Lorenz. In a letter sent to the association's 120 members, president Rolf R\u00c3\u00bcdiger Olbrisch wrote: \"Let's protect ourselves from landing in the wrong hands and wrong publicity, of the wrong business.\" Germany's media regulatory board said certain boundaries have to be respected, even in an industry that's all about erasing the boundaries between private and public life. \"Showing plastic surgery can hurt the dignity of a human being, even if the person having the surgery doesn't have a problem with it,\" said the head of the director's conference for Germany's state media boards, Wolfgang Thaenert. \"Basically, it's about respecting the final boundaries that touch on human dignity.\"",

        "story": "Baltic Beach Battle The Baltic Sea stretching from eastern Germany to Poland used to be a Mecca for beach bums who prefer skin to skivvies, but is an onslaught of prudish Western visitors spoiling the tradition? Back in the days of Communism, as many as 90 percent of beach-goers along the East German-controlled stretch of the Baltic Sea preferred to bathe in their birthday suits, au natural. Fifteen years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, it's a different story. Today, officials are buckling under pressure from tourists from western Germany who have demanded the nudists, known here as Free Body Culture (FKK), be pushed to the fringes of public beaches. According to a report by news agency Reuters, the tensions have pitted the nudes against the prudes. \"I grew up being naked at the beach and it's the only way to spend the summer here,\" Susanne Koch, 31, told Reuters. \"Being nude on the beach feels completely normal.\" To cover or uncover? The dispute, unfortunately, has also tapped into divisions between the eastern Germans and their western German neighbors, who sometimes pejoratively refer to each other as \"Ossis\" and \"Wessis.\" \"Western tourists are ruining the atmosphere,\" Koch said. \"The tensions are unfortunate. They don't know what they're missing, It's a shame westerners are so intolerant.\" But the resort town of Warnem\u00c3\u00bcnde, a coastal outpost near Rostock, is one of many in the area that reply heavily on tourism for its survival. Officials in the town have divided the beaches between \"textile\" areas and \"FKK\" sections. And there are even reported incidents of nudists taking one false step and winding up with a handful of sand in their faces. Keen to cash in on their higher spending power, tourism officials have sought to appease visitors from the west like Dirk Richter of the central western city of Hanover. \"I really don't want to see naked bodies all around me,\" he said. \"It's not for everyone and it's often not a very attractive sight. It's tough luck for the natives if that's the way it used to be. Times change.\" But few believe the nudists will go without a fight -- including people like Maron Mock. \"It's not fair,\" the 25-year-old primary school teacher said. \"We're being pushed off our own beach into a crummy little zone on the edge. Being nude is not a crime!\"",

        "story": "Online Advertising Gathers Momentum At the German Multi-Media Congress, experts agreed that online advertising is finally witnessing an upswing after a long downturn. After experiencing a three-year slump in online advertising, the situation in today's Internet market is looking promising, according to a group of industry experts meeting in Stuttgart this week. Earlier this year, Christian Muche from online marketing at the German Multi-Media Association (DMV) predicted that Internet advertising could expect a growth rate of 20 percent in 2004. His forecast reflected a wider optimistic trend based on the recent upswing in advertising spending. Online ads outstrip other media \"According to estimates by US company Jupiter Research, turnover from online advertising will have overtaken turnover from print media by 2008,\" wrote German daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung recently. Pressetext.Austria noted a similar development. \"In the first half of 2004, online advertising spending was twice as high as it was in cinema theaters,\" it wrote, while the Interactive Advertising Bureau in New York, the industry's leading association, pointed out that Internet advertising would be outstripping radio advertising by 2007. In the US, the world's largest advertising market, Web sites provided turnover of almost \u00e2\u0082\u00ac7.3 billion, thereby matching the amount spent in 2000, the most lucrative year ever. Advertising also increased by 6.5 percent in Germany in the first half of 2004, with a turnover of \u00e2\u0082\u00ac8.8 billion for all media. The Internet, meanwhile, registered a drop of 2.6 percent. Nonetheless, Bernd Henning from DMV market research told DW-WORLD that other studies showed the market was improving. After years of ad price dumping, prices are once again rising, he said. That's because cost-per-thousand -- the average cost for achieving a thousand exposures for a commercial against a target audience -- rises in accordance with the number of users a site attracts, and the cost of advertising rises with it. The new face of online advertising Like cinema advertising, experts agree that Internet advertising has a slow-burn effect on the consumer. Current online advertising is now far more complex and less click-oriented than it was ten years ago. 'Sticky ads' and 'Interstitials', for example -- ads that display between two pages of a website -- are interruptive, like television advertising, rather than passive, like Web banner advertising. Another trend is keyword marketing. Search engines like Google and Yahoo auction off prime positions on their pages, primarily to Internet traders with a vested interest in appearing at the top of the list in response to a query for, for example, 'digital camera'. These hits are known as \"sponsored listings\". Even though the growth in the online advertising market is considerable, its budgets are still far smaller than in other media. According to the 2003 Focus Mediaguide, the online share of the total US advertising budget was just three percent. Even in Norway, Denmark and Estonia, the European countries spending most on online advertising, the budget is negligible. Mediterranean countries spend even less. \"The North-South divide correlates with national statistics on Internet use,\" says Bernd Henning. \"The worse the weather, the more time people spend on the Internet.\"",

        "story": "Cloudy Skies Ahead for German Growth A group of leading economic experts have given a less-than-sunny forecast for Germany's economic growth, as the high euro and surging oil prices dampen the modest recovery in the euro zone's biggest economy. In their widely watched autumn report, the German government's so-called \"Five Wise Men\" -- independent economic advisors -- said they were expecting the country's gross domestic product (GDP) to expand by just 1.4 percent next year, compared with an anticipated 1.8 percent this year. Those figures fall far short of the government's official forecasts that put growth at 1.8 percent this year and 1.7 percent next year. Coupled with a stark decline in domestic consumer spending and a growing dependency on exports, the slower economic growth rate will further burden the already critical state of Germany's public finances. High euro, low domestic spending to blame The runaway strength of the euro against the dollar is partially to blame for the downturn in the German economy, which is heavily dependent on exports, the experts said. \"A further rise in the euro would result in risks for growth momentum next year,\" said the report, which was published on Wednesday. The panel of experts, which actually comprises four men and one woman, said that strong export growth this year had \"enabled Germany to break out of a three-year period of economic stagnation.\" \"But the weakening in growth since this autumn emphatically illustrates the vulnerability of a recovery driven primarily by external economic factors,\" the experts said. \"While global economic developments remain robust, they will be slowed by the rise in oil prices and it is therefore decisive that domestic investment and private consumption get on a better footing in Germany,\" they diagnosed. A modest upturn in equipment spending in the second half of this year provided the \"first encouraging sign\" for a possible improvement in domestic demand. \"Our prognosis for next year is a gradual revival in domestic demand coupled with fundamentally positive impulses from the global economy.\" Nevertheless, \"we're still a long way from seeing a sweeping upturn in the domestic economy,\" the experts said. The modest pace of growth will remain more or less unchanged in 2004 and 2005, the report estimated. Public finances at risk The absence of a stronger pick-up in the economy also spelled bad news for Germany's public finances. \"The state of Germany's public finances remains critical,\" the experts wrote, predicting that the German public deficit would breach EU budget rules for the fourth year in a row next year. Under the terms of the European Stability and Growth Pact, drawn up in 1997 largely at Germany's behest, euro zone countries are prohibited from running up public deficits in excess of 3.0 percent of GDP. But the German deficit already breached that level in 2002 and 2003, and is expected to do so again this year. German Finance Minister Hans Eichel has pledged to bring the deficit back below the 3.0 percent ceiling in 2005. However, the \"Five Wise Men\" predicted the deficit ratio would remain at 3.5 percent again in 2005. In a sign that the government has acknowledged, if not accepted, the cloudy forecast, Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00c3\u00b6der said it \"won't be easy\" to bring the public deficit back under 3.0 of GDP next year.",

        "story": "Gap Growing Between Poor and Rich A government-commissioned report on the rich-poor divide has found that poverty is on the rise in Germany and that the state might in fact be exacerbating it. The gap between the rich and poor in Germany has drastically increased since 1998 when the ruling coalition government of Social Democrats and Greens took over from its conservative predecessors. That's the core finding of a draft study commissioned by Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00c3\u00b6der's government and released on Thursday. The draft report minces no words. Poverty is on the rise in what is still considered to be one of the richest countries in the world, it says. Children worst affected The situation is particularly drastic in Germany\u00e2\u0080\u0099s big cities where children are among those worst affected in families with either lower incomes and reduced subsidies or suffering from long-term unemployment. 5 percent of the households concerned have to make do with less than 60 percent of average earnings, which is generally accepted by social scientists in the western world as the definition of poverty. This means that these households have fewer than \u00e2\u0082\u00ac938 ($1,269) a month at their disposal. 15 percent of children up to 14 years of age are registered as being poor, and 19 percent of young people between 14 and 19 years of age. German social scientist Klaus Hurrelmann maintains that families and particularly single-parent households are not adequately supported by the state. \"The social situation of many children is getting worse,\" he said. \"Of course the problems that children in rich Germany face cannot be compared to those of children in the developing world. However, the psychological pressure cannot be overlooked.\" \"Government making people poorer\" Faced with an ageing population and an overburdened welfare system as a result, the coalition government of Social Democrats and Greens has set out to overhaul mechanisms of granting benefits for the needy. Of the measures to come into effect as of January next year will be the merging of unemployment and welfare benefits at a low level which will see a good proportion of people, first and foremost the long-term unemployed, in an even greater financial plight. Barbara Stolterfoht, head of the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s welfare umbrella organization, predicts poverty levels going up even further as a result. \"The merging of social and unemployment benefits is a good idea, not a bad one,\" she said. \"But, merging this on the level of social benefits which is very low and which means poverty is a bad idea.\" Stolterfoht said poverty was bound to be the final outcome. \"What this government is doing is just making people poorer without giving them work.\" It's a view shared by Walter Hanesch, a professor of social sciences in Darmstadt. He reckons that with an ongoing polarization in society more unrest is programmed. essence this means that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re drifting more and more towards a greater potential of social unrest in the country, he said. \"It\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be interesting to see what impact the government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s social reforms will have in 2005.\" Hanesch contended that the merging of unemployment and welfare benefits will not be conducive to reducing poverty levels. \"On the contrary, some of the poorest \u00e2\u0080\u0093 particularly the long-term unemployed \u00e2\u0080\u0093 will even get poorer.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rich getting richer? While more and more people have to turn over every cent, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also an increasing number of people at the other side of the spectrum who can afford to spend money like water. 10 percent of people with the highest earnings now account for almost half of all net incomes in the country. Some 1.6 million Germans own at least half a million euros each, and an unspecified number can proudly call themselves billionaires.",

        "story": "EU tells Turkey migrant flows 'still way too high' The EU plans to offer Turkey billions of dollars in aid to stem the exodus of refugees into Europe has so far had little effect. Thousands continue to make the perilous journey every day. Seven weeks after the EU and Turkey reached agreement on curbing the refugee flow into Europe, migrants continue to arrive in Turkey with the aim of gaining entry to the EU. But while critical of Turkey's efforts to stem the flow across the Aegean Sea, EU Vice President Frans Timmermans said Ankara and Brussels had to work together to implement the agreed upon action plan. Toward that end, Turkish authorities may start offering Syrians work permits - in an attempt to lure them into staying in Turkey. \"The goal of this (action plan) is to stem the flow; 2,000 to 3.000 (arrivals) a day is not stemming the flow,\" Timmermans said, after meeting with Turkey's EU Affairs Minister Volkan Bozkir. \"But we are in this together and we will work on that.\" As part of the deal reached on November 29, EU leaders pledged 3 billion euros ($3.2 billion) in aid for the more than 2.2 million Syrian refugees sheltering in Turkey in exchange for Ankara acting to reduce the flow. More than 1 million asylum seekers arrived in the EU in 2015, and governments across the bloc are under increasing domestic pressure to stem the tide. But every day thousands more attempt the perilous journey, all too often with fatal results. During a single day last week Turkish authorities said 36 migrants, including several children, either washed up along Turkish shores or were found floating in the sea after their boats sank. Thousands more have managed safe landings in Turkey and made their way to Greece in the hope of reaching wealthier EU countries such as Germany and Sweden. But the Balkan corridor to western Europe is rapidly closing, and now thousands more migrants are finding themselves stuck in Greece - an EU country with 25 percent unemployment. Fewer than 1,000 people so far have opted for voluntary repatriation, according to Daniel Edras, who heads the International Office of Migration in Greece. \"It's one thing to return in handcuffs,\" he said, \"and quite another to go as a normal passenger with some money in your pocket, because we give them each 400 euros ($435).\" But repatriation isn't an option for tens of thousands from countries torn apart by violence. \"I can't go back to Somalia,\" said English teacher Ali Heydar Aki, who hoped to settle in Europe and then bring his family. \"I have sold half my house\" to fund the trip. bik/ng (AFP, AP)",

        "story": "Walmart to raise wages for over 1 million workers More than 85 percent of Walmart's workforce can expect a wage hike next month as the US' largest private employer steps up efforts to polish its image in the wake of fierce criticism from labor activists. The retail titan - the biggest in the world - announced that over 1.2 million of its employees would be paid at least $10 (9.2 euros) an hour, instead of the current minimum of $9, come February 20. The move, which Walmart hailed as \"one of the largest single-day, private-sector pay increases ever,\" comes just a year after the chain raised base wages for 500,000 workers to $9 an hour. However, that did not go down well with everyone. Long-time employees complained that less-experienced newcomers were all of a sudden earning almost the same as they were. \"We did hear from some associates who did feel left out last time,\" spokesman Kory Lundberg acknowledged. Across-the-board hikes But this time around, Walmart does not expect similar complaints. First, new entry level workers hired after January 1, 2016, will start at $9 per hour, before moving up to at least $10 an hour after having completed a six-month training program. Second, those already making more than $10 an hour would receive an annual pay increase \"rather than waiting until their anniversary date,\" the company said. And last but not least, it added, top-level hourly employees would see the minimum wage rise by $2 an hour to $15. As a result, the average full-time hourly wage at one of Walmart's more than 5,000 US stores will be $13.38, up from $13. For part-time workers, the hourly wage will be $10.58, up from $10. While this is above the national hourly average of $9.26 for cashiers and low level retail staff, it is still below the $14.95 average hourly retail workers in a non-supervisory role earn, according to US government data. On top of the raise, full-time hourly workers would also receive free, basic short-term disability, the retailer said. Moreover, employees who have earned paid time off will no longer have to wait a year before they can make use of them. Not entirely unselfish? Walmart had already warned last October that earnings for the year, starting next month, could be down as much as 12 percent due to the workforce investment. But the company said it is a price it is willing to pay. \"We are very clear that if we make sure our associates are being treated fairly, if they are rewarded simply and clearly, we will have a better business,\" said Judith McKenna, chief operating officer for Walmart's US division. But some say Walmart's move may not be completely unselfish. \"The competition for talent is strong,\" said Craig Rowley, global leader of consultancy Hay Group's retail practice. \"It's strong because there are fewer people to hire.\" According to Rowley, the turnover rate - the share of part-time workers who leave within a year - is now 67 percent for the retail industry, up from 50 percent during the recession. pad/hg (AP, AFP)",

Lagarde herself, however, is not ready to commit to seeking the job again. A statement from Germany's Finance Ministry on Thursday lent support to the idea of keeping Christine Lagarde in her position at the head of the International Monetary Fund for another term. \"Ms. Lagarde was a prudent and effective crisis manager in the difficult times after the financial crisis,\" the statement read from Finance Minister Wolfgang Sch\u00c3\u00a4uble's office read. \"At the same time, she managed to bundle the interests of IMF stakeholders and to further increase the efficiency of the IMF.\" British Finance Minister George Osborne issued a similar statement on Thursday saying, \"At a time when the world faces what I've called a dangerous cocktail of risks, I believe Christine has the vision, energy and acumen to help steer the global economy through the years ahead.\" Lagarde took part in a panel discussion at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Thursday and briefly addressed the idea of second term at the IMF. \"I'll be waiting before I say anything about that,\" she said. Lagarde's term is set to run out in July. She has served as the IMF head since July 2011. mz/sms (AP, dpa)",

        "story": "Europol launches pan-European counterterrorism center The EU law enforcement agency has announced the formation of a strategic center to combat terrorism in Europe. The hub is tasked with boosting intelligence-sharing among member states and tracking terrorists' finances. EU Migration Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos announced on Monday the creation of the European Counter Terrorism Centre (ECTC), which aims to boost cooperation among Europol member states in their fight against terrorist threats in Europe. \"The establishment of the European Counter Terrorism Centre is a major strategic opportunity for the EU to make our collective efforts to fight terrorism more effective,\" said Avramopoulos, with Dutch Justice Minister Ard van der Steur and Europol Director Rob Wainwright at a press conference announcing the center's creation. Europol said that the ECTC, based in The Hague, would focus on \"tackling foreign fighters, sharing intelligence and expertise on terrorism financing, online terrorist propaganda and extremism, illegal arms trafficking and international cooperation to increase effectiveness and prevention.\" The initiative follows the Paris attacks claimed by the so-called \"Islamic State\" militant group in November, which killed at least 130 people and wounded hundreds more. The assault on the French capital prompted fears of similar attacks across the continent. Europol chief Wainwright said that some 5,000 European nationals had left to fight alongside militant groups in Syria and Iraq, warning that they posed significant threats upon returning to their countries. \"Our ambition is for the ECTC to become a central information hub in the fight against terrorism in the EU, providing analysis for ongoing investigations and contributing to a coordinated reaction in the event of major terrorist attacks,\" said Wainwright. Increased intelligence sharing among EU member states - notably France and Belgium - in the wake of November's attacks led to the agency receiving 2.7 terabytes of information, \"resulting in 800 intelligence leads and more than 1,600 leads on suspicious financial transactions,\" Europol said. The law enforcement agency added that the ECTC's organizational structure would mirror Europol's, allowing for cooperation between counterterrorism authorities in the EU.",

        "story": "German youth ditch enviro interests for economic woes Germany's position as an eco-pioneer could be under threat. A new government survey has found that the country's current generation of 14- to 25-year-olds are less worried about the environment than their elders were. Young Germans are losing interest in environmental issues as they fear for their economic security, according to a government study released on Tuesday. Good living standards and opportunities for self-development are more important to young people than sustainable ecology, according to a report produced by the UBA, Germany's main environmental protection agency, in collobaration with the Environment Ministry. Only 21 percent of 14- to 25-year-olds consider an \"intact environment\" or the \"chance to enjoy nature\" important to living a good life, according to the study, which was based on a survey and focus group interviews. More important factors for a good life include belonging to a family or a community (71 percent), a high standard of living (48 percent) and having the chance to express oneself (39 percent). \"Young people are interested in the environment and do consider an intact nature also important for a good life, but not to the same extent as older people,\" UBA President Maria Krautzberger said, suggesting that branded clothing and electronic products are of more interest to young people. Apathy mixed with worry Despite the newfound eco-apathy, young people's lifestyles are more likely to be environmentally friendly than older people's - whether by accident or design. \"They move around the city and the country in an intelligent way,\" said Krautzberger. \"They use the bike, bus and train, or go on foot; cars don't play nearly as big a role as for adults.\" \"Of course the environment is very important, and I agree that we should try to preserve it, but the fact is that it isn't the highest priority for a lot of people,\" one 15-year-old told the researchers. \"I think it's somehow natural that things like happiness and health for example are more important than some aspects of the environment.\" Though young people rank the environment as low on their list of priorities, it seems that they are aware that the environment is in a bad state - particularly in the rest of the world. Some 94 percent of young people said that the state of the environment worldwide was either \"bad\" or \"very bad,\" while only 30 percent said this of the environment in Germany. Young people are also aware that the lifestyles of people in industrialized nations have an effect on the environment in the rest of the world: Some 84 percent said that high-consumption lifestyles such as those enjoyed in many European countries are at least partly responsible for environmental problems in poorer nations. This appears to have given many a pessimistic outlook. \"It'll probably become more negative in the future,\" one 16-year-old told the study. \"It's true that humanity is getting more conscious of the fact that it's getting worse, and is always looking for alternatives, for example to fossil fuels. But it'll always be a fifty-fifty situation, because something will make it worse, and something else will come along that will make it a bit better, but then it'll get worse again.\" \"I'm aware that my prosperity is based on the exploitation of the environment or the exploitation of other people,\" a respondent said. Economic anxiety Anxiety about the future economy clearly weighs heavier on the minds of young Germans than ecology - and apparently there is also an increased awareness of market pressures. \"The environment and nature do not play a significant role in young people's everyday lives,\" the study concluded. \"Increased pressure to perform, educational pressure and uncertain career perspectives are more pressing challenges.\" But, balanced with worries about prosperity, there was also a concern about the environmental impact of continual economic growth. A majority (69 percent) agreed with the statement, \"When I see that our economy continuing to grow year by year, I wonder: how long can that go well?\" But at the same time, nearly half - 49 percent - also believed that economic growth would actually be necessary to combating climate change. In other words, the study found that young German are stuck between twin anxieties. \"Young people are caught in a dilemma between skepticism toward economic growth and concerns about prosperity,\" the study concluded. \"They display an average level of skepticism toward growth combined with greater-than-average concerns about prosperity. In addition, among young people there is a widespread conviction that ecological and social challenges can only be overcome with growth and prosperity.\"",

        "story": "Germany's new anti-terror units: A paramilitary excess? The German police are upgrading. A new special unit, BFE+, is being trained to counter terror attacks. However, the upgrade mainly serves as a psychological reassurance for the public, says criminologist Rafael Behr. DW: Prof. Behr, why does Germany's federal police need the special BFE+ unit (Beweissicherungs- und Festnahmeeinheit plus, which means \"evidence collection and arrest unit plus\")? Rafael Behr: Well, there are very different ideas among specialists and professionals in the police regarding the need for it. I see two aspects: one of them is symbolic. The symbolic nature of such a unit shows that we are strong; we can respond to attacks on a new scale. And we can react to situations at several crime scenes simultaneously. We can respond by using pervasive weapons and better equipment. That is the symbolic effect. There is also the functional effect; for example, to make it clear that we are prepared for anything. We no longer need to discuss the deployment of the armed forces inside the country [currently banned by the German constitution, the ed.] because we have enough equipment and manpower to handle these attacks that vacillate between crime and war. In addition to the five new special units, which together comprise 250 men, the GSG-9 and riot police have been operating for many years now. Who is responsible for what, in the event of an emergency? This is quite clearly defined, at least bureaucratically. The taking of hostages, terrorist camps and acts of serious crime, fall under the jurisdiction of the Special Operations Command Units (SEK, or SWAT teams) and mobile task forces of the individual states. They are trained and equipped for these tasks. The GSG-9 is responsible for particularly serious attacks, like the one at the Munich Olympics in 1972 or the 1977 plane hijacking in Mogadishu, which was actually the unit's first mission. The riot police (anti-riot police/rapid reaction forces) actually play no role in this context, but we have units for all eventualities, and that is the crucial difference. GSG-9 and SEKs are dynamic intervention units, not investigative units. What is intended now with the BFE+ is to have a unit to launch large-scale manhunts, say, after an attack, when terrorists retreat into hiding, as was the case in Paris. This has drawn attention to a gap because the normal federal police supposedly cannot do this \u00e2\u0080\u0093 although I have my doubts about that. We live in times of terror; terrorists operate with weapons of war, which the police do not possess, and the armed forces, which have these weapons, are not allowed to intervene domestically. So is this a militarization of the police and is it a logical and sensible development? I've noticed for some time that the ideal of a civil police force, which originated in the 1990s, is disappearing more and more, and that the police are diversifying. Of course, we are all familiar with the beat officers on neighborhood patrol, but other work is also done. We are heading towards the other end of the policing spectrum, meaning to the point that it borders on war-like or military action. I would also not object if the Germany army contributed material in the case of terrorist attacks. Why should it not make available special protected vehicles or tanks to transport police forces? This should not be a big problem. Fortunately, emergency situations requiring special forces rarely occur. Would it not be more efficient if the state police and the federal police had more staff and better equipment? Demanding more staff and actually having more staff are two different matters, and although additional staff has been promised, it is still not immediately available. If we now hire 500 more employees in North Rhine-Westphalia or 3,000 more for the federal police, they are merely filling the gap that occurs when older officers retire. Thus, more police does not necessarily mean more security. Professor Rafael Behr is a criminologist and sociology professor at the Hamburg police academy. DW's Volker Wagener conducted this interview.",

A victory would bring Williams her 22nd Grand Slam singles title. Williams defeated Agnieszka Radwanska 6-0 6-4 on Thursday, putting her one step closer to matching Steffi Graf's record of 22 Grand Slam singles titles. \"I'm really excited to be in the final - it just kind of blows my mind right now,\" Williams said, according to the Associated Press. The American proved her prowess almost immediately, breaking Radwanska's serve in the opening and easily defeating her opponent in the first set. After putting up a fight in the second set, Radwanska eventually fell to Williams in the ninth game. Favorite to win Williams' opponent in the final round, seventh-seeded Kerber, defeated her opponent, the Brit Johanna Konta, 7-5 6-2. The two players will go on to face each other on Saturday. Williams, the critics' favorite, has gone on to win the Daphne Akhurst Memorial Cup every time she's made it to the final round. A win for Williams would put her alongside Graf and just behind Australian tennis legend Margaret Court, who holds the world record with 24 Grand Slam titles. blc/jil (AP, Reuters)",

        "story": "Syria: 'Russia not interested in a political solution' UN envoy de Mistrua has announced Syrian peace talk slated to begin this week would be postponed. In an interview with DW, Bassma Kodmani from the Syrian negotiating team blames Russian aggression for talks' collapse. DW: The UN envoy Staffan de Mistrua has said that the peace talks have been suspended, but haven't failed. Would you agree with that assessment? Bassma Kodmani: I would completely agree. We, the High Negotiations Committee, came to Geneva to see if there was a plan to implement humanitarian solutions and settle them before we could start negotiating. The recess in the talks now is simply to say: these obligations have not been met at all, and on top of that, the entire process is being jeopardized by this week's very aggressive air campaign and military operations by the regime, its foreign militias and Russian air support. These operations are unprecedented in their intensity and must have been under preparation for several weeks. So we are wondering: how come there were all these diplomatic exchanges and commitments? So, even while [US Secretary of State] Kerry was talking with [Russian Foreign Minister] Lavrov the last few weeks, were the Russians preparing all along to discredit the US in this very visible and obvious manner by launching this operation just as the talks were supposed to start? That is really a very big question. To us, it seems that this is about settling the whole conflict militarily; they are not interested in a political solution it seems \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that really is the message we have received from Russia. So, just to be clear: You're saying Russia has no interest in peace talks? In the last two months, Moscow was saying that they were looking for a ceasefire and a political process. We don't agree with Russia on the nature of the political process, but we were clear that there must be a political process coupled with a ceasefire, then we would come to the negotiating table. So, it would have been possible to start negotiating, but instead, we saw the air raids. So now, we see that the words we heard from Russia are in total contradiction to its behavior on the ground! The Russian airstrikes, in particular, are pushing back the opposition, which has been losing ground in recent months. Can you still win militarily? The balance of forces on the ground is obviously very unequal. We have three major forces fighting the Free Syrian Army: The Syrian army, Hezbollah and the militias from outside and from Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, you see some ten countries are contributing mercenaries to these militias, as well as Iranian and Russian forces. We are fighting three major forces with just the Free Syrian Army and the limited weapons we have. The misbalance is obvious to everyone! If you try to eliminate the Free Syrian Army, then you eliminate the political process, because you are eliminating the only moderate force committed to a diplomatic process. So the political impact is huge \u00e2\u0080\u0093 as is the humanitarian impact: we're seeing huge numbers of people fleeing as the air raids continue. There is another force on the ground: The Kurdish forces\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 We have Kurdish forces fighting alongside the Free Syrian Army, but the main group \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the PYD \u00e2\u0080\u0093 does have military capabilities, but the problem is that sometimes they fight alongside the regime. So we cannot count on them as part of the opposition. They are opening fronts and helping out on the regime's side when it suits them and then, when it suits them again, they come and talk to the Free Syrian Army. Their agenda doesn't seem reconcilable with the Free Syrian Army. Is the HNC going to stick to its demand that, as a precondition to any talks, the regime has to grant humanitarian access to besieged towns and the end of airstrikes? The humanitarian obligations under international human rights law are very clear: the sieges and starvation of populations are war crimes, killings and torture in prisons are war crimes, the indiscriminate bombings of civilians are war crimes! We want all war crimes to stop \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that is our precondition. A ceasefire is a different story \u00e2\u0080\u0093 dual track ceasefire and political negotiations on the transitional governing body are acceptable to us. That's what we came to Geneva for. As soon as the war crimes end, we can start the actual negotiations on the ceasefire and the transitional governing body, that's clear. What are the next steps? We will wait for what the international partners discuss. We believe that the members of the UN Security Council are entitled to an explanation from Russia about why it torpedoed the process here. DW spoke to Bassma Kodmani, a member of the main opposition umbrella group, the Saudi-backed Syrian High Negotiations Committee, on the line from Geneva. The HNC has demanded that, as a precondition to talks, the regime allow humanitarian access to besieged towns, stop bombing civilians and release thousands of prisoners - some of them children - held in regime jails. This interview was conducted by Naomi Conrad.",

        "story": "Tanzania to drop live TV coverage of parliament Tanzania plans to axe live parliamentary TV broadcasts, angering opposition legislators. Media practitioners and rights activists are still smarting over the closure by the government of a Swahili-language weekly. A move by the government of Tanzania to stop state-owned broadcaster Tanzania Broadcasting Corporation (TBC) from airing live streaming of parliamentary proceedings has triggered strong criticism. Human rights campaigners accuse the government of censorship. The decision to halt the broadcasts came a few days after members of the opposition faulted the government in parliament over its handling of the issue. \"We know the government wants to hide something, but if the problem is indeed the cost, we are willing to foot the bill because our aim is to ensure Tanzanians enjoy their right to see what is going on in the parliament\" said Salum Mwalimu, secretary general of the main Chadema opposition party. The right to information is guaranteed under the Tanzanian constitution, but there is no specific article enshrining freedom of the media. But analysts say media freedom is crucial to democracy, human rights and development since news media provide a basic information link between the government and the people. \"If you deny people the right to get direct information from a reliable source, you will force them to find it from unreliable sources likely to mislead them,\" said Simon Berege, president of the Media Institute of Southern Africa. Minister for Information Nape Nnauye said TBC was halting live streaming of parliament to minimise huge costs which it can no longer afford. \"TBC has been spending about 4.2 billion Tanzanian shillings ($ 2.1 million, 1.9 million euros) each year to foot costs associated with live coverage of the assembly. We have thus decided to stop the coverage,\" he said. Opposition legislators, lawyers and human rights activists expressed disgust at the move, accusing the government of curtailing press freedom and people's right to be informed. \"This is a serious violation of the people's rights to information,\" Zitto Kabwe an opposition legislator from ACT Wazalendo party said. Nnauye has repeatedly used his sweeping powers to warn, punish or completely shut down media organisations critical of the political establishment. Newspaper banned permanently In January 2016, the weekly Swahili-language Mawio newspaper was permanently banned for allegedly publishing 'inflammatory' news and feature articles about the ongoing political impasse in Zanzibar, where the results of a disputed election were annulled after claims of \"violation of electoral law\" by the Electoral Commission. The opposition has dismissed these claims. Western diplomats in Tanzania have expressed concern that the Commission had annulled the vote \"without having produced evidence to substantiate its claim that irregularities had taken place.\" The shutdown of Mawio applied to print and online editions. \"We had resorted all our efforts, time and professional capacities to bring you news and informative features that dared to call a spade a spade; we are shattered,\" Simon Mkina, one of Mawio's editors told DW. Tanzanian authorities have traditionally relied on a web of anti-press laws, including the Newspaper Act of 1976, under which the government can ban publications it considers seditious or keep the press in check. \"In fact this law retains most of the oppressive aspects of colonial laws which were meant to subjugate the colonized people,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Badala Balule, a media expert who has researched media legislation in Tanzania. \"The catch-all legislation enables officials to impose censorship almost at will upon relaying of information which the government deems secret. Prohibiting newspapers without registration is at the whim of a government-appointed official who may refuse registration if he is of the opinion that the publication may threaten national security\" Balule told DW. Balule also gives another example where the absence of a constitutional guarantee for media freedoms is a serious shortcoming. \"Classified information, [a category] which can be applied to any government document, also has its set of penalties, ranging from those imposed on civil servants for giving classified material to those imposed on the media for publishing it,\" he said. A study published in 2013 by the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) said conditions for journalists in Tanzania were worsening, with reporters being harassed or attacked and censoring their own work out of fear of reprisals. Tanzania is a member of the international initiative Open Government Partnership, which according to its website \"aims to secure concrete commitments from governments to promote transparency, empower citizens, fight corruption, and harness new technologies to strengthen governance.\" Some Tanzanians view their country's participation in this scheme as a promising sign. \"I think that as a member of Open Government Partnership, Tanzania ought to conduct its business openly, there's no reason to hide anything,\" said Edith Nyallu, a resident of Dar es Salaam. However, Tanzania has recently passed harsher laws to censor electronic communications and the publication of unofficial statistics. The Statistics Law gives the National Bureau of Statistics sweeping powers to imprison or impose fines of 10 million Tanzanian shillings on journalists who publish data from unofficial sources.",

        "story": "Polish Nobel Laureate Lech Walesa admits to 'mistake' after spy accusations Former Polish President Lech Walesa has denied cooperating with Communist intelligence agencies during the Soviet era. He did, however, admit to making a \"mistake.\" In an entry on his blog on Friday, Lech Walesa denied all accusations of working with security agencies while Poland was a Soviet satellite state. \"I did not cooperate with the security agency. I did not take any money,\" Walesa wrote, adding that he had made a \"mistake.\" He added that he would not reveal details of the \"mistake.\" \"There is a person - a perpetrator, who is still alive who should reveal the truth and I'm counting on it. I had a soft heart,\" the Nobel Laureate said in his microblog. Walesa's comments came a day after Lukasz Kaminski, director of Poland's National Remembrance Institute (IPN), reported about a secret service document signed by Walesa. The IPN is responsible for prosecuting Communist-era crimes. The paper included a commitment to provide information from 1970-1976 and had been signed by Walesa under the codename \"Bolek.\" However, IPN's Kaminski said on Thursday that every historical document had to be verified and an authentic intelligence agency document did not necessarily mean that its content was true. Walesa, currently on a trip to Venezuela, admitted he had signed a commitment to be an informant during the 1970s, but said he never acted on it. A special court cleared him of charges of collaboration 16 years ago. The 72-year-old leader is best known for launching the workers' party Solidarity in 1980, against the wishes of the Communist regime. He served as Poland's first post-Communist president from 1990 to 1995. The leader is still politically active and launched a scathing attack against the government last year, calling for early elections. mg/sms (dpa, AP, AFP)",

        "story": "Long necks, fat bellies, shrill colors: How Florence's 16th-century artists saw people We might not consider them beautiful, but Florence's Mannerism portraits were groundbreaking in art history. Some are being shown in Germany for the first time, at the St\u00c3\u00a4del Museum in Frankfurt. \"Elegant, cultivated, artificial,\" is how curator Bastian Eclercy describes the style of a new generation of Florentine Mannerism artists in the early 16th century. They wanted to set themselves apart from the grand masters of the Renaissance, such as Leonardo, Michelangelo or Raffael. Shrill colors, disproportionate limbs, unusual forms and perspectives were the trademark of art works during this era. Bastian Eclercy calls them \"capricious and extravagant, at times bizarre.\" Numerous significant paintings, designs and sculptures of this era form part of the exhibition \"Maniera. Pontormo, Bronzino and the Florence of the Medici,\" curated by Bastian Eclercy in Frankfurt's St\u00c3\u00a4del Museum. Bronzino's painting \"Portrait of a Lady in Red\" is both starting point and center piece of the exhibition. It's not only one of the most valuable works of art in the museum's possession , but also one of the key works of Florentine portrait painting. The portrait featuring a lady clad in a red dress and holding a small dog on her lap appears sublime and lofty. She looks down at her admirers with an aloof expression on her noble face - an effect purposefully created by Bronzino, the court painter of the Medici. Art on loan from all over the world Painters such as Rosso Fiorentino were more daring in the way in which they dealt with classical motives than, for example, Renaissance painter Raffael. That difference in approach becomes clearly discernible in the exhibition. Whereas Raffael created his work \"Madonna Esterh\u00c3\u00a1zy\" (ca. 1507/08) with soft colors and a well organized and simple structure, Fiorentino's portrait of the Madonna, the child and John (ca. 1515) is more dynamic and cheeky: The facial traits of the two boys are almost reminiscent of a caricature, and the Madonna's transparent dress allows the beholder to sneak a peek at her breasts and belly button. The St\u00c3\u00a4del Museum shows a total of 120 works from museums from all over the world, among them the Paris Louvre, New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art and the State Gallery in Stuttgart, with the aim of presenting the entire range of stylistic variety and the particular obstinacy of Florentine artists. Many of these impressive art works originate in Florence, the center of Mannerism. Jacopo Pontormo's \"Martyrdom of the Ten Thousand,\" which depicts human suffering in a very physical way, is a loan item from the Galleria Palatina. The portrait of \"The Duke Alessandro de' Medici\" by Giorgio Vasari, featuring the Florentine sovereign in a suit of armor, is part of the collection of the world-famous Uffizi Gallery in Florence. Medicis - obsessed with power and fond of culture In the exhibition, the paintings are presented in eight different parts, thus reflecting different chapters in the rich history of the city, while throwing light on the immense influence of the powerful Medici family on the world of art. Another central theme is also the widespread political unrest of the era, including the conquest of Rome by Charles V and the temporary expulsion of the Medici from Florence. Apart from paintings, designs and sculptures, curator Eclercy also made an effort to include architectural aspects of Mannerism in his exhibition. For that purpose, the St\u00c3\u00a4del Museum constructed a copy of the vestibule of the Biblioteca Laurenziana with Michelangelo's famous staircase in a proportion of 1:3. That masterwork had once been commissioned by the Medici Pope Clement VII. How Mannerism got its name Giorgio Vassari was not only a blessed artist and the court painter of the Medicis, but has also gained particular significance for the study of art. That's why a whole chapter has been dedicated to him in the exhibition. The second edition of his main work \"Le Vite de' pi\u00c3\u00b9 eccellenti pittori, scultori, ed architettori\" (The Lives of the most Eminent Painters, Sculptors and Architects),written in 1568, has remained the first systematic description of art history which also contains the first theoretical debates on Mannerism. And Vassari also served as the eponym of this art style: \"Maniera\" (Italian for Mannerism), which is derived from \"mano\" (hand), means \"way\" or \"fashion,\" and describes the individual style of the Mannerists. The exhibition \"Maniera. Pontormo, Bronzino and the Florence of the Medici\" is shown in Frankfurt's St\u00c3\u00a4del Museum from February 24 through June 5, 2016.",

        "story": "Two deadly explosions rock Mogadishu Two explosions have rocked the center of Mogadishu. A Somali police official confirmed that gunmen have also forced their way into a prestigious hotel in the Somali capital. Eyewitnesses reported that the first of the two blasts could be heard 15 kilometers (10 miles) outside of the city on Friday. It reportedly took place at a central hotel in the city and was accompanied by heavy gunfire. A second explosion was later confirmed by a government employee. Residents reported a large plume of smoke rising above the city. Police said a suicide bomber had rammed his car into the SYL hotel's entrance at 7:45 p.m. local time (1645 GMT) and that a number of gunmen had then entered the premises after an exchange of gunfire with hotel guards. There was no definitive information on casualties but the German news agency dpa reported that at least 20 people had died, citing a local government spokesman. Several more were wounded, it said. Police Major Ahmad Ismail told the Reuters news agency that it remained unclear whether the fighters were still inside the hotel. Al-Shabab claims responsibility The SYL hotel, also known as the Somali Youth League hotel, is located across from the presidential palace in Mogadishu and is frequented by government officials and business executives. The Islamic extremist al-Shabab group, which is affiliated with the al Qaeda terrorist network, claimed responsibility for the attack. Earlier this month, the group attempted to bomb a Daallo airlines flight en route from Mogadishu to Djibouti. The blast tore a gaping hole to the plane's fuselage and sucked the attacker out of the plane. Al-Shabab carries out attacks government facilities in Mogadishu on a regular basis, seeking to establish an Islamist state in Somalia. ss/sms (AFP, AP, Reuters)",

        "story": "Russia mulls resuming direct flights to Egypt Russia's top diplomat has announced Moscow's intentions to resume flights to Egypt after 2015's aviation tragedy. Metrojet, the downed aircraft's operator, was banned from undertaking domestic and international flights. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov announced on Wednesday that Moscow was working with Egyptian authorities to resume \"direct air links\" to Egypt, in comments carried by Russia's state-owned TASS news agency. \"We agreed to restore air links as soon as possible, provided the highest security standards are guaranteed for Russian citizens,\" Lavrov said after meeting with Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry in the nation's capital. Moscow banned all direct flights to Egypt in November after a Russian passenger plane was downed over the Sinai Peninsula shortly after taking off from Sharm el-Sheikh, a well-known tourist destination on the Red Sea. The \"Islamic State\"-affiliated militant group Sinai Province claimed responsibility for bringing down the Airbus A321 aircraft by smuggling a bomb onto the passenger plane. In a statement posted online, the militant group said the attack was made in retaliation for Russian airstrikes against \"Islamic State\" targets in Syria. Russian investigators confirmed the plane was brought down by an explosive device, although Egyptian authorities said there was a lack of evidence to prove the militant group's claims. 'Security for our citizens' Lavrov said Russian and Egyptian authorities have been in contact to ensure the necessary security measures have been implemented by Cairo. \"Specific recommendations were formulated. Our specialists are certain they will provide reliable security for our citizens who travel to Egypt and from Egypt by air. The Egyptian side has considered these recommendations and, as far as I understand, were supported in general,\" added Russia's top diplomat. Egypt's Red Sea tourist destinations, including Sharm el-Sheikh and Hurghada, were considered some of the most popular vacation spots for Russian citizens prior to the aviation disaster. Moscow's decision to ban direct civilian flights to Egypt further damaged the country's ailing tourism industry, one of its main sources of foreign currency. Meanwhile, Russia's Federal Air Transport Agency on Wednesday banned Kogalymavia, which operated the downed flight under the name Metrojet, from undertaking international and domestic flights due to \"discrepancies and violations\" following safety inspections, TASS reported.",

        "story": "Obama nominates Merrick Garland to Supreme Court US President Barack Obama has nominated Merrick Garland to serve as the Supreme Court's ninth justice. The president is preparing for a tense battle with Republicans over who will replace the late Antonin Scalia. On Wednesday, President Obama announced his nomination of Garland, the chief judge for the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. At a press conference on the White House lawn, Obama extolled Garland's virtues, including his integrity, modesty and even-handedness, and his attitude \"that all views deserve a respectful ear.\" \"To find someone with such a long career in public service ... who just about everyone not only respects but genuinely likes, that is rare,\" Obama told reporters. \"And it speaks to who Merrick Garland is, not just as a lawyer, but as a man.\" Washington is gearing up for a tense, months-long battle between the White House and the Republican-controlled Senate, which must confirm the nominee. A lot hinges on the choice to replace the late Antonin Scalia - for both Democrats and Republicans. On one side, Democrats want to preserve the Obama administration's liberal agenda by using the opportunity to tilt the Supreme Court in a more left-leaning direction for the first time in generations. On the other side, Republicans are dead-set on ensuring that a replacement stays true to the legacy of Scalia, a revered conservative who died in February. Gearing up for a fight Congressional Republicans have already said they'd refuse to consider Obama's nomination, insisting they would wait until after the presidential election in November before moving forward with the nomination process. During his press conference, Obama spoke out against the Republicans' position, calling it \"unprecedented.\" \"It is tempting to make this confirmation process simply an extension of our divided politics,\" Obama said. \"But to go down that path would be wrong. It would be a betrayal of our best traditions.\" Obama sent an email to his supporters earlier in the day, in which he defended his decision to go forward with the nomination even as the political atmosphere in the country grows more polarized by the day. \"In putting forward a nominee today, I am fulfilling my constitutional duty. I'm doing my job,\" Obama said. \"I hope that our senators will do their jobs, and move quickly to consider my nominee.\" The 63-year-old Garland, considered a moderate, was confirmed to the DC Circuit in 1997 by both Democrats and Republicans.",

        "story": "Welcome into the world It's not all bad news for the planet's plants and animals - while many species are going extinct, fresh ones are also being discovered. DW presents newcomers for 2016. Fancy Indian crabs The discovery of five new species of colorful freshwater crabs in the Western Ghats, India, is certainly good news. The mountains are a biodiversity hotspot in the world, for their rich variety of animals and plants. Unfortunately, there are great threats against them. These freshwater crabs are characterized by bright colors: from silvery grey to luminous pink. As opposed to marine crabs, these species have adapted to terrestrial mode of life and only need a freshwater pool for breeding. Findings on the new crabs were published in the journal \"Zootaxa\" in February 2016. Pictured above, Gubernatoriana thackerayi - named after its discoverer - has especially unique coloration among its relatives. Scarlet embellishes its shell and walking legs, while a flashy orange is reserved for the two pinchers. Casper the octopus Some cephalopods can change the color of their skin as a camouflage technique. This ghostlike octopus, on its side, lacks pigment cells altogether. The new species was found near the Hawaiian island of Necker by zoologists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Social media users couldn't pass up the comparison of the newly discovered animal, and its translucent appearance gained it the nickname Casper. Giant baby Rafflesia is a genus of parasitic plants, the flowers of which are known as the largest in the world and emit an overpowering smell of rotting flesh. Most of the - including the distantly related \"corpse flower\" - are found in southeastern Asia countries such as the Philippines, home to many rare and endangered species. Recently discovered Rafflesia consueloae, on the Philippine island of Luzon, is the smallest of the largest flowers in the world. So small, that it can \"only\" reach a diameter up to 12.7 centimeters when fully extended. It was described and illustrated in the journal PhytoKeys in February 2016. Something is shining over there In the 21st century, more than 100 new species of reptiles and amphibians have been found in India. A team of researchers from the United Kingdom and India - lead by David Gower from the Natural History Museum in London - has recently added a new name to the list. The \"Khaire's black shieldtail\" has been described in a paper published in the scientifc journal \"Zootaxa.\" In the wild, attractive colors are often linked to poisonous animals. However, despite its appearence, the newfound species belongs to a genus of non-venomous shieldtail snakes. Melanophidium khairei is the first species described in this genus for 144 years. 'Zorro' unmasked The cousin to piranhas pictured above is vegetarian, feeding on seeds, fruit and vegetation. Found in a tributary of the Amazon River, in western Brazil, the new fish has a length of about 45 centimeters. It has been named Myloplus zorroi, combining the names of the fictional black masked character Zorro and a renowned fish researcher. The finding was published in the scientific journal \"ZooKeys\" on March 7, 2016. Tarantula rock star Scientists in the United States have recently identified 14 new species of tarantula - among them, Johnny Cash. This spider has black hair, and was found near the prison were Cash recorded his famous song \"Folsom Prison Blues,\" in California. It was described in the scientific journal \"ZooKeys\" on February 4, 2016. In Australia, the recent discovery of an endemic spider has also attracted scientists. It uses water vibrations to move and trap aquatic prey such as fish or toads. Less high-profile than its glamorous relative, it has simply been named Brian. Widespread neighborhood More than 7,000 known species of amphibians exist worldwide. A thumbnail-sized frog and the Honnametti bush frog in India; the Asian litter frog in China; and a frog with yellow eyebrows in Colombia have been among the 2016 newcomers. To top it off, the identity of a rare tree frog - with a novel way of feeding its young - has been verified. It was rediscovered in north India after thought to be extinct for more than a century.",

        "story": "Australian stock exchange boss steps down The head of Australia's stock exchange resigned Monday amid allegations of bribery at a gambling group he previously ran. Elmer Funke Kupper had been CEO of the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) since October 2011. Funke Kupper has also taken a leave of absence from the board of Tabcorp, Australia's largest bookmaker, which is currently being investigated by the Australian Federal Police. The allegations center on a payment of $151,460 (134,535 euros) to the bookmaker by relatives of Cambodia's Prime Minister Hen Sen. Tabcorp, a publicly listed company, had reportedly been looking to expand into the country. Funke Kupper told the media last week that he had no recollection of such a payment during his four years at the helm of Tabcorp, which said it did not pursue the expansion opportunity in Cambodia. ASX chairman Rick Holliday-Smith said the board \"accepted that Elmer wanted to direct his full focus to the investigations which may be made into the Tabcorp matter - and not have them interfere with the important role of leading the ASX\". A statement by the ASX announced that Rick Holliday-Smith will take over Funke Kupper's duties until a replacement is found. AFP, ASX (hch/bea)",

        "story": "Russian court sentences Ukrainian pilot Nadezhda Savchenko to 22 years for murder The Ukrainian pilot received her sentence a day after being found guilty by a Russian court over the killing of two journalists. Savchenko has been at the center of the conflict between Kyiv and pro-Moscow separatists. The 34-year-old Savchenko was sentenced to 22 years in jail after the court found her guilty of giving the coordinates used in an attack that killed two journalists who worked for the Russian state TV broadcaster VGTRK. Savchenko has become one of the most famous faces of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine after she was taken into custody by pro-Moscow rebels in June 2014. Following her arrest, Kyiv granted her diplomatic immunity by appointing her as a representative to the Council of Europe. However, Moscow argued she still had to stand trial, as the alleged crime occurred after the appointment was made. She has denied any wrongdoing, and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has called on Moscow to return her to the country. Russian officials have suggested they are open to handing Savchenko over as part of a prisoner swap. The pilot responded to the sentencing in court by singing aloud the Ukrainian national anthem. Complicit in murder Savchenko was also found guilty of illegally crossing the Russian border. On Monday, the Russian court declared that Savchenko, \"having skills of military training, and experience in military actions in Iraq, while on a holiday, on her own choice in order to participate in the armed conflict in Ukraine's southeast, came to the Aidar batallion under commander Sergey Melnichuk, which was located in the town of Schastye in the Luhansk region.\" The court said Melnichuk was primarily responsible for the killings, and that he'd supplied the pilot with the gear and equipment. Savchenko has called the accusations a \"lie,\" something also echoed by both Brussels and Washington, who believe the pilot was abducted by pro-Moscow rebels and falsely charged. Russia has been accused of backing the rebellion in the eastern part of the country, which erupted after demonstrators forced President Viktor Yanukovich out of office in February 2014. The ensuing conflict has led to the deaths of more than 9,000 people, according to the UN. blc/msh (AP, AFP, Reuters, dpa)",

        "story": "Trump vows to undo Iran deal, NATO funding at AIPAC meeting Leading US Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has received a lukewarm response from pro-Israeli advocates. The mogul toned down his fiery rhetoric for the annual AIPAC conference. In a speech to an influential pro-Israel lobby on Monday, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump vowed to take apart the Iran nuclear deal and strengthen ties with Jerusalem. At the meeting of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), Trump also promised to push back against United Nations interference in Israeli interests. \"My number one priority is to dismantle the disastrous deal with Iran,\" said the Republican front-runner. In a change from his usual firebrand off-the-cuff speeches, Trump made the unconventional decision to read from a teleprompter at Monday's event. According to DW's Richard Walker, the real estate mogul's assertion that he had studied the Iran deal more than anyone else garnered a degree of derision from spectators, but they warmed to him when he promised to revoke the agreement. \"I have been in business a long time. I know deal making. And let me tell you, this deal is catastrophic. For America, for Israel and for the whole of the Middle East,\" Trump said. He then reaffirmed his commitment to side with Israel in peace negotiations with Palestine, promising to resist UN attempts to pressure Israel. \"The Palestinians must come to the table knowing that the bond between the United States and Israel is unbreakable,\" he said. Trump: US can't afford NATO Shortly before addressing the AIPAC event, Trump told an CNN interviewer that he would also move the US embassy to Jerusalem and cut American funding to NATO. \"The fact is I would like to see it moved, I would like to see it in Jerusalem,\" the Republican candidate said. Both Palestine and Israel consider the ancient city their capital, prompting most nations, including the US, to station their missions in the less controversial Tel Aviv. Furthering questioning long-standing Washington policy, Trump also swore to reduce spending to defense organization NATO if elected. \"We are paying disproportionately. It's too much and frankly it's a different world than it was when we originally conceived of the idea,\" he said. \"We have to reconsider. Keep NATO, but maybe we have to pay a lot less toward NATO itself.\" Trump even went so far as to say he'd work closer with Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose authoritarian policies in eastern Ukraine have seen tensions with NATO reach their most dire level since the end of the Cold War.",

        "story": "Europa League finalist Dnipro among three clubs handed European ban Having defied all odds to reach the Europa League final last year, Ukrainian side Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk have now been banned from European competition over financial violations. Last year's Europa League finalist Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk of Ukraine has been named among three clubs banned from European competition by UEFA over financial issues. UEFA announced on Thursday that Dnipro, Azerbaijan's Inter Baku and Romania's Targu Mures would be excluded from the next European competition for which they qualify in the next three seasons. All three clubs had been ordered by UEFA to clear \"overdue payables\" and told they would be excluded from Europe unless they cleared those debts by January 31. \"I did not imagine this could have happened to the club that was playing in the Europa League final half a year ago,\" Dnipro head coach Myron Markevych, whose side knocked out Ajax and Napoli on route to the Europa League final last year, which they lost 3-2 to Sevilla, told the \u00e2\u0080\u009cSegodnya\u00e2\u0080\u009d newspaper. \"How could it happen? I am not aware of the president's plans and how he sees the future of the club. We've got new debts. I know the foreign players are making new complaints. We have not been paid for four months at all. \"This is very bad for us,\" Markevych added. \"We have been playing on the European stage for 10 years and now we have been kicked off for something which is not the fault of the players and coaches.\u00e2\u0080\u009d UEFA gave no statement on another Romanian club, Astra Giurgiu, which had been given the same January 31 deadline.",

        "story": "Death toll mounts in Kolkata flyover crash as rescuers search for survivors Many people have died and more than 150 have been injured after a flyover collapsed in the eastern Indian city. Rescuers are meanwhile working tirelessly to find people buried under the debris. At least 21 people have died and around 60 injured people have been admitted to nearby hospitals, dpa news agency reported. The incident occurred on Thursday morning after 80 meters (260 feet) of the flyover collapsed in Kolkata's busy Burrabazar area. \"The guilty will not be spared. We will take action against builders. This is a very serious incident,\" Mamata Banerjee, chief minister of West Bengal, told reporters. \"But our first priority is to rescue the trapped, treat the injured in hospital and console the families of those who have died,\" she added. India's Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, expressed his condolences on Twitter. Flyover collapse an 'act of God' Some 400 army personnel, including engineers and medical workers, were deployed at the site. The chief of the disaster response force, O.P. Singh, said the operation was a \"very very challenging task.\" Workers used bulldozers, saws, special cameras and sniffer dogs to find survivors. IVCRL, the construction company building the flyover, said it was missing 30-40 people who had been working on the site. \"We completed nearly 70 percent of the construction work without any mishap,\" IVCRL's senior official K.P. Rao told officials. However, the company was widely criticized after another senior employee, named only as Dilip, described the incident as \"a total act of God.\" Many Indians took to Twitter to express their frustration at the hazard. Sonal criticized the builders for calling the tragedy an \"act of God.\" This user criticized the corrupt political system and negligence that led to the flyover crash. mg/rc (AP, dpa)",

        "story": "IMF warns global recovery 'too slow, too fragile' International Monetary Fund (IMF) chief Christine Lagarde has ramped up her calls for stronger policies by the world's economies to boost growth, warning that downside risks would only increase without decisive action. In a speech at the Goethe University in Frankfurt, Germany, on Tuesday, Christine Lagarde outlined specific policy actions to spur global growth, warning that the recovery from the 2008-2009 financial crisis \"remains too slow, too fragile.\" \"Let me be clear: We are on alert, not alarm. There has been a loss of growth momentum,\" Lagarde said, adding that if policymakers across the world would act together to confront the challenges, \"the positive effects on global confidence will be substantial.\" The IMF chief urged the United States to raise its minimum wage, expand tax credits for the working poor and improve family leave benefits. She also called on European countries to implement better training and employment-matching policies to help reduce unemployment among young people. Moreover, emerging economies should cut fuel subsidies and boost social spending, she demanded, while countries with high and growing debts and elevated borrowing costs should pursue further fiscal consolidation. Risks mounting Her remarks come less than two weeks before senior ministers, central bankers and other policymakers from the IMF's 188 member countries gather in Washington for the IMF and World Bank spring meetings to assess the health of the world economy. The global emergency lender has already indicated it will cut its current 2016 global growth forecast of 3.4 percent next week when it publishes fresh forecasts at the meeting in Washington. During her speech in Frankfurt, Largarde said weak global growth was \"exacerbated\" by China's relative economic slowdown, lower commodity prices and the prospect of financial tightening for many countries. \"Emerging markets had largely driven the recovery and the expectation was that the advanced economies would pick up the 'growth baton.' This has not happened,\" she said, adding that other risks, such as uncertainties from terrorist attacks or \"the silent threat of global epidemics\" were also a factor. Lagarde also warned against resorting to protectionist policies, as the US presidential candidates publicly questioned free trade agreements and Europe sought to rein in free movement in response to the refugee crisis. \"To some, the answer is to look inward ... to close borders and to retreat into protectionism,\" she observed. \"But history has told us - time and again - this would be a tragic course.\" Greek debt crisis re-emerges In her remarks, Lagarde did not mention negotiations between the IMF, European lenders and Greece for a new bailout program for the heavily indebted eurozone country. After the whistleblowing Web site Wikileaks published an apparent transcript of a controversial IMF conference call over the weekend, Lagarde denied on Monday that IMF staff might threaten to pull out of the Greek bailout as a negotiating tactic to force more European debt relief for Greece. The issue forced the German government to again rule out debt relief for Greece in an effort to rally skeptical members of chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative party behind the third Greek bailout package worth 86 billion euros ($97 billion). uhe/cjc (dpa, AFP, Reuters)",

        "story": "New clashes erupt between Armenia, Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh Clashes between Azerbaijani and Armenian forces have killed at least 13 people in a third day of fighting over Nagorno-Karabakh. Turkey is backing Baku as the worst violence in decades hits the disputed territory. US Secretary of State John Kerry spoke to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov Monday to review efforts to stop the violence that has broken out along the Nagorno-Karabakh line of conflict and how to get Armenia and Azerbaijan to resume talks. Russia and the West have scrambled to call for an end to the fighting. But Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan - a staunch ally of Azerbaijan - insisted that the Armenian-controlled region was rightfully part of Azerbaijan. \"Karabakh will one day return to its original owner. It will be Azerbaijan's,\" Erdogan said in televised remarks. Separatist authorities in Karabakh - which claim independence but are supported by Armenia - said three civilians and two more soldiers were killed in fierce shelling. And Azerbaijan said three of its troops were killed overnight when Armenian forces shelled its positions using mortars and grenade launchers. This comes as Armenia warns of a wider war against its neighbor. \"A further escalation of military actions could lead to unpredictable and irreversible effects, up to a widespread war,\" Armenian President Serzh Sargsyan said at a meeting with an envoy of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Interfax news agency reported. \"This will naturally affect the security and stability of not only the South Caucasus but also Europe,\" Sargsyan was quoted as saying. In an apparent reference to Erdogan's bullish statements, the Russian foreign ministry said: \"Lavrov and Kerry condemned attempts by certain external players to instigate confrontation around Karabakh.\" Decades of conflict in region Ethnic Armenian separatists backed by Armenia seized control of mountainous Nagorno-Karabakh - a majority ethnic Armenian region - during the twilight days of the Soviet Union. The foes have never signed a peace deal despite the 1994 ceasefire and some 30,000 people have lost their lives in the conflict. Energy-rich Azerbaijan, whose military spending exceeds Armenia's entire state budget, has repeatedly threatened to take back the breakaway region by force. jar/bw (AFP, Reuters, dpa)",
