The about-face came in the wake of cost-cutting measures and a joint venture with China. PSA Peugeot Citroen said Wednesday its operating profit in the first six months of 2014 totaled 477 million euros ($640 million), reversing a loss of 100 million euros in the same period one year ago. With 1.54 million cars sold from January to June - a year-on-year increase of 5.5 percent - revenues amounted to 27.6 billion euros. Depressed by currency fluctuations, the figure was slightly lower than last year, PSA Peugeot Citroen. Free cash flow, an important measure for auto makers, improved to 1.7 billion euros from just 203 million a year ago. \"The commitment of all the partners at the group to the Back in the Race strategic plan allowed PSA Peugeot Citroen to reap the first results of its turnaround,\" Chief Executive Carlos Tavares said in a statement.\" Tavares unveiled a four-year turnaround strategy earlier this year aimed at boosting profitability by producing fewer models and expanding sales in emerging markets. In addition, the French state and Chinese carmaker Dongfeng became shareholders in PSA, effectively rescuing the company after losses of more than 7 billion euros in the previous two years. PSA's recovery was led by the group's auto division which had logged an operating profit of 7 million euros. This marked a significant improvement over a loss of 538 million euros in the first half of 2013. Sales grew mainly in European car markets, up 11.7 percent, and in China. In Russia and Latin America, losses were also curbed. uhe/cjc (Reuters, AFP, dpa)",

        "story": "Germans take to the streets to protest anti-Islamization movement Anti-Islamist 'Pegida' supporters have had to cancel their appearance in Cologne, where thousands of demonstrators showed solidarity with migrants. However, thousands of anti-Islamists showed up in the city of Dresden. 20,000 residents in Cologne and neighboring areas gathered on the streets to demonstrate against the anti-immigrant movement, Pegida. Overwhelming support for immigrants and asylum seekers in Cologne led to the Pegida demonstrators cancelling their appearance. Citizens in Cologne shouted out in jubilation, the sole goal of their demonstration being to prevent the Kögida- the name of the anti-Islam movement in Cologne- from marching in their city. Lights out in Cologne Bridges over the Rhine in Cologne and the Cologne Cathedral were plunged into darkness as demonstrators of the anti-Islamic movement gathered to protest the influx of refugees into Germany. People displayed banners saying \"We are the people\" and \"Nazis, out!\" \"We will not let a racist mob run free on Cologne's streets,\" a pamphlet said, referring to the march and rioting by the group \"Hooligans against Salafists\" last October in Cologne. Around 5,000 protesters gathered in a Berlin neighborhood, calling for more tolerance. Berlin's integration leder Dilek Kolat of the Social Democrats called the Pegida- an acronym for Patriotic Europeans against the Islamization of the West- \"an attack on peaceful co-existence in our society.\" Citizens in Munich and Stuttgart also came out into the streets. Around 1,000 people gathered in Munich's Sendlinger Tor to voice their displeasure against the anti-immigrant movement. Pegida still strong in Dresden Germany's eastern city of Dresden witnessed a strong presence of the anti-Islamists with around 18,000 Pegida supporters, who gather on Mondays, rallying against what they considered a threat to German and European values. Anti-Pegida activists in Dresden offered concrete proposals for negotiation to Pegida demonstrators for the first time on Monday. mg/bw (dpa, EPD)",

        "story": "'Infrastructure can drive up disaster vulnerability' says UN climate expert Collapsed bridges, unsafe power grids, interrupted water supply: Weak infrastructure can turn natural hazards into disasters. In an interview with DW, UN expert Matthias Garschagen talks about the 2016 World Risk Report. Each year, the World Risk Report (WRR) and its World Risk Index (WRI) analyze vulnerability of over 170 countries to natural hazards. They do so to identify disaster hotspots and risk indicators. The United Nations University's Institute for Environment and Human Security publishes the report jointly with German NGO Bündnis Entwicklung Hilft and in cooperation with the University of Stuttgart. Now in its sixth edition, the annual report and index highlight several key areas: level of exposure (likelihood of a natural disaster), vulnerability (level of susceptibility), how well a society can cope (resilience) and what preventive measures can be taken. DW spoke to scientific lead Matthias Garschagen about the newest developments and why a reliable infrastructure is vital to a country's capacity to cope with hazards. The interview was conducted by Anke Rasper. Deutsche Welle: How high is the risk for disasters at this moment in time? Matthias Garschagen: That's a tricky question. In principle, particular parts of countries have a higher risk of suffering from disasters related to natural hazards. In the past days and weeks, we were able to see this in several parts of the world where we have floods and storms - also here in Europe. These risks are also increasing with regional environmental degradation and issues like climate change. The risk is also changing globally due to the role of vulnerabilities. It's not only about assessing the intensity of natural hazards but how susceptible societies are when being hit by those events. And the short-term and long-term capacity of those societies to deal with them. What are the global hotspots for risk at the moment? It's clearly sub-Saharan Africa, East Asia as well as, to a certain extent, South Asia and Latin America. If you were to decompose risk into its main components of the hazard exposure on the one hand and societal vulnerability on the other, the hotspots would shift to a certain degree. As you said, sub-Saharan Africa remains one of the world regions with a tremendous amount of risk and vulnerability. Can you talk about a few countries as examples? Mainly Western Africa - countries like Togo, Benin and Nigeria - countries with a high exposure to floods and droughts and, to a certain level, sea-level rise. They are also facing high vulnerability. They have many development challenges, like healthcare, infrastructure, quality of the environment, which drive up the vulnerability. Speaking of infrastructure: That's the emphasis of this year's report. What role do logistics and infrastructure play for risk and vulnerability? Infrastructure plays a key role for the question of whether a hazard turns into a disaster. This can go along two lines. On the one hand, infrastructure is of key importance for relief and response work. In the case of a flood, for example, you need reliable streets, bridges and airports in order to get support and relief into the right places quickly. Infrastructure also plays an increasing role for vulnerability in the first place. Can you give an recent example where infrastructure played an important role? The Nepal earthquake is a good one. Kathmandu's international airport was not up to dealing with the quantity of incoming aid. That was the main transport nodal point to get the relief work going. And the many damaged streets and bridges also hindered the flow of items from the airport. Would a rich country been in a better position to recover faster? Yes, and better able to cope with the impacts in the first place. If you compare Nepal to Switzerland, for example, the data clearly shows that Switzerland has, person capita and person square kilometer, a higher number of paved roads and bridges. It also has more helicopters and alternate airports and airstrips. All of this helps with short-term disaster response. Having economic buffers also makes a huge difference in terms of recovery. Can infrastructure in poorer countries be improved in ways that make it less susceptible to disasters? There are several ways. What is helpful is to look at the different dimensions of risk, which we also propose in the report. To start with exposure: Infrastructure development is done in non-exposed areas. In other words, if you do future planning for a new airport or power plant, you ought to think about flood scenarios in the context of climate change - not just in the present, but 10 or 20 years in the future. Or if you build a new nuclear power plant, you have to plan for the next 50 years. Could it be exposed to floods in 20 years? That is the first step. The second step is susceptibility, in terms of the fragility of a building. Are there building codes in place in order for buildings to withstand earthquakes? And, even more importantly, are those building codes enforced? In the Sichuan earthquake in China, the major problem was not a lack of building codes but that they were not adhered to due to corruption and poor enforcement. That's why a lot of the school buildings caved in, which massively contributed to the high death toll among school children. Thirdly, how can infrastructure cope with certain situations? Hospitals are increasingly aware of alternate evacuation routes in the event of a major flood, even here in Central Europe. Right now those topics are on the agenda, but more conceptually than practically. What are you hoping to achieve with the report? The World Risk Report has two main objectives. The first one is to raise awareness among the next generation of risk managers, politicians, etc., that disaster risk also encompasses building regulations, law enforcement, the level of corruption and so forth. All these things can drive up vulnerability and susceptibility towards these hazards. Secondly, we give recommendations as to what can be done for long-term risk reduction. One key recommendation is to be aware that infrastructure is much more than the technical solutions. It's also about institutions and the humans who run it. This cannot be stressed enough. Too often we focus on the export of technology and know-how in the international community, not so much on the institutions around them. Did you select the infrastructure and logistics emphasis because Habitat, the United Nations Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development, is coming up in October? That's part of it - transportation and communications nodal points are often located in cities. Plus humanity is increasingly living in cities and increasingly depends on infrastructure. To understand the interface with disaster risks is quite timely and important. What role do disasters and infrastructure play in urban settings? Infrastructure does not only play a large role for cities themselves but for societies at large. If communication nodal points or service stations go down in urban areas, where between 50 percent and two-thirds of societies live, the rest of the country will be affected as well. A power outage can hinder the flow of relief items to remote villages. One other key thing is that we should not to pin our hopes too much on technology. Smartphones, drones, social media and the like can do a lot, but what's most needed is basic infrastructure like a functioning road network, bridges and airports. Without these in place, no smartphone in the world can help you to get the right relief to remote places affected by landslides and floods. This interview was condensed for clarity. Dr. Matthias Garschagen is the scientific lead of the 2016 World Risk Report. He is the head of vulnerability assessment, risk management and adaptive planning, at the United Nations University's Institute for Environment and Human Security in Bonn, Germany.",

        "story": "'US and Germany can't afford chasm of trust' The alleged NSA monitoring of Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile could have serious consequences. The EU should make the first step in raising the bar on transparency, former Hillary Clinton adviser Ben Scott told DW. Ben Scott is currently program director at the Berlin-based think tank Stiftung Neue Verantwortung (New Responsibility Foundation). He served as an adviser on technology and foreign policy to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in Barack Obama's first administration. DW: US intelligence stands accused of having spied on German Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile. Berlin is upset and Merkel has already called US President Obama to discuss the matter. How big is the damage? Ben Scott: If it's true that the National Security Agency has tapped the phone of the German chancellor then that is a pretty serious political problem. And it indicates the misalignment between US American and European expectations on appropriate practices, on intelligence and foreign surveillance. Were you surprised at all when you heard about the allegations? Yes - pretty surprised. Tapping the phone of a world leader is something that I think is a decision you don't take lightly and has a lot of consequences if it is exposed. How will or should Germany react to this? We've already seen the initial reaction which is instant outrage and demands for explanation at every level all the way up to the top. But I think that the most important medium-term response is not just a demand to stop surveilling the chancellor's phone but a demand for an engagement government to government so that we'll have a policy solution. This incident is reflective of a larger division between the two countries' expectations and policies on surveillance. And I think it requires discussion and realignment because the US and Germany of course are long-time and very important allies. They can not afford to be separated by a big chasm of trust. What are the implications in terms of Trans-Atlantic relations? I think it speaks for the need for Trans-Atlantic engagement on these issues and a resolution about what standard practice should look like between allies when it comes to mass surveillance technologies. The irony of the (Edward) Snowden revelations is that we now know quite a bit about the NSA's practices. We don't know those facts about the German intelligence agency or the French intelligence agency. And if Europe wants to raise the bar and say this is the new standard for digital surveillance and this is appropriate and this is what's not and we demand the that United States comply, they have to be much more transparent about what they themselves do. There is no minimum standard for the protection of privacy among European states. Pretty much every country protects its own citizens at a much higher standard than they protect foreign citizens and I think one of the first steps has to be that the EU comes up with a common agreement amongst its member states. Do you think it's actually possible that EU members amongst themselves or the EU and the US can agree on a no-spy deal? I think it is. If NATO allies can organize themselves to go to war together, they can certainly decide to stop spying on one another. It's a question of political will and it's a question I think of a public debate of the costs and benefits of surveillance on your friends. What are the benefits that are so important to one side or the other that it's worth risking the political damage if exposed. And I think we should be careful to not put all the blame on Washington because it's clear from reading between the lines of all the stories that many European counties are doing very similar things - they simply don't have the capabilities the NSA does. How do you think the US will react to this? Does it register in Washington that the spying scandal is causing major damage in diplomatic ties with its allies? If hasn't registered yet, it is now. And I think that there will be a reaction of some kind. You've already seen President Obama make several statements about the reevaluation of surveillance policy, about making hard decision about what's really necessary in counter terrorism and what can be scaled back. He made some comments in his speech in the UN general assembly which I think are promising that the White House sees a need for reform and realignment with Europe. But what that looks like specifically remains to be seen. Is it even possible to roll back the clock here? Isn't it a fact that surveillance simply has become - in a way - so easy that intelligence services will always be tempted? I think that we have lots of technologies that would enable us to do things that we should not do. Whether it's digital surveillance or the use of powerful weapons. But that's why we have laws in democratic societies and I am confident that if the White House and the US congress changed the law and restricted the NSA from a practice that permits surveilling the German chancellor for example - then the NSA would stop doing that. The NSA has restrictions on what they do now and I think that these are honored or at least they attempt to honor them. Those screws could be tightened, the programs could be restricted further and the NSA would react appropriately. And I think so would European intelligence agencies. I think the general rule of thumb of any intelligence agency - at least in the West - is that if it's technically possible, legal and financially affordable, then it's happening. And if you're going to make changes, the place to change is the legal side. If you're going to make certain things illegal you have to be very clear where the lines are - otherwise no one is going to believe you. So there is the legal problem and the problem of trust. You not only have to change the laws to reset the lines to where they should be. You have to persuade people that it's real and that your oversight and accountability is meaningful.",

        "story": "MoU not enough to protect Indonesian maids Indonesia and Malaysia have signed an MoU to revise an agreement protecting the basic rights of domestic workers in Malaysia. It will lift a ban on Indonesian domestic workers put in place after a series of abuse cases. The new labor agreement between Indonesia and Malaysia is expected to improve working conditions for Indonesian domestic workers in Malaysia. The Indonesian Labor Minister, Muhaimin Iskandar, and the Malaysian Human Resources Minister, Datuk Dr. S. Subramaniam, have recently signed the revision in Bandung, Indonesia. Roostiawati, an Indonesian labor official, explains that the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between Indonesia and Malaysia is to ensure all salaries are paid using bank transfers and that the maids have access to communication. \"The migrant workers are to keep their passports instead of giving them to their employers, as has been commonplace. This is a basic human right. The maids are to be given one day off every week and their salaries have to be paid every month via bank transfer,\" Roostiawati explains. Long list of abuses Rights group say that every year hundreds of maids lodge complaints against their employers ranging from physical abuse to nonpayment of salaries. Some Indonesian maids were reportedly being forced to work up to 14 hours a day, seven days a week. The newly signed amendments also resolve the issue of minimum wage. According to the new agreement, salaries of Indonesian migrant workers must comply with minimum wages in their home regions. Anis Hidayah, Executive Director of the Indonesian NGO Migrant Care, criticizes that decision. She says that minimum wage paid to Indonesian domestic workers should not be lower than the standards in Malaysia. She believes that a standard for minimum wages is \"very important.\" Obstacles Officials from Indonesia and Malaysia will also set up a joint task force to monitor the implementation of the MoU’s terms. But Anis Hidayah is pessimistic that the joint task force will be able to do its work as maids are regarded as private sector workers In Malaysia. \"What kind of mechanism will the government use to ensure that the amendments are implemented? Are they going to visit every home? How can they be certain that the maids are allowed to keep their passports? Or that they will get a day off every week and get proper access to communication?\" Malaysia’s rapid economic growth has led to an influx of foreign workers, especially foreign domestic workers. Official estimates put the number of Indonesian maids working in Malaysia at around 200,000. In 2009, Indonesia issued a ban on sending domestic maids to Malaysia after many incidents of mistreatment were reported. The signing of the new Memorandum of Understanding between Indonesia and Malaysia will lift the two year freeze. Author: Ayu Purwaningsih / zr Editor: Sarah Berning",

        "story": "Bhopal - an endless disaster Thousands died in the central Indian city three decades ago in one of the world's worst industrial accidents. DW takes a look at the tragedy and its impact on the local population. \"They are coming back,\" says the 46-year-old Rihana referring to the reporters and camera crews who regularly visit J.P. Nagar, a slum in the central Indian city of Bhopal. The world's attention is focusing again on this city, particularly on the anniversary of one of the world's worst industrial disasters. Sitting alongside other survivors, Rihana plans campaigns to mark the 30th anniversary of the gas disaster which claimed the lives of thousands. \"My eyes burned as if someone had hurled chili powder,\" she recalls, adding that \"my stomach burned as if it were on fire.\" Rihana suffered the whole night from acute cough. Her two elder brothers ran away and survived the tragedy. Rihana, however, decided to stay with her parents and little brother in their hut. She was the only one who survived that night. Over 20,000 deaths On that fateful night 30 years ago, Rihanna inhaled the highly toxic methyl isocyanate (MIC) gas, a pesticide. In humans, MIC affects the mucous membranes and causes corrosion of the internal organs. The US firm Union Carbide had produced the pesticide in its plant in Bhopal since the early 1970s until that Sunday evening in 1984, when around 30 tons of the highly toxic gas leaked from the plant. The white smoke billowed through the streets of the nearby slums surrounding the plant and exposed their residents to the deadly gas. While more than 20,000 people died, hundreds of thousands suffered from gas-related injuries or diseases such as lung diseases, eye problems and high blood pressure. To this day, many people still suffer from chronic health issues. But this is only the one side of the disaster. Poisoned groundwater The other side of the tragedy began earlier. Even before the gas disaster, Union Carbide dumped its toxic waste directly behind the factory. The hazardous chemicals seeped from the old, abandoned pesticide plant directly into the groundwater. Several tests conducted by environmental activists revealed the presence of arsenic, benzene and heavy metals that are several times higher than the World Health Organization limits. Above all, it is the residents of the slums - whose wells and water pumps are located directly behind the wall of the abandoned Union Carbide plant - who face the consequences. Most of the wells, however, are now officially closed. \"My son was born in 1988, four years after the disaster,\" Rihana told DW, explaining that \"ever since he was eight years old, he has been sick. He first contracted tuberculosis. He now suffers from serious kidney problems.\" He should have undergone an operation, but Rihana lacked the money to pay for it. At that time, she had no idea what would happen to them. US group sees no blame The victims have only received compensation on one occasion. In 1989, the US company and the Indian government agreed to an out-of-court settlement to pay compensation amounting to some 470 million USD. Many victims, however, complain that the money has never reached them. At that time, Rihana received 25,000 rupees – equivalent to 400 USD today – for a lifetime of suffering. While she has been suffering from breathlessness since the day of the tragedy, her husband was diagnosed of having an edema in his lungs years ago. The chemical company Union Carbide now belongs to Dow Chemical. Even 30 years after the tragedy, the US-based company argues that the plant was in Indian hands at the time of the disaster. \"The plant was built and operated by Indians in India,\" said the company's spokesperson Tomm F. Sprick. US courts have also agreed with this view and declared that the responsibility for the tragedy lies with the Indian authorities. Sprick, however, did not respond to the question of who should be made responsible for the pollution of the ground water, and he instead referred to the website created specifically for this topic. On the website, the company cites a study that concludes that there has been no trace of contaminated ground water outside the factory premises. Furthermore, the government of the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh has assumed responsibility of the site since 1998, the website noted, adding that Union Carbide has nothing more to do with the issue. After years of protests by activists and a court ruling, Indian politicians have recently turned their attention to the issue. Most people living in J.P. Nagar now have access to clean drinking water. Nevertheless, legal proceedings as to whether Union Carbide should be made accountable for the contamination of the area, among other things, are still pending before both Indian and US courts. \"That's already something,\" said Rihana. \"But I cannot afford the surgery of my son,\" she added. A week after we met Rihana, her 24-year-old son died due to the kidney infection. For him, help came too late.",

        "story": "Rampant Bayern dismiss United's slump ahead of Quarter-Final Pep Guardiola's side are familiar with the \"favorites\" label - but the Spanish coach is not comfortable with the tag. Bayern head to a crisis-hit Manchester United in a bid to aid their progression to the last-four. Bastian Schweinsteiger could have been lining up for the team wearing red Tuesday night. But instead, the 29-year-old has become the first player under the age of 30 to have won seven Bundesliga championships at Bayern. If you add a further six German Cup winners medals, four other German domestic honors and a Champions League trophy - plus two runner-up finishes - then there might not be much room left on Schweinsteiger's mantel piece. Yet, Schweinsteiger was written off as a player on the decline after a problematic ankle injury which has become a nuisance for the midfielder. He underwent surgery twice in less than five months, but made a recovery during the club's recent winter training camp in Qatar. Since then, the German has wound back the clock, showing the same combination of tenacity, commitment and passing qualities that cemented his place in the middle of the park in the first place. With Thiago Alcantara on the sidelines for both legs following an anterior cruciate ligament injury sustained in Saturday's 3-3 draw at Hoffenheim, Schweinsteiger's importance to the team has increased tenfold. Losing the man who makes Bayern tick in a possession sense is bad enough, so Schweinsteiger will be key at Old Trafford. Bayern Munich's record on English soil is far from impressive: they've won just one from four matches at Old Trafford and only five from 18 in total. However, on their last trip to the Red Devils, Arjen Robben's sumptuous volley was enough to send the Germans through on aggregate (4-3) after a 3-2 defeat on the night. Bayern travel to England Tuesday evening (18:45 UTC) with many expecting the record English champions to roll over after a testing period. \"I know it'll be unbelievably difficult. I've never won at Old Trafford,\" Schweinsteiger said. \"It's great to have already one title, but we can't lose focus now.\" \"We want to win every remaining game,\" he added. \"We're a team that wants to win every game - even in training. This is no different.\" \"All the coaches around the world do not want to be favorites,\" Bayern coach Pep Guardiola said. \"They do not like the title. I have to accept that.\" \"Bayern Munich won everything last year and are now 25 points ahead in Bundesliga,\" he added. \"But there are eight teams in the quarter-finals and they all want to win the title. In the last 28 years Bayern won it twice, so it is difficult.\" Walking in big shoes The transition from Sir Alex Ferguson to David Moyes has been rough to say the least. Last season's English champions sit in seventh - outside of the Champions League positions - with Europe's premier club tournament the only glimmer of hope in a turbulent campaign. Guardiola was in a sympathetic mood during Monday's press conference and admitted the troubles Moyes has faced \"can happen to him tomorrow.\" \"It's been a very good competition for us so far in my short time here,\" Moyes said pre-match. \"I came into it very inexperienced in the Champions League but we've done well and now we've got the ultimate test in Bayern Munich.\" The Red Devils are nursing some injury concerns in defense, but most troublingly to Robin van Persie, who will miss Tuesday's match. Both Rafael and Patrice Evra won't be available for selection either for the Scot. As cup-tied Juan Manuel Mata sits in the stands, Bayern will face a former foe in Shinji Kagawa. The Japanese midfielder won back-to-back titles at Borussia Dortmund and scored two goals against the Bavarians during his time in the Ruhr Valley.",

        "story": "Italy Rejects Easing Assisted Fertility A boycott call spearheaded by the Roman Catholic Church has trounced an attempt to relax Italy's stringent fertility and bioethics law, after voter turnout failed to reach the 50 percent needed to validate the ballot. There was no escaping the mood of election apathy on Monday, when voters merely trickled into polling stations to have their say on the issue of whether or not Italy is ready to embrace a change in its bioethics law. Only around a quarter of Italian voters turned out to have their say in the referendum. Following Sunday's poor result, which saw just 18.7 percent casting ballots, Monday's papers wrote as if it were a foregone conclusion that the referendum would fail. \"Few vote, referendum drowns,\" headlined the Corriere della Sera daily. Analysts pointed at voter apathy but also at the appeal of Italian cardinals who, backed by newly-elected Pope Benedict XVI, urged predominantly Roman Catholic Italians to abstain from voting on moral grounds. \"The church exults,\" wrote Orazio Petrosillo, Vatican expert in Il Messaggero, while Turin's La Stampa daily said \"Catholics could return the slap in the face they received by the abortion and divorce law,\" approved in referendums despite church opposition in the 1970s. \"Te Deum\" praise of thanks Although top prelates and the Vatican kept a low profile as the voting continued, Father Gianni Baget Bozzo, a priest linked to Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, said he was preparing a \"Te Deum\" hymn of thanksgiving. Infuriated and embittered supporters of change accused the church of outstepping its sphere. \"Those who are sensitive to the influence of the pope let themselves be conditioned and gave up their right to free choice,\" lamented Michele Fasanella, an arts student from the southern Italian city of Potenza. \"There was such a brainwashing campaign by the church with the elderly, even the pope spoke out, so the result couldn't have been any different,\" said Renato, a Roman typographer, who voted to loosen the 2004 law along with 14 of his relatives on Sunday. General apathy But the result was also due to the \"indifference and laziness of those who do not vote regardless of the issue at stake,\" said political analyst Giulio Anselmi. None of the five referendums of the past decade succeeded in reaching the quorum. Equal Opportunities Minister Stefania Prestagiacomo refused to give up hope early Monday, saying that there was still a chance for the quorum to be reached. If not, Italy will have to \"keep a backward law, that jeopardizes the health of women,\" the minister was quoted as saying in Corriere della Sera. \"Good luck to us!\" quipped the minister, who spearheaded the campaign for change. Vow to continue Lawmakers backing change said they would not give up and would try to modify the law in parliament. Italy was deeply divided over the referendum, which asked people to authorize medical research on embryos, scrap a reference to the embryo as a full human being and give people with hereditary diseases access to medically-assisted procreation, currently permitted only to sterile couples. The referendum also asked voters whether to abolish current restrictions which only allow couples to create three embryos that must all be implanted at the same time, and without checking whether they carry genetic diseases. Opponents say the proposed changes go against what the pope has called the \"inviolability of human life from conception,\" while supporters say the current law puts women's health in danger, risks leaving Italy in the dark ages of medical research, and could lead to a recriminalization of abortion.",

        "story": "Oxfam: G7 emissions have 'savage impact' on African crops On the eve of the G7 talks in Germany, Oxfam has released a report highlighting the devastating impact emissions from G7 countries' coal plants will have on Africa's food supply. DW speaks to Oxfam's Kiri Hanks. A report released Saturday by Oxfam shows the G7 countries' continued reliance on coal is on track to cost the world $450 billion (405 billion euros) a year by the end of the century. Climate change and food security are expected to feature high on the agenda when leaders from the world's seven most economically powerful nations - the US, the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and Canada - meet Sunday for talks at Elmau palace in the southern German state of Bavaria. The \"Let Them Eat Coal\" report, which uses modeling by Climate Analytics researchers in Berlin, shows five of the G7 members, including Germany, have been burning more coal since 2009. In an interview with DW, Oxfam's energy advisor Kiri Hanks says Africa stands to lose millions of tons of staple crops by the 2080s. DW: Can you explain the link established in the \"Let Them Eat Coal\" report between hunger in Africa and coal plants in G7 countries? Kiri Hanks: We've done some new modeling to make the link between the climate change that G7 coal plants are causing and the impact that this is having on lost harvest. So we show that 7 million tons of staple crops are at risk of being lost by the end of the century if we carry on burning coal at the current rate. Coal-fired power plants are the biggest driver of climate change. The G7 coal fleet alone is emitting twice as much fossil fuel emissions as the whole of Africa, and 10 times as much as the 49 least developed countries. So they still have a huge coal problem and they have to move a lot faster in tackling it. Really, they should be leading the way as the leading group of industrialized economies and the countries with the means to invest in alternatives. The report says Africa's food sources will be particularly impacted by climate change driven by G7 emissions. Can you tell us what that reality looks like in practical terms? The most savage of all the impacts is the effect it's having on farming and the ability of people to feed themselves and grow enough food. Africa in particular will face costs of $84 billion annually by the end of the century. That includes the cost of adapting agricultural practices and irrigating fields, so it's total economic costs that will be caused by G7 coal plants. On the one hand you have the insidious rise in temperature, which will increasingly affect the harvest, but on the other hand you've got the impacts we're already seeing now - more flooding, more drought and more severe weather events. The report also looked at each country's energy grid to make recommendations for phasing out coal. When could the G7 countries realistically become coal-free? We've commissioned research from E3G, an energy specialist think tank, to analyze potential coal phase-out pathways and what policies could be put in place to speed up the transition from coal. For example, the UK, France and Italy could phase out coal within the next five to eight years. The US and Canada could phase out by 2030, Japan by 2035 and Germany by 2040. And this would really be the date of closing their last coal-fired power plant. What strategies can help wean G7 countries off coal? Some countries can move faster than others because you've got forward looking political leadership, different starting points and different energy mixes. In Japan you've got a situation where the government is deliberately following a coal-intensive energy pathway. And they've actually weakened legislation, so it's easier to build a new coal plant than it is to build a wind turbine, for example. Germany is still burning a huge amount of coal, and they're also phasing out nuclear at the same time. Germany could be coal free by 2040, but that would mean first tackling lignite (brown coal) because that's the worst and dirtiest form of coal. We're saying lignite there should be phased out by 2020. Environmental groups have described the G7 summit as an opportunity to create momentum for the Paris climate talks in December, when countries hope to sign a new climate change agreement to curb emissions. How optimistic are you that enough progress will be made? The G7 have huge sway and huge potential to send the right kind of signal to Paris - that they intend to phase out coal. This is one thing they could do that would really give the right message to the rest of the world, especially emerging economies who are going to be the big coal consumers of tomorrow. If the G7 take up their leadership role, they can inspire actions from others by showing that it's possible to phase out coal and maintain a healthy economy. The G7 have also pledged to deliver $100 billion in climate finance to developing countries (agreed at the 2009 UN climate conference in Copenhagen) and yet we're still waiting to see a politically credible road map for that money to be delivered, so these are areas where the G7 could really help momentum ahead of Paris. Kiri Hanks is the energy adviser with Oxfam in Britain.",

        "story": "Deadly train crash in India's Uttar Pradesh Rescuers in India have been searching through for survivors after a train came of the tracks in the northeast of the country. India's woefully underfunded railway system is a death trap, killing 15,000 every year. At least 23 people were killed and scores more injured when a train derailed in northern India Saturday. At least five railcars went off the tracks, according to Railways spokesman Anil Saxena, leaving emergency workers and private citizens to pull people out of mangled, upended carriages. \"Rescue and relief operations are continuing,\" G S Priyadarshi, Muzaffarnagar district magistrate, told the AFP news agency. Read more: Train disaster turns focus on India's shoddy railways The government deployed rescuers and sniffer dogs to the scene, with emergency workers using metal cutters and cranes were being used to reach inside the damaged coaches. \"Scores of people have been safely evacuated from the coaches. Some dead bodies have also been recovered,\" fire and emergency officer Naresh Kumar told AFP. Second tragedy in a week The derailment occurred in the north Indian state of Uttar Pradesh and is the second tragedy to hit the state in the past week. Dozens of children died in a hospital there that had run out of oxygen. The national authorities have sent disaster teams to help. \"We have mobilized all our resources to provide the best relief and rescue operations at this time,\" Saxena said on Indian television. Read more: Dozens killed in south India train crash India's railway network is the main form of long-distance travel in the vast country, but it is notoriously unsafe due to being under funded. In the past year 146 people died in a similar disaster in Uttar Pradesh. A government report in 2012 said almost 15,000 people were killed every year on India's railways. It described the loss of life as an annual \"massacre\". Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has pledged to invest $137 billion over five years to modernize the crumbling railway network, making it safer, faster and more efficient. bik/rc (AFP, Reuters, AP)",

        "story": "Nigeria hit by fatal bomb attacks Bomb blasts in two Nigerian cities on Sunday have killed at least 38. No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks in Kabuna and Jos, one of which detonated near a church holding Easter services. A car bombing near a church in the northern Nigerian city of Kaduna killed at least 38 people and injured dozens more on Sunday morning as churchgoers attended Easter services, officials in the West African nation said. Most of the fatalities were believed to be motorcycle-taxi drivers and beggars. It is thought the bomber was also among the dead. The All Nations Christian Assembly Church, which appeared to have been the target of the blast, was also severely damaged. \"We were in the Holy Communion service and I was exhorting my people and all of a sudden, we heard a loud noise that shattered all our windows and doors,\" Pastor Joshua Raji said. Second blast Hours later an explosion hit the city of Jos, around 200 kilometers (124 miles) to the south-east, injuring several people. Though no group immediately claimed the Kaduna attack, suspicion immediately fell on the radical Islamist sect Boko Haram, which had reportedly been planning a strike during the Christian festival. The Kaduna bombing was reminiscent of a series of deadly strikes on churches and other locations carried out by Boko Haram on Christmas Day. The bloodiest attack took place outside a church in Abuja, where 44 people died. Boko Haram, whose name means \"Western education is sacrilege,\" is seeking the introduction of strict Shariah law across the country and the release of all imprisoned followers. Its increasingly bloody insurgency has left more than 1,000 people dead since mid-2009. An attempt to hold indirect talks between the sect and Nigeria's government failed last month. Both Kaduna and Jos are situated along the dividing line between the mostly Muslim north and largely Christian south. The region has been the scene of religious tensions. Hundreds of people have died as a result of religious violence in Kaduna over the past few years. Jos was hit by acar bomb outside of a Catholic church just over a month ago, on March 11, killing at least 10. No one claimed responsibility for the attack. Pope sends message Hours earlier Pope Benedict XVI had condemned ongoing religious violence in Nigeria during his Easter speech at the Vatican. \"To Nigeria, which in recent times has experienced savage terrorist attacks, may the joy of Easter grant the strength needed to take up anew the building of a society which is peaceful and respectful of the religious freedom of its citizens,\" he said. ccp, ncy / ai (AFP, AP, dpa)",

        "story": "Eastern Germany's EU Funds in Danger of Drying Up The EU's competition commissioner met with the heads of Germany's eastern states to discuss future financial support for the region, which may no longer be a top priority following enlargement. The heads of Germany's economically depressed eastern states could be forgiven for going on the defensive prior to their meeting in Brandenburg with Mario Monti, the European commissioner for competition. With 10 mainly former communist countries now in the European Union, eastern Germany's economic problems suddenly don't seem so bad. And that means the region is in danger of losing some of the EU's development aid that, together with the so-called \"solidarity payments\" from western Germany, have funded reconstruction projects in the former East Germany. Reconstruction far from over During the meeting on Monday, Brandenburg's premier Matthias Platzeck said it would be difficult to explain to people in eastern Germany that their region would have to take a funding cutback. All the progress that's been made in recent years is still very fragile, Platzeck said. Eastern Germany had been completely deindustrialized after the collapse of the GDR, and rebuilding the region is far from over, he added. There have been no concrete signs yet as to how big a cut in EU subsidies the eastern German states would have to reckon with. The European Commission is conducting a comprehensive review of its regional aid policy in order to introduce new guidelines and criteria to come into effect on Jan.1, 2007. No reason to worry Monti (photo) said it was important for him to talk with eastern German leaders about their worries. He assured them that they can be confident about their region's future. Eastern Germany has gone from the outer edges to the very center of the EU -- a development that would soon manifest itself in further growth and development, he said. Statistically speaking, eastern Germany is no longer among the poorest regions in the EU, now that the bloc has expanded eastwards to include several ex-communist states with struggling economies. However, unemployment in Germany's eastern states is over 20 percent, and despite an estimated €1.25 trillion ($1.5) in aid, the economic gap separating east and west hasn't been closed. Platzeck said that parts of the European Commission's plan to reform its regional aid policy will only exacerbate the problem. The premier of Saxony-Anhalt, Wolfgang Böhmer, said that without financial help from Brussels his state would face a budget emergency. Last month, a government-commissioned report came to the conclusion that the east German reconstruction project was a failure. But Platzeck said accusations of ineffectiveness are unfair. He said 47 of the 50 large-scale development projects in his state of Brandenburg were working very well. Brandenburg's state government has already divided the region into two zones, so that it can at least apply for the highest level of EU funding for the poorer northern half.",

        "story": "Sanctions: Who's really hurting in Russia? With the EU about to review its sanctions regime against Russia, Fiona Clark looks at how Russians are faring under the embargoes and asks if they’re really having any effect on the country's leadership. Russians might think I'm insane but there are times when I wander the aisles of my local supermarket and literally laugh out loud. At least it's better than crying when I see blueberries on sale for the equivalent of 16 euros a punnet (125 grams) or mixed berries for just under 20 euros. I know they may have travelled all the way from the US, but seriously, who pays these prices? I assume somebody does, but it can only be wealthy because for the average Muscovite that's about 10 percent of a weekly wage. I know fresh berries may not be a necessity, but even staples like yoghurt and ‘kasha' (buckwheat, usually eaten for breakfast or as a potato replacement with dinner) have had a hefty price hike. Strangely enough they're both locally produced so shouldn't be affected by the sanctions that Russia imposed on the EU in retaliation for the sanctions imposed on it, nor should they be affected by those imposed by the EU, or by the severely devalued ruble. In general though, most products have gone up by about 30 percent, and some, like Italian prosciutto or French cheese, have completely disappeared from the shelves. The last time I saw real Italian parmesan was in January. The lack of these 'luxury' items has brought out the entrepreneur in some. Like kids craving their names in a tree trunk for all eternity, one clever art gallery owner has started producing fridge magnets stating \"parmesan was here\" or \"ham was here\" to remind consumers of the delicacies they used to enjoy. Now those of us who travel regularly carry them back from Europe in our hand luggage. But cheese is clearly a suspicious item. Every time I take a bag full of eight wedges of parmesan, four blocks of cheddar and an assortment of goat's cheese through Heathrow I'm pulled aside for security check. \"I live in Russia,\" I tell them. \"Sanctions. You can't get real cheese.\" Like a drug-addict, I explain you are allowed to bring it into the country as long as it's \"for personal use only.\" A boost for entrepreneurs But what's bad for me, may not be so bad for Russian manufacturers. The sanctions have provided a huge opportunity to artisanal producers to bring their products to those who have enough money to pay for them. Like the blueberries, you may need to take out a small loan for a slice of camembert at 48 euro/kg, but Russia has a lot of wealthy people so there is a market for these products. For the average man, however, this is out of the question. Instead supermarkets now stock an array of locally produced copies of popular cheeses. There are two problems with this - the fakes don't taste anything like the real thing (think rubbery plastic), and, according to recent media reports, they may be made with palm oil, not milk products. Since the sanctions started a year ago Russia has imported 39 percent more palm oil, and Russia's agricultural watchdog, Rosselkhoznadzor, says much of that is destined for the fake cheese market which now makes up some 50 percent of the cheeses in the supermarket fridge. But is it the sanctions that have driven the prices up? Before they were introduced Russia was already looking down the barrel of an economic downturn. Then the oil price plummeted, dragging the ruble down with it. And the result of all these things combined is that inflation is up - this April it was running at 16 percent, more than twice as high as it was a year earlier. But strangely enough people don't seem to be angry - yet. The general attitude, as one taxi driver told me, was that \"we've been through tough times before and we know how to survive.\" They are however, being prudent with their finances. One local newspaper, The Moscow Times, cites a survey showing that more than 50 percent of Russians have reduced their spending and almost 20 percent have no disposable income left after paying for food and housing. They're cancelling holidays abroad and tourism to Europe is down 30 percent. And businesses are feeling the pinch. Government statistics show retail spending has dropped 9.8 percent in the year to April 2015. Clothes shops and restaurants are shutting their doors and over the past few weeks I've noticed that stalls at my local food market are disappearing as increased rents drive vendors out. One meat seller explained that she pays 5,000 rubles (about 90 euros) a day to rent a one meter length of bench space (unrefrigerated) to sell her pork. On top of that she has to pay 4,000 rubles for her butcher and overnight refrigeration. \"I'm sorry for my language,\" she says, \"but they even charge you 100 rubles just to go to the toilet. 100 rubles!\" That's about 1.80 euros - more than three times the average 50 cents charged in Germany. Collusion and stagnation In total each month she pays out 270,000 rubles. She has to sell a lot of meat to cover that. Unfortunately though salaries aren't growing. In fact government statistics show real wages have fallen by just over 13 percent in the year to April 2015. Faced with an economic slowdown many companies are cutting workers' pay or cutting their hours, or simply laying them off. The Ministry of Labor said that the number of people officially registered as unemployed increased by 3.4 percent to over 900,000 in late January. The Russia and India Report says that's the equivalent of about 30,000 losing their jobs in just one week. For foreign companies operating in Russia it's not all bad news. The devalued ruble means staff are costing them about 30 percent less than usual. Workers aren't happy but as one country manager told me, he and his competitors in the IT industry have had discussions and will only raise the pay of their staff if they do it in unison. If they act unilaterally they risk a flood of resignations as staff flock to the higher paying company, giving the first to raise rates a cherry picking opportunity. And it's good for exports. A devalued ruble makes Russia's raw materials more competitive on the world market - ironically helping many of the oligarchs on the sanctions list to increase their profits. I'm no economist, but less disposable income can only mean less demand - effectively rubbing salt into an already wounded economy that's set to contract by around 4 percent this year. It's hard to say how much of this is the result of the slowing economy, the falling oil price or the sanctions, but it's even harder to tell if that elite inner circle who were supposed to be the real targets of sanctions are hurting. They may not be holidaying this summer in Cannes, Mallorca or Australia - as the sanctioned CEO of Russia's railways, Vladimir Yakunin said \"I am sorry I won't be able to see the kangaroos there.\" But instead he'll visit the white tigers at a Sochi wildlife refuge.

        "story": "Obama nominates Merrick Garland to Supreme Court US President Barack Obama has nominated Merrick Garland to serve as the Supreme Court's ninth justice. The president is preparing for a tense battle with Republicans over who will replace the late Antonin Scalia. On Wednesday, President Obama announced his nomination of Garland, the chief judge for the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. At a press conference on the White House lawn, Obama extolled Garland's virtues, including his integrity, modesty and even-handedness, and his attitude \"that all views deserve a respectful ear.\" \"To find someone with such a long career in public service ... who just about everyone not only respects but genuinely likes, that is rare,\" Obama told reporters. \"And it speaks to who Merrick Garland is, not just as a lawyer, but as a man.\" Washington is gearing up for a tense, months-long battle between the White House and the Republican-controlled Senate, which must confirm the nominee. A lot hinges on the choice to replace the late Antonin Scalia - for both Democrats and Republicans. On one side, Democrats want to preserve the Obama administration's liberal agenda by using the opportunity to tilt the Supreme Court in a more left-leaning direction for the first time in generations. On the other side, Republicans are dead-set on ensuring that a replacement stays true to the legacy of Scalia, a revered conservative who died in February. Gearing up for a fight Congressional Republicans have already said they'd refuse to consider Obama's nomination, insisting they would wait until after the presidential election in November before moving forward with the nomination process. During his press conference, Obama spoke out against the Republicans' position, calling it \"unprecedented.\" \"It is tempting to make this confirmation process simply an extension of our divided politics,\" Obama said. \"But to go down that path would be wrong. It would be a betrayal of our best traditions.\" Obama sent an email to his supporters earlier in the day, in which he defended his decision to go forward with the nomination even as the political atmosphere in the country grows more polarized by the day. \"In putting forward a nominee today, I am fulfilling my constitutional duty. I'm doing my job,\" Obama said. \"I hope that our senators will do their jobs, and move quickly to consider my nominee.\" The 63-year-old Garland, considered a moderate, was confirmed to the DC Circuit in 1997 by both Democrats and Republicans.",

        "story": "Lyon win women's Champions League Olympique Lyon's women have won the Champions League final for the second time in a row, again beating German opposition, and again by a margin of 2-0. Lyon have further cemented their place as the best in the world. It was the result observers of the women's game expected. Olympique Lyon went into Thursday's Champions League final in Munich as defending champions. They were also the champions of the French first division for the past five consecutive seasons, with a very real chance of making it six this year. The club is the highest-ranked in the women's game, and won the final at Munich's Olympic Stadium 2-0. German first division side FFC Frankfurt, meanwhile, finished a disappointing season in fourth place, and were something of a surprise entry in the final. Heavy favorites Lyon did the damage in the first half. Striker Eugenie Le Sommer opened the scoring from the penalty spot on 15 minutes. The French international stepped up and placed the ball calmly in the top-right corner. Abily scores in style Just before the half-hour mark, a poor bit of goalkeeping led to a sublime piece of attacking. Frankfurt goalie Desiree Schumann came out of her penalty area and sought to use her head to clear a dangerous long pass. Schumann's header, however, was weak; it fell to veteran French international Camille Abily, who side-footed a beautiful volleyed lob over the stricken Schumann and into the wide open net. Abily's impressive shot was taken from at least 25 meters out. Last season, Lyon dispatched Turbine Potsdam - German league champions for two consecutive seasons now - 2-0 in the final at Craven Cottage in London. An impressive 50,212 fans turned up to watch the match at the Olympic Stadium in Munich, Bayern Munich's former home before moving to the Allianz Arena. Last year's Champions League final drew a crowd of just 14,303. Women's football enjoys a loyal following in Germany - one of the traditional powerhouses of the sport. The 2011 World Cup, held in Germany, broke a string of all-time attendance records for the women's game. Author: Mark Hallam Editor: Charlotte Chelsom-Pill",

        "story": "IMF mulls extending Greek repayment schedule An IMF official has said European leaders must take tough decisions on Greece before the IMF releases its latest installment of the country's rescue package. One option is giving Athens more time to repay the loans. A senior IMF official in Greece said the International Monetary Fund would be open to some form of restructuring of Greece's national debt and its repayment schedules, but also warned that such changes could have serious ramifications. \"Stretching out payment terms, for instance in loans from euro area partners and the IMF, is a reasonable thing to think about because we have amortization right at the end of the program. This is a technical issue we can think about,\" the IMF's senior representative in Greece, Bob Traa, said on Tuesday. Traa said Greece was at a \"critical juncture\" with no time to waste, as Athens struggles to avoid defaulting on a 340-billion-euro ($499-billion) national debt that roughly equates to the total economic output of Greece over an 18-month period. Greece has already won one extension of the time-frame for repaying loans from the 110-billion-euro loans package granted by the EU and IMF last year. EU officials - eager to avoid a default but increasingly unwilling to lend more money - have been struggling to find a solution for the country's short-term financing, with restructuring the debt another potential option. \"If you want a debt restructuring that will really make a difference, it will need to be very large,\" Traa warned. \"Such a large debt restructuring would create untold problems not just in Greece but also in the eurozone.\" IMF: It's up to Europe Speaking at a banking conference in Athens, Traa also appealed for heads of state at June's EU summit to reach a consensus on Greece. The growing European reticence to continue supporting Athens has made the IMF wary of committing to its installments towards the international loans. \"I believe there is a summit in Europe by heads of state [in June] where some hard nuts need to be cracked and they need to make some decisions. And then actually we will be ready to go to our board and to disburse in early July because we know time is of the essence,\" Traa said. The Greek government is rallying and trying to push its latest medium-term austerity plan through parliament, one of the preconditions for receiving more international loans. Officials in Athens hope to secure the votes by the end of June, with the government offering the corporate and value added tax cuts demanded by the opposition into a longer-term budget in a bid to appease opponents of the cuts. The European Union has repeatedly urged Greek politicians to put party politics aside and form a consensus on its austerity program. Author: Mark Hallam (AFP, Reuters) Editor: Holly Fox",

        "story": "Berlin continues to spin its wheels over Opel's future The tug-of-war over European carmaker Opel seems set to continue after talks between Opel's troubled parent company General Motors and the German government ended inconclusively on Tuesday. General Motors' chief negotiator, John Smith, was in Berlin Tuesday to talk about the future of Opel. GM reportedly used the meeting to assure the German government Tuesday that it still may sell Opel, an unnamed German government source told the Associated Press. Yet other media reports that GM is looking for ways to hold onto Opel after all. The Wall Street Journal said that General Motors' new board of directors has ordered management to consider new options for Opel, including finding three billion euros ($4.3 billion) in funding to overhaul GM's European operations rather than sell them. The newspaper cited three unnamed sources familiar with the matter as saying that GM Chief Executive Frederick \"Fritz\" Henderson had been instructed to prepare a new financial plan ahead of the US carmaker's next board meeting in early September. Meanwhile, The Financial Times reports that GM is exploring ways of securing funding from the British, Spanish and US governments in a deal its source described as \"feasible if complex\". A leading German labor representative said he hopes General Motors will make a decision about the future of Opel by Wednesday morning. Armin Schild, the leader of the IG Metall union in the state of Hesse, where Opel has its headquarters, said the fact that GM's options for Opel had come to light ahead of an official announcement means that they may be under serious consideration. \"I see that as a bad sign for the future of Opel,\" Schild told German public television station ZDF. Magna rejection The reports follow a meeting last Friday in which GM's board rejected Henderson's recommendation that Opel be sold to a consortium consisting of Canadian auto parts manufacturer Magna, Russian state-owned lender Sberbank and Russian carmaker GAZ. The move was an embarrassment to the German government, which has offered to throw 4.5 billion euros ($6.4 billion) worth of financial support behind the Magna bid. Lawmakers and unions fear that the rival offer from Belgian-based investment group RHJ International could lead to widespread job losses in Germany, which is home to about half of GM's 55,000-strong European workforce. But GM's board is reported to be wary of the Magna deal because it could see valuable technological know-how end up in the hands of its Russian competitors. Meanwhile, the absence of a foothold in Europe could harm the GM in the long run by leaving the company overly dependent on North American and Chinese markets. Sale or no sale, German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck suspects that GM favors the RHJ bid because managers in Detroit aim to maintain control of Opel in the long term. \"My impression is that some people at the heart of GM management prefer the RHJ International offer because it would make it easier to buy back Opel in a few years time,\" Steinbrueck told the Handelsblatt financial newspaper. \"Magna, in our view, has a clear industrial strategy, not just a plan for short-term gain and that is why the government will not give any financial aid to RHJ,\" he said. \"Aid will only be given to Magna.\" sje/dpa/AP/Reuters Editor: Chuck Penfold/Trinity Hartman",

        "story": "Fires rage across Spain's Canary Islands Thousands of people have been evacuated on Spain's Canary Islands to escape forest fires sweeping across the islands of La Palma and La Gomera. Fire fighters and the military are trying to bring the flames under control. The fires raged for the second day on Sunday, devastating thousands of hectares of pine forest on the popular holiday island of La Palma. Around 4,000 residents and tourists had to flee their homes and were moved into a temporary shelter. Around 30 homes and several wineries have been burned down. Some 500 firefighters, forest rangers and military personnel, including from neighboring islands, were called in to deal with the fires. Spanish air force planes and helicopters are also involved in efforts to bring the blaze under control. The flames were fanned by strong winds and were spreading on several fronts while a fresh outbreak was detected on the smaller island of La Gomera. Spain has seen temperatures soar to well over 30 degrees Celsius. The fire has struck at the height of the holiday season – the archipelago off the Atlantic coast of northern Africa entirely depends on tourism. Local authorities said they hoped to bring the blaze under control on Sunday. Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero is expected to fly to La Palma later in the day to oversee efforts to tackle the fire. Since the the start of this year, at least eight people have been killed by fires in mainland Spain. Fires have ravaged some 75,000 hectares of land, almost double the number as for the whole of 2008. ai/AFP/AP/Reuters Editor: Sonia Phalnikar",

        "story": "Welcome into the world It's not all bad news for the planet's plants and animals - while many species are going extinct, fresh ones are also being discovered. DW presents newcomers for 2016. Fancy Indian crabs The discovery of five new species of colorful freshwater crabs in the Western Ghats, India, is certainly good news. The mountains are a biodiversity hotspot in the world, for their rich variety of animals and plants. Unfortunately, there are great threats against them. These freshwater crabs are characterized by bright colors: from silvery grey to luminous pink. As opposed to marine crabs, these species have adapted to terrestrial mode of life and only need a freshwater pool for breeding. Findings on the new crabs were published in the journal \"Zootaxa\" in February 2016. Pictured above, Gubernatoriana thackerayi - named after its discoverer - has especially unique coloration among its relatives. Scarlet embellishes its shell and walking legs, while a flashy orange is reserved for the two pinchers. Casper the octopus Some cephalopods can change the color of their skin as a camouflage technique. This ghostlike octopus, on its side, lacks pigment cells altogether. The new species was found near the Hawaiian island of Necker by zoologists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Social media users couldn't pass up the comparison of the newly discovered animal, and its translucent appearance gained it the nickname Casper. Giant baby Rafflesia is a genus of parasitic plants, the flowers of which are known as the largest in the world and emit an overpowering smell of rotting flesh. Most of the - including the distantly related \"corpse flower\" - are found in southeastern Asia countries such as the Philippines, home to many rare and endangered species. Recently discovered Rafflesia consueloae, on the Philippine island of Luzon, is the smallest of the largest flowers in the world. So small, that it can \"only\" reach a diameter up to 12.7 centimeters when fully extended. It was described and illustrated in the journal PhytoKeys in February 2016. Something is shining over there In the 21st century, more than 100 new species of reptiles and amphibians have been found in India. A team of researchers from the United Kingdom and India - lead by David Gower from the Natural History Museum in London - has recently added a new name to the list. The \"Khaire's black shieldtail\" has been described in a paper published in the scientifc journal \"Zootaxa.\" In the wild, attractive colors are often linked to poisonous animals. However, despite its appearence, the newfound species belongs to a genus of non-venomous shieldtail snakes. Melanophidium khairei is the first species described in this genus for 144 years. 'Zorro' unmasked The cousin to piranhas pictured above is vegetarian, feeding on seeds, fruit and vegetation. Found in a tributary of the Amazon River, in western Brazil, the new fish has a length of about 45 centimeters. It has been named Myloplus zorroi, combining the names of the fictional black masked character Zorro and a renowned fish researcher. The finding was published in the scientific journal \"ZooKeys\" on March 7, 2016. Tarantula rock star Scientists in the United States have recently identified 14 new species of tarantula - among them, Johnny Cash. This spider has black hair, and was found near the prison were Cash recorded his famous song \"Folsom Prison Blues,\" in California. It was described in the scientific journal \"ZooKeys\" on February 4, 2016. In Australia, the recent discovery of an endemic spider has also attracted scientists. It uses water vibrations to move and trap aquatic prey such as fish or toads. Less high-profile than its glamorous relative, it has simply been named Brian. Widespread neighborhood More than 7,000 known species of amphibians exist worldwide. A thumbnail-sized frog and the Honnametti bush frog in India; the Asian litter frog in China; and a frog with yellow eyebrows in Colombia have been among the 2016 newcomers. To top it off, the identity of a rare tree frog - with a novel way of feeding its young - has been verified. It was rediscovered in north India after thought to be extinct for more than a century.",

        "story": "Inflation is back in the eurozone In May, eurozone inflation hit positive territory for the first time in six months, moving the currency bloc away from the risk of deflation. But the figure still falls way short of the European Central Bank's target. Prices were up by a slightly better than expected 0.3 percent in May, compared with the same time last year, official figures showed on Tuesday. April's reading had been flat. \"This increase was stronger than widely expected, even if inflation is hardly racing ahead,\" said Howard Archer, chief European Economist at IHS Global Insight, told the AFP new agency. The figures mark a return to inflation after five months of negative consumer prices, which had sparked fears about a prolonged bout of deflation in the single currency bloc. The numbers came a day after data showed that German consumer prices rose at their fastest pace in eight months in May. Towards the end of last year, plunging energy prices as well as the eurozone's overall stagnant economy and high unemployment had caused prices to drop. Economists fear deflation because it means shoppers tend to put off purchases in the belief they may become even cheaper, leading to ever weaker demand, slowing the economy and pushing up unemployment. May's uptick can be attributed to a buoyant service sector, higher prices for unprocessed food and a rise in crude prices. The reading is, however, still far below the European Central Bank's target of 2 percent. ng/uhe (AFP, Reuters, AP)",

        "story": "Bad report card for EU's foreign policy German peace researchers have accused the European Union of having contributed to the crisis in Ukraine. In their latest annual report they warn of the danger of a new Cold War. The European Union has been given a poor report card for its foreign policy by a group of prominent peace researchers who point to shortcomings in how the EU has dealt with its neighbors in the Ukraine crisis. The assessment was made by five leading research institutes in their \"Friedensgutachten 2014\" (Peace Report 2014), presented jointly in Berlin on Tuesday (03.06.2014). \"The European Union policy of essentially presenting Ukraine with an either-or choice in the form of the association agreement was a momentous mistake,\" said Ines-Jacqueline Werkner of the Protestant Institute for Interdisciplinary Research in Heidelberg (FEST). According to her analysis, the EU has contributed to the development of the Ukraine crisis and has done little to resolve it. EU's mistake \"When the EU sided with the opposition on the Maidan - against the regime with which it previously wanted to sign an agreement - it increased internal political polarization and excluded itself as a mediator and conflict manager,\" said Werkner. Bruno Schoch of the Peace Research Institute Frankfurt (PRIF) argued that the EU was overwhelmed when confronted with a player like Russia at a geopolitical level. Attempts by the foreign ministers of Germany, Poland and France to mediate in Kyiv in February came too late, according to the report. By their own account, the five institutes hope their findings will enable them to influence foreign policy discourse in Germany. OSCE does it better The researchers view the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) as the appropriate agent for conflict prevention but are critical of the fact that over the past few years, both the OSCE's political role and its budget have been consistently reduced. This trend, they said, must be reversed. In the future, the OSCE should provide ongoing reports from Ukraine in future and not just be sent on short-term missions. The researchers also made other suggestions for resolving the conflict. Among them: Ukraine should hold roundtable talks on regional and local levels, and supporters of the former President Viktor Yanukovych's Party of Regions should be included in the government. Ukraine should also be clearly denied possible NATO membership. The long-term goal should be to make Ukraine a \"connecting bridge\" between the EU and Russia. Danger of a new Cold War For the time being, though, the researchers said it's crucial to prevent another Cold War. They write that Russian President Vladimir Putin is, in the manner of traditional power politics, flouting multilateral agreements. In doing this, they said, Russia is creating dangerous precedents and is eroding international order. The researchers fear the Ukraine crisis could lead to a new arms race in Europe. Sweden, they warned, has already announced a massive increase in its military spending over the next few years – a step in the wrong direction. \"Dialogue and cooperation with Russia remain indispensable,\" they write. \"We hope that, sooner or later, demands for democracy will become louder in Russia, too.\" Putin, the researchers note, is at the peak of his power and popularity. He is very careful to weigh the costs and benefits of his actions and ready to seize opportunities \"to portray himself as a charismatic leader and Russia as a counterforce to the West.\" They speculate that this is also a way for Putin to draw attention away from domestic problems. The \"modernization partnership\" so often mentioned by German policymakers is \"mirage,\" they claim. Humanitarian aid for Syria On the day of the Syrian presidential election, the peace researchers took the opportunity to comment once again on the bloody civil war that has taken the lives of more than 160,000 people and laid waste to large parts of the country. \"I am very pessimistic about the possibility of influencing this conflict from outside via diplomatic means,\" said PRIF's Schoch. He said that this view was strengthened by the withdrawal of the UN special envoy Lakhdar Brahimi, who threw in the towel in May after two years of dogged diplomatic efforts. The destruction of Syria's chemical weapons was the last success for diplomacy, said Schoch. The problem, however, was that this disarmament initiative, which was welcomed by the international community, had strengthened the regime in Damascus. The researchers suggested that foreign countries could try to provide humanitarian aid, by way of an airlift or by taking in more refugees. \"Both the European and the German refugee policies are absolutely scandalous,\" said Werkner. \"We appeal to the German government to take in at least 200,000 Syrian refugees in Germany in view of the ongoing humanitarian disaster.\" To date, according to government figures, a total of 40,000 Syrians have found asylum in Germany.",

        "story": "Bavarian premier pledges better relations with Prague Horst Seehofer, the premier of Bavaria, has been in Prague to meet with Czech Prime Minister Petr Necas. The visit marks the first such trip by a Bavarian leader since World War II. Horst Seehofer, premier of the German state of Bavaria, wrapped up talks with Czech Prime Minister Petr Necas on Monday by pledging future cooperation between the neighbors. Seehofer was in Prague for the first official visit by a Bavarian leader to the Czech capital since the end of World War II. He has suggested the leaders now meet regularly. \"We want to open a new chapter in our relationship, and we've taken the first step towards that\", Seehofer said, after more than an hour of conversation with the Czech prime minister. Relations between the Czech Republic and the border state of Bavaria have been strained by the expulsion of ethnic Germans from the former Czechoslovakia in 1945. Many of the expellees, known as Sudeten Germans, ended up in Bavaria. \"What we could not avoid were differing views about the past,\" Seehofer said. \"We are united in wanting to focus on the future together.\" Touchy subject Prime Minister Necas said his country had a \"huge interest\" in future cooperation, which is likely to include closer energy links and travel connections. Seehofer, head of the conservative Christian Social Union (CSU) party in Bavaria, had dinner with Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg on Sunday evening. Czech and Bavarian leaders did not discuss the controversial postwar decrees under which Sudeten Germans were deported from Czechoslovakia and had their property seized. Although Bavaria has long wanted them abolished, the decrees remain valid today, as Czech leaders fear removing them would give expellees or their heirs property claims. The Bavarian delegation included Bernd Posselt, a representative of the Sudeten German deportees, who has been critical of Prague. He did not take part in Seehofer's talks with Necas.

        "story": "'We are not xenophobic': PEGIDA A spokesperson for anti-Islamization group PEGIDA has said the organization will not give up, despite death threats against the group's founder. Police have temporarily banned the group's weekly Monday marches. One of the organizers of Dresden's weekly PEGIDA (\"Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West\") marches has argued that her group's message is simply misunderstood. Appearing on a Sunday evening episode of Günther Jauch's talk show on German public broadcaster ARD, Kathrin Oertel argued that most people had a \"false impression\" of her organization. Oertel's appearance was the first such interview with a PEGIDA organizer, and came just hours after the cancellation of Monday's march. The protest, which would have been the latest in a series of weekly protests that began in October, was called off on Sunday due to death threats against founder Lutz Bachmann. The Dresden police have temporarily banned demonstrations in the city, including a planned counter-demonstration. The threats to Bachmann come amid warnings from foreign intelligence services that the Berlin and Dresden train stations have become possible targets for terrorist attacks. On the show, Oertel rejected accusations that PEGIDA is racist and hostile to foreigners. \"We really are not a xenophobic organization,\" she insisted, adding that rather than stir up anti-immigrant feeling, the purpose of the marches is to \"shake things up.\" \"We want to highlight the shortcomings of our government in recent years,\" she said. Despite the ban on rallies in Dresden, Oertel said PEGIDA was by no means giving up its strategy. \"We will continue to put pressure on the government,\" she told Jauch. Dialogue instead of slogans Alexander Gauland, a senior member of the euroskeptic Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, was also a guest on the show. Coming to Oertel's defense, he called the ban on demonstrating \"the beginning of Islamization,\" according to news outlet Spiegel Online. Parliamentarian Jens Spahn, of Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU), was also present, and criticized PEGIDA for using \"slogans\" instead of \"dialogue.\" Spahn said if PEGIDA wanted to be taken seriously, it must enter into dialogue with the political system. Both Spahn and Wolfgang Thierse of the liberal Social Democrats (SPD) agreed that banning political rallies was a serious infringement of the basic right to assembly. Spahn assured Oertel and the audience that PEGIDA would be allowed to demonstrate again, but in this specific case, considering the threat against Bachmann, Spahn and Theirse agreed with the decision of the authorities. es/cmk (dpa, EPD)",

        "story": "Woman who searched for Mexico's \"disappeared\" is slain  Miriam Rodriguez was known for her courage facing Mexico's drug gangs after her daughter disappeared. She was killed on Mother's Day in Mexico.  A Mexican human rights activist who tirelessly searched for her missing daughter and organized more than 600 families to look for disappeared persons was shot to death in the northern state of Tamaulipas, authorities said on Thursday. Miriam Rodriguez was shot multiple times by unknown gunmen at her home in town of San Fernando on Wednesday, which is Mother's Day in Mexico. After her daughter went missing in 2012, Rodriguez led a search that found her child's remains in an unmarked grave. She later identified the perpetrators tied to the Zetas drug cartel, nine of whom were arrested. One of the men held responsible for her daughter's death recently escaped from prison, but Tamaulipas state attorney's office said he was quickly recaptured. Still, they responded to threats against Rodriguez by providing police patrols three times a day at her house. More than 30,000 people have gone missing in drug gang-ravaged Mexico in the last decade. Citizen Community in Search of the Disappeared in Tamaulipas, the group Rodriguez founded, is one of dozens of civic organizations that have sprouted up to find disappeared persons in the absence of what they say is the state's failure to find the missing. \"Mexico has become a very dangerous place for those who have the courage to devote their lives to search for missing persons,\" Erika Guevara Rosas, Amnesty International director for the Americas, said in response to Rodriguez's murder. \"The nightmare they face not knowing the fate or whereabouts of their relatives and the dangers they face in their work, which they perform given the negligent response from the authorities, is alarming,\" she said. The governor of Tamaulipas, Francisco García Cabeza de Vaca, condemned Rodriguez's murder. \"The state of Tamaulipas will not allow the death of Miriam Rodriguez to be another statistic,\" he said on Twitter. cw/rc (AP, dpa, Reuters)",

        "story": "European Court of Human Rights overrules Britain on murder jail terms A European Court has ruled that Britain violated the rights of three convicted murderers by jailing them for life with no prospect of release. Britain's Justice Secretary criticized the decision. The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg has ruled that sentences passed on three convicted British murderers constituted inhuman and degrading treatment. \"Given ... the absence of a dedicated review mechanism for whole life orders, the Court was not persuaded that, at the present time, the applicants' life sentences were compatible with Article 3,\" wrote the court. It cited the European Convention on Human Rights' provision that prohibits torture, and inhumane and degrading treatment. The convention has the power of law in all signatory countries. British conservatives are already pushing for its repeal and Tuesday's decision looks set to strengthen their hand. British Justice Secretary Chris Grayling commented: \"What the court is saying is that a judge can no longer tell the most appalling criminals that they will never be released. I think the people who wrote the original Human Rights Convention would be turning in their graves at this ruling.\" The ruling overturned a January 2012 judgment by a panel of seven judges at the European court that found the sentences of Jeremy Bamber, jailed for murdering five members of his family in 1985, serial killer Peter Moore and multiple-murderer Douglas Vinter, did not amount to inhumane or degrading treatment. The decision does not assure the petitioners any prospect of imminent release but it struck down a key British sentencing guideline. Further appeals by other British prisoners serving life terms, including some of the most notorious killers in the country's recent history, are now expected. Meanwhile, Britain announced on Tuesday it would opt out almost 100 EU measures on policing and criminal justice. For technical reasons, the move means the country first has to withdraw from all 133 such measures. However, Home Secretary Theresa May said Britain would rejoin 35 of them, including the controversial European arrest warrant scheme. jm/rc (Reuters, AP, AFP)",

        "story": "Opinion: Without Mullah Mansour things will get worse The United States is presumably hoping that a moderate Taliban leader will step into the shoes of the hard-liner Mullah Mansour. That hope is based more on desperation than calculation, DW's Florian Weigand writes. The United States has just provided confirmation that talking to the Taliban about peace is impossible right now. Early Sunday, they tried to kill the Taliban leader Mullah Akhtar Mansour with a drone attack - successfully, it seems, according to reports from Afghanistan's government. The only way this attack makes any sense is if any readiness to talk has been completely ruled out and Washington is hoping for a successor who is more open. Peace talks have been going on for months now, with a group of four - the US, China, Pakistan and Afghanistan - at the table. However, the Taliban's chair has always remained empty, in spite of both attempts to win them over and background pressure from the intelligence services. Mullah Mansour's undoing was presumably that he was, from the Taliban's point of view, very successful and able to reject talks without turning a hair. He was covertly pulling the strings even before he officially took over the leadership in the summer of 2015. By then, his predecessor, the infamous Mullah Omar, had been dead for two years: His death was kept secret to give Mullah Mansour time to establish himself fully. His leadership, once it became official, had a spectacular beginning. Last autumn, some two years after the withdrawal of German troops, the Taliban succeeded in capturing the former German army base in Kunduz for several days. It was only with difficulty, and with the support of specialist units and the US Air Force, that the Afghan military was able to recapture this symbolically important position. Taliban march on The Taliban are gaining ground elsewhere in Afghanistan, too. They claim to be active in 70 percent of the country. This is sure to be unconfirmed propaganda, but it may still be closer to the truth than the airbrushed reports of the government in Kabul. It is certainly the case that NATO is, once again, having to intervene more and more often in the fighting, and that its mandate will be extended beyond 2017. Even if the reports should turn out to be incorrect - as happened a few months ago - Kabul and Washington will not rest until they have hunted down Mullah Mansour. Will it then really be possible to start over with a more moderate Taliban leader? That's certainly the hope in Kabul, Washington and Islamabad. Diplomats and intelligence agencies will be sure to try to lever a more balanced dialog partner into position. Pakistan in particular is needed for this - the country has a long reputation of being very close to the Taliban. The strategy is unlikely to pay off, though. In the fight for succession, potential candidates will have to make their mark in the eyes of their followers - and the only way to do that is with spectacular terrorist attacks or conquests. The splendor of the Mullah Mansour era is the benchmark they will have to surpass. Experience has shown that the Taliban are able to score local successes even without central leadership. Its fighters know what their goal is, and they don't need orders from on high to tell them: the overthrow of the government in Kabul and the withdrawal of all foreign troops, followed by an Islamic state, as they had before, in the 1990s. These are not good prospects for a negotiated peace. The United States, Kabul and Islamabad may fervently wish for something different, but the Taliban may be more likely to elect an even more uncompromising leader: They already see themselves on the path to victory. The attack on Mullah Mansour was more an act of desperation than the cool calculation of the possibility of making a new start with a new leader. Do you have something to say? Add your comments below. The thread is open for 24 hours.",

        "story": "US jury convicts former CIA officer of leaking classified Iran nuclear details A United States federal court jury has found a former CIA officer guilty of leaking spy secrets to a journalist. Jeffrey Sterling was accused of leaking details of a failed operation to thwart Iran's nuclear ambitions. Following three days of deliberations, jurors on Monday convicted 47-year-old Jeffrey Sterling of all nine counts, most of which related to unauthorized disclosure of national defense information. Prosecutors had said Sterling's actions had put lives at risk as well as compromising efforts to deter Iran's contested nuclear plans. Earlier in the day the jurors had informed the judge that they could not reach a unanimous verdict, but they were urged by the judge to keep talking and a few hours later they delivered guilty verdicts. The central issue in the two-week trial was who had told James Risen, a reporter for the New York Times, about the top-secret mission. The plan involved using a CIA asset, a former Russian nuclear engineer nicknamed Merlin, to supply the Iranians with deliberately flawed plans for nuclear weapons, in the hope that Iran would spend years attempting to develop parts which stood no chance of working. The mission was outlined in Risen's 2006 book \"State of War.\" Sterling had been Merlin's case handler. Prosecutors had acknowledged a lack of direct evidence against Sterling, however said there was strong circumstantial evidence against him. They said Sterling believed he had been mistreated by his employer. Defense attorney Barry Pollack said it made more sense for a US congressional staffer at Capitol Hill to have leaked to Risen. The court case against Sterling was delayed for several years because prosecutors were trying to make Risen divulge his sources, which he refused to do. Iran has maintained its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes but the US and its Western allies fear it to be a front for producing nuclear weapons and had targeted Iran with heavy economic sanctions. Following a breakthrough in negotiations in late 2013 which led to an interim deal for limited sanctions relief in exchange for Iran curbing some aspects of its program, negotiations have been underway to reach a long-term agreement by June 30 this year. se/bw (AP, Reuters, dpa)",

        "story": "Greece steps closer to fresh bailout money International creditors working with Greece to come up with reforms necessary to secure the next batch of bailout loans say they have struck an agreement on the most important measures. The clock is ticking for Greece and the international troika of the European Union, the European Central Bank, and the International Monetary Fund to reach an agreement on austerity measures needed to secure the next loan for Greece. Without the next instalment of bailout money, Greece risks defaulting on its loans and possibly exiting the eurozone. But Wednesday's progress was a sign that, at least in the near future, Greece's reforms were still on track. Greece needs to come up with an additional 13.5 billion euros ($17.7 billion) in spending cuts on top of previous austerity measures that are putting the squeeze on Greeks suffering from high unemployment and an economy that has been in recession for five years. The exact details of the deal between Greece and the troika have yet to be determined, but the two sides have agreed on most policy issues. Sources close to the negotiations say the final remaining sticking point is labor reform. Representatives from the troika left Greece on Wednesday and are scheduled to update European leaders at a two-day EU summit that kicks off on Thursday.

        "story": "War in Crimea unlikely, experts say Russia has put its army on alert. Although experts doubt Russia will intervene militarily in Ukraine, they agree the relations between the two countries are difficult at best. Russia is sending out conflicting signals. President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly put troops in the western and central parts of the country on alert on Wednesday (26.02.2014). A large number of the troops stand ready to move on short notice, announced Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu without giving a reason. Many Ukrainians now fear Russian military intervention following the change of leadership in their country. Moscow doesn't recognize the legitimacy of the new regime in Kyiv. A few years ago, Putin referred to a military confrontation with Ukraine as a \"nightmare.\" Heated debate in Russian parliament On Wednesday Valentina Matvijenko, chairman of the Federation Council in Moscow, said it was \"too terrible to think about,\" adding that such a scenario would be \"impossible.\" The Federation Council is the lower chamber in the Russian parliament, representing the country's regions. In the upper chamber, the Duma, a heated debate is raging over the change of leadership in the neighboring former Soviet republic. Right-wing populist Vladimir Zhirinovsky has suggested issuing passports to interested Ukrainians. Not only Ukrainians but also experts from the West are closely monitoring such developments in Russia. Jens Siegert, director of the Heinrich Böll Foundation in Moscow, notes that Russia has been offering passports to people in the breakaway Georgian region of Abkhazia. \"I view this as a dangerous step,\" Siegert told DW. But he isn't sure whether the Kremlin would make a similar move in Ukraine. Other experts doubt that Russia will intervene militarily in Ukraine. \"I rule out that scenario,\" said Gerhard Mangott from the University of Innsbruck. \"That would severely damage Russian relations with the European Union and the United States,\" he told DW, adding that the Ukrainian army could also be expected to put up strong resistance. If there were to be any clashes in Crimea between the Russians and Ukrainians or the Tatar population and if the leadership in Kyiv were to intervene with security forces or if Crimean autonomy were to be in question, \"then I could imagine Russian military intervention,\" Mangott said. But he views these possibilities as \"highly unlikely.\" 'Huge defeat for Moscow' Christian Wipperfürth with the German Society for Foreign Policy (DGAP) in Berlin also doesn't expect any intervention on the part of Russia. \"I see no reason why Ukrainian borders should be at risk,\" he told DW but doesn't rule out the possibility completely. Most experts agree, however, that Russia has made mistakes in its Ukrainian policy. \"This is unquestionably a huge defeat for Moscow,\" Mangott said. The Kremlin, he added, underestimated the opposition protest on Independence Square. President Putin apparently believed he could sway Ukraine \"to his side\" with a $15 billion loan. \"Russia has no opportunity to maneuver Ukraine in a direction,\" says Peter Schulze from the University of Göttingen. \"This opportunity vanished with the resignation of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych,\" he told DW. Moscow, he argues \"has absolutely no interest to bang on the table and behave carelessly\" and knows that it can't play a \"separatist card\" in the Ukraine. Views also differ on how relations between the two countries will develop in the future. Schulze, for instance, believes much will depend on the outcome of the early presidential election in Ukraine in late May 2014. Even if Ukraine should seek stronger ties to Europe - a move that Russia views critically - Kyiv and Moscow would be forced \"to get along with each other,\" he said. Possible 'nyet' to loans and gas discounts All the same, Wipperfürth expects the relations between Ukraine and Russia \"to remain difficult.\" Ukraine continues to push away from Russia, he says, but doubts Russia will put \"massive pressure\" on Ukraine. Mangott is less convinced. He doesn't rule out Russia dropping its promised loans to Ukraine as well as its discount on natural gas. A majority of Russians also want the country to hold back on Ukraine. According to a recent poll conducted by the Moscow research institute VTsIOM, 73 percent of Russians said the country should not interfere.",

        "story": "Mexican president calls Canada's Trudeau ahead of NAFTA talks Mexico's President Pena Nieto has asked Canada's Prime Minister Trudeau to help press Donald Trump on the importance of NAFTA to the region. Trump has promised to renegotiate or tear up the free trade agreement. Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto spoke with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Sunday as the two agreed to mount a united front after US President Donald Trump announced he would meet with the pair to renegotiate a regional trade deal. A statement from Pena Nieto's office said that Mexico would push for economic integration in North America. Earlier on Sunday, Trump announced plans to meet with Pena Nieto and Trudeau \"very soon\" to discuss the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Trump has said he wants a \"fair deal\" for the United States, and has threatened to withdraw from the treaty if a new agreement is not reached. Under the deal's stipulations, it is relatively simple for one party to withdraw from the agreement. One country simply has to notify the other signatories, thereby opening up a 180-day window for a new deal to be reached. Canadian officials have warned their US counterparts that with the two countries' economies so inextricably linked, protectionist adjustments to the deal would hurt Americans and Canadians alike. As Canada's ambassador to Washington, David MacNaughton, pointed out on Sunday, however, his country is not likely to be in the spotlight during the talks. \"I don't think Canada is the focus at all,\" MacNaughton told reporters. \"But we are part of NAFTA, and there are discussions that need to be had, and we'll be having them over the next few weeks.\" Mexican economy shudders under Trump comments The situation may be more worrying for Mexico, as Trump's threats to sanction companies that move manufacturing from the US to its southern neighbor have sent shock waves through Mexico's economy. The announcement of renewed NAFTA negotiations came ahead of high-level talks on immigration, trade and security between senior US and Mexican officials set to take place on Wednesday and Thursday. Trump will met with Pena Nieto separately on January 31. Despite his repeated threats to build a border wall between their two countries, Trump praised his Mexican counterpart on Sunday when he discussed the NAFTA talks. \"The president has been really very amazing and I think we are going to have a very good result for Mexico, for the United States, for everybody involved. It's very important.\" es/kl (AP, AFP, Reuters)",

        "story": "Syrian chemical weapons plan behind schedule The US is renewing pressure on Syria to turn over all of its chemical weapons after missing multiple deadlines. Damascus and some experts blame the civil war. Others see a move by Assad to make himself indispensable. Doubts held by many experts regarding the timetable for the destruction of Syria's chemical weapons have turned out to be true. According to the plan drawn up by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), all of the Assad regime's poison gas should have been shipped out of Syria by the end of last December. That deadline expired without a single container of chemical weapons leaving the country. A second deadline on February 5, 2014 was also missed. All chemical materials used to produce the weapons should have been transported out of Syria by that date. So far, only 18 containers have been shipped from the Syrian port city of Latakia. Thus far, only 50 tons of chemical weapons out of a planned 1,300 have been loaded for transport. That's just four percent of the Assad regime's total stockpile. If the operation continues at this rate, it will take three years for all of the chemical weapons to be removed from Syria. Yet according to the OPCW's plan, the country's entire stockpile is to be destroyed by June 30. The Syrian government blames the security situation in the war-torn country for the delays. Additionally, bad weather, logistical problems and a lack of equipment have slowed the process. Damascus is now calling for additional war-related equipment like bomb detectors to clear roads of explosive devices. Idle ships Syria has already received equipment to transport its chemical weapons. Russia, for example, has delivered off-road SUVS and armored vehicles into the war-zone. Other countries are also making contributions to this historically one-of-a-kind mission. Denmark and Norway have stationed two cargo ships near the Syrian coast. The ships have been tasked with transporting chemical weapons and their constituents from Latakia across the Mediterranean to southern Italy. Those freight vessels are being protected by warships from Denmark, China, Great Britain, Norway and Russia. According to the plan, the chemical weapons will then be transferred to \"Cape Ray\" at the Calabrian port of Gioia Tauro. The specialized US ship will then destroy most of the chemical weapons in international waters. Many of the chemical constitutents and byproducts will be destroyed by several states on shore and in an environmentally friendly manner. \"Certainly, all of the arrangements that have been made by OPCW member states - [which] are all contributing to this extraordinary mission to remove and destroy the elements of Syria's chemical weapons program - are ready to go,\" said Michael Luhan, press spokesman for the OPCW, in an interview with DW. But right now, the ships in the Mediterranean are still waiting. And the costs of the mission are rising with every delay. The Norwegian Defense Ministry told DW that the charter for just one of the two cargo ships has already cost nearly five million euros ($6.8 million). The defense ministry remained diplomatic, however, saying that it's aware of the mission's extraordinary nature and the difficult security situation on the ground. All of the partners involved should continue to demonstrate their engagement, and further delays should be avoided, the ministry says. OPCW patience, US pressure The coordinator of the mission, Sigrid Kaag, reportedly told the UN Security Council behind closed doors that it's unlikely the Syrian government is intentionally delaying the transport of its chemical weapons. Meanwhile, OPCW spokesman Michael Luhan maintains that the final date for the destruction of all of the stockpiles would not be changed at this time. \"There's no discussion or suggestion at this point of moving that 30th of June deadline,\" he said. \"In our assessment, it is still possible to reach that deadline.\" But the OPCW's view is not shared by all of those involved in the mission. The US raised the pressure when its State Department made public on its website an OPCW assessment of the mission. \"We know the regime has the ability to move these weapons and materials because they have moved them multiple times over the course of this conflict,\" said Samantha Power, the US ambassador to the UN. \"It is time for the Assad government to stop its foot-dragging, establish a transportation plan, and stick to it.\" Syrian government playing for time? Some commentators suspect that Assad is using his chemical weapons as a bargaining chip. As long as he still possesses the weapons, he can make himself an indispensable negotiating partner and thereby win time to improve the regime's military position in the civil war. This assumption is supported by the Syrian military's refusal to destroy special hangars and subterranean facilities in which chemical weapons were once manufactured or stored. But it's questionable whether all of the blame can be laid at the feet of the Syrian government. The OPCW and its planners likely underestimated the difficulty of transporting and accessing the chemical stockpiles across the frontlines of Syria's civil war. The OPCW still has yet to inspect one of the 23 storage and production facilities declared by Damascus. The mission, however, has achieved one concrete success: The Syrian government no longer has the capability to deploy chemical weapons. Just a few weeks after the mission began in October, the OPCW reported that the production equipment, filling stations and combat munitions had been completely destroyed under its watch.",

        "story": "Belarus president dismisses PM, reshuffles government amid economic crisis Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has sacked the country's prime minister and a number of top ministers in the biggest reshuffle in years. The move comes as the former Soviet republic's economy struggles. Mikhail Myasnikovich, who served as Belarus' prime minister since December 2010, has been replaced by President Lukashenko's chief of staff, Andrei Kobyakov, the presidential press service said on Saturday, without giving reasons for the reshuffle. The president also dismissed the head of the country's central bank in what analysts say is a move to protect the country's economy. Belarus' strongman Lukashenko had warned earlier this year he would sack the administration if it failed to achieve the desired economic objectives. On Friday, the president issued another critical statement, saying the government officials might have spent too long at their posts. \"That can be fixed,\" he said. Russian sanctions An economic crisis in Russia due to Western sanctions over Ukraine and a fall in global oil prices pose a serious challenge to Belarusian economy. Although its currency is not officially pegged to the Russian ruble, the ex-Soviet republic is highly dependent on Russia, which remains its main trading partner and political ally. Last week, Lukashenko ordered the country's transactions with Russia be settled in dollars or euros in an effort to avert worst of the crisis. Its central bank also announced a \"temporary\" tax of 30 percent on all purchases of foreign currency and increased interest rates to 50 percent. The government has admitted its economy has been badly hit in the recent months as around 40 percent of its exports are linked to Russia. shs/sms (Reuters, AFP)",

Interior Ministry chief Rehman Malik said that several suspects are now being held and a case has been filed which may lead to their prosecution. At least 173 people were killed in November's attacks. Tensions between between India and Pakistan rose after Delhi said all 10 gunmen were from Pakistan. Pakistan denied any responsibility in the immediate aftermath of the attacks, but later it admitted that the sole gunman captured alive was a Pakistani national.",

        "story": "Bahrain hunger strike activist refused transfer to Denmark Bahrain has rejected a request from the Danish government to transfer a jailed activist who has been on hunger strike for almost two months. The Danish citizen has been detained for his role in an anti-regime uprising. A Danish request to transfer an anti-regime activist, currently on hunger strike in Bahrain, was rejected on Sunday, state news agency BNA reported. The handover of accused and convicted persons to foreign countries takes place under specific conditions ... This does not apply in Abdulhadi al-Khawaja's case,\" BNA quoted a Supreme Judiciary Council official as saying. Abdulhadi al-Khawaja, who is a Danish citizen, has refused food since Feb 8. He is serving a life sentence over an alleged plot to topple Bahrain's Sunni monarchy during a month-long uprising by the island nation's Shiite majority one year ago. Danish Foreign Minister Villy Soevndal issued the request to his Bahrain counterpart to transfer Khawaja to Denmark for treatment amid heightened fears over his declining health, BNA reported on Saturday. Al-Khawaja has shed some 25 percent of his body weight and was \"at risk of organ failure,\" Front Line Defenders, an Ireland-based non-governmental organization, said Tuesday after a visit to Bahrain's capital Manama. The organization warned that the 52-year-old activist could die in jail. The Bahraini authorities have confirmed that he had lost some 10 kilogram's (22 pounds), while his lawyer said that he was weak but conscious on Friday, when he visited him in hospital. Defending human rights Al-Khawaja is a former Middle East and North Africa director of Front Line Defenders and has documented human rights abuses in Bahrain for international rights groups such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. Having lived in exile in Denmark for several decades he returned to Bahrain in 2001. Last April he was arrested and sentenced to life imprisonment alongside six other opposition figures in a special security court, which was set up after Bahrain imposed martial law last March to quell political unrest. Opposition supporters have staged daily rallies in Bahrain calling for his release which have often sparked clashes with security forces. With tensions still high, former Formula One champion driver Damon Hill has demanded a rethink of the contentious Bahrain Grand Prix which is due to take place in two week's time. The premier international event was cancelled last year as a result of political unrest. ccp/pfd (AFP, AP)",

        "story": "Thailand charges 72 in human trafficking crackdown Thai prosecutors are to indict 72 people on human trafficking charges, including state officials. It comes after thousands of Rohingya Muslims were stranded at sea trying to flee Myanmar via Thailand. A spokesman for the Office of the Attorney General (OAG) said on Friday it had issued an order to charge 72 people on 16 counts, mostly over human trafficking, including more than a dozen state officials of all levels. Arrest warrants have been issued for at least 45 others, who remain at large. \"We will not let influential people rise above justice,\" Wanchai Roujanavong told reporters at a press conference in Bangkok. Among the suspects is Lieutenant General Manas Kongpan, charged with being a major smuggling kingpin. The charges include human trafficking, involvement in international crimes, taking and bringing illegal migrants and malfeasance. The court must now decide whether to take up the cases. Thailand has long been criticized for not doing more to combat the lucrative human trafficking business in the country. Until a major Thai crackdown in May, the trade had flourished, as thousands of mainly Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar were being smuggled to their preferred destination, Malaysia, via Thailand's southern provinces. During their investigation - Thailand's biggest according to police - the authorities discovered vast smuggling rings, leading traffickers to abandon boats crammed with thousands of migrants at sea, attracting widespread international attention. Thai police say they have now successfully dismantled the trafficking network through the kingdom. But rights groups are waiting for the end of the monsoon season in a few months to see if the crackdown has worked. Around 4,500 Rohingya as well as Bangladeshi migrants were stranded in Southeast Asian waters in recent months, ping-ponged between countries reluctant to accept them until finally landing ashore on Malaysian, Indonesian, Bangladeshi, Myanmar and Thai soil. As part of the crackdown, investigators also discovered 26 bodies in graves buried deep in a jungle near the border with Malaysia. Last June, the United States downgraded Thailand one of its oldest allies in Asia, to the lowest \"Tier 3\" status in its 2014 Trafficking in Persons (TIP) Report, for not meeting the minimum standards for combating the illicit trade.

        "story": "Germans March for Peace Some 50,000 people took to the streets in Germany over the weekend to take part in the traditional Easter peace marches. Activists protested against war, cutbacks in the social welfare system and the new EU constitution. The US-led war in Iraq was the center of renewed criticism at Germany's Easter peace marches in 65 cities across the country this year. But participants also emphasized the drawbacks of the new European constitution, which must be approved by German lawmakers on May 12. \"We want social equality and civil protection rather than pre-emptive war, as well as a democratic Europe,\" said Willi van Ooyen, spokesman for the organizers \"Informationsstelle Ostermarsch.\" Van Ooyen said the diversity of participants reflected the lasting awareness of people interested in the peace movement to get involved in current political debates. \"Never again fascism, never again war\" The main demonstrations took place in Berlin, Hamburg and Frankfurt, where the organizers are based. The Network of the German Peace Movement took a positive stock of the marches. \"Sixty years after the liberation of Germany from Hitler's fascism and the end of the Second World War, these demonstrations expressed the indissoluble consensus of the era: never again fascism, never again war,\" the Network's director Manfred Stenner said in a statement. He said the ongoing skepticism against war and the military in Germany was also the merit of the postwar peace movement. Constitution committed to rearmament? The protests also drew attention to the new European constitution, which is currently in its ratification process across Europe. Stenner said, though, that this criticism was not directed against Europe's integration, but rather because the draft \"sets the course for rearmament and military adventure.\" The peace march in the industrial Ruhr basin focussed on those parts of the European constitution which, according to peace groups, encourage militarization. They quoted Article I-41, which states: \"Member States shall undertake progressively to improve their military capabilities.\" \"This is a commitment to rearmament on a constitutional level,\" said Felix Oekentorp, spokesman of the Ruhr Easter march committee. \"This is unequalled worldwide and that alone is reason enough for us to say that this constitution draft is not acceptable for the peace movement.\" Not mimic the United States European citizens should use the referendum process as an opportunity to lead an \"intense discussion\" about what kind of Europe they want, said Stenner. \"If the current constitution draft were to fail, peace initiatives and globalization opponents are hopeful that the basic principles of the European Union will move more in the direction of social justness, greater commitment to peace politics and dealing with conflicts civilly,\" he said. If the referendums failed, European governments would have to rework the constitution. \"Europe shouldn't strive to militarily mimic the superpower United States,\" said Stenner. \"Rather, it should use its peacemaking policies to bridge the gap to southern countries, as well as to the Islamic and Arab world.\" The Easter peace marches started in Britain in the 1950s to call for nuclear disarmament. Since then, tens of thousands of people across Europe take to the streets during Easter. In Germany, the first march took place in 1960. They peaked in Germany in 1983, when 700,000 people protested against the installation of US Pershing II missiles in the country.",

        "story": "Mario Götze impresses, but lack of goals holding him back Germany’s machine rolls on and shows no signs of stopping after another victory in World Cup qualifying. Mario Götze’s performance was intriguing, but a lack of goals is holding him back. Aided by a rapturous Hamburg crowd happy for a change of scenery from their domestic disappointments, Germany showed that all the spokes of their tactical wheel were functioning in a dominant display against the Czech Republic on Saturday night. From defenders conducting to Thomas Müller's clinical finishing, it was another evening of expectations met from Joachim Löw's men. Mario Götze, who has struggled to hit the heights expected of him since his return to Borussia Dortmund, probably should have had a goal in both halves. He probably should have had an assist as well, but he showed flashes of the understanding that has recently been lacking at club level. Perhaps leading the line for Germany – rather than playing as a No.10 – is a role he's grown more comfortable with recently. The display against the Czech Republic certainly seemed to suggest as much. The only thing he lacked on the night was a goal. Nevertheless, with Götze clearly enjoying his role as a false nine, Germany flooded the opposition half when in possession. Both Jonas Hector and Joshua Kimmich were so wide and high up the pitch that Jerome Boateng and Mats Hummels were left to instigate many of Germany's attacks, with the former spreading passes like a quarterback at times. With Sami Khedira and Toni Kroos occasionally sweeping into the defensive line, it was clear why the driving midfield presence of Ilkay Gündogan was a luxury surplus to requirements until late in the second half. It should be noted that with a head coach not long in the job and Tomas Rosicky and Petr Cech now retired, Czech football's rebuild is clearly still in its infancy. There wasn't even a hint of a reminder that Germany's last competitive defeat on home soil came against the Czech Republic. The usual second-half dip came just after the hour mark, but by then the result had long been decided and the Mexican waves were well and truly rolling around the Volksparkstadion. Much of Germany's team is already in place for the tournament they are currently looking to qualify for. It's Götze's role that remains the most intriguing, though. With Mario Gomez unlikely to keep his form and fitness, the role of leading the line is Götze's position to lose. With Julian Brandt, Max Meyer and Leroy Sane breathing down his neck though, Götze knows that sooner rather than later he'll need to do more than just flash his brilliance. Northern Ireland on Tuesday would be a good place to start.",

        "story": "New police raid on Deutsche Bank HQ in Frankfurt German investigators have carried out a search on the premises of Deutsche Bank's Frankfurt headquarters. The raid comes as the bank struggles to break free of regulatory issues that led to the resignation of its CEOs. The investigators carried out their search as \"subpoenas\" in connection with \"an ongoing inquiry,\" a spokesman for the state prosecutors' office in Frankfurt said. He said the office could not say anything about the reasons for the search because \"the operational phase\" was still ongoing. A source familiar with the incident said some 30 police officers in 10 police cars had arrived at the Deutsche Bank headquarters in Germany's banking capital to take part in the search. Deutsche Bank, whose premises have been searched several times in the past, confirmed that the raid took place, saying that none of its employees had been charged with any wrongdoing. \"I can confirm there were searches today at offices of Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt at the request of prosecutors in Wiesbaden,\" a bank spokesman said. Wiesbaden is a city just to the west of Frankfurt. \"The searches were aimed at obtaining evidence in connection with an inquiry against clients in respect of certain securities transactions,\" he said. Scandals galore The financial institution has recently been facing a number of legal problems, including probes into alleged manipulation of benchmark interest rates and derivatives, tax evasion and money laundering. Last month, it was fined a record $2.5 billion (2.2 billion euros) for its involvement in manipulating the interbank lending rate Libor. On Sunday, the banks two co-CEOs, Anshu Jain and Jürgen Fitschen, said they would be stepping down amid falling shareholders' confidence. John Cryan, former chief financial officer at Swiss banking giant UBS, will replace Jain when he leaves on June 30, and then become the bank's sole chief executive when Fitschen retires in one year's time. Fitschen is currently on trial in Munich on allegations of perjury stemming from testimony regarding the dissolution of the Kirch media empire. tj/bw (dpa, Reuters)",

        "story": "Vatican charges 78-year-old ex-bank chief with €50 million embezzlement The former chief of the Vatican's bank and his 94-year-old lawyer allegedly scraped profits from property sales. Pope Francis has been cracking down on financial impropriety. The former president of the Vatican bank and his lawyer have been charged with embezzlement for the loss of more than €50 million ($62 million). Angelo Caloia, 78, was president of the Institute for Works of Religion (IOR) from 1999 to 2009. His lawyer, Gabriele Liuzzo, 94, was also charged while a third person under investigation, former IOR director general Lelio Scaletti, died several years ago. Read more: Vatican court convicts ex-hospital head over luxury housing scandal The IOR said in a statement that the pair were charged with alleged acts of embezzlement and self-laundering between 2001 and 2008, when the bank offloaded \"a considerable part of its real estate assets.\" In December 2014 the Vatican's top prosecutor, Gian Piero Milano, froze accounts worth millions of euros held by the three men. He suspected the men of misrepresenting the sale prices of 29 buildings between 2001 and 2008 and pocketing the difference, according to a Reuters news agency report. The bank has been involved in various financial scandals over the past decades, with thousands of accounts being closed last year as part of a clean up effort by Pope Francis. The trial starts on March 15. aw/jlw (Reuters, AP) DW editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism. You can sign up to receive it directly here.",

        "story": "EU tells Turkey migrant flows 'still way too high' The EU plans to offer Turkey billions of dollars in aid to stem the exodus of refugees into Europe has so far had little effect. Thousands continue to make the perilous journey every day. Seven weeks after the EU and Turkey reached agreement on curbing the refugee flow into Europe, migrants continue to arrive in Turkey with the aim of gaining entry to the EU. But while critical of Turkey's efforts to stem the flow across the Aegean Sea, EU Vice President Frans Timmermans said Ankara and Brussels had to work together to implement the agreed upon action plan. Toward that end, Turkish authorities may start offering Syrians work permits - in an attempt to lure them into staying in Turkey. \"The goal of this (action plan) is to stem the flow; 2,000 to 3.000 (arrivals) a day is not stemming the flow,\" Timmermans said, after meeting with Turkey's EU Affairs Minister Volkan Bozkir. \"But we are in this together and we will work on that.\" As part of the deal reached on November 29, EU leaders pledged 3 billion euros ($3.2 billion) in aid for the more than 2.2 million Syrian refugees sheltering in Turkey in exchange for Ankara acting to reduce the flow. More than 1 million asylum seekers arrived in the EU in 2015, and governments across the bloc are under increasing domestic pressure to stem the tide. But every day thousands more attempt the perilous journey, all too often with fatal results. During a single day last week Turkish authorities said 36 migrants, including several children, either washed up along Turkish shores or were found floating in the sea after their boats sank. Thousands more have managed safe landings in Turkey and made their way to Greece in the hope of reaching wealthier EU countries such as Germany and Sweden. But the Balkan corridor to western Europe is rapidly closing, and now thousands more migrants are finding themselves stuck in Greece - an EU country with 25 percent unemployment. Fewer than 1,000 people so far have opted for voluntary repatriation, according to Daniel Edras, who heads the International Office of Migration in Greece. \"It's one thing to return in handcuffs,\" he said, \"and quite another to go as a normal passenger with some money in your pocket, because we give them each 400 euros ($435).\" But repatriation isn't an option for tens of thousands from countries torn apart by violence. \"I can't go back to Somalia,\" said English teacher Ali Heydar Aki, who hoped to settle in Europe and then bring his family. \"I have sold half my house\" to fund the trip. bik/ng (AFP, AP)",

        "story": "Fashionistas Unite in Düsseldorf Its organizers say it’s the world's largest fashion trade fair. So what is cpd man-woman doing in Germany? When most people think fashion, Paris immediately comes to mind. This though is followed quickly, of course, by Milan, New York or London. But for buyers and sellers of ready-to-wear this week, the most important place to be was in Düsseldorf, Germany. The three-day fashion trade fair \"Collections Premieres Düsseldorf-cpd woman-man\" comes to a close on Tuesday. In it, some 1,900 exhibitors from 51 countries are showing women's and men's collections for spring and summer 2004. And the show's organizers, Igedo, said they expect the final tally for visitors will be in the region of 60,000. Low fashion profile Despite its no-frills image, Germany has produced a handful of internationally renowned fashion designers, such as Karl Lagerfeld, Jil Sander, Wolfgang Joop and Hugo Boss. And firms like Escada, Bogner, and Strenesse have enjoyed international repute for decades. But while fashion plays an important role in daily life in Germany, especially for young people, the attitude differs from that of classic haute-couture countries such as France and Italy. In Germany, high fashion does not have the status of a stand-alone cultural asset, like art, literature or architecture. Thus, some of the hottest young German designers, such as Dirk Schönberger, Markus Lupfer, and Bernhard Willhelm, choose to work abroad. \"Germany is not a classic fashion country,\" says Peter Paul Polte, editor-in-chief of the textile industry magazine Textilwirtschaft (Textile Industry.) \"But German companies know a lot about marketing and production.\" Fashion exports According to cpd statistics, Germany is the largest and most important market for textile and apparel manufacturers in Europe. In 2000, Germany ranked as the third-largest textile importing country after the United States and Hong Kong. In 2001, German textile and apparel imports amounted to almost €30 billion ($34 billion). As an exporter, Germany ranks fifth, after China, Hong Kong, Italy and the United States, with total exports of €19.5 billion in 2001. Yet as with so much else having to do with Germany's economy, the picture is not entirely rosy. In 2002, the German textile and clothing industry had turnover of some €23.9 billion , of which clothing accounted for €9.6 billion – down some 8 percent from the previous year. This year, with the economy faltering, fashion is once again on the ropes, with overall sales some 5 percent lower for the first five months of the year, from the same period last year, according to the Associated Press. Düsseldorf, with its fashion trade fairs (in addition to cpd, there is a shoe trade fair and an international beauty fair,) supports 1,400 fashion-related businesses with a total turnover of about €13 billion. The Königsallee, or Kö, is one of the great shopping streets of Europe, lined with upscale designer boutiques. Fashion capital moves to Berlin? While industry insiders hope the fair will give German fashion sales a boost, Düsseldorf officials simply hope the cpd will remain in their city. Since the wall came down in 1989, Berlin has steadily been securing its place as the country's culture capital, with increasing numbers of events moving there from smaller cities. Recent press reports suggested that the cpd may be the latest big trade fair to do so, but Harald Schartau, the economy minister of the state of North Rhine Westphalia (of which Düsseldorf is the capital) denies it. Düsseldorf will remain Germany's fashion capital, Schartau told the DPA news agency. \"The (cpd) benefits from a unique environment, from the many (locally)-based textile and clothing companies, designer-oriented shops and retailers, fashion centers, showrooms and order rooms, and a network of creative workers in advertising, design and fashion,\" he said. Yet even if cpd stays in Düsseldorf, German fashion's cutting edge may already belong to Berlin. The BREAD & butter trade fair, showing \"urbanwear and street couture\", used to be in Cologne but moved to Berlin this year. And the \"No Dress?!\" public show in Berlin is a hot venue for small, innovative labels promoting young talent.",

        "story": "Ex-Virginia Governor Jim Gilmore joins Republican nomination race in US election Former Virginia Governor Jim Gilmore has become the seventeenth major Republican figure to throw his hat into the ring in the race for Republican presidential nomination. He is unlikely to appear in the televised debate. The 65-year-old filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission on Wednesday to stand alongside a number of considerably higher profiles, including former Florida governor Jeb Bush, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, Senator Marco Rubio and real estate tycoon Donald Trump. Having previously headed the Gilmore Commission - which advised both President Bill Clinton and George W. Bush on ways to improve homeland security strategy, particularly against domestic terrorism involving weapons of mass destruction - Gilmore is hoping that his national security credentials will work in his favor. He was also governor of Virginia on September 11, 2001, when hijackers crashed a plane into the Pentagon, which sits in the eastern US state, across from Washington. \"I don't think we're addressing the threat to the country,\" Gilmore told the Richmond Times-Dispatch earlier in July. \"I bring to the table experience others don't have,\" he added. Gilmore's first opportunity to take to the Republican stage will be on August 6 during the party's primary debate. Broadcaster Fox News has ruled, however, that only the top 10 candidates in nationwide polls will participate in the debate. Little-known outside Virginia, it is unlikely that Gilmore will make the final cut. ksb/jil (AFP, Reuters)",

        "story": "Solar-powered plane makes next US leg of global journey The Solar Impulse 2 plane has departed from the US state of Oklahoma on an 18-hour journey to Ohio. The solar-powered plane is on a mission to circumnavigate the globe. The plane took off from Tulsa, Oklahoma, early on Saturday morning on its way to Dayton, Ohio, where the Wright Brothers developed the first powered airplane. The 18-hour flight is the 12th leg of a journey for the Swiss-made Solar Impulse 2 as it attempts to circumnavigate 35,000 kilometers (21,700 miles) around the globe without using any gasoline. After Ohio, the plane is expected to make one more stop in the United States before crossing the Atlantic to Europe, from where it will continue on to the United Arab Emirates. \"The flight is part of the attempt to achieve the first ever Round-The-World Solar Flight, the goal of which is to demonstrate how modern clean technologies can achieve the impossible,\" the project said in a statement. The plane's 17,000 solar cells power propellers and charge batteries. Its ideal speed is only 45 kmh (28 mph), but it can go twice as fast during the day, when the sun gives it a boost. At night the plane runs on a battery using power stored during the day. The plane, which is as heavy as a car and has wings wider than a Boeing 747, is being operated by two Swiss pilots, Bertrand Piccard and Andre Borschberg. They started the journey in March 2015 from the United Arab Emirates, traveled more than 27,000 kilometers and spent 351 hours in the air. Previous stops include Oman, India, Myanmar, China and Japan. In the United States, the crew stopped in Hawaii for several months to repair a battery damaged during a five-day flight from Japan. They then continued on to San Francisco and Arizona. cw/bw (AFP, AP)",

        "story": "For refugees, psychological trauma doesn't end in Germany About 30 percent of refugees and asylum seekers are considered traumatized. Unfortunately, the trauma doesn't always stop upon reaching Germany. Ruan doesn't even notice the overcrowded dormitory in Cologne. The young man from Somalia only notices his constant inner restlessness. He cannot sleep well because of his nightmares. Again and again he watches as his family is killed in a militia attack right before his eyes. Ruan himself has experienced abuse, and his sister Marula was raped. Smugglers took the last of their money. Their papers were lost on the boat that took them to Italy. From there they continued their flight across France and Holland to Germany. They have already described their odyssey to authorities in Germany with the help of an interpreter. After probing questions and photographs taken by German authorities, they now prefer to be silent and not e photographed. Humiliating identification procedures If suspicious of illegal entry, German police are obliged to open an investigation and carry out so-called \"identification measures.\" Pictures are taken and fingerprints are recorded. In the case of missing papers and ambiguous information, the actual age of the refugees must be determined. Tooth positions and bone structure are considered - in a few cases also the presence of pubic hair. When these steps cannot determine a person's age X-rays of bones in the hand, chest or clavicle are taken by the Institute of Legal Medicine. Medical associations, however, have called this practice \"unethical\" and point out that the \"bone age\" may even differ by several years from the actual age of a person. Moreover, X-rays may constitute a form of bodily harm. Many young refugees find the experience humiliating, as talks with the investigating authorities revealed. Often they also complain about how they are brought from one place to another. At the request of the Berlin State Parliament in April 2013, the Berlin Senate admitted that minors were sometimes handcuffed while being transported: \"to avoid being hurt by other or themselves and to prevent the escape.\" While in custody, refugees have also been kept in open collection cells without contact to outside people while their medical data is analyzed. The Berlin Senate later said no official court order is necessary to restrict people's freedom of movement during the identification process. The nightmare of seeking asylum Ruan and Marula, like many thousands of refugees, have another problem. For each asylum application, the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees has to decide if the applicant meets the criteria for protection. In addition to establishing the first EU country the applicant entered, the office's examination includes information about asylum seekers' reason for fleeing their homeland. In the past, this information has frequently been rejected as \"insufficient\" or \"unsubstantial.\" \"What really is traumatic is the often very long asylum procedures,\" said Bernd Mesovic of the refugee rights group ProAsyl. The process can take up to one and a half years. Short-term visas giving applicants \"tolerated\" status, which allows them to stay temporarily and are often extended only at the last minute, can be especially unnerving. \"The period of uncertainty feels like helplessness and increases the post-traumatic stress from experiences before fleeing,\" said Elise Bittenbinder, describing the situation of many refugees. Bittenbinder is an educator and psychotherapist working for the Nationwide Association of Psychosocial Centers for Refugees and Victims of Torture - an umbrella group of 25 specialized agencies address the treatment of traumatized refugees. \"There has rarely been a time in history when as many people in need of treatment have come to Germany,\" added Bernd Mesovic, \"Often, fear is all that remains.\" A mountain of pressure Little attention is paid to the psychological burdens of being a refugee. Depression, anxiety as well as suicidal tendencies frequently go undetected or untreated because healthcare provided under the Asylum Seekers Benefits Act covers only acute diseases and pain. Psychological hardships are also lurking in everyday life, according to ProAsyl and charities such as Caritas and Diakonie. Asylum seekers are prohibited from working during the first months of their stay in Germany and access to language courses depends on the details of their residence permits and permitted length of stay. The forced idleness is reinforced as refugees are not permitted to leave their officially assigned accommodation. Concentrated living quarters lead to ghettoization and isolation. \"For the purchase of food, they are given vouchers banning the purchase of consumer goods, which they feel is derogatory,\" Bittenbinder said after numerous discussions with refugees. Mitigating circumstances Living conditions for refugees are supposed to improve. The Federal Constitutional Court has ruled that asylum seekers and refugees are entitled to more money and that a decent living conditions should be ensured. Vouchers are seldom used in many cities and towns anymore - and compensation for services provided by the refugees will be paid in cash. The residence requirement, which restricts travel out of the state where asylum seekers are accommodated, has already been loosened in some states, could be replaced by more permissive freedom of movement regulations, according to a federal bill approved in September by the Bundesrat, Germany's upper house of parliament. But fears for their future remain for many refugees, as it does for Ruan and Marula from Somalia.",

        "story": "Eastern German Town Boasts Cutting-Edge Technology There's more to eastern Germany than just chronic joblessness and neo-Nazism. The state of Thuringia is the nerve center of sophisticated and innovative optical technology. Former Communist East Germany may today be associated with renovated prefabricated housing blocks and empty city centers. But the city of Jena in the eastern German state of Thuringia effortlessly defies that image. The place is a hive of activity these days. Not only is it a major center for the optics industry there is also a technology and innovations park with around 60 firms and several research centers on the campus of the University of Applied Sciences. One of the most innovative companies is Jenoptik which focuses on six areas of expertise. According to Jenoptik's Norbert Thiel, lasers and particularly diode lasers are an important focus of attention and will continue to be so in the future. \"It's very clear the laser processing material markets will be one of our main investments in the future. A huge market which is coming up is the laser soldering and laser welding,\" said Thiel. \"And the second point of diode lasers is the medicine market. For example, hair removal is a huge market for laser diodes.\" Aerospace and back to earth Another area that Jenoptik is increasingly trying to gain a foothold in is aerospace. The famous multi-spectral camera was developed in Jena for the Russian Mir space project. Norbert Thiel points out that today Jenoptik is very active in a current aerospace project called Rapid Eye. \"We analyze with this camera from space the chlorophyll content of the earth so we can make direct earth observations,\" Thiel pointed out. \"We are a market leader in the field of sensor technology. We aren't intending to assemble and design satellites but we are very much focused on this technology in the future.\" Back on earth, life is destined to get difficult for speeding motorists following the work done by Jenoptik together with its partner company Robot. Jenoptik has developed a speed measurement system based on lasers. And, says Thiel, the future will be in digital speed cameras. So there will be no film to replace and a speeding motorist won't even know he's been caught. \"We have a lot of expertise here. If you measure a distance five times in very short pulses you get the velocity, you get the speed of a car. We developed a speed measurement system based on lasers. So digital camera, the future will be an infrared flash.\" Cures for cancer and multiple sclerosis Jena is also home to a range of top-notch research institutes such as The Institute for Physical High Technology which performs research and development projects in the areas of magnetics, quantum electronics, micro-systems and laser technology. A further top address for cutting-edge research is the renowned Beutenberg Campus in Jena. It includes several research institutes which link the fields of physics and optics to new applications in the life sciences. Wacker Biotech is a prominent example. Its core focus is in the manufacture of so-called biologics. \"These are active ingredients for pharmaceuticals. This is a new class of molecules which developed during the last, I would say, 30 years and what we normally know is so called small molecules,\" explained Wacker's Anke Suter. \"They're used in the treatment of cancers, multiple sclerosis and because they are proteins they can act in a way that synthesized molecules can't currently. This is a new market and it is strongly growing with an average growth rate of 16 person cent,\" Suter added. \"Software is the key driver\" Another big name on the Jena research landscape is Carl Zeiss, which was founded in 1846 as a workshop for precision mechanics and optics in Jena and quickly gained a worldwide reputation for the high quality of its products. \"I think innovation is the key of what our business is all about,\" said Ulrich Simon, president and chief executive of Carl Zeiss Micro Imaging in Jena. \"Innovation is the core driver. We generate a lot of patents, roughly two patents a day over the entire organization,\" he added. It's obvious that the future for Carl Zeiss lies in automation and miniaturization. \"To really turn data in information knowledge -- I think that will be the key driver for the future business,\" said Simon. \"Software is one of the key drivers. What you want to do in the end is you just put a sample into the laptop and get out the information, by just hitting one button. This will be our vision.\"",

        "story": "Contentious US-Korea missile defense system delayed China has long campaigned against the deployment of the military system and some Korean politicians say it is not worth the trouble. It is a heated political issue in a country gripped by political instability. The deployment of a controversial US missile defense system in South Korea designed to protect against North Korean aggression could be delayed, Seoul's defense ministry said on Monday. The Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system was due to be built on a golf course owned by the Lotte Group conglomerate in the Seongju region, southeast of South Korea's capital Seoul. \"The plan to go ahead with the exchange will be signed by mid-January, but there is a possibility it will be slightly delayed,\" South Korean ministry spokesman Moon Sang-gyun said. He said they were waiting on a meeting with Lotte directors to settle land use fees. South Korea and the US had said the THAAD deployment was to protect against North Korea's growing nuclear and ballistic capabilities. Heavy regional opposition But China strongly objected, saying its powerful radar could penetrate Chinese territory. This led to some South Korea opposition leaders to call for its delay or cancellation. They argued that the security benefits would be outweighed by worsened relations with China and Russia. China and Russia railed against the deployment, warning of unspecified retaliation and a sharp downturn in relations with Seoul if it went ahead. \"China believes it is a serious threat to China's security interests and for the region,\" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said last week. \"I believe that as long as our country has legitimate security concerns, it is understandable that necessary measures be taken to safeguard such interests.\" Local landowners also protested against its use saying it would destroy melon crops and make the area a target for North Korea. Effect of political crisis South Korea is currently in the midst of a political crisis after lawmakers voted to impeach incumbent President Park Geun-hye over an influence-peddling scandal. If upheld by the Constitutional Court, the motion will trigger new presidential elections. Presidential hopeful Moon Jae-in said its deployment should wait until the next administration is elected. Potential rival candidate, former United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, said on Sunday it was appropriate for THAAD to be deployed in the country. \"Since the reality is the Korean peninsula is in a quasi-war-like state, such action made by the government is appropriate,\" Ban was quoted by South Korea's Yonhap News Agency as saying. aw/rt (Reuters, AP)",

EU officials are anxious about the UK's lack of mandate to negotiate its exit from the bloc. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she was hopeful that Britain would stick to the Brexit plan following the snap general election that saw the ruling Conservative Party lose some of its parliamentary seats. The talks about Britain's exit from the 28 member European Union are scheduled for June 19 but the election results have cast doubts about them. British Prime Minister Theresa May had hoped to win a bigger mandate in the snap vote and improve her position in negotiations with the EU on Brexit. After the Labor Party's surge in the general election, its leader Jeremy Corbyn said Prime Minister May did not have the clear mandate to carry forward Brexit talks with the EU. Merkel optimistic \"On our side we are ready to negotiate and prepared,\" Merkel said Friday in Mexico City after talks with President Enrique Pena Nieto, adding that she hoped Britain was also interested in sticking to the agreed negotiating schedule. \"I assume that Britain, from what I heard from the prime minister today, wants to stick to its negotiating plan,\" Merkel told a news conference alongside President Nieto. \"We want to negotiate quickly, we want to negotiate in the agreed timeframe,\" Merkel added. So far, May has not hinted at any deviation from the plan. - Opinion: Theresa May's devastating miscalculation - When European politicians bet big - and lost The German chancellor pointed out that regardless of Britain's imminent exit from the EU, the country will remain a good partner with the bloc. \"Britain is a member of NATO, so we have a lot of shared challenges to deal with, and that's the spirit we want to carry out these negotiations in. But obviously while also asserting the interests of the 27 member states that will make up the European Union in future,\" she underlined. shs/jm (dpa, AFP, Reuters)",

        "story": "Number of fake euros in Germany at all-time high New data show an all-time high in the number of counterfeit euros in Germany. But it's still not a huge problem: The average German would have to live for 800 years to come into possession of a single fake banknote. The German central bank, or Bundesbank, has released a report saying that about 50,500 fake banknotes with a total value of 2.2 million euros ($2.4 million) had been registered in the first half of 2015. That's an increase of 31 percent over the second half of 2014, and it's two and a half times as many bogus banknotes as were registered two years earlier, in the second half of 2013. Also on Friday, the European Central Bank (ECB) said that worldwide 454,000 fake euro banknotes had been withdrawn from circulation in the first six months of 2015 - the second highest amount since the introduction of the euro, but still less than in the first half of last year. The Bundesbank examines about 15 billion banknotes each year, searching for counterfeits. Statistically, given the number of counterfeit notes it finds, that means there are about 12 fake banknotes in circulation person 10,000 residents of Germany. The same data can be used to work out that an average German would have to live for eight centuries in order to happen across a single fake euro banknote, according to Carl-Ludwig Thiele, who is the chief of the Bundesbank's cash provision section. Nevertheless, the counterfeiting trend has been sharply upward over the past couple of years, and so the Eurosystem and the police are determined to increase their efforts to shut down counterfeiters, the Bundesbank reported. A key measure has been the introduction of new banknotes that are more difficult to counterfeit - a second series that replaces the banknotes the eurozone has used since the year 2000. Redesigned 5- and 10-euro banknotes are already in circulation; a new 20-euro banknote will come off the presses starting November 25. \"The 20- and 50-euro banknotes of the first series were counterfeited particularly often,\" Thiele said. The data show that 41 percent of all counterfeit notes were 20-euro notes, and 48 percent were 50-euro notes. The number of counterfeit coins, in contrast, has declined sharply recently. In the first half of 2015, about 14,500 fake coins were found; in the second half of 2014, about 26,000 had been found. How to check a banknote's authenticity The Bundesbank warns retailers and others who handle a lot of cash that they should screen for counterfeit notes before accepting payments, because there is no compensation for fake banknotes. \"The authenticity of a banknote can be tested by a procedure of 'feel-see-tilt' quite readily,\" said Thiele. In examining a banknote, several security features should be scanned, because the authenticity of euro banknotes can best be verified in the interplay of the various features: One can feel the texture of embossed lettering on their front side, as follows: In the older (first) euro banknote series, one finds the legend \"BCE ECB EZB EKT EKP\" at the top. In the newer banknotes, one finds the legend \"BCE ECB EЦБ EZB EKP EKT EKB BĊE EBC\" and additional stripes on the right and left edges. The watermarks can be seen in the unprinted area by holding a banknote up to the light. The hologram image changes when the banknote is tilted. On the back, pearly-sheened stripes (in denominations up to 20 euros) or shifting colors of the right value number (denominations from 50 euros upward) can be checked by tilting the banknote. In addition, the new \"Europe series\" euro banknotes have an \"emerald number\": By tilting the banknote, one can see the color change, and a bright bar is seen to move up or down. When examining a suspect banknote, it's helpful to compare it to an undoubtedly genuine banknote - in particular, one that was obtained by withdrawal from an ATM.",

        "story": "Yemen's alarming disintegration Long the poorest country in the Arabian Peninsula, Yemen is now in a deep crisis. The collapse of the state - a breeding ground for Islamist terror groups such as al-Qaeda - can no longer be ignored. Germany's foreign ministry is not mincing its words: \"Any Germans who may still be in Yemen are urged to leave,\" it said on its website. On Friday, Germany quietly closed its embassy in the capital Sanaa - following the lead of the US, UK, France and Italy. The situation in Yemen is extremely unstable, it said. Unloved new rulers Last week, Shiite Houthi rebels from the northwest of the country seized power in Sanaa. They announced they had deposed Interim President Abed Rabbo Mansur Hadi and dissolved parliament. But their coup lacks widespread support among Yemenis. On the contrary, many Sunnis are protesting loudly against the Houthis' actions, and are arming themselves and joining forces with the terrorist network al-Qaeda. UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon warned that Yemen was breaking apart before the eyes of the world. The months-long mediation efforts of the United Nations finally appear to have failed. Yemen is facing many problems simultaneously. It is one of the least developed countries in the world. The population is growing rapidly, but most of its 25 million people are desperately poor. Illiteracy and unemployment are widespread and water scarcity is now taking on dramatic proportions. Since the forced resignation of longtime ruler Ali Abdullah Saleh in 2012, violence and serious political unrest have shaken Yemen. The Hadi government was supported by Saudi Arabia, but control of the country gradually slipped out of its grasp. In early 2014, the Houthi rebels launched an offensive, occupied the capital and expanded their control to the south of the country. Battle for supremacy The Houthis are fighting for a share of power. Since the civil war in the 1960s, Shiites have felt marginalized by the Sunni majority. Between 2004 and 2010, the Houthis battled, sometimes for months at a time, with the government forces of President Ali Abdullah Saleh. This was repeatedly followed by a ceasefire. But in the course of the Arab Spring, many tribes allied themselves with the Houthis, along with parts of the army, with many Sunni Islamists and with young people protesting against the president - at least temporarily. Saleh lost the presidency. But he remained in Yemen and was able to hold on to some of his supporters in the military and among the tribes. In the constitutional negotiations that followed, the interests of the Houthis and the formerly independent south were given short shrift. Instead, the Islamist Islah party prevailed. But Islah lost the support of the Saudis, who had turned against the Muslim Brotherhood, which in turn formed the Islah's core. The Shiite Houthis, on the other hand, are backed by Iran - a deeply troubling scenario for the Sunni-dominated Gulf States. Longing for the past The Houthis are now taking advantage of their opponents' weakness and making a bold statement with their advance toward the south. They are now supported by Saleh, who has fallen out with his successor and party comrade Hadi. Saleh hopes to return to power - or at least maintain his influence. For 33 years he was head of state, first of North Yemen, then of the united country. During that time, the situation in Yemen continued to deteriorate. But against the background of the current chaos, some Yemenis now want Ali Abdullah Saleh back.",

        "story": "Trump vows to undo Iran deal, NATO funding at AIPAC meeting Leading US Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has received a lukewarm response from pro-Israeli advocates. The mogul toned down his fiery rhetoric for the annual AIPAC conference. In a speech to an influential pro-Israel lobby on Monday, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump vowed to take apart the Iran nuclear deal and strengthen ties with Jerusalem. At the meeting of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), Trump also promised to push back against United Nations interference in Israeli interests. \"My number one priority is to dismantle the disastrous deal with Iran,\" said the Republican front-runner. In a change from his usual firebrand off-the-cuff speeches, Trump made the unconventional decision to read from a teleprompter at Monday's event. According to DW's Richard Walker, the real estate mogul's assertion that he had studied the Iran deal more than anyone else garnered a degree of derision from spectators, but they warmed to him when he promised to revoke the agreement. \"I have been in business a long time. I know deal making. And let me tell you, this deal is catastrophic. For America, for Israel and for the whole of the Middle East,\" Trump said. He then reaffirmed his commitment to side with Israel in peace negotiations with Palestine, promising to resist UN attempts to pressure Israel. \"The Palestinians must come to the table knowing that the bond between the United States and Israel is unbreakable,\" he said. Trump: US can't afford NATO Shortly before addressing the AIPAC event, Trump told an CNN interviewer that he would also move the US embassy to Jerusalem and cut American funding to NATO. \"The fact is I would like to see it moved, I would like to see it in Jerusalem,\" the Republican candidate said. Both Palestine and Israel consider the ancient city their capital, prompting most nations, including the US, to station their missions in the less controversial Tel Aviv. Furthering questioning long-standing Washington policy, Trump also swore to reduce spending to defense organization NATO if elected. \"We are paying disproportionately. It's too much and frankly it's a different world than it was when we originally conceived of the idea,\" he said. \"We have to reconsider. Keep NATO, but maybe we have to pay a lot less toward NATO itself.\" Trump even went so far as to say he'd work closer with Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose authoritarian policies in eastern Ukraine have seen tensions with NATO reach their most dire level since the end of the Cold War.",

        "story": "Rolf-Dieter Heuer, Director General of CERN Physicist Rolf-Dieter Heuer is searching for \"what holds the world together at its center\" -- as he once described his passion for research in an interview. As Director General of the European Organization for Nuclear Research CERN near Geneva, the 66-year-old has the best equipment to do just that: a 27-kilometer-long particle acclerator. With it, CERN is seeking the Higgs boson or Higgs particle, which is postulated as the last undiscovered building block of subatomic matter. On \"Talking Germany\", moderator Peter Craven explores the world of particle physics with Rolf-Dieter Heuer. Rolf-Dieter Heuer took on his post as director general at CERN in 2009, when the Swiss-based laboratory was going through a difficult phase. The Large Hadron Collider particle accelerator had broken down shortly after it going online for the first time. The financial crisis was also putting pressure on the budget at the time. Heuer, who describes himself as an incurable optimist, steered CERN successfully through its difficulties. He was born in Boll in the state of Baden-Württemberg in 1948. His gift for physics attracted notice while he was still at school. He went on to study physics in Stuttgart and got his doctorate in 1977 in Heidelberg. He worked at various institutes in Germany and taught at the University of Hamburg, concentrating on basic research in the field of physics. Although his current position at CERN is more managerial and he himself is not engaged in research there, he sees it as a high point in his career. Rolf-Dieter Heuer lives with his wife in a French town near the border to Switzerland. (First broadcast on 25.03.2013)",

        "story": "Merkel, rivals in final push ahead of Sunday's German election Politicians have continued to campaign hard leading up to Germany’s general election. Polls indicate that Chancellor Angela Merkel is headed for victory, but she too has been fighting for every last vote. Chancellor Merkel continued her bid for re-election with a campaign stop in the southern city of Munich on Friday. She used her speech in the Bavarian capital to defend her government's record on the economy. \"When I became chancellor ... there were more than 5 million unemployed, and now there are fewer than 3 million,\" she said, referring to her first term in office, when she led a grand coalition between her Christian Democrats (CDU) and the Social Democrats (SPD) from 2005 to 2009. \"But we need to keep working,\" she added. \"Many people can say that you're doing better than in 2009,\" Merkel said. \"I want you to be able to say in 2017 that you're doing better than now.\" This was the chancellor's second major campaign event on Friday, having worked the crowds in the northern city of Hanover earlier in the day. The SPD's candidate to replace Merkel in the chancellery, Peer Steinbrück, also pressed the flesh on Friday in a bid to win over every last undecided voter. Steinbrück, who was finance minister during Merkel's first term in office, delivered speeches in the central cities of Wiesbaden, Marburg and Kassel. He has attacked Merkel's coalition government between her CDU and their junior coalition partners, the liberal Free Democrats (FDP), for allowing the gap between rich and poor to grow, despite reduced jobless figures. The SPD's preferred coalition partners, the Greens, held their last major rally of the campaign in one of their traditional strongholds, Berlin's Friedrichshain-Kreuzburg district. With the latest opinion polls giving the SPD and Greens little chance of winning a majority, the ecological party's leading candidates, Jürgen Trittin and Katrin Göring-Eckardt urged their supporters to make a final push to win over the undecided. \"No, nothing at all is decided,\" Göring-Eckart told the crowd. \"We're going to use the next 48 hours to convince people,\" Trittin said. An opinion poll released on Friday gave the SPD and the Greens a combined 36 percent support, well behind the CDU and the FDP, on 45 percent. With Steinbrück having ruled out including the Left party (nine percent) in any coalition, victory for Merkel's conservative-liberal coalition would appear to be assured. On its own, however, the FDP has consistently polled at about 5 percent throughout the campaign. That is the minimum required to send lawmakers to the Bundestag, and should the Free Democrats fail to clear 5 percent in Sunday's general election, Merkel could be forced to reach out to a different partner as she seeks to build a parliamentary majority. This could force her into another uneasy grand coalition with the Social Democrats. pfd/av (dpa, APF, Reuters)",

        "story": "Report: Baby Boom Will Push France Ahead of Germany According to a new study, Germany is set to concede its lead as Europe's largest economy to France by the mid 21st century. The reason? The country's declining birth-rate. Family policy is topping the political agenda in Berlin once again, after German Family Minister Ursula von der Leyen sparked controversy within the ranks of her own Christian Democrat party (CDU) with proposals to make it easier for women to combine careers and family responsibilities. Her push to create more day-care facilities for the under-threes has drawn harsh criticism from conservatives who accuse von der Leyen of undermining family values. Others say the time has come to wake up to the realities of a changing world, and a new study carried out by the Institute for German Economics (IW) provides more evidence that Germany's failure to encourage women to start families has serious long-term repercussions for the economy. Slow-down While Germany's population decline is currently irreversible, France is seeing a population boost -- and if demographic predictions prove correct, this will put France well on track to become the continent's strongest economy by 2035. According to the experts, the discrepancy between German and French economic clout will become particularly acute between 2025 and 2035. \"The French economy will grow twice as fast as the German one in these years,\" IW expert Axel Plünnecke told the weekly Die Welt. This is when Germany's \"baby-boomer\" generation will reach retirement age and the country will start feeling the pinch of its ageing population and declining birth rate. \"The shortfall in the work-place will put a brake on the economy,\" Plünnecke said. France gets it right To many, the development is an obvious return on the French government's family-friendly policies. Since 2000, France has seen more births than Germany even though it has some 21 million fewer inhabitants. Last year, France registered 831,000 births compared to 675,000 in Germany, making it one of the most fertile countries in Europe. This robust reproduction rate is officially encouraged by government programs, including three-year paid parental leave with guaranteed job protection upon returning to the workforce; full-time pre-school starting at age three; subsidized day-care for the under-threes; stipends for in-home nannies and monthly child-care allowances that increase with the number of children person family. Germany, meanwhile, is still mired in a debate about whether women should be encouraged to work or encouraged to stay at home, with critics maintaining that von der Leyen's recent proposals create a false image that only women who go out to work are modern. \"If you want to give women the chance to work and have children too, you have to provide day care,\" said CDU parliamentary chief, Volker Kauder. \"But I want to emphasize that parents who stay home with their kids from birth until the age of three should not be regarded as belonging to the last century.\"",

        "story": "China oil drilling sparks violent protest in Vietnam Thousands of workers in southern Vietnam have staged a violent protest against China, trashing property and setting buildings on fire. A dispute over islands in the South China Sea prompted the rampage. On Wednesday, buildings at an industrial park in southern Vietnam showed signs of looting, some standing partially destroyed as the result of a mass protest. Hours earlier, thousands of anti-China demonstrators had rampaged the site. They targeted properties in the Singapore-run park believed to be owned by China companies. Authorities detained some 500 protesters linked to the unrest, according to news agency AFP. \"Extremists\" had aggravated the protests, which began peacefully on Tuesday evening, the deputy head of the province's people's committee, Tran Van Nam, said. At least 15 buildings were set on fire. Anti-China protesters then trashed a number of others. The Chinese government later expressed concern about the incident and had requested that Hanoi take the necessary steps to put the crimes to a stop. Officials from Taiwan also responded to the violent protest, summoning the Vietnamese ambassador, according to news agency DPA. Some of their buildings came under attack by demonstrators who were believed to have mistaken them for Chinese companies. Tuesday's demonstration against Beijing was not the first in Vietnam. Late last week, hundreds of protesters gathered before the Chinese Embassy in Hanoi, expressing their infuriation at the situation. A territorial dispute over the Paracel Islands - known as Hoang Sa in Vietnam and Xisha in China - in the South China Sea sparked the protests. In recent weeks, an oil-drilling venture by China has angered Vietnam. Hanoi claims the drilling is illegal. Beijing has refused to halt operations. Last week, there were reports of clashes between Vietnamese and Chinese vessels in the areas. According to Hanoi, the disputed waters belong to Vietnam's exclusive economic zone as defined by the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. However, Beijing has controlled the islands since seizing them in 1974. kms/mkg (AP, AFP)",

        "story": "Russia and Japan Expand Energy Ties Russia and Japan agreed on a series of energy deals during Prime Minister Vladimir Putin’s visit this week. This includes a key pact on civilian nuclear co-operation. But the two sides once again failed to resolve their long-running diplomatic dispute. Japan and Russia have been locked in a territorial dispute for decades. It focuses on a chain of islands between the two countries which are called the Northern Territories by the Japanese and the Southern Kurils by the Russians. The islands were occupied by Soviet army in the last days of World War II and are claimed by both sides. During a recent meeting between Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and his Japanese counterpart Taro Aso in Tokyo this week, both sides said they would study all options to end the row, but fell short of announcing any breakthrough. The two countries also reaffirmed that they want to bolster bilateral co-operation and engage in joint energy projects. \"Russia-Japanese relations have been worrying for years, including the cold-war period. But in recent years things have changed rapidly. And I think economic relations have become more important for them,\" explains Professor Nobuo Shimotomai, an expert on Japan-Russia relations at Tokyo's Hosei University. Nuclear pact One of the major highlights of the Putin-Aso meeting was a nuclear energy pact. The agreement will allow the transfer of Japanese technology to Russia. In return, Japan will get the much-needed nuclear fuel. It will also pave the way for joint uranium mining in Russia, a crucial step for the Russian uranium and nuclear industries, says Marcel Viëtor, an expert on energy policy at the German Council of Foreign Relations in Berlin: \"The Russian uranium and nuclear industries have been in a critical situation for almost two decades. They are in dire need of new contracts to develop power plants and they are looking for international partners. And now it seems they have found one in Japan. And if it is ratified by both parliaments, this will be a wonderful deal for the Russian nuclear sector.\" Co-operation in gas sector Japanese and Russian energy companies have also agreed to jointly develop two major oil fields in eastern Siberia. The project is likely to cost over 150 million dollars. A Memorandum of Understanding was signed between Russian energy giant Gazprom and its Japanese partners to explore ways to process natural gas near the Pacific city of Vladivostok. Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller told the media in Tokyo that a 2,000-kilometre pipeline from Sakhalin island to Vladivostok was likely to be completed by 2011, which could possibly supply natural gas to consumers in the Asia-Pacific region as well, including Japan. Energy expert Viëtor says the move, if successful, would considerably help Japan, which is currently heavily relying on Middle Eastern oil. \"Until today the Japanese get their oil and gas imports from the Middle East. But of course they are cautious about the political developments there and if, for whatever reasons, the shipments of oil and gas from the Middle East are interrupted, the Japanese industries will suffer. So they are very much looking forward to establishing other transportation routes and since Russia is close to Japan, it will suit the Japanese industries very well.\" In February Russia opened its first Liquefied Natural Gas or LNG plant on the Pacific coast. The plant supplies Japan also with millions of tonnes of gas annually. Author: Disha Uppal Editor: Grahame Lucas",

        "story": "Haribo boss Hans Riegel dies aged 90 HAns, RIegel, BOnn: now you know how Haribo got its name. The German candy giant was founded by the Riegel family and was synonymous with Hans Riegel since 1946. The long term leader has died aged 90. A spokesman for Haribo said that the business' chief executive, Hans Riegel, died on Tuesday. Riegel had undergone brain surgery to remove a benign tumor last year. Riegel and his younger brother, Paul, rebuilt their father's company together after the Second World War. Founder Johann Riegel was known as Hans, and had named his company after the first letters in Hans, Riegel, and the business's home city, Bonn. The business grew to be world-renowned for its wide array of candy and sugary treats, not least its Gummibärchen, or gummy bears. Under the Riegel brothers' leadership, the company went global – even exporting its memorable slogan effectively into the English language. \"Kids and grown-ups love it so, the happy world of Haribo\" is an exceedingly loose but rhythmically pleasing translation of the original \"Haribo macht Kinder froh, und Erwachsene ebenso.\" With a keen sense for promotion and marketing, Riegel secured domestic celebrities like extravagant game show host Thomas Gottschalk for prolonged television advertising campaigns. Riegel could be found at the company headquarters, Hans-Riegel-Strasse 1, on most days even into his old age. Haribo employs around 2,000 people and logged turnover of just under 620 million euros ($835 million) in 2011. Haribo's deceased patriarch was awarded The Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany, first class, in 1994 for his social engagement and promotion of sports. Austria also honored Riegel with the golden order of merit for services rendered to the republic of Austria. msh/rg (AFP, dpa)",

        "story": "Obama calls Libya his 'worst mistake' US President Barack Obama has spoken in an interview about the biggest mistake of his presidency, which he considers the 2011 campaign in Libya. Five years later, the North African country remains unstable. In an interview with US broadcaster Fox News, President Obama spoke candidly about his lack of foresight in the aftermath of the fall of late Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. He said that his \"worst mistake\" was \"probably failing to plan for the day after what I think was the right thing to do in intervening in Libya.\" Since the downfall of Gadhafi, who was killed in the course of a popular uprising, Libya has spiraled into chaos and anarchy, with the country split up and ruled by rival militias vying for power. The self-styled \"Islamic State\" (IS) group managed to gain influence in the country amid that power vacuum as well. A UN-back unity government might be in sight but the balance of power in Libya remains feeble. Praise for Clinton as Secretary of State The president added that his former secretary of state, Hillary Rodham Clinton, was \"outstanding,\" defending the current presidential candidate, who has been facing criticism over her use of a personal email server for official correspondence as the US' top diplomat during her tenure between 2009 and 2013. Clinton's private-server emails reportedly contained classified material, including 22 messages with top secret information. \"She would never intentionally put America in any kind of jeopardy,\" Obama told Fox News' Chris Wallace. Clinton has faced a number of lawsuits seeking the release of the documents under freedom of information laws in the US and has had to defend herself before Congress. The use of her private email account has also raised questions about her handling of the deadly 2012 attack on the US diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, during which the US ambassador to the country, Christopher Stevens, was murdered alongside two CIA contractors. Not the only one to blame for Libya Obama had criticized British Prime Minister David Cameron and former French President Nicolas Sarkozy for their roles in the bombing campaign in Libya before. The US President said in an interview with \"The Atlantic\" magazine in March 2016 that Cameron had become \"distracted\" while Sarkozy appeared to seek to promote his country during the 2011 NATO-led military intervention in Libya. Presidential highlights In the Fox News interview Obama also reflected on some of the best moments of his tenure as president, which is due to end in January 2017. \"Saving the economy from a great depression\" was his biggest accomplishment, he said. He also named the US health care reform, commonly referred to as Obamacare, as one of the highlights of his time in the White House. Obama added that his single worst day in the White House was when he had to travel to Newtown in the US state of Connecticut after a gunman had shot and killed 20 young children and six adult staff members at an elementary school in December 2012. ss/kms (AFP, dpa, FOX)",

        "story": "Germany's young female soccer stars lift World Cup at home Germany has won the U-20 Women's World Cup on home soil after beating Nigeria 2-0 in the final. For star-player Alexandra Popp there was the double glory of being recognized as both top scorer and best player. The German women's Under-21 side lifted the World Cup on home soil after beating Nigeria 2-0 in the final on Sunday. Tournament top scorer Alexandra Popp netted the opening goal at Bielefeld, where the match took place, with teammate Kim Kulig sealing the win in injury time. \"We deserve to be World Champions,\" said team coach Maren Meinert. \"Everything that we dreamed about has come true.\" Indeed, the game opened in fairytale style for the Germans in front of a crowd of 24,633. Just eight minutes had been played when, after a cross Bianca Schmidt, Popp held off two Nigeria defenders to shoot past Nigeria keeper Alaba Jonathan for the first goal. The goal was Popp's tenth of the tournament. The 19-year-old from Duisburg finished as top scorer on 10 goals - hitting the net in all six of Germany's tournament wins. Fighting Falconets Nigeria's young \"Falconets\", the first African women's team to reach the final of any FIFA tournament, tried hard to get back into the game with Germany keeper Almuth Schult tested more than once. The game lost pace in the second half and, although both teams had their chances, Germany looked the more likely to score. The team sealed a victory in the 92nd minute, courtesy of 19-year-old Kulig's header. For Popp, there was the double honor of winning the tournament Golden Boot for scoring the most goals, as well as the best player award for her consistency. \"It was the best day of my football career so far,\" said Popp. In the earlier third place play-off, South Korea defeated Colombia one-nil to take third place. Almost 400,000 fans attended the tournament's 32 games, with Germany set to host the next Women's World Cup in 2011. Author: Richard Connor (SID/dpa) Editor: Nigel Tandy",

        "story": "Steinmeier calls on Syria and Lebanon to take part in Middle East peace process German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier is in Lebanon as part of a whirlwind Middle East visit centered on restarting negotiations in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Steinmeier congratulated Lebanon's new prime minister, Saad al-Hariri, and wished him success in forming a new cabinet, after talks between the two men in Beirut on Tuesday. His election was an encouraging sign of stability in the country, Steinmeier added. Steinmeier said that he and al-Hariri \"agreed that we must use the opportunities presented by US President Barack Obama\" in furthering the Middle East peace process. The German foreign minister arrived in Lebanon for a three-hour visit after meetings in Syria and Israel. Steinmeier and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad were not able to come to an agreement on resuming contact between Israel and Syria during their talks in Damascus, along with Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem. \"Syria has an objective interest in the success of the Middle East peace process,\" said Steinmeier, \"and I call on Syria and also my counterpart Mr. al-Moallem to do its part.\" Contact between Israel and Syria was suspended after Israel's military offensive on the Gaza Strip this past winter. Al-Moallem reiterated that Syria would not give up its claim on the Golan Heights, which Israel has occupied since the Six Day War in 1967. Steinmeier specifically named Hezbollah as an obstacle to the peace process. The Lebanon-based organization relies on Syria for some financial support. The talks were also meant to focus on the issue of human rights in Syria, as the European Union has promised to support Damascus in its efforts to improve its infamous record. Steinmeier said he would call on Syria to continue its trend of openness, which he said had improved in recent months. Another hot topic is Syria's close relationship with Iran. During meetings with Israeli President Shimon Peres on Monday, Steinmeier was given harsh words to pass on in Syria. Peres asked Steinmeier to tell Syrian President Bashar al-Assad that, if Damascus continued to have such close ties with Iran, Israel would hesitate to return the Golan Heights to Syria. Talks in Israel Steinmeier had traveled to Syria from Jerusalem, where he'd met with the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, on Monday. The German foreign minister welcomed Netanyahu's recent acceptance of the need for a two-state solution and called the removal of road blocks restricting the movement of Palestinians in the West Bank a \"small start.\" He added that the \"road to stability in the entire region leads only through talks with the Palestinian side. My personal conviction is that a guarantee for stability can only come through the realization of the two-state solution.\" Reciprocity Netanyahu had initially balked at the idea of openly supporting the two-state solution, but finally made a public endorsement of a demilitarized Palestinian state in a June 14 policy speech, following intense pressure from the US and Europe. Despite this, Netanyahu had refused to accept demands for a complete freeze of construction in Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank, which the Palestinians along with nations including Egypt and Jordan, have made a condition for any resumption of peace negotiations. Netanyahu has also vowed to pursue a policy of \"reciprocity,\" insisting on Palestinian and Arab counter-steps in exchange for any Israeli \"concessions.\" This would include Arab states gradually moving towards normalizing ties with Israel even before a Palestinian state is created. hf/glb/Reuters/dpa/AFP/AP Editor: Chuck Penfold",

        "story": "South Sudan peace negotiators 'met this morning' South Sudan's government and rebels have both claimed that they have finally started peace talks. The talks, held in Ethiopia, are aimed at brokering a ceasefire to end the violence that has rocked the fledgling nation. A series of false starts initially delayed talks, with separate negotiations between intermediaries required and the release of several political prisoners held by Salva Kiir's government a sticking point. But after both sides finally agreed to negotiation regulations on Monday, they claimed that talks finally began the next day. The negotiations have been brokered by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), an eight-nation bloc in Eastern Africa including South Sudan. \"This morning at nine we met,\" South Sudan's Information Minister Michael Makuei told AFP, adding that the topics raised were an end to hostilities and \"the question of detainees.\" Mabior Garang, one of opposition leader Riek Machar's delegation, confirmed to Reuters that talks had begun. Makuei also said, however, that some members of his team had returned to the South Sudanese capital of Juba to consult with the government and that there would be \"no direct negotiations until they come back today.\" Fighting began in the world's most recently formed country on December 15 when President Kiir accused troops loyal to his then-deputy Riek Machar of trying to stage a coup to overthrow him. While Kiir's government remains in power, the ensuing fighting - much of it sectarian between members of rival tribes - has led to more than 1,000 deaths, according to the United Nations. An estimated 200,000 others have fled their homes. Kiir is an ethnic Dinka, while Machar is Nuer - although both leaders claim the conflict is primarily political. Sudan's role increases Sudan, from which South Sudan seceded in 2011 after years of war, has played an increasingly prominent role in a bid to bring peace back to the world's newest county. The still uneasy neighbors remain tied together by their shared oil industry, leading to a visit to Juba by Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir. \"We have come to see what we can do to stop this war knowing all too well that armed conflict would never resolve a problem and also knowing that any problem no matter how complicated can be solved at the negotiation table,\" Bashir said on Monday. ph/msh (AP, AFP, Reuters)",

        "story": "German utilities demand compensation for nuclear exit German energy suppliers are demanding billions of euros in compensation for losses incurred by the phase-out of nuclear power, according to the daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ). The country's biggest utility, E.ON, alone wants at least 8 billion euros ($10 billion) in damages, the paper reported, a figure that has since been confirmed by a company spokesman in Dusseldorf. Altogether, the companies are seeking 15 billion euros ($18.7 billion) in compensation, the FAZ said. The Federal Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe will examine the compensation claims in the coming weeks. Its decision is not expected until late 2013, after Germany's next federal parliamentary election. Lengthy judicial appraisal It will first consult with both houses of the German parliament as well as 63 other organizations, including Greenpeace and the Federation of German Industry (BDI). The constitutional court must then decide whether Germany's exit from nuclear energy violated the constitution before civil courts can rule on possible damages. Both E.ON and its next biggest rival, RWE, have already filed complaints with the constitutional court about Germany's energy turnaround, citing a sharp fall in their profits. The large-scale shutdown of nuclear power plants is to be completed by 2022, with renewables such as power from wind turbines filing the gap in supply. E.ON has said the complaint was not about Germany's phase-out of nuclear power as such - a move that is widely supported by Germany's population - but about the lack of compensation for companies affected by the decision to abandon nuclear energy. Last year, Germany's center-right coalition stalled over a previously legislated phase-out of nuclear power, but went ahead after Japan's reactor catastrophe in Fukushima. Eight German nuclear plants were taken from the grid straight away, and the remaining nine in Germany have had their operating lifetimes considerably reduced. tj/ipj (AFP, Reuters)",

        "story": "German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas starts first visit to Africa After being at the center of attention in 2017, Germany's Africa policy has somewhat stagnated. But Foreign Minister Heiko Maas wants to keep communications open and is visiting Ethiopia and Tanzania this week. Germany's Africa policy is back in the spotlight, this time at the highest level. Only six weeks after assuming office, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas is making his first visit to Africa. On the itinerary are Ethiopia and Tanzania — two countries with which Germany maintains close historical and developmental ties. Both also host important state alliances, such as the African Union (AU) and the East African Community (EAC). Although Ethiopia achieved double-digit economic growth, it continues to be accused of human rights violations. In Tanzania, after an energetic start, so-called reform president John Magufuli seems to be running out of steam and his country, while remaining relatively stable politically, continues to rely on Western donors. Africa fatigue? For Germany's federal government, things have quieted down when it comes to issues related to Africa. In 2017, new initiatives for Africa came thick and fast. The continent was the focus of Germany's G20 presidency and numerous African heads of state came to the German capital. \"In 2017, there was lots of Africa. Maybe a bit too much for German politics,\" Africa expert Helmut Asche from the University of Mainz told DW. \"Although one must say that not so much has been implemented, also by the German side, as we would have wished.\" Neither the \"Marshall Plan with Africa,\" proclaimed by Development Minister Gerd Müller, nor the Pro! Africa initiative — launched by Maas' Social Democrat Party (SPD) colleague Brigitte Zypries in her turn as economy minister from January 2017 until this March — could convince skeptics. The German government's enthusiasm for Africa has faded as a chorus of critics denounce rivalries between ministries and policy focuses more on stemming migration. \"A great expectation was aroused among our friends in Africa, and we have the impression here, as they do, that nothing much has been been done yet,\" Stefan Liebig, the chairman of the German-African Business Association, told DW. Read more: Germany's Africa Year: Much goodwill but little action Strengthening African regional alliances Talks with the AU and the EAC are on the agenda for Mass' first trip to Africa. The message from Berlin — which has caught on in reform-oriented countries in the south — is that regional integration is the key to development and stability. Indeed, the AU, which has its headquarters in Ethiopia's capital Addis Ababa, has evolved into an increasingly important player, with which Germany has close links through its long-standing support of the Peace and Security Council. Rwandan president and current AU Assembly chair Paul Kagame has launched an ambitious reform agenda designed to make the union more financially independent and more effective at cutting through red tape. Further south in the shadow of Mount Kilimanjaro in Arusha, Tanzania, the EAC — founded in 2000 and based on the European Union (EU) model — is a pioneer in regional integration, having its own customs union, a single market and a single customs territory. Over the years Germany has provided €285 million ($341 million) in financial support. But things haven't been running smoothly for some time and the pace of reform of members such as Tanzania and Rwanda diverges considerably. \"The East African Community was well on its way towards becoming a customs union, with free trade within a consolidated and cohesive economic space,\" Asche told DW. \"Then the Europeans came along with their own economic partnership agreements. This is a piece of policy failure and Minister Maas can do a lot to rectify things.\" Many problems in Ethiopia and Tanzania The bilateral relationship with Tanzania is also worrying: At the end of 2015, President John Magufuli was elected, and quickly began to straighten things up and was celebrated by both locals and partners alike. Now he's clamping down on journalists, bloggers, opposition figures and even the churches. \"This is how one can be fooled,\" Asche told DW. \"We had hoped that Magufuli would remedy inefficiencies and corruption.\" However, Asche believes the president's reform policies have deteriorated into \"absurd repression and completely erratic political behavior. One should really be concerned by the current political system and state of democracy in Tanzania, which was comparatively stable in recent decades.\" In Ethiopia, fresh winds of change are blowing. New Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed announced numerous reforms during his early days in office which offer hope for Africa's second-most populated country, with 100 million, mostly young people. But the much-maligned state of emergency remains in force — and this could become a stumbling block for the young prime minister. \"It would be great if Maas could talk to Abiy,\" says Asche. \"The change which has taken place could really herald a better future.\" One should not overburden Heiko Maas' visit to Africa with excessively high expectations. If it ends with the realization that Germany's Africa policy needs to become more coherent and should not get lost within sometimes-contradictory political initiatives, then that is already a success. In any case, the real work to be done is in Berlin, not in Africa, says Liebig. \"I believe that the tasks of the foreign minister do not lie so much in Africa. Rather, he should do his homework here and must sit down with his colleagues in government to think about how many of the measures announced can actually be implemented.\"",

        "story": "Brussels Approves Financial Rescue Plans by Sweden, Portugal The European Commission on Thursday approved packages by Sweden and Portugal to protect financial institutions from the global credit crunch. In both cases, Europe's top state aid watchdog said that the plans respected its guidelines for helping the financial sector cope with the worst crisis in generations without distorting competition. Sweden's plan involves the state providing up to 1,500 billion Swedish kronor (153.8 billion euros, $201 billion) in debt guarantees to banks and other lenders. Portugal's plan envisages similar state guarantees worth 20 billion euros ($26 billion). Plans must follow strict guidelines But while Sweden's was cleared within just three days of it being notified to the commission, the Portuguese plan required negotiations with officials in Brussels over a two-week period. \"The Swedish measures were well-designed and needed little alteration to take full account of the state aid rules' requirements that such schemes are non-discriminatory and minimize potential distortions of competition,\" said Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes. The commission has issued clear guidelines on what governments can and cannot do to protect their countries' financial institutions. Rescue plans have to be limited in time and scope and they should not discriminate against foreign banks operating in the country. They should also be followed up by structural adjustment measures for the financial sector as a whole, while state money should not be used by beneficiaries to attract new business. The commission has already cleared similar rescue plans by Britain, Denmark, Germany and Ireland and is still considering those of, among others, France and Spain.",

        "story": "Learning the safety lessons of the Titanic Even 100 years after the Titanic, there's still no such thing as an unsinkable ship. Modern cruise-liners are in fact more vulnerable to capsizing, but there is much that engineers can do to make ships safer. The Titanic was famously said to be \"unsinkable\" – a boast that was exposed as an illusion in an accident that cost the lives of around 1,500 people. It was a disaster that shook the governments of the world's most important countries to take action, and in direct response, they adopted the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) in 1914. The building and operating of ships still adheres to SOLAS today, and the agreement has been continually updated to keep up with the technology. But the problems of ship-building have remained the same. Ship disasters generally have one of three causes. Either the ship collides with something - an iceberg or it runs aground where the hull is breached and water floods in. Or there is a fire or an explosion on board. Or a huge wave capsizes or damages the ship. Double-hull For all three scenarios there is one main solution - the consequences can only be brought under control if the ship has been divided into as many different closed, water-tight compartments as possible. If the hull is torn open, this means the flooding can be limited. \"That means dividing the ship lengthwise, from side-to-side, and vertically, effectively creating a double-hull, which is absolutely necessary,\" says Peter Bronsart, professor of ship-building at the University of Rostock. Between the individual divisions, there need to be doors and gates, so-called bulkheads, but these have to be centrally controllable from the bridge. There were 15 bulkheads on the Titanic, and so 16 separate compartments. The front five were flooded in the collision with iceberg. Since the ship began sinking at the bow, and the separating walls were not built high enough, the water got into the other compartments. This separation of the ship's hull into various compartments also helps to prevent the spread of fire. \"You divide the ship into individual fire zones, which helps organize fire extinguishing and evacuation operations,\" says Bronsart. Despite the now standard sub-division of ships, there are still many weak points in modern vessels, says Olle Rutgersson of the Chalmers University in Gothenburg, Sweden. His biggest concern is the danger of capsizing. \"My personal opinion is that the cruise-liners we have today are probably not as well-built and safe as the Titanic was,\" he says. \"But of course, on the Titanic they made the big mistake of not building the separating walls higher. If they had done what is done today, it would probably have survived the accident.\" Panorama windows or safety? But he says the case of the Costa Concordia, which hit rocks in the Mediterranean on January 13 and capsized, shows that modern cruise-liners are more unstable than the Titanic was. \"But as we saw, cruise-liners also have difficulty surviving a breach in the hull,\" says Rutgersson. \"If fact, the [Costa Concordia] sank much quicker and in a more dangerous way than the Titanic, because it capsized.\" Rutgersson is appealing for ship's sides to be built higher, and for the outer sides of ships to be made of detachable, floating units. But economic interests certainly stand in the way of such a plan. Shipping companies want plenty of rooms with large, panorama windows on the outside of their cruise-liners. And on cargo ships, they fear such plans would reduce capacity. Shipping safety begins a long time before an accident even happens. Because of modern navigation technology, and global weather predictions, ships usually don't even get into dangerous situations anymore. Indeed, ships are considered among the safest means of transport there are. According to Bronsart's estimate, around 80 percent of accidents are down to human error. Computer-aided safety systems Dirk Dreissig, of the Rostock-based Engineers Society for Maritime Safety Technique and Management (MARSIG), is developing a computer system to help officers and crews make the right decisions in an emergency. It collates information from various sensors, cameras and measuring devices throughout the ship and calculates what is likely to happen next after an accident. \"What do we do when there is a fire in the machine room? Or a fire in the storeroom? Or on the car-deck?\" says Dreissig. \"There are modules that calculate the stability of the ship when the body of the ship has been damaged – if this or that compartment is opened and water gets in, what happens to my ship? Then there are modules for evacuation. Which way should people run?\" The computer system then passes on the advice to the bridge, but only the captain can make the final decision to start a sprinkler, or alert passengers to an evacuation, or to close the bulkheads. \"International maritime law dictates that the captain always has ultimate authority on board,\" says Dreissig. \"He has to decide everything and carries the final responsibility if the decision goes wrong afterwards.\" Author: Fabian Schmidt / bk Editor: Gregg Benzow",

        "story": "Bolshoi Theater replaces director Anatoly Iksanov The head of Russia’s Bolshoi Theater has been replaced after a series of scandals including an acid attack against its artistic director. The attack uncovered bitter infighting within the institution. Russian Culture Minister Vladimir Medinsky announced at a press conference Tuesday that Anatoly Iksanov has been replaced as the Bolshoi's director, dismissing the suggestion that Iksanov had been fired. Iksanov, who had held the position for 13 years, sat beside the minister during the announcement. Vladimir Urin, the general director of the Stanislavsky Musical Theater, is to take his place. \"He (Urin) will be able to unite the troupe and continue the development of the best theater in the country and one of the best in the world,\" Medinsky told reporters. \"A difficult situation had developed around the theater and the troupe, and everything pointed to the need for renewal at the theater.\" Speaking to reporters after the announcement, Urin said: “I very much hope that the majority of people working in his theatre - talented, remarkable people - will be my allies,\" Urin said. \"Only together can we solve the problems that, like in any theatre, exist today in the Bolshoi Theater.\" The theater has been in turmoil since January when a masked man threw acid in the face of Sergei Filin, the Bolshoi's artistic director. Last month the Bolshoi said that despite 18 operations, the attack has left Filin blind in one eye and with only about 10 percent vision in the other. A top Bolshoi dancer, Pavel Dmitrichenko, later confessed to hiring two accomplices to attack Filin but said he had not expected acid to be thrown in his face. Theater in-fighting has plagued the Bolshoi Ballet throughout much of the company's history, which spans over 200 years. hc/pfd (Reuters, AFP)",

        "story": "Do Possessions Make Us Happy? - Taking Stock in an Affluent Country What have researchers found out about the relationship between happiness and possessions? And what about those people who live prosperous lives - and those who have consciously turned their backs on material wealth? The average German hoards nearly 10,000 things in his or her home - an unimaginable number. We have never possessed so much and bought so much as we do today. But does that make us happy? Scriptwriter János Kereszti wants to find out and his quest for answers brings him into contact both with people who enjoy the consumer society – and with those who consciously reject it. He meets a rich businessman's wife from the Allgäu, drops in on dropouts in the Uckermark region, visits lottery millionaires and a talks to a female student in Frankfurt who dreams of making it in high finance. He also interviews economics professor Niko Paech, who says you have to have enough time to enjoy your possessions: A music lover, for example, won’t be ten times happier buying a hundred CDs a week instead of ten because he just won’t have time to listen to them all. He also asks celebrities such as actor Peter Lohmeyer and top model Sara Nuru what their personal angle on prosperity is. What do these people dream of? How much property makes them happy? His film is a philosophical road movie painting a picture of the material desires and consumer dreams of Germany’s rich and poor.

        "story": "Flying makes us happy! The Indian aviation sector is growing rapidly. A flight school in a rural region between Cologne and Frankfurt is benefiting from this boom by running a special training program designed for future Indian pilots. \"Flying makes us happy!\" This is the philosophy of the Air Alliance Flight Center based at Siegerland airport. But it not only makes you happy, you can also make money with it. There is huge demand for good pilots in India, says Anju Varghese, a young Indian pilot of 35 years and managing director of AV Aviation in India. That's how she came up with the idea to set up a high-quality program based on German standards for Indian students to receive the best pilot training. In 2007 she implemented her idea and launched a successful Indian-German co-operation with the German flight school Air Alliance. Good training is important \"I have done my training in India and also in Germany. When you compare it, I think the quality and standard we have in Germany is really good and there is a system. In India we still don't have that systematic way of training. Here we do,\" says Anju Varghese. But Anju Varghese does not only want to promote her flight school. She says the advertising jungle in India often confuses young people about making the right choice. Varghese says the students need a career guidance. \"The students get so much of information. And they don't know how to select the best school. That's very important right now because there are so many options on the market.\" Air Alliance was the first choice Axel Beimdiek, Managing Director of Air Alliance is very optimistic that the training program has a bright future. He is very proud of the Indian-German partnership. Beimdiek says one aspect that made the school attractive to Indians was that it offered courses in English. \"Of course it was exciting for us. Because I think we are not the biggest school in Germany but we are the most flexible one, as we are used to having international students here in the school. Not only from India. They are from Spain, Portugal and Italy, even from Russia.\" The students obtain the European ATPL License which is internationally accepted. Axel Beimdiek says it is recognized as the best. Air Alliance is not only a flight academy but also a state-of-the-art aviation service provider, covering the fields of charter and sightseeing flights, plane maintenance and airplane sales. This gives the students the opportunity to gain insight in various areas of the flight industry. Students feel very professional 24-year-old John Leenus is an aspiring pilot. Since he was young he dreamed of becoming a pilot and now he is only three weeks away from this goal. He is very satisfied with his choice of flight school. Leenus says he would definitely recommend the flight school to others, as the standards in Germany are quite high. He adds, \"if you are training in India you go to small airports. You don't have many airports in India. In Germany I go to Cologne. You get to train there, you get to land there. You are very professional if you go to Cologne or Frankfurt or Dortmund. From the very beginning you are really professional.\" A bright future for prospective pilots According to experts, the number of passenger jets in India will double by the year 2020. A few weeks ago the private Indian airliner IndiGo bought a number of Airbus planes for a total of 16 billion dollars. It is considered to be the biggest deal ever in the commercial aviation sector. But buying planes alone does not mean \"time for takeoff.\" The airlines need pilots, crew and ground staff, too. That means good job opportunities for every Indian student of Air Alliance.

        "story": "Adidas buys Runtastic in race for fitness apps While the sporting goods industry's major players invest more in digital offerings like fitness apps, Germany's Adidas has been slow on the uptake. But it has now bought Runtastic in a bid to catch up. German sportsgear manufacturer Adidas announced Wednesday it had bought the Runtastic fitness app from German media conglomerate Axel Springer for 220 million euros ($239 million). The announcement came a day before Adidas is expected to announce quarterly figures. The acquisition is in keeping with an industry-wide trend of increased investment into digital fitness tracking - where Adidas has been falling behind. Rival Nike, which has been taking market share away from Adidas, has proven to be more in touch with industry trends. The US firm teamed up with tech giant Apple on the Nike+ running programs for the iPod and iPhone and launched the FuelBand calorie tracker in 2012. Nike isn't the only one outrunning Adidas. Baltimore-based Under Armour overtook Adidas last year as the second-biggest sportswear maker in the US. This year, it bought diet and exercise app MyFitnessPal for 437 million euros and social fitness network Endomondo for 78 million euros. But it took until as late as last year for Adidas to launch its own miCoach fitness device. Now the German company’s new buy has 20 apps covering variety of endurance, health and fitness activities in 18 languages. “Digital technologies are providing new capabilities and insights to help athletes of all levels take control of their sporting destiny – whether improving their performance, sharing their experiences, or creating their own great social moments of sport,” said Adidas CEO Herbert Hainer in a statement. Runtastic was founded in 2009 and has around 70 million registered users and is available in 18 languages. jd/uhe (dpa, Reuters)",

        "story": "The photographer behind Marilyn Monroe's most iconic photo We've all seen Marilyn Monroe in a white dress standing over a subway ventilation. The iconic image is Sam Shaw's most famous, but certainly not his most moving. His work is now on show in Germany. A young blond woman in a white dress standing over a ventilation grate in the New York subway, the air pushing up the dress - and the photographer snaps the picture. That's the story behind Sam Shaw's most famous picture, but it's certainly not his most moving image. It was the famous ventilation grate picture in the 1950s that made photographer Sam Shaw better known to a larger audience - and made Marilyn Monroe even more famous. The picture has been reprinted millions of times, making it one of the best known in the world. Shaw staged the photograph himself as a PR gimmick to promote the film \"The Seven-Year Itch,\" directed by Billy Wilder, in which Monroe starred. \"Interestingly, you don't see this image set precisely in this way in the film,\" said Christiane Vogt, director of the Ludwig Gallery at Schloss Oberhausen, which just opened a retrospective of photographer Sam Shaw's work, \"Finding the Unexpected.\" \"There is a scene [in the film] showing her legs, and one showing her torso, but not one showing Marilyn Monroe's entire body,\" she noted. Marilyn Monroe was Shaw's driver Shaw had been friends with Monroe for quite a while before the picture was even taken. In fact, before Marilyn had her own breakthrough as an actress, she was actually photographer Shaw's driver, since he did not have a driver's license, curator Nina Dunkmann pointed out. Yet the retrospective is not reduced to showing photographs only of movie star Marilyn Monroe. The 230 black-and-white images from six decades show a host of other people - from starlets to everyday actors. \"Our concept focused on one space being dedicated to Marilyn Monroe; that was clear from the start,\" said Vogt. \"But the show actually opens with Sophia Loren. We wanted to show photos that weren't necessarily so famous, and Loren was the perfect motif,\" she said. Dunkmann stressed the stamina with which Shaw worked - taking a great deal of time for his pictures. \"He did so with Sophia Loren - depicting her as a goddess and an erotic symbol,\" she said. \"He draws the viewer's gaze across her body and up to her face.\" \"Shaw almost always manages to tell stories with just one picture,\" she pointed out. Access to film stars, a passion for the less famous The show in Oberhausen portrays many pictures of film stars, from Marlon Brando in a tight t-shirt and a profile of John Wayne, to Dennis Hopper and Paul Newman and John Cassevetes with their families. Shaw had access to actors - up-close and unadorned. He was, for instance, close friends with Anthony Quinn, whom he took numerous photos of during the filming of \"Alexis Sorbas\" on Crete. One picture shows Quinn playing chess during a recording break. Yet Shaw also used the time as a still photographer on the film set to create a photo essay for \"Life\" magazine about island life in the 1950s. It showcased farmers' faces creased from working out in the sun. \"These photo stories for \"Life\" and \"Time,\" which were often published in color, secured a good income for Shaw, in addition to his work as a still photographer on film sets in Hollywood,\" said Vogt. These photo essays on social issues were close to the photographer's heart. He began creating them in the 1940s and the pictures are so expressive, that the viewer immediately recognizes which mood Shaw wanted to capture. They are glimpses of real life, showing the hardships of poor people in society and the travails of people working in dangerous jobs in a lively way. Shaw depicts an American soldier saying goodbye to his family on a farm, young women at work in an armor factory in the US, worn-out African-American women in dilapidated living conditions, and workers around oil rigs. He also captured photos of sporting events, accidents and everyday violence. Racism and the marginalized Shaw likewise created photo essays about racism in the US South and of demonstrations against the Vietnam War. \"He always placed people at the center, but also expressed criticism, such as in the pictures he took of the election campaign of a racist politician in the South,\" said Dunkmann. One picture shows a corpulent policeman protecting a politician at an appearance before a crowd of people. Shaw dedicated whole series to African-American culture and was interested in the marginalized people of society. He brought home such pictures from his travels through Europe - series of Roma women in Spain and images from poor neighborhoods in Rome and Paris. Paris was, after all, a city Shaw loved - one he once dubbed the most picturesque in the world. Shaw's own glimpse of the world can be viewed at Schloss Oberhausen through September 17, 2017.",

        "story": "Iran Issues Enrichment Threat But Considers Russian Proposal Iran said Monday that it would restart uranium enrichment work despite international objections. At the same time, Tehran indicated that negotiations were still possible and that Russian options were being considered. Iran said Monday that large-scale uranium enrichment work, the focus of fears it is seeking nuclear weapons, will begin in \"due course\" in response to the International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) decision to report the clerical regime to the UN Security Council. \"The order from the president lifts the voluntary restrictions and Iran will resume its work,\" government spokesman Gholam Hossein Elham told reporters, referring to an order from hard-line President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. But when asked to say what specific work had already resumed -- and if that included enrichment equipment being put into action -- he replied that \"technical issues are the concern of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran.\" \"They will follow the directive and they will resume their technical work. The Atomic Energy Organization will give its order in due course,\" Elham said. Enrichment is a process that involves feeding uranium gas through cascades of centrifuges. When purified to low levels the result is reactor fuel, but the process can be extended to make the fissile core of a nuclear bomb. Iran had agreed to suspend this work, as well as centrifuge assembly, as part of a 2003 and 2004 deal with Britain, France and Germany. The current crisis was sparked by Iran's decision last August to resume uranium conversion -- which makes the gas fed into centrifuges -- and start laboratory-scale enrichment on Jan. 10. Enrichment announcement in retaliation to IAEA decision The kick-starting of full-scale fuel cycle work comes in retaliation against Saturday's vote by the IAEA's 35-nation board to report Iran to the UN Security Council, a turning point in the long-running nuclear dispute that exposes Tehran to the threat of sanctions. The country, which maintains it only wants to generate atomic energy, announced Sunday that it will also no longer allow reinforced inspections of its nuclear facilities. \"We are now at the end of one phase where the Islamic republic was building trust, going beyond its Non-Proliferation Treaty commitments and cooperating within the framework of the additional protocol,\" Elham explained. \"There has been a good chance for our negotiation partners to reach a good result. But now the door for voluntary measures has been closed. What remains open is the door of negotiation,\" he added. \"Our use of nuclear technology is very transparent, and as the president has said, we will continue our nuclear program within the framework of the NPT. Iran dos not have any plans to get out of the NPT.\" Iranian president laughs at \"idiots\" behind UN resolution Ahmadinejad has laughed off the resolution and branded Iran's international opponents as \"idiots,\" while Elham insisted the resolution was a \"victory\" for the Islamic republic. \"From our position it was a victory. The government and people are hand in hand and that is a victory. The breaking of the consensus on the IAEA board was a victory. And the position of the West shows the second and third generation of the Islamic republic that they don't want Iran to progress, and that too is a victory,\" he insisted. He also asserted that oil-rich Iran still had the upper hand when it came to enduring any eventual sanctions. \"Energy is a matter for the West, and we are not interested in causing problems for them. Any decision in this regard will not hurt us. It will hurt the consumers and not the producers. We are in a position of power when it comes to energy, and it will not have any affect on our budget,\" he said. The spokesman also dismissed rumors of fierce divisions within the regime -- dominated by hardliners but featuring some more pragmatic conservatives -- on how to handle the escalation crisis. \"We deal within the framework of the regime, and on the matter of foreign affairs the government implements this policy. Nothing special has happened in this regard,\" Elham said. Iran ready to negotiate with Russia over enrichment offer However, in what was interpreted as a sign that Iran was still ready to negotiate, Tehran said that Russia's offer to shift Iran's uranium enrichment to Russian territory was still up for discussion. Before IAEA voted to report the Iranian nuclear program to the Security Council on Saturday, Iran had threatened to walk away from future talks with Moscow on a proposal which was seen as a means of assuring the world that the process would not produce materials that could be used to make nuclear weapons. Iran on Sunday indicated it remained ready for talks on the Russian proposal. Steinmeier: Russian proposal a way back to diplomacy German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier on Sunday urged Iran to accept the Russian proposal, saying it \"can be the key to a negotiated solution.\" The decision taken by the IAEA to report Iran to the UN Security Council \"a show of international unity\", Steinmeier said. \"It was a very strong and determined signal to the Iranian leadership that is should fully suspend its nuclear program.\" Germany's top diplomat said the Iranian nuclear issue was the most important task facing the world. \"Solving the Iranian nuclear issue is the key task for the immediate future unless we want an arms race in the Middle East,\" Steinmeier said.",

        "story": "A German Visa Scandal in China, Too? Even as the row over lax German visa policies in eastern Europe simmers, an unusually high number of Chinese travelers are flooding into Germany. Some never return home. Last year the German embassy in Beijing issued visas for 220,000 Chinese travelers, a three-fold increase since three years ago. That's more than France, Italy and the Scandinavian EU countries taken together. Germany is keen to boost business ties with China and also lure Chinese touriststo the country. With that in mind, Beijing and Berlin agreed last year on relaxing entry procedures for short-term travel. Since then, Chinese tourists no longer need apply for a individual visas in person. They can get group visas organized by a licensed travel agency for a party of several people. And there are no checks on whether everybody who comes with a tour group actually goes back. \"There are people who disappear\" Klaus Schmidt of the German travel agency Caissa admitted it was a problem. \"We cannot completely rule out that regulations are abused by certain individuals,\" Schmidt said. \"And there are sadly people who disappear after their arrival in Europe. We report this to the police then. It is very rare, but it does happen.\" Once Chinese travelers have arrived in Germany, it is easy to move on to other EU countries given the lack of border controls. That has security experts worried. They say that since the United States has restricted its immigration procedures, Chinese criminals are flocking to Europe in gangs similar to the Italian mafia and involved in smuggling goods, drugs and people. Their activities in Europe are centered in the Netherlands, France and Great Britain, but Germany may well be turning into a major destination for transit. Employees in the German foreign ministry in Berlin received warnings of widespread visa abuse in China months ago. It's similar to the situation in Ukraine, where it has seems that a lax visa policy was exploited by criminals while foreign ministry officials appear to have ignored warnings. Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer is under mounting pressure because of the scandal. Opposition involved too? But as far as China is concerned, politicians from the conservative opposition are also coming under attack. The prominent conservative premier of the state of Hesse, Roland Koch intervened personally only last year to urge utmost lenience in granting visas to Chinese citizens, pointing to the fact that Hesse tops the list of popular destinations for Chinese tourists. The issue hasn't gone unnoticed in the current debate over massive German visa abuse in eastern Europe. A letter written by German Deputy Foreign Minister Jürgen Chrobog to the interior ministry and leaked to the press last week noted that the German embassy in Beijing issued a record 15,000 visas to Chinese nationals within a period of just a few weeks. Quick damage control Meanwhile, Klaus Schmidt predicts a further rise in numbers. \"We’ve already seen a rise by 40 percent over the last year and we expect that trend to continue for Germany and from here to other destinations in Europe like Italy, France, Austria and Switzerland,\" he said. While these predictions may thrill German travel agents, the foreign ministry is scrambling to get things under control. In a special measure aimed at damage control experts have been dispatched to the embassy in Beijing which has reported difficulties in detecting fake passports and other documents.",

        "story": "Breivik boastful in Norway massacre trial Anders Behring Breivik has defended his massacre of 77 people in and around Oslo last year, admitting he would 'do it again.' The right-wing extremist returns to the witness stand on Wednesday on day three of his trial. Norwegian extremist Anders Behring Breivik returned to the witness stand on Wednesday a day after declaring he would repeat the killings of 77 people if he had the chance. Breivik showed no remorse for the July massacre on Tuesday as he took the stand for the first time. \"I have carried out the most sophisticated and spectacular political attacks committed in Europe since the Second World War,\" Breivik told the court, reading from a prepared statement. Detailing his anti-Islam, anti-multicultural ideology, he claimed to have acted out of \"goodness, not evil\" to prevent a wider civil war in Europe, insisting \"I would have done it again.\" \"The attacks on July 22 were preventive attacks, and I can therefore not acknowledge criminal guilt,\" Breivik said as the almost hour-long statement came to an end. Judge dismissed Breivik's testimony was delayed on Tuesday after one of the five judges in the trial was dismissed over revelations that he had posted a comment on Facebook saying Breivik deserved the death penalty. \"The death penalty is the only fair outcome in this case!!!!\" citizen judge Thomas Indreboe wrote a day after the July 22 attacks. After a 30-minute recess to reach the decision, Indreboe was replaced by backup lay judge Elisabeth Wisloeff. Breivik, 33, pleaded not guilty on Monday to setting off a car bomb at government headquarters in Oslo before embarking on a shooting spree at a youth summer camp organized by the ruling Labor Party. He claims to have been acting in self-defense to protect Norway from Muslims by attacking the left-leaning political party he blamed for the country's immigration policies. The trial is expected to last up to 10 weeks, with the next five days set aside for Breivik's testimony. ccp/acb (AFP, Reuters, dpa, AP)",

        "story": "German Jobseekers Plumb Volunteerism's Possibilities Unlike the US, Germany does not have a highly developed culture of volunteerism. But with state coffers increasingly empty and a continually tight job market, observers say unpaid work can have hidden benefits. In the US, volunteering is widespread -- a credo promoted at home and in schools, and even as pseudo-governmental doctrine. From tutoring in after school programs, to working as an aide in a hospital, to helping build houses for the poor -- Americans have long been schooled in the importance of \"giving back to community.\" But since its postwar economic boom, Germany has used its tax base wealth to provide for the needy and offer its citizens singularly generous social benefits. Volunteer work was mainly done by charitable religious groups, or young men exempted from military service, fulfilling an obligatory year of civil service. Increasingly, though, young people going onto the job market are discovering the side benefits that can be reaped from a volunteer stint. Such experience can help develop the highly touted \"soft skills\" that are increasingly in demand in the business world, observers say. After all, anyone can call themselves a \"team player,\" but a well-chosen, unpaid job may give them the chance to actually prove they are one. \"For people looking for their first job, working as a volunteer is a great advantage,\" said Sascha Theisen, the spokesman for StepStone.de, an employment-recruiting Internet portal that advises people at all stages of their career. \"It gives them the chance to gain experience, for instance in leading a project, or solving problems or managing people. \"It also means they could come to the job with a network already in place of people who would be good contacts later on down the road,\" he added. Too much of a good thing? But Theisen warned that people who are already in the middle of their careers should be careful not to overdo it. German employers would only really smile upon someone involved in an activity that might be beneficial to business: taking an active role in a professional association, for instance. \"If someone is busy leading several sports clubs and on top of that they sing in a choir, you have to ask yourself, are they going to have enough time for their job?\" Theisen asked. Christoph Lender saw the benefits of volunteering first hand. By his own account, the half-dozen years he spent leading Catholic youth groups helped give him just those skills required by his first employer, a bank. At the job interview, they discussed the work he had done coordinating events, leading discussions and meetings, and being an authority figure for 10 to 15 kids every week. \"It's a signal for a company, that in addition to your studies and any internships you do, that you also took time for other things, and were socially engaged,\" Lender said. \"It speaks for how you choose to spend your time.\" Job boost a 'byproduct' But Lender stressed that his motivation for taking up volunteer work was not some calculated attempt to improve his chances on the job market. \"I did it for my own personal development,\" he said. \"The good experience with the job was just a byproduct of that.\" German software giant SAP's hiring approach also supports Lender's experience. Spokesperson Alla Ruggaber-Mast said the company looks for people who are motivated and independent, with highly developed \"soft skills\" in communication, problem solving, and conflict resolution. But while the firm \"welcomes candidates who are socially engaged, that is not a decisive factor in hiring.\" According to the latest German government survey on volunteerism from 2004, some 36 percent of Germans claim volunteer responsibilities, up from 34 percent five years earlier. But that high number includes such volunteer jobs as taking an active role in a sports club or cultural institute. The figure for \"social\" volunteerism -- such as leading a youth group -- was at 5.5 percent in 2004, up from 4 percent in 1999. There are historical reasons that relatively few Germans take on social volunteer jobs, said Werner Lindwehr, a spokesman for the Agency for Self-Help and Volunteering in the city of Osnabrück, in the state of Lower Saxony. \"Directly after the war, volunteerism was part of society, out of necessity,\" Lindwehr said. \"People helped one another.\" Later, the state took over many of those responsibilities. \"And it may be that Germans started just sitting back and saying, 'I'll let the state take care of it,'\" he acknowledged. Difference to USA Today, however, he sees a movement toward citizens taking a more active role. A \"culture of volunteerism\" is, indeed, developing in Germany, he said. \"People want to do more than just vote every four years,\" Lindwehr said. \"They want to do something on their own doorstep, and they see that they are taken seriously by the government.\" But volunteerism in Germany will never have the same status as in the US, where it fills a quasi-governmental function, he added. \"You can't compare the volunteerism with USA and here,\" he said. \"The US has a much worse social system. In my opinion, they have more need, and thus more organization.\" In Germany, Lindwehr argued, volunteerism will grow, but it will have a more \"political\" character, with volunteers and governments forming a sort of bridge to get things done. For instance, he said, people are becoming increasingly active in local citizens' initiatives. Not everyone likes it An example is a group of people who decide their playground needs renovation, but the town says there is no funding for it. So the local government will act as a go between, and find a carpenter who is willing to donate wood, or people to help manage the construction. Despite these examples, volunteerism in Germany is far from being accepted as purely beneficial. Debates occasionally flare up over the usefulness of the civil-service year, and there are those who decry the notion of unpaid work at all, saying it steals jobs from people who need them. Meanwhile, Christoph Lender said that from where he stands, he has seen little evidence that the country will be overrun by volunteers any time soon. \"Among my friends, I guess you would say I am one of the more socially engaged,\" Lender said. \"Young people have a lot of other things to do -- with sports, going out, the Internet… Everyone has to decide how they want to spend their time.\"",

        "story": "Iran Tops Agenda at G8 Ministers' Meeting in Moscow Foreign ministers of the Group of Eight countries are holding talks in Moscow Thursday that are expected to raise pressure on Iran over its nuclear program. The meeting at a mansion in central Moscow was seen as one of the last opportunities to iron out differences ahead of the July 15-17 summit in Saint Petersburg of leaders of the G8, which comprises Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia and the United States. Moscow, by focusing on Iran's nuclear intentions, may seek to prevent next month's G8 summit becoming a magnet for criticism of its democratic credentials. Arriving at the talks, European Union foreign policy chief Javier Solana said he would meet Iran's top nuclear negotiator Ali Larijani, probably next Wednesday, to discuss proposals by the UN Security Council members plus Germany, aimed at allaying Western concerns about Tehran's nuclear program. Iran has still not said whether or not it will accept a package of incentives proposed on June 6 in Vienna by Germany, the U.S., Britain, France, China and Russia. The incentives are conditional on Iran forgoing large-scale uranium enrichment and answering questions about its program. Iran has a two-week deadline French Foreign Minister Philippe Douste-Blazy said that Iran must reply to the international plan before the July 15-17 G8 summit. \"It seems clear to me that Iran must say yes. Then there will be negotiations,\" Douste-Blazy said. U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice earlier said the ministers would talk about Iran, about how to deal with the Palestinians' Hamas government and about democracy in Russia and Belarus. \"We should also talk about democracy,\" Rice told the broadcaster CNN, expressing a desire for Russia to \"enhance its commitment to democratic development\" as well as referring to Belarus and other \"places that have yet to see a democratic future.\" Russia has played a significant role in the standoff over Iran's nuclear program, being a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council and a close ally of Tehran. President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday again underlined his differences with the West on the Iran issue, saying Russia did not intend \"to join any sort of ultimatum, which only pushes the situation into a dead end.\" Amid reports that Moscow wants to limit discussion of its human rights record or commitment to democracy at next month's summit, a senior Kremlin official defended Russia's role in neighboring parts of ex-communist Europe. \"Moscow has done much more for democracy in central Europe than Washington or London,\" said the deputy head of Putin's office, Vladislav Surkov, at a briefing Wednesday. \"It's Moscow which democratized this immense space.\" But if Russia hopes to avoid discussion of accusations that it is backsliding on democracy and media freedom, the British Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett reiterated that Britain had concerns about human rights and the rule of law in Russia. Beckett, in an interview with Russia's Kommersant broadsheet, also said she hoped next month's summit would give a signal about the importance of competitive and open energy markets. \"Russia's actions are inconsistent with G8 democratic norms\" Four prominent U.S. lawmakers on Tuesday urged President George W. Bush to rebuke Putin over the \"deterioration of democracy\" in his country. It is important that the other G8 heads of state \"make clear that Russia's actions are inconsistent with G8 democratic norms,\" read a letter signed by Democratic Representative Tom Lantos and Republican David Dreier, together with senators John McCain, a Republican, and Democrat Joe Lieberman. Earlier, an analyst close to the Kremlin, the head of the Moscow-based Institute for Political Research, Sergei Markov, said he expected Thursday's meeting to be \"rather tense.\"",

        "story": "Sweden 'doesn't need groups like PEGIDA' The Swedish branch of the PEGIDA movement has held its first demonstration in Malmo with little success, as counter-demonstrators vastly outnumbered PEGIDA supporters. Malcolm Brabant reports from Malmo. The atmosphere on Malmo's Stortorget, or Big Square, was like a bear pit on Monday evening - and this was no ordinary PEGIDA demonstration. Following the lead of Dresden, where the PEGIDA rallies got their start in Germany last October, rallies are supposed to be orderly marches through European cities issuing dark warnings against the \"Islamization of the West.\" But for Sweden's first PEGIDA outing, the authorities decided to corral the anti-Muslim protestors behind a wall of steel barricades in one corner of the square. The arena, for that's how it appeared, was surrounded on all sides by a hostile crowd, baiting anyone who had the nerve to carry a Swedish flag. Not surprisingly, despite declarations of support on Facebook, only a handful of PEGIDA followers dared brave the anti-racism demonstrators and follow controversial art gallery owner Henrik Ronnquist, leader of the Swedish chapter, into the cauldron. \"Hundreds and thousands of people have contacted me over the past few days saying we sympathize with you, we support you, but we don't dare come here today,\" said Ronnquist, a man with a conviction for inciting racial hatred. Last year, his gallery exhibited what a court determined were derogatory depictions of Roma people and Africans by artist Dan Park, who received a six-month sentence for his work. Not long after Ronnquist's statement, a topless woman climbed over the barricade in an attempt to get at him. She had the words \"Stop the PEGIDIZATION of Malmo\" written on her torso. Screaming \"Stop PEGIDA!\" she was dragged away by a burly policeman, who later returned her coat to ward off the cold winter air. \"Sweden needs PEGIDA,\" said Ronnquist. \"What we're seeing is the slow Islamization of Sweden. It's not about racism. It's not about specific Muslim people. We want to keep our traditions. The ground Sweden stands on. Our culture. Freedom of speech, freedom of religion.\" Some young Muslims covered up their faces at the police barriers, anxious not to be filmed. Facing them from across the barricades, a handful of PEGIDA supporters held up a sign saying \"Deport supporters of the 'Islamic State.'\" PEGIDA 'preying on people's fears' The idea that Sweden is being Islamicized was ridiculed by Anders Ekhem, the vicar of Malmo, who held a service in support of Muslims during the rally at his church not far from the square. \"I'm concerned about PEGIDA,\" he said. \"They are preying on people's fears. Most Muslims in Sweden support democracy.\" At the rally, a group of young people carrying red flags supported his view. They spoke passionately against PEGIDA as the demonstration got under way. \"We need to show them that everyone is welcome here,\" said Alma Karlssen. Protesting nearby, David Svensson said that Sweden doesn't \"need groups like PEGIDA, who are driving a wedge between Swedes and creating more problems than there already are.\" \"They don't know their history,\" added Philip Spanberg. \"This is exactly how Nazi Germany came to power.\" Outlet for frustrations PEGIDA's emergence in Sweden comes as the country is involved in an intense debate over immigration and the government's commitment to admitting 100,000 asylum seekers person year. Ronnquist shares an ideology with the right-wing Sweden Democrats, which oppose the current open door immigration policy. The Sweden Democrats are the third largest party in parliament but their influence over legislation has been restricted after the major parties formed an alliance to effectively keep them out of the political decision-making process. Nevertheless, the party has seen a recent rise in its popularity in the polls. PEGIDA, therefore, has become an outlet for frustrations over Sweden's commitment to become the most generous country in Europe toward refugees. But following the low turnout on Monday evening in Malmo, and after poor attendance at PEGIDA rallies in Copenhagen just across the Oresund Bridge, the future of the movement in Scandinavia appears in doubt. \"PEGIDA has more traction in Germany than in Scandinavia,\" said Magnus Ranstorp, a lecturer at the Swedish National Defense College and an extremism expert. \"There is greater tolerance in Scandinavia, despite the presence of right-leaning parties. But this is a warning flag for the authorities, in that they need to deal more holistically with immigration and integration in a sensible way.\"",

        "story": "'Council of Europe must keep talking to Russia' Russia's delegation at the Council of Europe may face sanctions, but the deputy president of the Council's parliamentary assembly, Axel Fischer, says it's unlikely Russia will be excluded altogether. Deutsche Welle: The Council of Europe has been critical of the situation in Ukraine for quite some time, in particular with regard to human rights, the rule of law and the democratization process. Why is the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe intent on imposing sanctions on the Russian delegation at this point in time? Axel Fischer: The Council of Europe and the OSCE have already sent observers to Ukraine and Crimea, and we're also going to accompany the upcoming presidential elections. Of course, the question was: what were the legal preconditions for the vote in Crimea on March 16, and how did Russia annex the Ukrainian peninsula afterwards - in particular bearing in mind that the US, Britain and Russia promised to guarantee Ukraine's territorial integrity after the country gave up its nuclear weapons. The question was, can the Council of Europe simply stand by and watch or must it take action. Our British colleague Robert Walter launched the first initiative: he submitted a motion suggesting that the Council of Europe must formally approach the delegation. He even demanded canceling he Russian delegation's accreditation. You also signed the petition: Are you aiming for Russia's expulsion from the Council of Europe? The petition aims at cancelling the accreditation, but withdrawing the right to vote could be a compromise solution. We believe there has been a breach of the Council of Europe's basic principles. We must make it very clear that the Council of Europe takes its duties seriously, and works towards understanding and a peaceful solution to the conflict. According to Russian media, the head of the Russian delegation has already announced their departure ahead of the Parliamentary Assembly vote. We don't want the situation to escalate any further and we want to keep the talks with Russia going. But under no circumstances will we be blackmailed. We will openly discuss the situation at the meeting and then we'll see what we can agree on. Perhaps the Russians have good arguments to convince us, but right now, I don't expect that to be the case. De-escalation is the first priority - but should the delegates really withdraw ahead of time, what signal would that send to the members of the Council of Europe? I don't believe the Russians will simply opt out. I could imagine the Russian delegation withdrawing if the monitoring committee were to advise the assembly to revoke accreditation. It's possible, but we shouldn't aim for that outcome. But we also can't decide to do nothing at all just because of the Russian announcement. We'll calmly analyze the situation - but de-escalation needs both sides. It's not acceptable that we hold back, discuss possible solutions as to how we could approach the Russian delegation, and meanwhile the Russian side only makes demands. That won't work: the two sides must approach one another. How have negotiations with your Russian counterpart gone up until now? The Russian side's criticism concerning Ukraine is very clear. They say it wasn't a revolution, but a coup, and it wasn't covered by the constitution. They accuse Europeans and Americans of interference. The role of the EU isn't seen in a positive light, either. But that's the Russian point of view. We have a clear point of view, too: we have clear criteria for the Council of Europe that are in accordance with the rule of law, and we know how democracy should function and how elections should be conducted. No matter who did what in Ukraine and in Kyiv, we want human rights to be observed and the rule of law to be guaranteed. That is the Council of Europe's duty. Axel Fischer is a Christian Democrat member of Germany's Bundestag. He heads the German delegation in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE).",

        "story": "Opinion: All Eyes on Germany's President Not from the political elite himself, German President Horst Köhler faces the politically charged decision of whether or not to dissolve parliament. DW's Wolter von Tiesenhausen looks at Köhler's first year in office. When he was elected to office last year Köhler promised to use his position to work on the problems facing Germany and not to let anyone influence his decisions as the country's head of state. It's a promise he's kept by speaking the truth -- even when many may not want to hear it. In the last 12 months, Köhler, who headed up the International Monetary Fund before returning to Germany last year, has not steered clear of controversy. In fact he's rubbed salt into many of Germany's open wounds by criticizing the German trait of not risking or changing anything and happily taking advantage of social services they do not need. President decides on new elections Most recently, he promised not to be influenced by German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder's wish for early elections. Now that the Bundestag, Germany's lower house of parliament, has followed Schröder's wish of a negative vote of confidence, it will be up to President Köhler to decide whether to dissolve the parliament. It would go against the many efforts Köhler has made for change in Germany not to approve the request from all of the country's major political parties and refusing to open the path to new elections a year ahead of time. On the other hand, he is also self-confident and independent enough to push through his own position if he thinks it's the right thing to do -- meaning the election guessing game's next round will now begin. The business-friendly president? Elected by Germany's conservative opposition, union leaders see Köhler to be too business-friendly but do not take into account the scathing remarks he has had for acquisitive businesses that have often shown a lack of corporate responsibility. If Köhler has been unable to remain neutral when it comes to Berlin's political wrangling, then it certainly hasn't hurt the public's view of him. That doesn't come as much of a surprise as his job affords him a high profile and limited authority: He's still near the top of public popularity polls, a position envied by just about every other German politician. Even with his limited powers, Horst Köhler has shown himself to be more than just a yes man who puts his stamp on everything that gets thrown his way. He has remained an influential figure with trips around the globe and continues to work to push Germany forward on the world stage -- work he will most likely continue regardless of who sits in the chancellor's seat this fall.",

        "story": "NATO Troops Killed in Roadside Afghan Blast Five NATO-led troops, three Afghan civilians, two Afghan police officers and five militants were killed in a series of blasts and clashes in Afghanistan. A sixth NATO soldier died in a traffic accident, officials said. In the latest incident, four NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) soldiers were killed in a roadside bomb blast in eastern region of the country, the alliance said in a statement on Sunday, March 15. \"On behalf of ISAF, I offer our sincere condolences to the families and friends of our fallen soldiers,\" Brigadier-General Richard Blanchette, an ISAF spokesperson said in a statement. \"These dedicated professionals have risked their lives for a safe and stable Afghanistan,\" he said. The statement did not disclose the nationalities of the soldiers, nor say where exactly in eastern region the incident took place. Zabiullah Mujahid, a Taliban spokesman said that their forces attacked a US military tank in Kot district of eastern Nangarhar province on Sunday afternoon. It was not immediately clear if the Taliban and NATO statement were referring to the same incident. Meanwhile, a French soldier was killed in a Taliban attack in an area east of Kabul city on Saturday, French Defense Ministry and NATO military in Kabul said. The sixth NATO fatality was a German soldier, who was killed in a traffic accident in northern Afghanistan, the German Defense Ministry said. A British soldier was also killed in an insurgent attack in southern province of Helmand on Saturday, bringing the total number of NATO fatalities to seven in the past two days. Meanwhile, a suicide bomber detonated an explosives-packed vehicle near a convoy of foreign forces in the Afghan capital Kabul on Sunday afternoon, killing two civilians and wounding 14, including several children, Zemarai Bashary, spokesman for the Interior Ministry said. In the south of the country, a roadside bomb targeting Kandahar city's mayor on Sunday killed one bystander and wounded six more civilians, Abdul Khaliq, a senior police official in the province, said. In a separate incident in the same province, US-led coalition forces said they killed five suspected Taliban insurgents and detained four more in an operation in Maiwand district of the province on Sunday morning. The Afghan forces bear the brunt of Taliban attacks in Afghanistan. More than 2,300 police forces were killed in the past two years. Seven years from the ouster of their regime, Taliban militants continue to grow stronger and extend their writ to wider swathes of the country.",

        "story": "From the lab to the medicine cabinet: the long road of drug development Before new medicines are allowed on the market, they have to pass a series of trials to ensure they're safe. It's a lengthy and expensive - but necessary - process for pharmaceutical companies. Out of about 10,000 manufactured substances, an average of about nine will make it out of the laboratory and into clinical studies. Of those nine, it can be as few as just one that will later receive approval to enter the market. Developing, manufacturing and testing new medicines can cost a company between $1 billion and $1.6 billion (750 million euros and 1.2 billion euros) - the range includes the cost of projects that fail. Due to these high costs, it's usually only private pharmaceutical companies that can afford to develop new drugs. But they have been collaborating more and more with universities and research institutes, which often provide the fundamental knowledge that leads to new medicines. Laying the foundation First, researchers aim to identify areas that new medicines could influence, such as particular proteins or genes. They will then search for agents capable of targeting the areas they have identified. Often they will use robots to test thousands of substances in broad tests. When the researchers come across substances they find interesting, they will usually attempt to chemically alter certain properties to make the substance suitable for use in medication. The substances need to be easy for the body to absorb and expel, and be free of poisonous side-effects - for obvious reasons. Manufacturers patent substances, which they feel have the potential to become candidates for use in future medicines. These potential medical substances are then subjected to strict trials. Researchers test them both in the lab and on animals to assess their toxicity – for instance, to ensure they are not carcinogenic, damage embryos or have other harmful effects. Clinical trials: testing pills on people There are three phases to clinical trials. In Phase 1, the medicine is given to a small number of volunteers to test how well they react to it and whether the predictions from animal tests apply to humans when it comes to acceptance, spread and clearance. Scientists also decide on the best means of administering a medicine - whether it's tablets, creams or solutions. The medicine is then tested on sick volunteers in Phase 2. By giving the medicine to between 100 and 500 sick patients, researchers test whether the drug has any effect. They also check for potential side effects and evaluate the ideal dosage. In Phase 3, the trial size grows to include several thousand patients. A study can be cancelled at any point if side effects prove too severe or if a drug is deemed to lack certain level of efficacy. Getting approval If, however, all the studies and trials are successful, drug manufacturers can apply for approval either from a national approval board or an international authority, such as the European Medicines Agency in London. In addition to the application, manufacturers are required to submit information about the purity of the drug and its shelf-life, as well as data from all pre-clinical tests and clinical trials. When all of the approval board's questions have been sufficiently answered, which generally takes about 13 months, the pharmaceutical company receives approval to sell the drug. From start to finish, the whole process of developing a new drug can take 10 years.",

        "story": "Kuwait Airlines and limited Israeli mobility in Middle East A German court's ruling that allowed Kuwait Airlines to deny an Israeli travel has focused attention on an enduring multination boycott of Israel. Kuwaiti law prohibits companies from doing business with Israelis. Critics are accusing a German court of endorsing anti-Semitism following a ruling on Thursday that permits Kuwait Airlines to refuse to transport Israelis because of their citizenship. Though this is the first time a German court has ruled to allow a company to enforce such a specific travel ban, the case casts light on Israelis' long-term lack of mobility across the Middle East. As with most of the Arab League's 22 members and several other Muslim-majority states that do not recognize Israel, Kuwaiti law prohibits companies from doing business with the country's government and citizens. The passenger sued the national carrier for discrimination after it refused to fly him from Frankfurt to Bangkok via Kuwait City in 2016. The airline offered him a seat on a flight by another airline, but he refused. The court ruled that it could not evaluate the laws of a foreign country and that the airline was following Kuwaiti law. It also found that German law prohibits discrimination because of race, ethnicity and religion, but not based on citizenship. Arab League boycott With the notable exceptions of the Palestinian Authority, Jordan and Egypt, which have diplomatic relations with Israel, most Arab League members and several Muslim states have long boycotted the country and plan to continue doing so until its conflict with Palestine is resolved. More than two dozen countries have barred Israeli citizens, declaring that they do not recognize Israel as a nation. Saudi Arabia, like Kuwait, does not allow Israelis to board national planes or transit through the country's airports. Kuwait and about a dozen other Arab and Muslim states go even further, preventing people of any nationality with an Israeli stamp in their passports from entering. To circumvent this, Israeli authorities offer the option of stamping a piece of paper. The travel restrictions that many Middle Eastern nations have imposed do not apply to Jews in general. Most of the countries will not accept Israeli passports because they do not recognize the nation's right to exist, which officially invalidates the travel document. Israel's national carrier, EL AL, is also restricted from flying within the airspace of several Arab and Muslim countries, including Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and Iran. This forces the airline to take longer routes in some cases, such as when flying to Asia. Citizens of most states that impose a boycott are also banned from visiting Israel by their governments. The US Congressional Research Service has found that the Arab League's nearly seven-decade boycott is \"sporadically applied and ambiguously enforced.” Within and near the Middle East, Israelis may travel to Jordan, Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia, as well as non-Arab Turkey. In 2015, the United Arab Emirates, home to the major airlines Emirates and Etihad, changed its laws to allow Israeli citizens to transit airports and people with Israeli stamps on their passports to enter the country. 'Any applicable laws' The case in Frankfurt follows a similar discrimination suit against Kuwait Airways in the United States, where the court ruled against the company. In the US case, however, the defendant was not allowed to fly from New York City to London, where he was to disembark, on a leg of a flight to Kuwait City. According to the International Air Transport Association's guidelines, a carrier can refuse any passenger if \"such an action is necessary to comply with any applicable laws, regulations or orders of any state or country to be flown from, into or over.\" The US Department of Transportation found the airline's policy discriminatory because the man had the right to travel to the UK. The ruling did not address direct flights from the United States to Kuwait. The airline responded by ending flights from the US with a stopover in London. Israel's own maneuvers In March, Israel's parliament passed a law barring foreign activists who support the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement from entering the country. BDS is a global effort to put international pressure on Israel for its policies toward Palestinians and illegal settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Israel regularly denies entry to critics of Israel and supporters of BDS, which has raised concern among some liberal Jewish organizations in the United States. In July, five members of an interfaith delegation of Jewish, Christian and Muslim activists were prevented from boarding a Lufthansa flight from Washington to Israel after authorities told the German national carrier to not to allow them on board. Three of the activists, including a rabbi, were from Jewish Voice for Peace, which supports BDS. A Lufthansa spokesperson told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency that the airline had no indication of why Israel's government did not want the activists to enter. \"We simply have to abide by the rules and regulations of every country in which we operate,\" he said.",

        "story": "Glamorous icon of the swinging '60s: Julie Christie turns 75 Born on April 14, 1941, the British actress is most famous for playing Lara in \"Doctor Zhivago.\" Here are more roles that turned Julie Christie into a pop icon in the1960s - or that revived her career later on. Most starlets would probably be quite happy to have landed a role such as \"Lara\" in \"Doctor Zhivago\" once in their lives. As the young and incredibly beautiful lover of Omar Sharif alias Dr. Jurij Zhivago, Julie Christie became famous beyond her British homeland. The pompous and melodramatic movie set in the Russian Revolution was the work of British director David Lean. And Christie continued to work with outstanding British directors in the '60s and '70s, among them John Schlesinger, Richard Lester and Nicolas Roeg. Dark blue eyes and noble features: Julie Christie Christie's radiant smile that could instantly turn into moving sadness, her expressive eyes and her noble features lent a lot of glamour and depth to her roles. Christie was not just beautiful, she was also highly gifted as an actress: She played lovers and models, as well as older women afflicted with rather tragic experiences. Her performance in Joseph Losey's movie \"The Go-Between\" is unforgotten. Here, she plays a young, attractive woman with whom a 12-year-old boy in puberty falls in love. Already at age 25, Julie Christie was awarded an Oscar for best actress for her performance in the British movie, \"Darling.\" Indian-born, she became a star in Britain Christie was clever enough to not let herself be pinned down to particular roles. And when it came to working with different directors, she did not limit herself to British directors. The British actress was born on April 14, 1941, in India, where her father ran a tea plantation in Assam. And already at a relatively young age, she worked with outstanding non-British directors such as François Truffaut, John Ford and Robert Altman. There isn't really any explanation for why the '80s and '90s saw a sort of decline in her career. After all, Julie Christie continued to be extremely beautiful, and she certainly did not suddenly lose her acting skills. And yet, films shot during those decades, such as \"Dragonheart\" (1996) and \"I'm with Lucy\" (2002) have not stuck in people's memory - in contrast to box office hits such as \"Troy\" and \"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,\" which are remembered not so much for Christie's performance, but rather for their settings and special effects. Comeback with 'Away from Her' Julie Christie fans and international audiences were relieved when the British actress, who had once been acclaimed so much only to be quickly forgotten, succeeded in making a triumphal comeback roughly 10 years ago. She returned into people's hearts as a woman suffering from Alzheimer's. Julie Christie, hailed by critics for her performance as Fiona in \"Away from Her,\" won an Oscar nomination and, in addition to numerous prizes, a Golden Globe. For a long time, Christie, who has always been protective of her privacy, has shared her life with British journalist Duncan Campbell, whom she married in 2008 - in India, her birthplace. Christie and her husband run a farm in Wales. On April 14, 2016, Julie Christie, one of the most glamorous actresses of European cinema, turns 75. Happy birthday!",

The multi-million dollar prize is for heads of state who have left office in the last three years. The Mo Ibrahim Foundation announced on Thursday that the seven-member prize committee had failed to find a winner for the 2015 award, after no one met the criteria. \"When we launched the prize 10 years ago, we deliberately set a very high bar,\" said chairman of the foundation, Mo Ibrahim, a telecoms entrepreneur. \"We want the prize to shine a spotlight on outstanding leadership to provide role models right across society, as well as supporting laureates to continue to serve the continent by sharing their wisdom and experience.\" Candidates for the prize worth $5 million (4.4 million euros) are former African executive heads of state or government who have left office in the previous three years. The prize has been awarded four times since it was established in 2006: Mozambique's Joaquim Alberto Chissano, Botswana's Festus Gontebanye Mogae, Cape Verde's Pedro De Verona Rodrigues Pires and Namibia's Hifikepunye Pohamba. South Africa's Nelson Mandela was awarded an honorary prize in 2007. The winner receives $5 million over 10 years and then $200,000 a year for life, and can apply for another $200,000 a year for good causes they support. The five criteria for the prize for former leaders include democratic election, serving of a mandated term and the demonstration of exceptional leadership. With offices in London and Senegal, the Mo Ibrahim Foundation is an African Foundation set up \"to put governance at the centre of any conversation on African development. It is our belief that governance and leadership lie at the heart of any tangible and shared improvement in the quality of life of African citizens.\" Some of the African leaders not meeting the criteria are Paul Biya who has been prime minister or president of Cameroon for 40 years, Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, president of Equatorial Guinea for 36 years, Jose Eduardo dos Santos who has been leading Angola as president since 1979 and 92-year-old President Robert Mugabe, who has led Zimbabwe since 1980. jm/sms (Reuters)",

        "story": "Turkey signals Incirlik Air Base access, if Germany \"behaves\" well Access demanded by German parliamentarians to the Incirlik NATO airbase could be restored, says Turkey's foreign minister. Mevlüt Cavusoglu has warned through that any approval will depend on how Berlin \"behaves.\" Cavusoglu's conciliatory signal via the German newspaper \"Die Welt\" Wednesday echoed Chancellor Angela Merkel's claim early this week that she expected \"good news\" in the coming days. Cavusoglu's remark preceded his visit due Wednesday to the Council of Europe in Strasbourg where the 47-nation European body is examining President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's large clampdown on officials and civilians since a failed coup in July. Ankara banned in June access to Incirlik by members of Germany's parliament, which has ultimate say over German troop deployments, in anger at the Bundestag's declaration that 1915 massacres of Armenians by Ottoman Turkish forces amounted to \"genocide.\" Germany budgets investment On Tuesday, the magazine \"Der Spiegel\" said Berlin was prepared to invest in new German facilities at the busy air base in southeastern Turkey. Cavusoglu told \"Die Welt\" Wednesday that if Germany \"behaves as it's doing now we will consider it,\" - implying restoration of parliamentarian access. \"If Germany, however, tries to treat Turkey badly then that will not be the case,\" he said, adding that his country refused to be regarded as a \"second class country.\" The impasse was eased last Friday when the German government said the Bundestag parliament's almost unanimous Armenia resolution was not binding. Merkel subsequently emerged from weekend talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, saying she was hoped the ban would soon be lifted. Based at Ercirlik alongside crews from other nations are some 240 German soldiers and Tornado reconnaissance aircraft involved the international campaign against the jihadist \"Islamic State\" (IS) militia which holds parts of Syria and Iraq. Cavusoglu in Strasbourg In Strasbourg Wednesday, Cavusoglu is due to meet foreign ministers of other Council of Europe nations. NATO said Tuesday its Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg will visit Turkey on Thursday and Friday. It will be his first since the 15 July coup attempt in which more than 270 people were killed. ipj/jil (Reuters, AFD)",

        "story": "Europe Salutes Mideast Summit as 'Historic' First Step The Mideast Summit concluded on Wednesday with pledges from Israel and the Palestinians to support the international road map for peace. Europe applauded both sides’ commitment to the plan, but questioned its own role. In a historic meeting in the Jordanian coastal town of Aqaba on Wednesday, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and his Palestinian counterpart Mahmoud Abbas agreed to implement the so-called road map for peace as drafted by the Middle East quartet. European leaders lauded both sides’ commitment to the plan and expressed gratitude to United States President George W. Bush for his success in bringing Abbas and Sharon together. During the summit, Sharon said he was prepared to accept an interim Palestinian state and to dismantle \"illegal\" settlements in occupied Palestinian territories, but cautioned this could only happen if the Palestinians made inroads in stopping terrorism. Abbas, for his part, vowed that his government would \"act vigorously\" to end violence against Israel and pressure those militant groups who attack Israel to renounce terrorism. \"A historic chance\" German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer praised Sharon, Abbas and Bush, who spearheaded the one-day summit, for their \"courageous efforts\" in putting aside their differences and returning to peace talks for the first time since the process collapsed in 2000. \"Israelis and Palestinians are called upon to use this historic chance to create peace and security for both people,\" Fischer said Wednesday evening. \"Both conflicting parties have made important steps on the road to peace,\" he added, while warning that the will to peace should not be undermined by extremists. \"Terror and violence must end,\" he urged. Speaking on behalf of the German government, Fischer vowed to support the renewal of the Middle East peace process with all his country’s strength. The foreign minister has been actively involved in the European Union’s attempts to bring Israel and the Palestinians back to the negotiating table. In April he met with Sharon and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to discuss efforts to speed up the adoption of the international road map to peace. Europe’s role in Middle East The road map, which was hammered out by the so-called Middle East quartet comprising of the United States, United Nations, the European Union and Russia details a series of steps aimed at creating a Palestinian state by 2005. What role the European Union is expected to play in the future of the peace process, however, seems to be a matter of discussion as the U.S. takes charge of the negotiations. Prior to the summit in Aqaba, France saluted the United States’ \"re-engagement\" in the Middle East, but insisted Europe must not be excluded from the negotiations. Speaking on Europe 1 radio on Wednesday, French Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin stressed, \"The road map means the quartet -- that is the U.N., Russia, the U.S. and the EU. And the EU has played a full role in recent months. It must continue to do so. To make peace succeed, everyone must act together.\" Lest the other players in the quartet forget what the EU brings to the negotiation table, the minister emphasized Europe’s strengths in the region. \"Europe has a powerful influence. It is Israel’s main economic partner,\" he said. \"It is the biggest aid donor to the Palestinian territories. This is a strength. Let us use our strengths together.\" \"Everyone must act together\" Earlier in the week, French President Jacques Chirac alluded to EU plans to draft a new parallel \"road map\" for the Middle East to include Syria and Lebanon. The plan, which allegedly has the approval of EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana, is scheduled to be introduced at the European Union summit in Greece on June 20. If not carefully orchestrated, such actions could run up against Washington’s renewed interest in leading the peace talks. Although the U.S. has not come out with any comments to the contrary, it has also not specifically mentioned what role the EU would play in implementing the Israeli-Palestinian road map. One point of consternation between the two quartet players is Europe’s insistence on maintaining contact with Palestinian leader Arafat despite objections from the U.S. \"They [the Europeans] are going to, for their own political reasons, meet with Arafat. That’s their choice. We basically say we don’t think it’s a good idea,\" a senior official traveling with Bush in the Middle East told Reuters. Both Israel and the U.S. have refused to deal with Arafat, who has been largely confined to his Ramallah headquarters since the recent wave of violence erupted in December 2001. European leaders, however, see Arafat as wielding a significant influence in the Palestinian territories and say he must be encouraged to work with and not against the quartet.",

        "story": "Mkhitaryan's farewell letter to Dortmund fans meets with mixed reaction After his move to Manchester United was confirmed by the Premier League giants, Henrikh Mkhitaryan penned an open letter to Borussia Dortmund fans. But the Armenian's farewell note met with mixed reactions. Mkhitaryan, the reigning DW Bundesliga Player of the Season, said in the letter that he feels “privileged” to have played for the Ruhr area club. \"I will never forget the moments we shared together,\" said Mkhitaryan in a post on his official Facebook page. He also thanked his Dortmund teammates and the BVB fans for all the support he's been given over the years. Some Dortmund fans, however, are less than thrilled by the playmaker's move. Many BVB supporters cite Mkhitaryan's wage demands from the German club as the reason for their displeasure. According to reports, Dortmund had offered the attacker a salary of around 5 million euros a year, which would have made him one of the club's top earners but he rejected it and asked for a transfer in order to land a more lucrative deal elsewhere. His reported deal with Manchester United will see him earning a yearly wage of 10 million euros, double the offer reportedly made by Dortmund. However, plenty of of Twitter users sent Mkhitaryan messages of support and best wishes, while also expressing their sadness at his departure from the Signal Iduna Park. Some fans have drawn comparisons between the Armenian and another former BVB man Mario Götze, who signed for Bayern Munich after a 13-year spell with Dortmund. Other Dortmund fans have criticized his failure to take a penalty in the DFB Pokal final against Bayern Munich. Finally, this fan also made a cheeky remark about the fact Mkhitaryan's new club won't play Champions League football this term. Mkhitaryan is the third high-profile player to leave Borussia Dortmund this transfer window, after the departures of Mats Hummels and Ilkay Gündogan. Dortmund's CEO Joachim Watzke was recently quoted saying that the attacker will end up staying at Dortmund, only to later confirm his move to the Premier League club.",

        "story": "German Wine Producers Discover the Art of PR After years of being thought of as cheap and sugary, German wine is enjoying huge international success. It owes its success to producers who are adapting to accommodate a new generation of consumers. As the first grapes of this year's harvest are due to be picked in the coming weeks, wine producers are optimistic about the 2008 vintage. But Raimund Pruem, who has been producing wine in the Moselle Valley for over 30 years, remembers a time when Riesling was not so prosperous. \"The bad reputation of German wine really hurt us,\" he said. \"I will never forget a blind tasting we did a while ago. The judges gave tremendous praise: Against South African and Australian wines, German Riesling did the best. But when they took off their blindfolds and saw the labels they started making excuses for their comments.\" Since then, however, German wine has made a comeback, particularly in the US after some Moselle Valley vintners earned the attention of the hugely influential American wine critic Robert Parker. A new generation of customers As German vintners don't tend to produce very large quantities of any one style of wine due to the varying conditions in the vineyards, most of their wine sold abroad goes through specialist retailers or online. Due to the steepness of the slopes virtually all Riesling in the Moselle Valley is hand-picked and despite being very labor intensive, high quality German wines remain relatively inexpensive -- a new reputation that is prized by vintners. But while Germany's sweet Rieslings are by far the most popular in the US, the German market decidedly prefers the \"trocken\" variety, the dry wines. Ninety-five percent of the wine the S.A. Pruem winery sells in Germany is dry Riesling. \"There is a generational problem, young people in Germany today do not drink the same wine as their grandparents anymore -- they drink only drier, more expensive wines,\" Pruem said. This is a relatively new development since a sudden change in German wine drinkers' pallets in 1976 switched the demand from very sweet Rieslings to bone dry. Such changes are not uncommon in the wine business as each generation of customers presents new demands. Producers stepping up Although Raimund Pruem's vineyards have been in his family since 1158 and his daughter is now sharing his marketing responsibilities, the art of winemaking is no longer something taught exclusively from one generation to the next. Virtually all top vintners around the Moselle have studied viticulture and vinification, gathering experience with many grape varieties and in some cases working in vineyards around the world. While Pruem's ancestors' jobs mainly consisted of winemaking, today German wine producers are increasingly spending their time promoting and selling their wines too. \"When people come here they don't want to meet the sales staff, they want to meet the producer,\" Pruem explained. \"Who else is a better promoter than the producer himself? That's something that has changed totally. My grandfather, my father and even myself when I was younger -- we saw how it doesn't work sitting here, waiting for customers, you have to be active.\" There has to be a connection between the producer and his customers, he added: \"Customers need communication.\" As a result, more and more producers are taking it upon themselves to host large group tastings, wedding receptions and to participate in international tasting events, touring the world with their wines. An artful business The change in approach is evident. Producers are experimenting and reaching out more and more: Bottles of other grape varieties such as Pinot Blanc and Chardonnay -- and even the occasional red wine -- are increasingly found on tasting lists around the Moselle Valley. But the demands of marketing are hard to keep up with. \"I have to sell my wine twice: first to the customer (the retailer), then to my customer's customer,\" Pruem said. \"You have to go with the retailer to ensure the wine is on the shelves and is being taken off the shelves and bought.\" Like most other wine producers, Pruem is carrying on the centuries-old art of winemaking: \"The art is to taste the juice from the grapes and produce a wine from it that shows the signals of the vineyard.\" But he is also introducing a new art -- that of public relations. \"My wines need to show character, if they don't show character then forget it.\" -- Pruem's statement reveals the bottom line for vintners like himself: If their wine fails to meet standards, then not only is their livelihood, passion and reputation at stake, but also their legacy.",

        "story": "Hecking confident he can lead Gladbach out of danger zone Mönchengladbach have unveiled their new coach as they prepare to head to their winter training camp. They also appear to be close to signing a defender as they look to put distance between themselves and the drop zone. Dieter Hecking (pictured above, right), who was actually named as the successor to the sacked Andre Schubert after Gladbach's last game of 2016, looked confident as he appeared at Wednesday's press conference alongside sporting director Max Eberl (above left). \"Yes, I know how to be successful. Yes, I know how to deal with young players. Yes, I have previously led teams out of such regions (of the standings),\" Hecking said, referring to the fact that having taken just 16 point from their first 16 matches, the Foals are currently in 14th spot in the Bundesliga standings. However, the 52-year-old Hecking, who began his playing career at the club more than 30 years ago, also said his goals for this season would be modest. \"I am a realist. We are a long way from saying that we intend to finishing in third, fourth or fifth place,\" he said. For his part, Eberl said he was convinced that Hecking was the right man for the job because of his successful track record and the fact that he had proved that he has a knack for working with young players. \"He is a good fit for Borussia Mönchengladbach,\" Eberl said. Although Hecking said that he was convinced that the Foals were already a strong team in terms of personnel, it looks like he will be getting some help for the back line. Eberl confirmed that they were close to signing central defender Thimotee Kolodziejczak from Sevilla. While the two appeared at the press conference, the 25-year-old Kolodziejczak was going through his physical - and is expected to be part of the roster that fly off on Friday for their winter training camp in Marbella, Spain. Mönchengladbach are Hecking's fifth assignment in the Bundesliga, after previously having coached Alemannia Aachen, Hannover, Nuremberg and Wolfsburg. He was sacked by Wolfsburg in mid-Octoberafter that club too got off to a disappointing start to the season. The Volkswagen-owned club are currently level on points with Gladbach, but one position above them in the standings on goal difference. pfd/dv (dpa, SID)",

        "story": "Schalke and Bremen limp into Champions League fixtures Two of Germany's Champions League representatives are beginning to fray at the edges at home. Both Schalke and Werder lost last weekend, but they may have different approaches to European competition. The Champions League is meant to separate the men from the boys. Football connoisseurs enjoy pointing out that it is superior in quality to the World Cup, and no less an authority than Real Madrid coach Jose Mourinho has said it is the best competition in the world. But then he would, seeing as how he’s won it twice. But in the group stages at least, the gulf between Europe's rich and poor leagues often belies this claim, and Germany's representatives in this season's Champions League seem to be finding Europe's best of the best a lot easier to cope with than unglamorous mid-table sides like Nuremberg. Bayern Munich, last season's Champion's League finalists, have only just broken into the top half of the table, but they are three from three in their easy European group. But it is Schalke, led by veteran coach Felix Magath and spear-headed on the pitch by Spanish star Raul, who are best at showing up what a questionable test the Champions League group stages really are. Schalke are second from bottom in the league, having scraped together six points from 10 games - the exact same total they have notched up in their three Champions League matches, thanks to routine wins against Portugal's Benfica and Israel's Hapoel Tel Aviv. Another win in Tel Aviv on Tuesday and they will be well on their way out of the group. Superficial glory But there are of course many other factors at play. As Magath never tires of pointing out, Schalke are struggling with new signings and a new system, and somehow the glamour and much-mooted 'magic' of Europe seems to lift veterans like Raul, the Champions League’s all-time top scorer. The short-term glory of a much-needed win in Europe is a balm for many sorrows. After Raul put two past Hapoel a couple of weeks ago, there was much optimistic talk of \"transferring\" that form to the league, but Saturday's 1-0 home defeat to local rivals Leverkusen ended with the players being booed off the pitch, and now Schalke face the real prospect of replacing their dead title dreams with a relegation battle. That is not much fun for internationally experienced stars like Manuel Neuer, Klaas-Jan Huntelaar and Christoph Metzelder, and Magath sounded pessimistic after the game. \"We have players who are used to playing for the top. That's why they can't cope with the situation,\" newspaper Bild quoted Magath as saying. \"The performance didn’t match our current position in the standings. We have to try to avoid a tight situation at the bottom of the table.\" Mid-table struggle For Werder Bremen, the problem is more subtle. Their league form is not good either, and they also just lost at home, to a solid but average Nuremberg. But their attacking line-up featuring the likes of Claudio Pizarro, Hugo Almeida, and Marko Marin are always good for a few goals, and they have at least consolidated mid-table status. In Europe, though, they face a scrap. Tuesday sees them host Dutch champions FC Twente, and the match is pretty much a do-or-die tie for both teams - they are both on two points, behind second-placed Tottenham Hotspur, who have four. A defeat would signify pretty much the end of the competition for Werder, and a draw does neither team much good. Werder's frame of mind going into the match is pessimistic. \"The only chance we still have is getting three points,\" Marin said after Saturday's game. \"But that will be difficult. The mood in the dressing room is not good.\" Team captain Torsten Frings was livid after the defeat on Saturday. \"We're just being too careless with the situation,\" he said, after railing against his team-mates as the final whistle went. But he does not see the Champions League match as a distraction, but a chance. \"It’s a good opportunity to take a big step forward,\" he said. The combination of having a fight on their hands, along with the fact that they will have something to prove to the Weserstadion faithful, means they may well pull off a win against Twente. Werder have more European experience, and home advantage should see them get past the Dutch side, whom they held to a 1-1 draw in the Netherlands. For Schalke, meanwhile, the Champions League needs to be an afterthought. Author: Ben Knight Editor: Matt Hermann",

        "story": "'We need the death penalty to deter criminals' The latest statistics on the death penalty published by Amnesty International confirm that no country executes more people than China. Recent reforms are unlikely to change this any time soon. Amnesty International assumes that several thousands of people were executed in China last year - which is more than in all other countries, which all together, have carried it out 527 times. For the second year, the human rights watchdog refrains from publishing more precise figures or even estimates about the number of executions in China, which is a state secret. Many offenses can be punished by death in China, not only murder, but also corruption and other economic crimes. Widespread public support The official justification for this practice is that the death penalty is needed to deter criminals. And if one asks people in the streets of Beijing, many share the government's view. One man said, \"I think we need the death penalty. Otherwise our society would be too chaotic. Every country has its own particular situation, and China is no exception.\" Widespread corruption in particular makes people angry.\" Ordinary people hate nothing more than corruption,\" a woman said. \"Even if you shoot a corrupt official ten times over, this hatred won't go away. In fighting corruption, penalties can't be too harsh. They should all be put to death!\" Gradual changes Despite China's harsh penalties the attitude towards the death penalty has gradually changed since the opening of the country 30 years ago. For years, death-row inmates were paraded through the streets on the way to their public executions. But shooting criminals in public was banned in the late 1980s for harming the country's image. Today, executions take place in jails or special execution buses, reports the California-based rights organization Dui Hua Foundation. More and more, bullets are being replaced by lethal injections. Since 2007, the Supreme Court has had to confirm each death sentence, which has brought down the number of executions, says Liu Renwen, a law expert from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) in Beijing. \"This is meant to cause some restraint in the provinces in proclaiming death sentences, and to bring down their numbers further still.\" No precise figures known The exact number of death sentences remains a well guarded state secret. Chinese experts are cautious to talk about this topic publicly, fearing repercussions. Rights groups such as the Dui Hua Foundation assume that the number of annual executions stood at about 10,000 ten years ago, and has been halved in the meantime. Apparently the intention in Beijing is to further reduce the figure, but at the same time, the leadership believes that the time has not come for abolishing the death penalty altogether. Professor Liu Renwen, who openly opposes the death penalty himself, admits that the chances are slim at the moment. \"Laws must reflect the harmonious values of a society and the demands of the majority. So we can just cut down the death penalty step by step. It would be difficult to completely do away with it all of a sudden.\" China has launched at least a cautious reform of the death penalty a month ago. Previously, 68 offenses had been punishable by death, 13 of which are now set to be removed from the list. The maximum penalty will no longer be possible for criminals smuggling rare animals or looting archeological excavation sites, for example. But human rights groups think this will hardly affect the number of annual executions as many of these crimes, including VAT fraud, have not been punished by death for years.

        "story": "German lawmakers agree on inheritance tax compromise A parliamentary mediation committee has clinched a long-awaited deal on a required reform of Germany's inheritance tax system. The agreement ended a bitter political dispute that lasted almost two years. The governing parties of Germany's grand coalition government on Thursday agreed to crack down on tax breaks for people inheriting companies. A parliamentary mediation committee representing both houses said heirs should in future still be able to get a 100-percent tax break, if they kept the firm going and preserved the previous employment level. But the committee made it clear that exemptions for businesses worth more than 90 million euros ($100 million) would be done away with, while preferential treatment for those worth more than 26 million euros would be reduced tangibly. The compromise deal is likely to be passed by the Bundestag lower house on September 29 and comes after the country's supreme court rules the previous inheritance tax regulations breached the principle of equal treatment. Not everyone is amused In December 2014, the Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe demanded tighter restrictions for small and medium-sized firms to qualify for generous tax breaks. Germany's DIHK Chambers of Commerce welcomed the compromise, saying it would give family-owned companies more security as they made investment and hiring decisions. It warned, though, that the tax burden for heirs of many bigger firms would rise significantly. With some of the stipulations in the deal leaving room for interpretation, the head of the Ifo economic think tank in Munich, Clemens Fuest, criticized the agreement, describing it as an \"employment program for tax consultants.\" hg/uhe (Reuters, dpa)",

        "story": "Moshammer Killer Gets Life Sentence A Munich court has sentenced Herish Ali Abdullah, a 26-year-old Iraqi, to life in prison for murdering fashion designer Rudolph Moshammer in January. The Munich court convicted Abdullah to murder and robbery resulting in death to a life sentence 10 months after the colorful fashion designer was murdered in his villa in Munich. \"You killed in an insidious manner, out of greed and to make robbery possible,\" Manfred Götzl, the leading judge in the case, said to the defendant. Abdullah had taken an unspecified amount of money from Moshammer after the murder, at least one 200-euro bill. Abdullah admitted on the second day of his trial that he killed Moshammer after the designer refused to pay for sex. Moshammer had picked up Abdullah on the evening of Jan.13 near the Munich train station and taken him back to his villa, offering the younger man 2,000 euros ($2,360) to go to bed with him. The Iraqi, who is living in Germany as a refugee, said after the refusal to pay, he wrapped an electrical cord around Moshammer's neck and \"pulled it tight.\" After the designer fell to the ground, Abdullah said he pulled the cord again. Abdullah was arrested two days later after police found his DNA on the cord. Severity of crime The court ruled that the severity of the man's guilt called for Abdullah to serve at least 15 years in prison, with no possibility of early release. The sentence corresponds to the motion put forward by the district attorney, who had asked for the life sentence. The motion accused Abdullah of strangling Moshammer in a particularly insidious manner, saying that the young man had had the intent to rob the designer from the moment that Moshammer picked him up in his Rolls Royce. The defendant's attorneys, on the other hand, had asked that their client be convicted on a charge of manslaughter and had called for a sentence of under ten years. German Eccentric With the death of the 64-year-old Moshammer, Germany lost the man who was once described as the country's \"only genuine eccentric.\" He was instantly recognizable to most Germans with his jet-black bouffant, waxed moustache and Yorkshire terrier Daisy who was always in his arms, or in his lap. Moshammer counted among his clients Arnold Schwarzenegger, now governor of California, tenor Jose Carrera and the Las Vegas-based entertainers Siegfried and Roy. But he was also well-known outside of high-society circles. For his funeral procession, more than 10,000 people lined the streets of Munich.",

They hope to extract DNA from the skeleton and determine who he was. Archaeologists discovered a 2,000-year-old skeleton in a shipwreck off the coast of the Greek island of Antikythera. If they are able to extract DNA from the remains, they can get an accurate genetic profile of the man who was on the ship, including hair and eye color and ancestral origin. It is very rare to find a skeleton in the sea, as human remains are usually eaten by fish or swept away over time. It is especially rare to find a well-preserved skeleton, including a partial skull, two arm bones, several ribs and two femurs. \"It doesn't look like bones that are 2,000 years old,\" said Hannes Schroeder, a DNA analysis expert from the Denmark Museum of Natural History. \"Archaeologists study the human past through the objects our ancestors created,\" said co-director of the excavation, Brendan Foley, a marine archaeologist with Massachusetts-based Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. \"With the Antikythera shipwreck, we can now connect directly with this person who sailed and died aboard the Antikythera ship,\" Foley said. The Institution is working on the excavation with the Greek culture ministry. The Antikythera shipwreck was first discovered by in 1900 and is believed to be the first wrecked ship ever investigated by archaeologists. The first major find in the ship was the \"Antikythera Mechanism,\" an item from 2nd century BC and is occasionally referred to as the world's oldest computer. It modeled the motions of the sun, moon and planets and is composed of many cogs and gears. The ship also contained marble statues, tableware, and thousands of other artifacts. There were other skeletons found in the ship, but they were discovered before DNA testing was available. kbd/jm (AFP, AP)",

        "story": "A night of what-ifs in Gelsenkirchen Against Ireland, Germany once again didn't gel as they should have. While coach Joachim Löw continues to say his players are not fresh enough, the fans say the reasons for the failed result are many and varied. After drawing 1-1 with Ireland in Gelsenkirchen, disappointed Germany fans hurried along in the dark towards waiting trains, faces downturned and muttering complaints. There can be no doubting that tonight's draw feels like a loss to the home fans here. \"Hummels and Kroos are the problem, they just aren't playing well enough,\" said one. \"This team still needs to find itself,\" chirped one child, wearing her Germany shirt, to her father. \"They wanted to just defend their way to a win, but attack is the best form of defense,\" quips another fan as he chats to his friends. Lacking freshness The fans are right. The reasons for Germany's failed attempt at picking up three points on Tuesday night in Gelsenkirchen are varied. Jerome Boateng after the game said it was all to do with Germany getting too frantic at the end of the game, and not clearing the ball properly. Since their World Cup final replay game against Argentina, the most obvious reason for Germany's current plight is the loss of class. With Philipp Lahm, Per Mertesacker and Miroslav Klose all enjoying international retirement, Germany has now permanently lost some great players in crucial positions. Lahm used to provide important attacking impetus, Mertesacker was strong and reliable in central defense, and Klose may have got Germany that crucial second goal in Gelsenkirchen. On top of that, there are a host of senior players out injured too: Bastian Schweinsteiger, Mesut Özil and Sami Khedira can't be just replaced overnight. Still, Germany coach Joachim Löw defended his leadership vacuum after the game saying it's not really an issue. \"We have players - Boateng, Kroos, Hummels – that are taking over the leadership of this team,\" he told DW. \"I see these guys taking on more responsibilites all the time and they are doing it well.\" \"But, of course, those senior players did use to help all the squad, also off the pitch,\" he added. Löw appears to be sticking to his main argument. In the post match press conference he said the team was still lacking a bit of fitness, and that this is one of the biggest problems. Germany frustrated while Ireland rejoices The fact that Germany is looking for so many excuses so soon after their World Cup win must surprise many outside observers. It's reminiscent of the German fans and media mood before the World Cup in Brazil. But, the mood understandably wasn't bothering the Irish players who, after the game, sung their team song raucously in the changing rooms as if they were celebrating a victory. \"To be honest, I think it was because we defended well, not because Germany was lacking direction,\" Ireland veteran Robbie Keane told DW after the game. \"Aside from the early chances and Kroos' chance, which was from a long way out, they didn't have a lot of shots.\" \"They had a lot of possession, but didn't shoot much,\" he added. And, there, in principle might be the issue. Germany, deserved World Champions just three months ago, will have to get used to playing teams that stack up their back line and force them into endless passing. It is up to the Germans now to find a way around the challenge. No more excuses.",

        "story": "Anti-Islamist protests, counter-protests staged in Cologne Police in the western German city of Cologne are bracing for potential violence as seven demonstrations take place. The rallies are being staged by anti-Islamist, extreme leftist and Carnival groups, among others. Sunday's demonstrations center around a protest planned by the so-called Hooligans Against Salafists (HoGeSa) group, an anti-Islam organization that last year caused riots in the city at a similar demonstration. The Cologne chapter of \"anti-Islamization\" movement PEGIDA, which has its base in the eastern city of Dresden, is also expected to stage a rally. At the same time, a number of counter-protesters opposing the anti-Islam, anti-immigration stance of such groups have also gathered in the inner city. They include radical leftist \"autonomous\" demonstrators carrying banners with the slogan: \"Germany, keep your mouth shut!\" Other counter-demonstrators come from the city's vibrant Carnival scene. DW's Milan Gagnon is reporting from Cologne. Some 3,500 police have been deployed to try to keep the peace in Cologne, with around 23,000 people from the competing sides expected to take to the streets. Several water cannons are also on hand, and a helicopter is surveilling the city from above. Police tried to have the HoGeSa demonstration banned in the days leading up to the demonstration, citing last year's violence on October 26 in which at least 44 police were injured. But a court on Wednesday ruled against prohibiting the rally, stipulating only that it had to take place at a fixed location rather than include a march through the streets. Police did, however, manage to have the HoGeSa demonstration moved from last year's location at the main railway station to the other side of the river in the Deutz district. tj/cmk (AFP, dpa)",

        "story": "Australia-Cambodia refugee resettlement deal slammed by rights groups Australia and Cambodia signed a $35 million deal that will see an unknown number of refugees currently housed in Australia's offshore detention centers resettled in the impoverished Southeast Asian nation. Cambodia's Deputy Prime Minister Sar Kheng and Australia's Immigration Minister Scott Morrison signed the agreement in Phnom Penh on Friday, September 26, in a four-minute-long ceremony that saw a tray of champagne flutes crash to the ground as they put pen to paper. After a brief round of applause from their respective entourages, both men ignored media questions and hurriedly left the room. The secretive agreement, which has been under negotiation since February, has been widely condemned by rights groups and others. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees António Guterres condemned the deal to resettle refugees from the Pacific island of Nauru to Cambodia, adding that he was \"deeply concerned\" at the precedent it set. \"This is a worrying departure from international norms. We are seeing record forced displacement globally, with 87 percent of refugees now being hosted in developing countries. It is crucial that countries do not shift their refugee responsibilities elsewhere,\" he said. \"International responsibility sharing is the basis on which the whole global refugee system works. I hope that the Australian government will reconsider its approach,\" Guterres added. A joint statement handed to the media after Friday's signing ceremony shed little new light on the issue beyond noting that Cambodia would decide when and how many refugees it would take, and stating that there would be an \"initial trial arrangement with a small group of refugees, which will be followed by further resettlement in accordance with Cambodia's capacity.\" It reiterated that settlement would be \"on a voluntary basis,\" a condition Phnom Penh has insisted upon. Earlier Morrison told Australia's ABC network that the deal provided a regional solution to a regional problem, and met the Abbott government's pledge that \"no-one will be resettled in Australia.\" He also said there was no upper limit on the number of refugees who might be sent, adding that it currently applies to people at the detention centre on the Pacific island of Nauru. Around 200 of the more than 1,200 asylum seekers there have been classified as refugees. Australia has agreed to pay an additional 40 million AUD (35 million USD) in development aid over the next four years to Cambodia, which is considered one of the world's most corrupt countries, with the money purportedly earmarked for projects such as electoral reform, rice milling and land-mine clearance. Australia will also fund the costs of the resettlement process. But many aspects remain unknown, including how many refugees will come, where they will be housed, whether they will be allowed to work, and how they will access services in a country where provision of services is poor and government-sanctioned corruption is rife. Controversial The deal has proved highly controversial in Cambodia and abroad. In Phnom Penh on Friday morning, around 100 protestors petitioned the Australian embassy to scrap the agreement, saying Cambodia is too poor to help others. Speaking to reporters at the demonstration, opposition chief whip Son Chhay condemned the secrecy that surrounded the drafting process, and warned against using Cambodia \"as a dumping ground for unwanted refugees\" by using money to buy off \"a corrupt government.\" \"We believe that this deal not just violates the Refugee Convention, but it [allows] some countries who have money [to be] able to buy off their responsibility towards refugees,\" he said. \"And [that] could create a bad habit for many countries to follow.\" Protester Son Chum Chuon said he was against the agreement because Cambodia lacks the capacity to handle the refugees and needs to sort out the entrenched problems facing its own people before it can assist others. \"The human rights system [and] the democracy system in Cambodia [are] still poor. That is the reason that some demonstrators want to gather in front of the Australian embassy today,\" he said. \"In future, if Cambodia [is] stable in democracy, stable in human rights, I am happy to see all those refugees. But now [I'm] not.\" Top secret The deal has been on the cards since February when the visiting Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop asked Cambodia to take in refugees. Both countries subsequently maintained a near-uniform silence on the proposal until Wednesday when Cambodia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that Morrison would visit Phnom Penh to sign. In the face of withering criticism, the Abbott government, which was elected in part on the promise that it would not allow more boats carrying asylum seekers to land in Australia, says it wants a regional solution to the issue of asylum seekers, and holds that many of those trying to reach its shores are economic migrants. News of the signing has caused a storm of protest over the past two days. Opposition politicians in both countries have joined rights organizations, church groups and legal experts in condemnation. Alastair Nicholson, the former chief justice of Australia's Family Court, described the deal as \"inappropriate, immoral and likely illegal,\" and said it raised serious concerns for the welfare of refugees and their children. Nicholson, who was speaking on behalf of an alliance of organizations including Amnesty International, the Refugee Council of Australia, and Save the Children, said Cambodia's welfare sector was already struggling. \"It is inappropriate because Cambodia has no capacity within its social sector to take an influx of refugees,\" he said. \"Immoral, because these vulnerable people are Australia's responsibility and, while we await the detail, it appears illegal in contravening Australia's humanitarian and refugee obligations to vulnerable children and families.\" Cambodia, one of the poorest countries in the world, already relies significantly on international donors to fund its social and welfare programmes. \"When you choose to place refugee children in the care of a country already dependent on the international donor community for supporting its own children, you make a clear choice to put refugee children and their families at serious risk,\" Nicholson warned. 'Unsafe and ill-equipped' On Thursday, Human Rights Watch warned that Cambodia's poor record on refugees and on human rights meant Australia was failing to meet its commitment that it would send people to a \"safe third country.\" \"Australia's deal with Cambodia will send people to a country that has a terrible record for protecting refugees and is mired in serious human rights abuses,\" said HRW's Australia director Elaine Pearson. \"Despite Canberra's claims, the reality is Cambodia is both unsafe and ill-equipped to handle large numbers of refugees who will be given one-way tickets to Phnom Penh.\" Cambodia has a poor record when it comes to asylum seekers. In 2009, for example, the country sent a group of 20 Uighur asylum seekers back to China (where HRW said they were jailed). Within days it had received a billion-dollar package of grants and loans from Beijing. According to UNHCR spokesperson Vivian Tan, Friday's deal meant Australia's international responsibilities towards refugees \"are in question,\" adding that people \"fleeing conflict and persecution deserve compassion and help.\" \"UNHCR has always advocated that asylum-seekers should be processed and benefit from protection in the territory of the country where they arrive or which otherwise has jurisdiction over them,\" she said. \"They should not be transferred to another country for asylum processing, and if recognized as refugees, relocated to yet another country for permanent settlement.\" Services lacking Much of Cambodia's infrastructure and social services remain in disarray after the destruction of the Khmer Rouge's 1975-79 rule, civil war, and underinvestment by the government. Mental health services, for instance, are practically non-existent outside Phnom Penh. In addition, there are few jobs, and education and healthcare are poor. Sister Denise Coghlan heads the Cambodian office of the Jesuit Refugee Service, which has operated here since 1990. Although Cambodia's willingness to take in refugees was \"a good thing,\" she said the lack of mental health services is only one issue they will face. “[Cambodia's] capacity to accept people who have been severely traumatized both by the situation in their own country and by their treatment by the Australian government – first on places like Christmas Island and then Nauru – these people have now been left in a very traumatized and psychologically weak situation,\" she said. \"The capacity of the mental health facilities in Cambodia to really cope with this kind of situation is pretty weak.\"",
