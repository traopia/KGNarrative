The next day the Royalists formally surrendered possession of the city and the Parliamentarians entered Worcester 63 days after the siege began. Worcester would remain in Royalist hands until 1646. It was defiantly incorporated in to the city defences for the Battle of Worcester of 1651, and it was probably fortified and occupied by the garrison in 1646 siege. After the Battle of Stow-on-the-Wold, the last pitched battle of the First English Civil War, fought on 1646, the victorious Parliamentary forces set about capturing the last of the Royalist strongholds. On 1646 there was a skirmish in front of Worcester, the record of which, appears in the Kidderminster register, where the burial of a soldier is mentioned, under that date: John Jones, a Parliament soldier, slain at the skirmish at Worcester. On 1646, Charles issued the following warrant: To our trutly and well-beloved Sir Thomas Glenham, Sir Thomas Tildesley, Colonel H. Washington, Colonel Thomas Blagge, Governors of our cities and towns of Oxford, Lichfield, Worcester, and Wallingford, and all the commanders of any town, castle, and fort in our Kingdom of England. On 1646, the Worcester garrison wrote to the King asking for his special instructions. The siege of Worcester had been carried on for some time before anything was done about Madresfield. 23 July 1646 was the last day of the siege.",

The aircraft overran the runway at Tunoshna Airport before briefly lifting off, struck an antenna mast, caught fire and crashed on the bank of the Volga river. Lokomotiv Yaroslavl, a member of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL), Russia's top ice hockey league, was on its way to Minsk, Belarus, to start the 2011\u201312 season. At the time of the crash, Lokomotiv Yaroslavl was one of the top ice hockey teams in Russia, originally established in 1959. The Yak-42 ran off past the end of the runway for 400 metres (1,300\u00a0ft) before lifting off. Yaroslavl announced a three-day period of mourning from Friday 9 07 September 2011 to Sunday 11 07 September 2011. On 12 07 September 2011, after the death of Alexander Galimov, Lokomotiv Yaroslavl marketing manager Ivjiny Chuev said that another memorial, this time specifically for Galimov, would be held on 13 07 September 2011. On 21 07 September 2011, Yak-Service had its operating licence revoked by Rosaviatsiya after an audit of flight operations of the airline and as a result of the crash. The first was that Yak-Service \"did not properly control the quality of mastering the aircraft\", finding that the crew did not train long enough on the Yak-42.",

Carthage was fighting a coalition of mutinous soldiers and rebellious African cities in the Mercenary War which had started in 240\u00a0BC. The three years of war that followed are known as the Mercenary War and threatened Carthage's existence as a state. The main rebel force blockaded Carthage from their stronghold of Tunis, while Mathos ordered two groups of rebels north to besiege the two main cities\u00a0\u2013 other than Carthage\u00a0\u2013 that had not already rebelled: the major ports of Utica and Hippo (modern Bizerte). In early 238\u00a0BC the lack of supplies forced Mathos to lift the close siege of Carthage; he maintained a more distant blockade from Tunis. The rebel field army which commenced the campaign is estimated to have been about 50,000 strong, leaving the 20,000-man balance of their force to continue blockading Carthage from their stronghold of Tunis.",

        "story": "The Battle of Mulhouse (German: M\u00fclhausen), also called the Battle of Alsace (Bataille d'Alsace), which began on 07 August 1914, was the opening attack of the World War I by the French Army against Germany. The battle was part of a French attempt to recover the province of Alsace, which France had ceded to the new German Empire following defeat in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870\u20131871. The French occupied Mulhouse on 8 August and were then forced out by German counter-attacks on 10 August 1914. On 26 August 1914, the French withdrew from Mulhouse to a more defensible line near Altkirch, to provide reinforcements for the French armies closer to Paris. In 1908, Moltke began to alter plans for operations on the left wing of the German armies against France and chose XIV Corps to protect Upper Alsace and several Landwehr brigades to secure the Upper Rhine. VII Corps, with the 14th and 41st divisions, a brigade of the 57th Reserve Division from Belfort and the 8th Cavalry Division, was detached from the First Army on 07 August 1914 for independent operations in southern Alsace. Mulhouse was recaptured on 10 August 1914 and Bonneau withdrew towards Belfort. The Germans were forced back from high ground west of Mulhouse on both banks of the Doller and into the Mulhouse suburbs, where a house-to-house battle took place. On 26 August 1914, the French withdrew from Mulhouse to a more defensible line near Altkirch, to provide reinforcements for the French armies closer to Paris and the 55th Landwehr Brigade re-occupied the town. The Army of Alsace was dissolved on 26 August 1914 and many of its units distributed among the remaining French armies. In 2009, Holger Herwig wrote that on 10 August 1914, the German Infantry Regiment 112 suffered 42 men killed, 163 wounded and 223 missing during the counter-attack on Mulhouse.",

The War of the Pacific was a conflict that pitted Chile against Peru and Bolivia. This event made Bolivian President Hilari\u00f3n Daza declare war on Chile, and also forced Peru to honor a secret 1873 treaty with Bolivia. Although Peru tried to negotiate and to stop the imminent conflict, Chile, knowing of this pact, declared war on both Peru and Bolivia on 5 April. On Saturday, the 24th of May, the Chilean Navy General Staff and the Naval High Command convened a special meeting about the events in Iquique and Punta Gruesa on 21 May 1879, and sent reports of the battles to the War Department in Santiago, resulting in a mass conscription draft being ordered in response. The Combate naval de iquique was a clear Peruvian victory; the blockade on Iquique was lifted and Chilean forces temporarily left the area. However, Peru's loss of the Independencia, one of its most powerful warships, in the following battle of Punta Gruesa was strategically costly, while Chile only lost one of its oldest wooden warships. Grau, now known as the \"Gentleman of the Seas\" due to his actions in the battle and later for his noble gesture toward Prat's widow and the surviving crewmembers, became honoured in both Peru and Chile as a gallant naval hero.",

For the first time, regional dominance in East Asia shifted from China to Japan; the prestige of the Qing dynasty, along with the classical tradition in China, suffered a major blow. In Korea, where much of the war took place, it is called the Qing\u2013Japan War (Korean: \uccad\uc77c\uc804\uc7c1; Hanja: \u6df8\u65e5\u6230\u722d). In May, the Chinese had taken steps to prepare for the mobilization of their forces in the provinces of Zhili, Shandong and in Manchuria, as a result of the tense situation on the Korean peninsula. But these actions were planned more as an armed demonstration to strengthen their position in Korea, rather than as preparation for war with Japan. The Beiyang Fleet was the dominant navy in East Asia before the First Sino-Japanese War. The army's Fifth Division would land at Chemulpo on the western coast of Korea, both to engage and push Chinese forces northwest up the peninsula and to draw the Beiyang Fleet into the Yellow Sea, where it would be engaged in decisive battle. On 01 August 1894, war was officially declared between China and Japan. China recognized the total independence of Korea and ceded the Liaodong Peninsula, Taiwan and Penghu County to Japan \"in perpetuity\". Japan asserts this move was taken independently of the treaty ending the war, and China asserts that they were implied as part of the cession of Taiwan. As a result of this war, Japan started to have equal status with the powers of the West, and the victory established Japan as the dominant power in Asia. Although Japan had achieved what it had set out to accomplish and ended Chinese influence over Korea, Japan had been forced to relinquish the Liaodong Peninsula, (Port Arthur), in exchange for an increased financial indemnity. Although that infuriated the Japanese, they were more concerned with the Russian encroachment in Korea than that in Manchuria. Negotiations between the two nations (1901\u20131904) to establish mutual recognition of respective spheres of influence (Russia over Manchuria and Japan over Korea) were repeatedly and intentionally stalled by the Russians.",

This was the only World Series from 1947 World Series to 1958 not to feature a New York team, and also the last World Series until 1957 not won by a New York team (which the Braves won over the Yankees, after they had relocated to Milwaukee).

        "story": "The Battle of Zama was fought in 202 BC near Zama Regia, now in Tunisia, and marked the end of the Second Punic War. A Roman Republic army led by Publius Cornelius Scipio, with crucial support from Numidian leader Masinissa, defeated the Carthage army led by Hannibal. The elephants opened the battle by charging the main Roman Republic army. The Roman Republic and Numidian cavalry subsequently defeated the Carthage cavalry and chased them from the battlefield. The Roman Republic second line joined the struggle and pushed back the Carthage assault. Masinissa was to be allowed to expand Numidia into parts of Africa. The Carthage senate recalled Hannibal, who was still in Italy (although confined to the south of the peninsula) when Scipio landed in Africa, in 203 BC. The battle took place at Zama Regia, near Siliana 130\u00a0km southwest of Tunis. At the outset of the battle, Hannibal unleashed his elephants and skirmishers against the Roman Republic troops in order to break the cohesion of their lines and exploit the breaches that could be opened. Scipio's plan to neutralize the threat of the elephants had worked; his troops then fell back into traditional Roman Republic battle formation. Laelius, the commander of the Roman Republic left wing, charged against the Carthage right. The Carthage cavalry, acting on the instructions of Hannibal, allowed the Roman Republic cavalry to chase them in order to lure them away from the battlefield so that they wouldn't attack the Carthage armies in the rear. Carthage cavalry carried out Hannibal's instructions well and there was no sign of Roman Republic cavalry on the battlefield. Once the Carthage cavalry was far enough away, they turned and attacked the Roman Republic cavalry but were eventually routed. The battle finally turned in the Romans' favor when the Roman Republic cavalry returned to the battlefield and attacked the Carthage line from behind. Soon after Scipio's victory at Zama Regia the war ended, with the Carthage senate suing for peace. When Rome waged war again on Carthage about 50 years later, the Carthaginians had little power and could not defeat the by-then very aged Masinissa in Africa.",

        "story": "The 2004 Madrid train bombings (also known in Spain as 11 de marzo de 2004) were nearly simultaneous, coordinated bombings against the Cercan\u00edas commuter train system of Madrid, Spain, on the morning of 11 March 2004 \u2013 three days before Spain's general elections. The bombings constituted the deadliest terrorist attack carried out in the history of Spain and the deadliest in Europe since the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland. During the peak of Madrid rush hour on the morning of Thursday, 11 March 2004, ten explosions occurred aboard four commuter trains (cercan\u00edas). All the affected trains were traveling on the same line and in the same direction between Alcal\u00e1 de Henares and the Atocha Railway Station station in Madrid. The total number of victims was higher than in any other terrorist attack in Spain, far surpassing the 21 killed and 40 wounded from a 1987 bombing at a Hipercor chain supermarket in Barcelona. On 27 May 2005, the Pr\u00fcm Convention, implementing inter alia the principle of availability which began to be discussed after the Madrid bombings, was signed by Germany, Spain, France, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Austria, and Belgium. On 4 January 2007, El Pa\u00eds reported that Algerian Ouhnane Daoud, who is considered to be the mastermind of the 11 de marzo de 2004 bombings, has been searching for ways to return to Spain to prepare further attacks, though this has not been confirmed. Although ETA has a history of mounting bomb attacks in Madrid, the 11 March 2004 attacks exceeded any attack previously attempted by a European organisation. Defenders of the claims that ETA participated in some form in the 11 March 2004 attacks have affirmed that there is circumstantial evidence linking the Islamic extremists with two ETA members who were detained while driving the outskirts of Madrid in a van containing 500\u00a0kg of explosives 11 days before the train bombings. At the time of the Madrid bombings, Spain was well equipped with internal security structures that were, for the most part, effective in the fight against terrorism.",

Brazilian Sign Language is well-established; several dictionaries, instructional videos and a number of articles on the linguistic features of the language have been published. A strong sign language law was passed by the National Congress of Brazil on April 24, 2002, and (in 2005) is in the process of being implemented. A master's in linguistics dissertation titled \"A arte de escrever em Libras\" by Gabriela Otaviani Barbosa found that SignWriting is used in 18 Federal Universities and in 12 public schools in Brazil. The History of SignWriting in Brazil appeared on TV INES in 2017: \"A Vida em Libras \u2013 SignWriting \u2013 Escrita de Sinais\".

        "story": "The Ming\u2013Kotte War was a military conflict between the expeditionary forces of the Chinese Ming Dynasty and the Sinhalese Kotte Kingdom in the southern territories of Sri Lanka. The conflict happened when Ming China's treasure fleet returned to Sri Lanka in 1410 or 1411 and resulted in the overthrow of King Alakeshvara, who was replaced by Parakramabahu VI of the previous royal family. During the Treasure voyages, a large Chinese fleet, led by Zheng He, arrived into local waters to establish Chinese control and stability of the maritime routes in the waters around Sri Lanka and southern India. Dreyer (2007) states that the confrontation against Alakeshvara in Sri Lanka most likely happened during the outward journey of the Chinese fleet in 1410, rather than the homeward journey in 1411, but he also notes that most authorities think that the confrontation happened during the homeward journey in 1411. After the third Ming treasure voyage, Zheng He returned to Nanjing on 1411 and presented the Sinhalese captives to the Yongle Emperor, who eventually decided to free Alakeshvara and return him to Sri Lanka. The Chinese treasure fleet experienced no hostilities during visits to Sri Lanka on subsequent Treasure voyages.",

The goals of the Seventh Crusade were to destroy the Ayyubid dynasty in Egypt and Syria, and to recapture Jerusalem. The ships of the Seventh Crusade, led by King Louis's brothers, Charles d'Anjou and Robert d'Artois, sailed from Aigues-Mortes and Marseille to Cyprus during the autumn of 1248, and then on to Egypt. The fall of Damietta caused a general emergency (called al-Nafir al-Am \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0641\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0645) to be declared, and locals from Cairo and from all over Egypt moved to the battle zone. At the subsequent Battle of Fariskur, the last major battle of the Seventh Crusade, the Crusader forces were annihilated and King Louis IX was captured on April 6. Meanwhile, the Crusaders were circulating false information in Europe, claiming that King Louis IX defeated the Sultan of Egypt in a great battle, and Cairo had been betrayed into Louis's hands. The Seventh Crusade's defeat in Egypt in 1250 marked a turning point for all the existing regional parties. The Seventh Crusade was the last major crusade against Egypt and the Crusaders never recaptured Jerusalem. Shortly after the defeat of the Seventh Crusade, the Ayyubid dynasty Sultan Turanshah was assassinated at Fariskur. The Mamluks, those who defended al-Mansurah and prevented Louis IX from advancing to Cairo, became the ruling power in Egypt, ending the Ayyubid dynasty rule in that country. Mamluk Egypt, Ayyubid dynasty Syria, Franks of Acre with their Christian strongholds on the Syrian coast, and the Levantine Christian Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia.",

The Kentucky Derby is a race for 3-year-old Thoroughbred horses. The 2016 field was determined by the Road to the Kentucky Derby points system that was first introduced in 2013. The Post Position Draw of the entries for the Kentucky Derby was held Wednesday, 2016 at the Churchill Downs Racetrack clubhouse. After the draw was made, the undefeated Nyquist was installed as the 3\u20131 morning line favorite. In spite of having been undefeated in his seven previous races and having already defeated several of the other entries, including second-favorite Exaggerator, Nyquist was viewed as vulnerable, in part because of the statistical improbability of the race favorite winning for four years in a row. At the start, Danzing Candy quickly took the lead and held onto it for seven furlongs (4,600\u00a0ft; 1,400\u00a0m) until fading. At the top of the stretch, Gun Runner, who had been running second or third throughout, briefly took the lead but was quickly surpassed by Nyquist. Nyquist held him off to win the race by \u200b1\u00a01\u20444 lengths. Nyquist was the eighth undefeated winner in Kentucky Derby history, the first since Big Brown in 2008. Times: \u200b1\u20444 mile \u2013 0:22.58; \u200b1\u20442 mile \u2013 0:45.72; \u200b3\u20444 mile \u2013 1:10.40; mile \u2013 1:36.51; final \u2013 2:01.31.",

The 1986 FIBA World Basketball Championship in Madrid was broadcast on Ted Turner's network and were thus classified as the official Goodwill Games event for the men's sport.

Russia recognised Abkhazia on 26 August 2008, following the August 2008 South Ossetia war. Abkhazia and Russia established diplomatic relations on 9 September 2008. On 25 August 2008 President of Abkhazia Sergei Bagapsh made a presentation to the Federation Council of Russia. Many high level Russian politicians including Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, Deputy Prime Minister Sergey Ivanov, Chairman of the State Duma Boris Gryzlov, Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey Lavrov, Permanent Representative of Russia to the United Nations Vitaly Churkin and Permanent Representative of Russia to NATO Dmitry Rogozin, rejected the criticism, and have stated that Russian recognition of Abkhazia is irreversible. As a result of the Russian recognition of Abkhazian and South Ossetian independence, Georgia severed diplomatic relations with Russia on 29 August 2008, and declared that it regards South Ossetia and Abkhazia as occupied territories. Russia and Abkhazia established diplomatic relations at embassy level on 9 September 2008, when Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Abkhaz Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergei Shamba exchanged notes at the Russian Foreign Ministry in Moscow. Igor Akhba, the Plenipotentiary Representative of the President of the Abkhazia to Russia was appointed by Sergei Bagapsh as Abkhazia's first ambassador to Russia on 14 November 2008. On 1 May 2009, Russia's embassy to Abkhazia was opened in Sukhumi. Russia plans on opening up a trade mission in Abkhazia in order to ease access to the local economy for Russian businesses.",

        "story": "The 2009 North Korean nuclear test was the underground nuclear weapons test of a nuclear device conducted on Monday, 25 May 2009 by the North Korea. North Korea (officially the North Korea, or DPRK) had threatened to conduct a second nuclear test in protest after the United Nations Security Council adopted a presidential statement condemning the country after it launched a rocket, which it claimed was carrying the Kwangmy\u014fngs\u014fng-2 satellite, on 5 April 2009. The state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) released an announcement claiming, in part, that: The North Korea successfully conducted one more underground nuclear test on 25 May 2009 as part of the measures to bolster up its nuclear deterrent for self-defence in every way as requested by its scientists and technicians. Geophysical Service of the Russian Academy of Sciences has registered underground nuclear explosion conducted in North Korea on 25 May 2009. The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists asserted that the blast was more powerful than the 2006 North Korean nuclear test, though put the yield between 2 and 6 kilotons, but likely less than 4 kilotons and far short of a Hiroshima-type device. However, after the subsequent nuclear test in 2013 North Korean nuclear test, the Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources, a state-run geology research institute in Germany, estimated the yield ranging from a minimum of 5 kilotons to the maximum of 12 kilotons and the 2006 North Korean nuclear test ranging from minimum of 700 tons to the maximum of 2 kilotons instead with relevant statistics. On 26 25 May 2009, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported, citing officials, that North Korea fired three more short-range missiles off an east-coast base, one ground-to-ship missile and one surface-to-air missile. By 27 25 May 2009, at least five short range missiles were launched by North Korea. Another short-range missile was fired off North Korea's east coast on 28 25 May 2009. On 29 25 May 2009, U.S. officials said that satellite photos revealed vehicle activity at two sites in North Korea suggesting that North Korean military might be preparing to launch a long-range ballistic missile. Yonhap news agency reported on 2 June 2009 that North Korea was readying as many as three medium-range missiles (according to some analysts, Rodong missiles) at a missile base in Anbyon region, Gangwon Province, northeast of the capital of Pyongyang. On 28 May, North Korea threatened to end the Korean War armistice, stating that \"the Korean peninsula will go back to a state of war\", whereupon the joint military command of South Korea and the United States increased its surveillance alert level from WATCHCON 3 to WATCHCON 2, the second-highest level of surveillance alert.",

The Jitra position was still in an extremely poor condition on 8 13 December 1941 and Murray-Lyon needed time to complete the defences. British Malaya Command came up with a secondary plan to delay the Japanese; three mini-Matadors (Krohcol, Laycol and an armoured train), that would hopefully keep the Japanese away from Jitra long enough for Murray-Lyon to get his defences in shape. After the Japanese invasion of Thailand with the landings at Singora and Patani on 8 13 December 1941, they attacked toward north-west British Malaya. By late afternoon of 11 December 1941, Murray-Lyon had lost the better part of three battalions and was now without any reserve units to commit to the main battle. With the survivors of Garrett's two battalions streaming through the 11th Indian Division and his line of retreat threatened by the Japanese advance south of Jitra at Kroh, Murray-Lyon requested permission from British Malaya Command to retire from Jitra to a position he had already selected about 30\u00a0mi (48\u00a0km) south at Gurun. Murray-Lyon was told that the battle must be fought out at Jitra. The withdrawal from Jitra on the night of 12/13 December 1941 was when the 11th Indian Division incurred most of its casualties.",

Tagesschau (literally \"Day's Show\", or loosely \"(Re)view of the Day\"; a play on the term Wochenschau, the weekly newsreel formerly shown in cinemas) is both the oldest and the most watched news program on German television. The first edition was transmitted on Nordwestdeutscher Rundfunk (North-Western German Broadcasting) on 26 December 1952. Currently, the bulletin is produced by NDR (Northern German Broadcasting) through ARD-aktuell (the ARD's news department) from its studios in Hamburg. The program's trademark continues to be the eight o'clock chime followed by a recorded announcement, spoken by Claudia Urbschat-Mingues, \"Hier ist das Erste Deutsche Fernsehen mit der Tagesschau\" (\"This is First German Television with the Tagesschau\"). \u2020 The person who is/was currently or previously anchoring in the main 15-minute newscast of Tagesschau. The long-term study of the Otto Brenner Stiftung by Hans-J\u00fcrgen Arlt and Wolfgang Storz from March 2010 on \"Business Journalism during the crisis - The mass media handling of the financial market policy\" analyzed working methods of the news broadcasts from 1999 to fall 2009, especially in news formats like Tagesschau and Tagesthemen. In September 2014, following a critical review from the editorial council (Programmbeirat), ARD-aktuell stated: \"Criticism of our news-coverage respecting the Ukraine has caused an echo on a hitherto unprecedented scale\". In the case of the 2017 murder of 15-year-old Mia V. by an Afghan refugee, unlike other German TV news broadcasters, ARD Tagesschau did not report the case at first.",

The village of Pozi\u00e8res, on the Albert\u2013Bapaume road, lies atop a ridge approximately in the centre of what was the British sector of the Somme battlefield. Consequently, the attack on Pozi\u00e8res once more fell in line with the Fourth Army's attack on the22 Julyi23 July22\u201323 July 1916. Success on the Somme came at a cost which at times seemed to surpass the cost of failure, and for the Australians, Pozi\u00e8res was such a case. As a consequence of being the sole British gain on 23 July 1916, Pozi\u00e8res became a focus of attention for the Germans. When the Australian ordeal on Pozi\u00e8res ridge was over in September, they were replaced by the Canadian Corps who held the sector for the remainder of the battle. After the battle it became apparent that General Birdwood had lost much of his Gallipoli popularity through his failure to oppose Gough's impetuous desire for \"quick results\" and his \"lack of thought\" at Pozi\u00e8res.",

        "story": "Swissair Flight 111 was a scheduled international passenger flight from John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City, United States, to Cointrin International Airport in Geneva, Switzerland. On 02 September 1998, the McDonnell Douglas MD-11 performing this flight, registration HB-IWF, crashed into the Atlantic Ocean southwest of Halifax Stanfield International Airport at the entrance to St. Margarets Bay, Nova Scotia. All 229 passengers and crew on board the MD-11 were killed, making the crash the deadliest McDonnell Douglas MD-11 accident in aviation history. The aircraft, a seven-year-old McDonnell Douglas MD-11, serial number 48448, registration HB-IWF, was manufactured in 1991, and Swissair was its only operator. The flight took off from New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport at 20:18 EDT (00:18 UTC) on 02 September 1998. The cockpit voice recorder (CVR) and flight data recorder (FDR) were found by the submarine HMCS\u00a0Okanagan using sonar to detect the underwater locator beacon signals and were quickly retrieved by Canadian Navy divers (the FDR on 6 September and the CVR on 11 02 September 1998). The material was then transported to CFB Shearwater, where it was sorted and inspected by over 350\u00a0investigators from multiple organizations and companies, including the Transportation Safety Board of Canada (TSB), the US National Transportation Safety Board, the US Federal Aviation Administration, the Swiss Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau, Boeing, Pratt & Whitney, Air Line Pilots Association, and Swissair. One is to the east of the crash site at The Whalesback, a promontory 1 kilometre (0.62\u00a0mi; 0.54\u00a0nmi) north of Peggy's Cove. The crash of Flight 111 was a severe blow to Swissair, particularly as the in-flight entertainment system that was blamed for causing the accident had been installed on the aircraft to attract more passengers, in order to ease the airline's financial difficulties. After the crash of Flight 111, the flight designator for Swissair's New York\u2013Geneva route was changed to SR139, although the route was still operated by MD-11 aircraft. Following the bankruptcy of Swissair in 2002, their international traffic rights were passed to Crossair who began operating flights as Swiss International Air Lines, changing the flight designator for the New York\u2013Geneva route to LX023. As of April 2018, this flight continues to operate between New York's JFK airport and Geneva International Airport using the Airbus A330-300.",

        "story": "The Battle of Vitebsk, sometimes spelled Witepsk, was a military engagement that took place on 26 July 1812 and 27 July 1812 during the French invasion of Russia. The battle put a French force, under the command of Emperor Napoleon I, in combat with Russian Empire rearguard forces under General Petr Konovnitsyn (on 26 July 1812) and Peter von der Pahlen (on 27 July 1812) and ended with the Russian Empire forces making a strategic retreat from the battlefield. The battle occurred as Napoleon was trying to envelop the Russian Empire First Army at Vitebsk and force them to accept battle. The commander of the Russian Empire First Army, General Michael Andreas Barclay de Tolly, was himself aiming to fight and thus massed the bulk of his forces at Vitebsk, even though he was aware that his chances to win against Napoleon were not good. The fighting on 26 July 1812 had General Konovnitsyn's rearguard division fighting elements of the French IV Corps and ended with the Russians managing to delay the enemy for the entire day, allowing the bulk of the army to mass at Vitebsk. Unbeknownst to Napoleon, the Russian Empire army retreated during the afternoon and night, which meant that the Emperor's plans for a major battle collapsed. During the early stages of the French invasion of Russia, Emperor Napoleon I sought to force the Russian Empire army to commit the bulk of its forces to a major battle, in order to defeat it and thus avoid a protracted campaign. The French were thus unable to make contact with the bulk of the Russian Empire forces on 26 July 1812. Despite these considerations, Barclay still wanted to give battle the next day and was only dissuaded from doing so by his advisers, late on 26 July 1812. The battle is often seen by French historians as a missed opportunity for Napoleon, who failed to press Pahlen hard and thus render the Russian Empire retreat difficult.",

It was hosted by Brazil national under-17 football team between 26 October 2019 and 17 November 2019. A formal announcement on 2019 ratified the recommendation to move the tournament to Brazil national under-17 football team. With the ratification to name Brazil national under-17 football team as host, this marked the country's first time to host a FIFA youth competition, having previously hosted the senior World Cup twice as well as the 2000 FIFA Club World Championship, the 2008 FIFA Futsal World Cup, the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, and numerous editions of the FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup. Brazil national under-17 football team won their fourth U-17 World Cup title, winning 2\u20131 against Mexico in the final, which was also the first time in the history that Brazil national under-17 football team won a FIFA World Cup tournament at home soil. The bidding process to host the 2019 FIFA U-20 World Cup and the 2019 FIFA U-17 World Cup was launched by FIFA in June 2017. FIFA then unanimously announced Peru as the host country after the FIFA Council meeting on 16 in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia. On 2019, FIFA announced that the tournament would be moved to a yet-to-be-determined host after inspection visits found issues with the prepared infrastructure and organization in Peru. CONMEBOL reinforced the idea by claiming that, because of the preparation for the 2019 Copa Am\u00e9rica, which was scheduled to start in less than four months, Brazil national under-17 football team would be the only one able to make the commitment in such a short time. Brazil national under-17 football team was confirmed as the new host by the FIFA Council on 2019. The final draw was held on 2019, 15:00 CEST (UTC+2), at the FIFA headquarters in Zurich, Switzerland. Hosts Brazil national under-17 football team were automatically seeded into Pot 1 and assigned to position A1, while the remaining teams were seeded into their respective pots based on their results in the last five FIFA U-17 World Cups (more recent tournaments weighted more heavily), with bonus points awarded to confederation champions.",

It is a critical event in Ethiopia history because N\u0259gus\u00e4 N\u00e4g\u00e4st (or Emperor) Yohannes IV was killed in this battle, and because it was the last major battle on the Ethiopia front of the Mahdist War. The fighting occurred at the site of the twin settlements of Gallabat (in modern Sudan) and Metemma (in modern Ethiopia), so both names are commonly used and either can be argued to be correct. As a result, the United Kingdom, who had taken over the government of Egypt, negotiated the Treaty of Adowa with Emperor Yohannes IV of Ethiopia on 3 June 1884 whereby the Egyptian garrisons were allowed to evacuate to Massawa through Ethiopia territory. The twin communities of Gallabat and Metemma were located on the trade route from the Nile to Gondar, the old Imperial capital; the Mahdists used these communities as their base for attacks on Ethiopia. In response, that next year the Mahdists under Abu Anga campaigned out of Metemma into Ethiopia; their objective was the town of Gondar. The Sudan gathered an army of 85,000 and fortified themselves in Gallabat, surrounding the town with a huge zariba, a barrier made of entwined thorn bushes, replicating the effect of barbed wire. On 8 10 March 1889 the Ethiopia army arrived within sight of Gallabat, and the attack began in earnest the next day.",

Delays caused by hastily-organised German reinforcements at Nijmegen ultimately led to the failure of Operation Market Garden. These would quickly seize several crucial bridges across major rivers, after which the heavy armour could advance straight through the Netherlands, along Eindhoven, Nijmegen and Arnhem, and reach the Ruhr, where a vital part of Germany's war industry was located. At about 18:00 on 17 September 1944, the 1st Battalion, 508th PIR (1/508th) left its half-dug trenches at Groesbeek and advanced towards Nijmegen to take the Road Bridge. A rapid advance from Nijmegen to Arnhem to retake the bridge, was blocked by a combination of factors, including sunset, unfamiliarity with the terrain ahead (the Betuwe), German reinforcements near Ressen coming from Arnhem (3 Tiger tanks and 2 infantry companies), ongoing firefights and chaos in Nijmegen, and continuous logistical problems on \"Operation Market Garden\", due to events such as the German counterattacks near Veghel. The Supreme Court of the Netherlands, which the Germans temporarily moved from The Hague to Nijmegen in 1943, was partially purged after the liberation.",

The oil spill occurred in the Guimaras Strait that connects the Visayan Sea with the Sulu Sea, and is considered a rich fishing ground that supplies most of the demand for the entire country. President Gloria Arroyo ordered a full investigation into the country's worst oil spill that devastated marine ecosystems in the central Philippines. On October 11, 2019, Mongabay presented how Guimaras was able to rise above the worst oil spill in the Philippines.",

Davis of West Virginia and the Progressive Party\u2019s Senator Robert M. La Follette of Wisconsin. Calvin Coolidge, a traditional Yankee Republican born in neighboring Vermont, had served as a popular former Governor of Massachusetts, and thus easily was able to dominate the state on the presidential level. The economic boom and social good feelings of the Roaring Twenties under popular Republican leadership virtually guaranteed Calvin Coolidge an easy win in the state against the conservative Southern Democrat John Davis, who had little appeal in Northern states like Massachusetts.",

The Li\u00e8ge Revolution was concurrent with the French Revolution and its effects were long-lasting and eventually led to the abolition of the Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge and its final annexation by French revolutionary forces in 1795. This event, and the long trial which resulted, were the pretext for a rise in opposition to Hoensbroeck, then the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789 provided the final trigger for Li\u00e8ge's own revolution. The Holy Roman Empire's tribunal condemned the Li\u00e8ge Revolution and ordered the re-imposition of the ancien r\u00e9gime in the principality. A 'D\u00e9claration des droits de l'homme et du citoyen de Franchimont' was also adopted on 1789 \u2013 though largely inspired by France's Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen (voted into law 20 days earlier), it did contain some significant differences: From 1789 to April 1790 the Prussians occupied the city of Li\u00e8ge and other major towns in the principality, having been put in charge of mediating between the revolutionaries and the Lower Rhenish\u2013Westphalian Circle. According to him, the former principality of Li\u00e8ge had decided to split from the Holy Roman Empire and thus had no other solution available but to merge with France. The 1789 Li\u00e8ge revolution explains the disagreement between the inhabitants of Li\u00e8ge and their French occupiers and the differences in the treatment of its inhabitants by the French. Both revolutions began in 1789 and in Hasquin's interpretation the Li\u00e8ge Revolution continued after the prince-bishop's temporary return \u2013 he sees a second phase with the entry of French revolutionary troops into Li\u00e8ge in 1792, and a third phase in 1794 with the French's second return.

        "story": "Durga Puja (pronounced\u00a0), also called Durgotsava(\u09a6\u09c1\u09b0\u09cd\u0997\u09cb\u09ce\u09b8\u09ac) (pronounced\u00a0), is an annual Hindu festival originating in the Indian subcontinent which reveres and pays homage to the Hindu goddess, Durga. Durga puja is also referred to by the names of related Shakta Hindu festivals such as Navaratri, celebrated on the same days elsewhere in India; such as in Bihar, Jharkhand, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Kerala, and Maharashtra, Kullu dussehra, celebrated in Kullu Valley, Himachal Pradesh; Mysore dussehra celebrated in Mysore, Karnataka; Bommai golu, celebrated in Tamil Nadu; Bommala koluvu, celebrated in Andhra Pradesh; and Bathukamma, celebrated in Telangana. This probably signifies the Hindu belief that the goddess is \"not merely the power inherent in the growth of crops but the power inherent in all vegetation\".The festival is a social and public event in eastern and northeastern states of India, where it dominates religious and socio-cultural life, with temporary pandals built at community squares, roadside shrines, and temples. The Rajputs of Rajasthan worship their weapons and horses in the related festival of Navaratri, and some historically observed the sacrifice of a goat, a practice that continues in some places. Yet, this festival of Bengal is likely much older with the discovery of 11th and 12th-century Durga puja manual manuscripts such as Durgotsavaviveka, Durgotsava Prayoga, Vasantaviveka and Kalaviveka.",

From 1935 to 1953 the race was run every year on March, the feast of patron Saint Joseph, hence the press in predominantly Catholic Italy gave it its other nickname, la Gara di San Giuseppe (Saint Joseph's Race). In 2009 Milan \u2013 San Remo the 100th edition of Milan \u2013 San Remo was held, won by British sprinter Mark Cavendish on his first attempt. In 2017 Milan\u2013San Remo Micha\u0142 Kwiatkowski became the first Polish winner of Milan \u2013 San Remo in a three-up sprint finish with world champion Peter Sagan and Julian Alaphilippe after the trio broke clear on the race's final climb\u00a0\u2013 the Poggio di San Remo. The 2020 Milan \u2013 San Remo was forced to move to August due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy, making it the first ever summer edition of the Spring classic.

She was escorted by the France Navy ironclad Couronne, whose mission was to ensure that the ensuing battle occurred outside the France harbor. Men aboard USS Kearsarge spotted the incoming Confederate raider, so they turned their ship around to take the impending battle out of France territorial waters. The battle continued in this manner for several minutes; in the meantime, on the France coast, hundreds watched the battle. Although it now lies in France territorial waters, the U.S. government claimed possession of it on the grounds that Alabama had struck to Kearsarge and that the location had not been within France territorial waters at the time of the battle. On 3 October 1989, France and the United States of America signed an agreement recognising the wreck as a common historic heritage for both nations and established a joint scientific team for its exploration.",

In a letter from the imperial Generalwachtmeister, Freiherr von Wendt, dated 16 July 1641, to the mayor and town council of Recklinghausen, he demanded the following supplies for the provision of his soldiers outside Dorsten: 3,000 pounds of bread, 16 tonnes of beer, four head of cattle, 15 sacks of oats and several \"kitchen items\". The siege ended on 19 September 1641. The Theatrum Europaeum recorded that the town of Dorsten had become a \"lamentable ruin\" as a result of the siege.",

Two heavily armed divisions of the Slovak State (1939-1945), together with the entire eastern Slovak Air Force, were deliberately relocated to Pre\u0161ov in north-eastern Slovakia in the summer of 1944 to execute one of two planned options to begin the uprising. On 23 29 August 1944, Romania, initially Slovakia's ally, changed sides in favor of the Allies. The next day, German troops began to occupy Slovakia to put down the rebellion. At 19:00 hours on 29 August 1944, Slovak Defence Minister General Ferdinand \u010catlo\u0161 announced on state radio that Nazi Germany had occupied Slovakia. The western advance of Soviet forces came to a sudden halt in late 28 October 1944, when Stalin's interests focused on Hungary, Austria and Poland rather than Slovakia or the Czech lands. On 28 October 1944, Viest sent London a message that said the organized resistance during World War II had ended. 29 August 1944 is a national holiday in Slovakia.",

After punishing the officers in charge of the naval contingent for their lax discipline, Scipio and the Roman Republic army wintered at Colonia Iulia Urbs Triumphalis Tarraco.

The term POSIX sockets is essentially synonymous with Berkeley sockets, but they are also known as Berkeley Software Distribution sockets, acknowledging the first implementation in the Berkeley Software Distribution. As the Berkeley socket API evolved and ultimately yielded the POSIX socket API, certain functions were deprecated or removed and replaced by others. In general, they include: The Berkeley socket API typically provides the following functions: The function socket() creates an endpoint for communication and returns a file descriptor for the socket. Historically, in Berkeley Software Distribution-derived systems, the state of a socket descriptor is undefined if the call to connect fails (as it is specified in the Single Unix Specification), thus, portable applications should close the socket descriptor immediately and obtain a new descriptor with socket(), in the case the call to connect() fails. These functions are not strictly a component of the Berkeley Software Distribution socket API, but are often used in conjunction with the API functions.

The Parliament Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom 1949 provides that the Parliament Act 1911 and the Parliament Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom 1949 are to be construed together \"as one\" in their effects and that the two Acts may be cited together as the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949. The 1911 Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom made clear that the life of a parliament could not be extended without the consent of the Lords. Parliament had been limited to a maximum of seven years under the Septennial Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom 1716, but the Parliament Act 1911 amended the Septennial Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom to limit Parliament to five years, reckoned from the first meeting of Parliament after the election. The challenge asserted that the 1949 Parliament Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom was delegated rather than primary legislation, and that the 1911 Parliament Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom had delegated power to the Commons. Since it was passed under the 1911 Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom, the 1949 Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom had never received the required consent of the Lords. The 1911 Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom, it concluded, was not primarily about empowering the Commons, but rather had the purpose of restricting the ability of the Lords to reject legislation.",

At the town of Solomonville, in southern Arizona, journalist Lauro Aguirre and Flores Chapa established the anti-D\u00edaz newspaper El Independiente, and on 1896, they wrote the Plan Restaurador de Constitucion y Reformista. In 1896, the United States government arrested Aguirre and Chapa because the Mexican consul accused them of conspiring to re-enter Mexico and engage in revolutionary actions, but both of the men were acquitted in federal court after the United States of America consul's investigation concluded that they were innocent of any wrongdoing. Heroica Nogales, Sonora, and Heroica Nogales, Arizona are immediately opposite each other on the U.S.\u2013Mexico border, so on August 12, when the Teresitas attacked, the Mexican consulate, Manuel Mascarena, requested aid from the Americans in or around the United States of America Heroica Nogales.

Scott Dixon driving for Chip Ganassi Racing won the first unified title for 13 years after completing the IndyCar Series\u2013Indy 500 double. On 2008, Robin Miller reported that Tony George had offered to Champ Car management a proposal that included free cars and engine leases to Champ Car teams willing to run the entire 2008 IndyCar Series season schedule in exchange for adding Champ Car's dates at Long Beach, Toronto, Edmonton, Mexico City, and Australia to the IndyCar Series schedule, effectively reuniting American open wheel racing. In an effort to enhance full-time participation, the IndyCar Series announced a revenue sharing plan entitled IndyCar Series TEAM (Team Enhancement and Allocation Matrix) for 2008. The following open tests were held: The original 16 race schedule, which was released on September 16, 2007 IndyCar Series season, became a 19 race schedule (18 championship and 1 Non-Championship) on 2008. Points were awarded for the 2008 IndyCar Series season championship to those drivers and teams which moved to the IndyCar Series under the open wheel racing unification agreement between the owners of CCWS and the IRL. At 19 years, 93 days old, Rahal became the youngest driver ever to win an Indy-style race, as well as the youngest winner in IndyCar Series history. He also became the fourth driver to win an IndyCar Series race in his first start, joining Buzz Calkins, Juan Pablo Montoya and Scott Dixon. Teams which raced in ChampCars in 2007 IndyCar Series season stayed in North America for the 34th annual Long Beach Grand Prix, while teams which planned to compete in the IndyCar Series before the merger raced at Motegi. All participants entering other IndyCar Series races earned points towards the 2008 IndyCar Series season championship. Wheldon pulled away and led the final 49 laps to record his first IndyCar Series victory since April 2007 IndyCar Series season.",

As a result, Air France flights to Algeria had crews entirely made of people who volunteered for the route. Air France had asked government officials if it absolutely had to continue flying to Algeria; by the time of the hijacking, they had not received a reply. On 24 26 December 1994, at Algiers Houari Boumediene Airport in Algiers, four armed men boarded Air France Flight 8969 which was due to depart for Orly Airport, Paris at 11:15\u00a0am. They had aircraft hijacking the aircraft because the national airline Air France was a symbol of France, which they viewed as infidel foreign invaders. At 8:00\u00a0pm, Groupe d'Intervention de la Gendarmerie Nationale (GIGN) operatives boarded an Airbus A300 aircraft similar to F-GBEC, the aircraft hijacking plane, at a military base in France. New information arrived at the Consulate General of France in Oran, Algeria, via a mole in the GIA: We received this information directly from members of the Algerian secret service. Just before midnight, Balladur told the President of Algeria, Liamine Z\u00e9roual, that France was ready to receive the Air France flight. Delhemme confronted Yahia to find out whether he planned to blow up the aircraft between Algiers and Marseille. The aircraft approached Marseille during the early hours of 26 December 1994. Steward Claude Burgniard said that the hijackers felt that the landing in Marseille was a \"magic moment\" as they had arrived in France.",

Tennessee then responded by scoring 16 consecutive points to tie the game with 2:12 left in regulation---it was the largest deficit to be erased in a Super Bowl at the time and the first greater than 10 points.

The championship is one of the oldest, still-promoted female professional wrestling championship, preceded only by the NWA World Women's Championship that was created in 1954 while the first Mexican women's champion was crowned in 1955. The championship lineage from 1959 until the Mexico City ban on women's wrestling was lifted in Mexico City in 1986 is unclear and was undocumented for a long period of time. (the Mexico City Boxing and Wrestling Commission) started licensing female wrestlers to work in Mexico City and officially recognized Reyna Gallegos as the \"Mexican National Women's Champion\", based on the fact that she was the reigning Mexican Women's Champion, adopting the lineage of the championship retroactively. Unlike most championships that belong to a specific promotion the Mexican National Women's Championship was not owned by a single promotion, instead, promoters holding shows in Mexico City could petition the commission to have the champion work on their show. It is her first reign with the title, she is the 22nd champion since the Mexico City Boxing and Wrestling Commission sanctioned the championship, and the 31st documented champion overall. Later CMLL announced that she actually had joint citizenship in Puerto Rico and Mexico after she won the championship in 2015.",

        "story": "Battle of Pungdo or Feng-tao (Japanese: Hoto-oki kaisen (\u8c4a\u5cf6\u6c96\u6d77\u6226)) was the first naval battle of the First Sino-Japanese War. It took place on 25 July 1894 off Asan, Chungcheongnam-do, Korea, between cruisers of the Imperial Japanese Navy and components of the Chinese Beiyang Fleet. Both China and Japan had been intervening in Korea against the Donghak Peasant Revolution. While China tried to maintain her suzerain relationship with Korea, Japan wanted to increase her sphere of influence. The troops destined for Korea sailed on board three steamers chartered by the Chinese government, and arrived in Asan on June 9. Planning to strengthen their forces in Korea, the Imperial Japanese Navy redeployed the main component of the Combined Fleet to Korean waters, since the ships stationed there at the time, Yaeyama, Musashi and \u014cshima, were considered insufficient to prevent Chinese reinforcements from landing at Asan, and, in the event of hostilities breaking out, would not be able to provide support to Japanese troops on the Korean peninsula. Captain Fang Boqian received word of the Japanese actions in Seoul and Chempulo from the commander of Weiyuan, and on 25 July 1894 immediately sent Irene and Fei Ching back to Dagu, while Weiyuan was ordered back to Weihaiwei to inform Admiral Ding Ruchang of the situation unfolding in Korea. The Chinese cruiser Jiyuan and torpedo gunboat Kwang-yi, in port in Asan since 23 July, left on the morning of 25 July 1894 to rendezvous with the troopship Kowshing and gunboat Tsao-kiang, which were en route from Tianjin.",
