        "story": "The Barbary Wars were a series of two wars fought by the United States of America and Sweden against the Barbary states (including Tunis, Algiers, and Tripoli) of North Africa in the early 19th century. Sweden had been at war with the Tripolitans since 1800 and was joined by the newly-independent US. The First Barbary War extended from 1801 to 10 June 1805, with the Second Barbary War lasting only three days, ending on 1815. Lasting only three days, the second conflict ended the need for further tributes by the United States of America, granted the U.S. full shipping rights in the Mediterranean Sea, and significantly reduced incidents of piracy in the region. The First Barbary War (1801\u20131805), also known as the Tripolitian War or the Barbary Coast War, was the first of two wars fought between the alliance of the United States of America and several European countries against the Northwest African Muslim states known collectively as the Barbary states. These were Tripoli and Algiers, which were quasi-independent entities nominally belonging to the Ottoman Empire, and (briefly) the independent Alaouite of Morocco. A U.S. naval fleet was sent on 1801, at the beginning of the war under the command of Commodore Richard Dale. The Second Barbary War (1815), also known as the Algerine or Algerian War, was the second of two wars fought between the United States of America and the Ottoman Empire's North African regencies of Tripoli, Tunis and Algeria, known collectively as the Barbary states. The war between the Barbary States and the U.S. ended in 1815; the international dispute would effectively be ended the following year by the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. In the 21st century, the United States of America again conducted military operation in the North African area, specifically participating in the intervention against the government of Libya, and this operation has sometimes been termed in the media as the continuation of the previous Barbary Wars and given the name \"Third Barbary War\".",

        "story": "The First Quarter Storm (Filipino: Sigwa ng Unang Sangkapat), often shortened into the acronym FQS, was a period of civil unrest in the Philippines which took place during the \"first quarter of the year 1970.\" It included a series of demonstration, protests, and marches against the administration of President Ferdinand Marcos, mostly organized by students, from January 26 to 1970. The KM had since been active in various rallies and demonstration such as those condemning the Laurel-Langley agreement, Parity Amendments, Mutual Defense treaty, the state visit of South Vietnam Premier Cao Ky in 1966, the state visit of President Marcos to the U.S., the Oct. 24, 1966 Manila Summit conference, the killings of Filipinos in American bases, and the visit of President Nixon\u2014events which they believe contribute to the feudalistic nature of the country. On October 24, KM held a demonstration in front of Manila Hotel to protest against American involvement in Vietnam which resulted in a violent dispersal. While the period from January to 1970 was one of significant social unrest in the Philippines and there is no definitive record of all protests or demonstration in the country, seven protests in the area of Metropolitan Manila have come to be considered the historically notable demonstration of the time, even being branded the \"7 deadly protests of the First Quarter Storm\" in some media accounts. The beginning of what is now known as the \"First Quarter Storm\" was marked by a demonstration in 1970, at the opening of the Seventh Congress, during which President Ferdinand Marcos gave his fifth State of the Nation Address (SONA). After the violence of the Battle of Mendiola, the Movement for a Democratic Philippines (MDP) organized a rally at the Plaza Miranda outside the Quiapo Church on 1970. Militants organized a second \"People\u2019s March\" on March 17, in what would come to be recognized as the last major demonstration during the First Quarter Storm proper. The March 17 demonstration is generally acknowledged as the last of the major events of the First Quarter Storm, because the demonstration had largely been led by student groups, who had at that point reached the end of the Philippines' school semester. The First Quarter Storm was followed by a year of demonstration, varying from picketing, long marches, live theater, people's tribunal, and parliament of the streets.",

        "story": "The 1988 Brazilian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on 03 April 1988, at the renamed Aut\u00f3dromo Internacional Nelson Piquet in Rio de Janeiro. Ferrari had dominated the pre-season tests in Rio with times that were not only faster than everyone else, but faster than had been recorded at the 1987 Brazilian Grand Prix, prompting rumors that the team had either shut off the FIA's mandatory pop-off valve which in 1988 Formula One season limited turbo boost pressure to just 2.5 Bar, or more likely were running the 1987 Brazilian Grand Prix valve which had a 4.0 Bar limit (most of the team engineers agreed that in 1988 Formula One season the turbo engines had lost approximately 300\u00a0bhp (224\u00a0kW; 304\u00a0PS) due to the reduction in boost). The rumors were renewed during qualifying in Brazil when neither Michele Alboreto nor Gerhard Berger could get near their test times from a month earlier and both drivers complained of engines that were down on power, too thirsty and had poor throttle response out of the slower corners. During the qualifying session, there was controversy when Nelson Piquet made comments in the local media publicly insulting Ayrton Senna, though he later claimed he did not know he was talking to a journalist and was forced to withdraw his allegation under threat of a lawsuit (over time, these insults by Piquet \u2013 with the aid of Alain Prost \u2013 also extended to claims that Senna was homosexual, particularly given his failed marriage in 1982; as it transpired in a 1990 interview of Senna by Brazilian edition of Playboy the gay claim may have been motivated by the fact that Senna had apparently had a relationship with Piquet's wife when she was single). The second row was occupied by Gerhard Berger's Ferrari and Alain Prost's McLaren.",

The winner of the contest was Vincenzo Cantiello, who represented Italy with the song \"Tu primo grande amore\". On 18 December 2013, the Maltese national broadcaster Public Broadcasting Services (PBS) and the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) announced that the Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2014 would take place in Malta.

Vladislav Yakovlev, the executive supervisor for the Junior Eurovision Song Contest, announced that there would be no host city for the contest, but that the island of Malta would be a host island instead. On 2014, the EBU confirmed that the 2014 contest would be held at three large former shipbuilding sheds of Malta Shipbuilding. On 2014, Anton Attard, CEO of the host broadcaster, revealed the Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2014 logo and slogan. On 2014, it was announced that Moira Delia would host the 2014 contest. During the Heads of Delegations meeting in Malta on 2014, the broadcaster PBS along with the production team sought permission to change the running order rule, which was to allow the artists to randomly select their position number (a system used in 2013). A pre-draw to decide the order in which countries would select their running order halves, took place on 2014, hosted by Moira Delia, Vladislav Yakovlev, and Gaia Cauchi. Vincenzo Cantiello who represented Italy with the song \"Tu primo grande amore\", was declared the winner after all the votes had been cast from all of the sixteen participating countries and the kids jury. Junior Eurovision Song Contest Malta 2014, is a compilation album put together by the European Broadcasting Union, and was released by Universal Music Group on 2014.",

The battle was fought on 06 July 1782. The battle was indecisive but Suffren was stopped in his goal by Hughes and withdrew to Cuddalore, while the Great Britain remained in control of Nagapattinam. France had entered the American Revolutionary War in 1778, and Britain declared war on the Dutch Republic in late 1780, after the Dutch refused to stop trading in military supplies with the French and the Americans. When the Great Britain sent an army of 12,000 toward Vandavasi to relieve the siege, du Chemin, against the wishes of Hyder, refused to engage in a battle that the Franco-Mysorean force would probably have won (which would have significantly reduced the Great Britain military presence in India). As his fleet had grown by captured prizes and arrivals from \u00cele de France (it was now twelve ships of the line and four frigates), Suffren gave chase and caught up with Hughes, who had anchored off Nagapattinam, on 5 July. Suffren had been thwarted in his efforts to take to Nagapattinam \u2013 he stripped M. Bouvet, the captain of Ajax, of his command, and arrested three others for a variety of transgressions in this battle and the previous two. Nagapattinam would remain in Great Britain hands until the end of the war.",

        "story": "The 2017 AFL Women's Grand Final was an Australian rules football match held on 25 March 2017 to determine the premiers of the 2017 AFL Women's season, the league's inaugural season. Adelaide Football Club were victorious over minor premiers Brisbane Lions, claiming the first AFL Women's premiership by a score of 35 points to 29. Brisbane Lions had entered the grand final as undefeated, conceding only one draw during the season, while Adelaide Football Club conceded two losses, including a three-point loss to Brisbane Lions in the fifth round. After defeating the Western Bulldogs in round six and securing their sixth straight win, Brisbane Lions mathematically qualified for a place in the 2017 AFL Women's Grand Final. After Adelaide Football Club, the second placed team, lost their sixth round match against Melbourne, Brisbane Lions pulled away with two wins ahead of Adelaide Football Club at the beginning of the final round, securing the minor premiership and the right to host the grand final. The only match up between Adelaide Football Club and Brisbane Lions before the grand final was Adelaide Football Club's 3-point loss to Brisbane Lions in round five, which knocked Adelaide Football Club off the top of the ladder. As the season progressed, the likelihood rose of the match not being held in Melbourne, as Brisbane Lions and Adelaide Football Club performed well in the first few rounds. With Brisbane Lions being favourites to host, the Gold Coast Football Club lobbied to hold the grand final at Carrara Stadium to prevent splitting crowds with the \"QClash\" match between Gold Coast and the Brisbane Lions being held on the same day at 6:25\u00a0pm, a plan backed by Lethlean. The 2017 AFL Women's Grand Final was broadcast on the Seven Network, as part of a broadcasting rights deal that saw Seven West Media gain broadcasting rights to all matches of the 2017 AFL Women's season, airing on the Seven Network, 7mate, or the video on demand service, PLUS7.",

It did not conclude until the 02 February 1831 election of Bartolomeo Alberto Cappellari as Gregory XVI. Benedetto Cappelletti, informed the cardinals that there was a conspiracy in Rome involving the Bonaparte nephews of Cardinal Joseph Fesch. When the conclave convened on 14 December 1830, some 45 of the 54 living cardinals participated; eight of whom were not Italian. Initially the chief candidates included Emmanuele de Gregorio and Bartolomeo Pacca, who had been papabili in the 1829 conclave, plus Giacomo Giustiniani, who was a long-serving papal diplomat but who was vetoed by King Ferdinand VII. However, it became clear eventually that neither of the unvetoed papabili could gain the support of two-thirds of the cardinals, and with Prince Klemens Wenzel von Metternich wanting a very strong Pope to hold firm against the flood of revolution haunting Europe at the time of the conclave, Giuseppe Albani, who led the Austrian faction and supported Pacca, intervened.",

        "story": "Operation Tractable was the final attack conducted by Canadian and Polish troops, supported by a British tank brigade, during the Operation Overlord during World War II. The operation was to capture the tactically important France town of Falaise and then the smaller towns of Trun and Chambois. Despite a slow start and limited gains north of Falaise, novel tactics by the 1st Polish Armoured Division during the drive for Chambois enabled the Falaise Gap to be partially closed by 19 21 August 1944, trapping about 150,000 German soldiers in the Falaise Pocket. On 21 August 1944, elements of the First Canadian Army relieved the Polish survivors and sealed the Falaise Pocket by linking up with the Third US Army. Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery hoped that Canadian forces would achieve control of Falaise by midnight on 14 August 1944. Operation Tractable began at 12:00 on 14 August 1944, when 800 Avro Lancaster and Handley Page Halifax heavy bombers of RAF Bomber Command struck German positions along the front. Although the first day's progress was slower than expected, Operation Tractable resumed on 15 August; both armoured divisions pushed southeast toward Falaise. By the evening of 21 August 1944, the vast majority of the German forces remaining in the Falaise Pocket had surrendered. German casualties during Operation Tractable are also uncertain; approximate figures can be found for casualties within the Falaise Pocket but not for the Canadian operations during Tractable. In the British and Commonwealth system of battle honours, participation in Operation Tractable (included as part of the honour Falaise for service from 7 to 22 August) was recognized in 1957, 1958, and 1959 by the award of the battle honours Laison (or \"The Laison\" for Canadian units), for service from 14 to 17 August, Chambois from 18 to 22 August and St Lambert-sur-Dives from 19 to 22 August.",

The United States of America had opposed Fiji's unelected government, which came to power through a military coup in December 2006. Prior to Fiji becoming a British colony in 1874, the United States of America had maintained a consular presence there. He went on to rebuke the United States of America for interfering in Fiji's domestic affairs. The United States of America Peace Corps, temporarily withdrawn from Fiji in 1998, resumed its program in Fiji in late 2003. Fiji's response to its deteriorating relations with the United States of America and other Western countries has been to turn to Asia for new political and economic partners. In December 2007, one year after the coup, Fiji's embassy in Washington stated that it wished to promote \"good relations between Fiji and the United States of America\". Following the ruling, Fiji\u2019s interim attorney-general, Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum, called upon Australia, New Zealand, the European Union and the United States of America to lift the sanctions they had imposed on the country, stating that they could no longer refuse to recognise the interim government. The United States of America government responded that it did not intend to alter its position, and that the \"suspension of certain US assistance to the Fiji government under section 508 of the foreign operations appropriations act will remain in place, until the President or Secretary of State determines that Fiji has made measurable progress toward the restoration of democratic rule\". Fiji's embassy to the United States of America is accredited to Canada and Mexico. The United States of America' embassy to Fiji is accredited to Kiribati, Nauru, Tonga and Tuvalu.",

It took place on 25 June 2000, at the TD Garden in Boston. The undercard featured the 2000 King of the Ring tournament, won by Kurt Angle. King of the Ring featured professional wrestling matches that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing feuds, plots, and storylines that were played out on Raw is War and SmackDown!\u2014World Wrestling Federation's (WWF) television programs. On the June 19 episode of Raw is War, the tournament matches continued as Kurt Angle defeated Bubba Ray Dudley, Chris Benoit defeated X-Pac, Eddie Guerrero defeated Chyna, Chris Jericho defeated Edge, Rikishi defeated Scotty 2 Hotty and Crash Holly defeated Hardcore Holly. On the June 12 episode of Raw is War, WWF CEO Linda McMahon announced that at King of the Ring, Rock, Kane and Undertaker would team up to wrestle Triple H, Vince McMahon and Shane McMahon in a six-man tag team match. On the June 15 episode of SmackDown, a stipulation was added into the match that if Triple H's team won, Triple H would defend the title against the winner of the King of the Ring tournament at Fully Loaded but if any person from Rock's team got the pinfall, he would lose the title. Next was the final round match of the 2000 King of the Ring tournament pitting Kurt Angle against Rikishi. Triple H demanded to Foley for another shot at the WWF Championship, arguing that he was never, technically, pinned during the match at King of the Ring. Kurt Angle came out and requested that he would be the new contender since he'd won the King of the Ring tournament. As a result, Foley issued a triple threat match with Triple H, Kurt Angle, and The Rock to determine the #1 contender to Rock's WWF Title that night. By winning the King of the Ring tournament, Kurt Angle's main event push started.",

The battle took place in Thuringia in what was the Ernestine duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld. The battle was the second clash in the Prussian Campaign of the War of the Fourth Coalition. At 5am on 10 October 1806, Lannes with Louis-Gabriel Suchet's division and Anne-Fran\u00e7ois-Charles Trelliard brigade of light cavalry of V corps began advancing down the road to Saalfeld, aware that a Prussian-Saxon force was in front of them. Knowing that the main body of the army under Hohenlohe was due to advance across the River Saale on 10 October 1806, Prince Louis therefore decided that his forces needed to stop the French column from either crossing the Saale at Saalfeld and interfering with Hohenlohe\u2019s movements or from moving up the western side of the Saale to Rudolstadt, which they would reach before Brunswick\u2019s army. At 7am Prince Louis began concentrating his troops at Saalfeld, and by 9am he had arranged his forces for battle. The troops were arranged in a line stretching from in front of Saalfeld to behind Cr\u00f6sten and Beulwitz facing the woods the covered the hills above Saalfeld and the Saale valley.",

Following the invasion of South Korea by North Korea and the outbreak of the Korean War on 1950, the United Nations Security Council voted to send armed forces to defend South Korea.

The influx of squatters was a consequence of the 1848 California Gold Rush; when courts began to take legal action against squatters in the area, the squatters mobilized under Dr. Charles L.

The main event of the show featured WWF World Heavyweight Champion Kevin Nash defending the championship against Davey Boy Smith. On August 21, 1995 WWF World Heavyweight Champion Kevin Nash teamed up with Davey Boy Smith to take on the team known as Men on a Mission (King Mabel and Sir Mo) in the main event of the WWF's Monday Night Raw show. Up until that day Davey Boy Smith had always been a face in the WWF, but turned on Kevin Nash that night, attacking him and then leaving him alone to fight off King Mabel and Sir Mo. The storyline was picked up against at In Your House 3 when Davey Boy Smith (Smith was billed exclusively as the British Bulldog by then) teamed up with Yokozuna to take on Kevin Nash and Shawn Michaels in the main event. In the weeks leading up to In Your House 4 the WWF Intercontinental Champion Shawn Michaels had been targeted by the heel Shane Douglas, who claimed to be both intellectually and physically superior to Michaels. Bret Hart joined the commentary team for the main event between Kevin Nash and the British Bulldog to push the fact that Bret Hart was next in line for the championship. Bret Hart ended up defeating Kevin Nash to win the WWF World Heavyweight Championship a month later in the main event of the 1995 Survivor Series. After his disqualification victory over Kevin Nash the British Bulldog got the first title match against the new champion, losing to Bret Hart at In Your House 5. The Kevin Nash vs British Bulldog main event was very poorly received, it also angered Vince McMahon (who was doing commentary) to the point that he reportedly threw his headset off after the match and the pay-per-view had finished and yelled \"horrible, f**king horrible!\"",

It was Aberdeen F.C.'s 13th and Celtic F.C.'s 45th Scottish Cup Final. As Scottish Premier Division clubs, Aberdeen F.C. and Celtic F.C. both entered the competition in the third round. Aberdeen F.C. won all of its four fixtures before the final on its first attempt whilst Celtic F.C. needed one replay to see off Premier Division club Dunfermline Athletic in the quarter-finals. Aberdeen F.C. knocked out Division One clubs Partick Thistle and Morton before defeating Premier Division clubs Heart of Midlothian and Dundee United before the final. The match was Celtic F.C.'s 45th appearance in the final while it was Aberdeen F.C.'s 13th. Both clubs had met in the final on five occasions beforehand in 1937, 1954, 1967, 1970 and 1984 with Celtic F.C. winning three over Aberdeen F.C.'s two. Celtic F.C. had previously won the tournament 29 times whilst Aberdeen F.C. only six times, four coming in the previous nine seasons. Aberdeen F.C. were favourites to win the match on this occasion having finished well ahead of Celtic F.C. in the league, and having beaten the Glasgow side 3\u20131 at Parkhead a mere ten days earlier. Aberdeen F.C. won the match 9\u20138 on penalties after a 0\u20130 draw over 90 minutes of normal play and 30 minutes of extra-time. After a further 8 consecutive successful penalty kicks Celtic F.C.'s Anton Rogan missed the penultimate kick, allowing Brian Irvine to win the tie and claim Aberdeen F.C.'s seventh Scottish Cup victory.",

The revolt began in \u00dcsk\u00fcb in 1843 and grew strongly when an Ottoman Empire army under Hajredin Pasha, in the process of opposing it, tried to recruit local Albanians into the regular army. In November the rebels liberated Gostivar and in 1844, after bitter fights with the Ottoman Empire army, they captured Kalkandelen. The rebellion was spread to \u0130pek, Yakova, Prizren and \u0130\u015fkodra (now Shkod\u00ebr), while in the spring of 1844 the rebellion reached Ohri (now Ohrid) and Manastiri in the south, \u0130\u015fkodra in the west, Vranje and Leskovac in the north and Kumanova in the east. Fearing a further extension of the rebellion, the Ottoman Empire government tried to gain some time through negotiations. In 1844 the Ottoman Empire army attacked the rebels, forcing them to retreat to the areas of Kalkandelen, \u00dcsk\u00fcb and Kumanova. On 1844 the Ottoman Empire army entered \u00dcsk\u00fcb, where many reprisals took place. Dervish Cara was captured by Ottoman Empire forces in summer 1844. In the fall of 1844, the Ottoman Empire army was concentrated against the rebels in the Sanjak of Dibra. Although the rebellion was crushed, the Ottoman Empire government postponed the application of Tanzimat for the Sanjak of Dib\u00ebr and Shkod\u00ebr.",

        "story": "theosophy is a religion established in the United States during the late nineteenth century. Categorized by scholars of religion as both a new religious movement and as part of the occultist stream of Western esotericism, it draws upon both older European philosophies such as Neoplatonism and Asian religions such as Hinduism and Buddhism. theosophy's founder, the Russian Helena Blavatsky, insisted that it was not a religion, although she did refer to it as the modern transmission of the \"once universal religion\" that she claimed had existed deep into the human past. That theosophy should not be labeled a religion is a claim that has been maintained by Theosophical organizations, who instead regard it as a system that embraces what they see as the \"essential truth\" underlying religion, philosophy, and science. Scholars of religion who have studied theosophy have characterized it as a religion. Various scholars have pointed to its eclectic nature; Joscelyn Godwin described it as a \"universally eclectic religious movement\", while scholar J. Jeffrey Franklin characterized theosophy as a \"hybrid religion\" for its syncretic combination of elements from various other sources. Scholars have also classified theosophy as a form of Western esotericism. The historian of religion Wouter Hanegraaff noted that theosophy helped to establish the \"essential foundations for much of twentieth-century esotericism\". Although theosophy draws upon Indian religious beliefs, the sociologist of religion Christopher Partridge observed that \"theosophy is fundamentally Western. Alternately, the scholar of esotericism Wouter J. Hanegraaff distinguished the Blavatskian movement from its older namesake by terming it \"modern theosophy\". In the early years of Blavatsky's movement, some critics referred to it as \"Neo-theosophy\" to differentiate it from the older Christian theosophy movement. According to the scholar of religion James A. Santucci, discerning what the term \"theosophy\" meant to the early Theosophists is \"not as obvious as one might think\". Campbell also noted that theosophy appealed to educated Asians, and particularly Indians, because it identified Asia as being central to a universal ancient religion and allowed Asians to retain traditional religious beliefs and practices within a modern framework. Many early scholars of religion dismissed theosophy as being not worthy of study; Mircea Eliade for instance described theosophy as a \"detestable 'spiritual' hybridism\". Hammer and Rothstein suggested that the \"dearth of scholarly literature\" on theosophy was because \"powerful individuals and institutions\" in Europe and North America regarded the religion as \"ludicrous\", thus discouraging scholars from devoting their time to researching it.",

        "story": "Pickett's Charge was an infantry assault ordered by Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee against Maj. Gen. George G. Meade's Union positions on July 3, 1863, the last day of the Battle of Gettysburg in the state of Pennsylvania during the American Civil War. Although some Confederates were able to breach the low stone wall that shielded many of the Union defenders, they could not maintain their hold and were repelled with over 50% casualties, a decisive defeat that ended the three-day battle and Lee's campaign into Pennsylvania. Years later, when asked why his charge at Gettysburg failed, Pickett reportedly replied, \"I've always thought the Yankees had something to do with it.\" While Pickett's division had not been used yet at Gettysburg, A. P. Hill's health became an issue and he did not participate in selecting which of his troops were to be used for the charge. The infantry charge was preceded by what Lee hoped would be a powerful and well-concentrated cannonade of the Union center, destroying the Union artillery batteries that could defeat the assault and demoralizing the Union infantry. When Union cannoneers overshot their targets, they often hit the massed infantry waiting in the woods of Seminary Ridge or in the shallow depressions just behind Alexander's guns, causing significant casualties before the charge began. Longstreet had opposed the charge from the beginning, convinced the charge would fail (which ultimately proved true), and had his own plan that he would have preferred for a strategic movement around the Union left flank. Longstreet wanted to avoid personally ordering the charge by attempting to pass the mantle onto young Colonel Alexander, telling him that he should inform Pickett at the optimum time to begin the advance, based on his assessment that the Union artillery had been effectively silenced. Two gaps opened up in the Union line: the commander of the 71st Pennsylvania ordered his men to retreat when the Confederates came too close to the Angle; south of the copse of trees, the men of the 59th New York (Hall's brigade) inexplicably bolted for the rear. The site of Pickett's Charge is one of the best-maintained portions of the Gettysburg Battlefield. A cyclorama painting by the French artist Paul Philippoteaux entitled The Battle of Gettysburg, also known as the Gettysburg Cyclorama, depicts Pickett's Charge from the vantage point of the Union defenders on Cemetery Ridge.",

The event marked the second time the Hell in a Cell format was used by WWE in a Bad Blood event; the first was at Badd Blood: In Your House in 1997. The 2003 Bad Blood event grossed over $500,000 ticket sales from an attendance of 10,000. On the May 19 episode of Raw, after Triple H successfully defended the World Heavyweight Championship against Ric Flair, Co-General Manager Steve Austin announced that due to Nash winning at Judgment Day by professional wrestling, Nash would face Triple H again at Bad Blood for the World Heavyweight Championship in a Hell in a Cell match. During the segment he explained that he conspired the attack because he grew jealous towards Goldberg's success in WCW, disliking Goldberg's ego and felt that since joining the WWE, he had achieved everything he had ever wanted in his career especially becoming the first WWE Undisputed Champion in history and all that was left was to defeat Goldberg and challenged him to a singles match at Bad Blood. The Lakewood Church Central Campus had a maximum capacity of 16,285, which was reduced for Bad Blood.",

Mongolia is represented to Norway via its embassy in Brussels, while Norway is represented in Mongolia by its embassy in Beijing. The move is to facilitate the development of bilateral contacts and have stronger relations between Norway and Mongolia. The Government of Norway has promoted the commercialization of super-insulating materials in the housing sector in Mongolia in coordination with the Global Environment Facility, the United Nations Development Program Mongolia, and the Mongolian Ministry of Infrastructure and provided technical and financial support in building energy efficient housing. There has traditionally been only modest diplomatic contact between Mongolia and Norway, though according to Norwegian foreign minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re bilateral relations have been \"good and fruitful\" ever since they were established. Haakon, the Crown Prince of Norway, visited Mongolia in November 2008 as the goodwill ambassador for the United Nations Development Programme. At the Kaan Bank Theatre in Mongoliahe said: is quite interesting to note that Mongolia and Norway were both at their height of power about the same time at the beginning of the second millennium. In this regard, I am happy to learn that Norway has given support to the UNDP\u2019s efforts aimed at strengthening democratic institutions in Mongolia, and that there are fruitful relations between the Parliaments in our respective countries. ... As small nations, Norway and Mongolia also share a belief in multilateral co-operation based on international law, with the United Nations at the centre. The Crown Prince's visit marked the 40th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between Norway and Mongolia, which also saw the foreign ministers of the two nations exchange congratulations. Vice President of the Norwegian Parliament Carl I. Hagen represented Norway during Mongolia's 800-year anniversary in 2006.",

Camillo Felgen for Luxembourg; Fran\u00e7ois Deguelt for Monaco; and Fud Leclerc making his fourth appearance for Belgium, having also been present at the 1956 and 1958 contests. Jean Philippe, having previous represented France in 1959, returned to the contest as a representative for Switzerland. This year marked the second jury voting system change in the contest\u2019s history, moving away from a point per favourite song from 10-member juries to the allocation of 3, 2 and 1 points given to the top three favourite songs from each country's 10-member jurors' ratings.",

For interpreted languages, however, a syntax error may be detected during program execution, and an interpreter's error messages might not differentiate syntax errors from errors of other kinds. For example, some would say that the use of an uninitialized variable's value in Java code is a syntax error, but many others would disagree and would classify this as a (static) semantic error. A syntax error is one of several types of errors on calculators (most commonly found on scientific calculators and graphing calculators), representing that the equation that has been input has incorrect syntax of numbers, operations and so on.",
