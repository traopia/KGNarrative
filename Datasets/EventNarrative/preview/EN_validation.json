However, the rapid response of the nationalist cavalry ruined his plan by following closely, and by the afternoon of August 17, 1947, Wang Shitai (\u738b\u4e16\u6cf0) still could not shake off the nationalists when they reached the Eagle's Feather's Pass (Diao Ling Guan, \u96d5\u7fce\u5173) at the border of Shaanxi and Gansu. However, communists had obviously not learnt anything from their defeat and thus paid a heavy price in later conflicts: In 1948, during the Western Shaanxi-Eastern Gansu Campaign, the communist 3rd Garrison Brigade was tasked to protect the right flank of the attacking communist force but it was unable to stop the nationalist counterattack led by the nationalist general Pei Changhui (\u88f4\u660c\u4f1a) and the former-guerrilla turned regular unit withdrew into Linyou (\u9e9f\u6e38) mountains, exposing the Peng Dehuai's headquarters and the communist main force at Baoji. Peng Dehuai and his headquarters of the communist First Field Army would meet a similar danger several days later when the communist 3rd Garrison Brigade once again made the same debacle: when the attacking communists withdrew to Northern Shaanxi via Eastern Gansu, Peng Dehuai ordered the 5th Regiment of the communist 3rd Garrison Brigade to guard the region from Duzi (\u5c6f\u5b57) town to Xiaojing (\u8427\u91d1) to secure the safe passage for the headquarters and the communist 1st, 4th and 6th columns. After the Western Shaanxi-Eastern Gansu Campaign, Peng Dehuai angrily criticized Huang Luobing (\u9ec4\u7f57\u658c), claiming that the mistake he had made would be sufficient to have him executed. Had the communists learned the problem of the former-guerillas earlier during the Meridian Ridge Campaign and remedied the problem back then, they would not have to face the danger later on in Western Shaanxi-Eastern Gansu Campaign."

Tung Chee Hwa, a Shanghai-born Hong Kong businessman who was seen being favoured by Jiang Zemin, General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, was the ultimate winner of the election, defeating former Chief Justice Yang Ti-liang and tycoon Peter Woo with a large margin. According to the Basic Law of Hong Kong, the mini-constitution of the HKSAR, the first Chief Executive of Hong Kong was selected by a 400-member Selection Committee. Tung Chee Hwa, a Shanghai-born Hong Kong shipping magnate, was not widely known until the campaign began. The pro-democrats also backed veteran politician and member of the Legislative Council Szeto Wah to launch a petition movement as the civil Chief Executive of Hong Kong to mock the election of the 400-member Selection Committee. Tung Chee Hwa, Yang Ti-liang and Peter Woo all secured more than 50 nominations to enter the race, while Simon Li, to his shock, fell a few votes and was eliminated. On 11 December 1996, the election was held at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre (HKCEC), where 400-member Selection Committee elected Tung Chee Hwa as the Chief Executive of Hong Kong. Tung received 320 votes against 49 votes for Yang Ti-liang and 36 votes for Peter Woo. Tung Chee Hwa was appointed as the first Chief Executive of Hong Kong of the HKSAR by Premier Li Peng under State Council Order 207 at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on 18 11 December 1996."

On 10 September 2013, the four remaining adult defendants - Pawan Gupta, Vinay Sharma, Akshay Thakur and Mukesh Singh (Ram Singh's brother) - were found guilty of rape and murder and three days later were sentenced to death by hanging. They included Ram Singh, the bus driver, and his brother, Mukesh Singh, who were both arrested in Rajasthan. Vinay Sharma, an assistant gym instructor, and Pawan Gupta, a fruit seller, were both arrested in UP and Bihar. Ram Singh was presented before the Metropolitan Magistrate on 18 16 December 2012. Mukesh Singh, Vinay Sharma, Akshay Thakur and Pawan Gupta denied the charges. On 15 March 2014, the Supreme Court of India stayed the execution of two of the four convicts, Mukesh Singh and Pawan Gupta, to allow them to make their appeal against their conviction on 31 March. On 17 January 2020, the President of India rejected the mercy plea of the convict Mukesh Singh. Public protests took place in New Delhi on 21 16 December 2012 at India Gate and Raisina Hill, the latter being the location of both the Parliament of India and Rashtrapati Bhavan, the official residence of the President of India. After Jyoti Singh's death on 29 16 December 2012, protests were staged throughout India, including Kolkata, Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Kochi, Thiruvananthapuram, Mumbai, Bhubaneswar and Visakhapatnam. Author and activist Eve Ensler, who organised One Billion Rising, a global campaign to end violence against women and girls, said that the gang rape and murder was a turning point in India and around the world. On 22 16 December 2012, a judicial committee headed by J. S. Verma, a former Chief Justice of India and one of India's most highly regarded Chief Justices and eminent jurists, was appointed by the Central government to submit a report within 30 days to suggest amendments to criminal law to sternly deal with sexual assault cases. In December 2014, the two-year anniversary of the attack, referring to a woman who was raped in a car operated by an Uber driver, the parents remarked to the press that not much had changed: \"Nothing in India has changed since 16 December 2012."

After the president's departure for Montgomery, Alabama, he telegraphed Hood that he had decided to retain him in command and, acceding to Hood's request, transferred Lt. Gen. William J. Hardee, one of Hood's corps commanders, out of the Army of Tennessee. Hood then moved to the west and crossed the Coosa River in the vicinity of Rome, Georgia, near the Alabama state line. He turned north in the direction of Resaca, Georgia, and joined with Maj. Gen. Joseph Wheeler's cavalry, which had been previously raiding in Tennessee. Hood set out toward Decatur, Alabama, with the intention of meeting up with Forrest in the vicinity of Florence, from where they would march north into Tennessee.

AQI had used the city as a staging ground for moving foreign fighters into Iraq since early 2005. The offensive was launched on 01 September 2005 in a joint United States of America Army and the New Iraqi Army operation to destroy suspected insurgents' havens and base of operations in Tal Afar. By 18 September 2005, the battle was over, Coalition forces succeeded in significantly eliminating AQI and other insurgents from the city, thereby creating a secure environment for the referendum in October and national elections in 2005, Tal Afar went from being the city with the lowest number of voters to the highest in the country, schools and businesses reopened and the population transitioned back to living a normal life as possible. The operation was considered one of the first successful counterinsurgency operations of the war and President George W. Bush remarked that \"the story of Tal Afar gives me confidence in our strategy, because in that city we see the outlines of Iraq we've been fighting for.\""

Gold Coast's association football federation, founded in 1920, was over twenty years older than Nigeria's and its team was more respected among Britain's colonies. The two nations played to relative parity for much of the rest of the 1950s, mostly trading victories on respective home soil, but Ghana would go on to dominate much of the competition between the 1960s and the early 2000s and win the Africa Cup of Nations four times to Nigeria's two in that time period. During the 1950s and 1960s, Nigeria and Ghana would compete in three cup competitions. Despite these issues, the tournament would see two matches played between Ghana and Nigeria, the high point being when the two sides met in the final of the 1960 tournament in Lagos, Nigeria in which Ghana won 3\u20130."

He then went on, throughout early 2004, to win every nomination contest, including a sweep of Super Tuesday, beating back the vacuum of challengers and maintaining the recent tradition of an easy primary election for incumbent Presidents (the last time an incumbent was seriously challenged in a presidential primary election contest was when Senator Ted Kennedy challenged Jimmy Carter for the Democratic nomination in 1980). Bush managed to raise US$130 million in 2003 alone, and expected to set a national primary election fund-raising record of $200 million by the time of the 2004 Republican National Convention in New York City. There were 2,509 total delegates to the 2004 Republican National Convention, of which 650 were so-called \"superdelegates\" who were not bound by any particular state's primary election or caucus votes and could change their votes at any time."

        "story": "'flaming') is a form of late Gothic architecture that developed in Europe in the Late Middle Ages and Renaissance, from around 1375 to the mid-16th century. Ribs in Flamboyant tracery are recognizable by their flowing forms, which are influenced by the earlier curvilinear tracery of the Gothic architecture (or Second Pointed) styles. Notable examples of Flamboyant style are the west rose window of Sainte-Chapelle (1485\u20131498); the west porch of the Church of Saint-Maclou, Rouen, (c.1500\u20131514); the west front of Troyes Cathedral (early 16th century), and a very early example, the upper tracery of Great West Window of York Minster (1338\u20131339). In architectural history, the Flamboyant is considered the last phase of French Gothic architecture and appeared in the closing decades of the 14th century, succeeding the Rayonnant style and prevailing until its gradual replacement by Renaissance architecture during the first third of the 16th century. Notable examples of Flamboyant in France include the west rose window of Sainte-Chapelle in Paris, the transepts of Sens Cathedral and Beauvais Cathedral, the fa\u00e7ade of Sainte-Chapelle de Vincennes and the west front of Trinity Abbey, Vend\u00f4me. What has been termed \"proto-Flamboyant\" appeared at the Saint-Ouen Abbey, Rouen in the inner wall of the north transept between 1390 and 1410. The term \"Flamboyant\" was coined in the early 19th century, primarily to refer to French monuments with flame-like, curvilinear tracery that were constructed between circa 1380 and 1515. The Sainte-Chapelle de Vincennes had a single floor and the windows, consisting of curvilinear tracery, covered nearly all of the walls. The building's most prominent architectural feature is its monumental west fa\u00e7ade, which was completed in the Flamboyant style in the 15th century. The incorporation of Flamboyant Gothic with the classicizing forms of Italy produced eclectic, hybrid structures that were rooted in traditional French building practices yet modernized through the application of imported antique motifs and surface decoration. Before the unification of Spain, monuments were constructed in the Flamboyant style in the Crown of Aragon and Kingdom of Valencia, where Marc Safont was among the most important architects of the Late Middle Ages. The building includes elements borrowed by the English Perpendicular style, tracery inspired by French Flamboyant, and German-inspired openwork steeples. This architectural response to increasing concerns with the aesthetics of urban space is particularly notable in Normandy, where a striking group of late 15th- and early 16th-century projecting polygonal porches were constructed in the Flamboyant style; examples include Notre-Dame, Alen\u00e7on; La Trinit\u00e9, Falaise; Church of Notre-Dame de Louviers; and Church of Saint-Maclou."

The social movement's name in Chinese is (Chinese: \u592a\u967d\u82b1; pinyin: ta\u00ec y\u00e1ng hua), a calque of the English word \"sunflower\", rather than the native term, (Chinese: \u5411\u65e5\u8475; pinyin: xi\u00e0ng r\u00ec ku\u00ed) This term was popularized after a florist contributed 1000 sunflowers to the students outside the Legislative Yuan building. The social movement is also known as the \"18 March 2014 Student Movement\" (318\u5b78\u904b) or \"Occupy Taiwan Legislature\" (\u4f54\u9818\u570b\u6703\u4e8b\u4ef6). In response to the April 6 concessions from Speaker Wang, the protesters held a press conference on April 7 stating they would vacate the Legislative Yuan on 10 April 2014 at 6 p.m. local time, which they eventually did, and also continue the social movement in the broader Taiwan society. On April 21, Lin Fei-fan, Chen Wei-ting, Huang Kuo-chang and four other key members of the Sunflower Movement attended the Taipei District Prosecutors' Office voluntarily to explain what happened during their occupation of the legislature that began on 18 March 2014 and the attempted occupation of the Executive Yuan on March 23. In August 2014, leaders of the student social movement visited the United States, meeting with the US Congress, Department of State and the American Institute in Taiwan. Chen Wei-ting and Huang Kuo-chang both called the social movement a \"third force\" in the politics of Taiwan. On March 21, a group of presidents from the 52-member Associations of national universities of Taiwan issued a joint statement calling on President Ma Ying-jeou to respond to the student-led protesters' demands, and urged Ma to engage in talks with student protest leaders as soon as possible to defuse the situation. The BBC commented that this social movement could be a further democratization of Taiwan, with additional safeguards to let the people, not any political party, decide the fate of Taiwan."

In response, the West Indies women's cricket team were bowled out for 145, resulting in an Australian victory by 114 runs, and securing Australia women's national cricket team's sixth World Cup victory. The final group match saw Australia women's national cricket team beat New Zealand by seven wicket, and see them qualify for the Super Six section of the tournament. Despite losing to India and England, they finished in third place in the group and qualified for the Super Six section, where they won all three of their games, against South Africa, New Zealand and Australia women's national cricket team, to qualify for the final. The West Indies women's cricket team then took further wickets until at 209/7 with fewer than 7 overs left, Australia women's national cricket team appeared to have lost their momentum. However Jodie Fields and Ellyse Perry hit 50 more runs off the remaining balls, leaving Australia women's national cricket team with a final score of 259/7. The West Indies women's cricket team had beaten Australia women's national cricket team in the Super Six group stage, but were outclassed in the final; the BBC said that \"Australia women's national cricket team were too clinical for a West Indies women's cricket team side that were sloppy in the field, wayward with the ball and unable to keep up with the run chase.\""

On 1962, the Centralia Council met to discuss the approaching Memorial Day and how the town would go about cleaning up the Centralia landfill, which was introduced earlier that year. David DeKok says that the bourough's deliberate burning of trash on 27 May 1962 to clean up the landfill in the former strip mine ignited a coal seam via an unsealed opening in the trash pit, which allowed the fire to enter the labyrinth of abandoned coal mines beneath Centralia. Centralia councilman Joseph Tighe proposed a different hypothesis: that Centralia's coal fire was actually started by an adjacent coal seam fire that had been burning west of Centralia's."

        "story": "Congressional Baseball Game is an annual baseball game played each summer by members of the United States Congress. In the game, Republican Party and Democratic Party form separate teams and play against each other. Deep, dark rumors were in circulation that 'ringers' would be introduced, but when they lined up at 4 o'clock the nine Republican Party were stalwart, grand old party men, while the Democratic Party were of the pure Jeffersonian strain.\" The Democratic Party beat their Republican Party opponents, 26\u201316 in the first game and continued their winning streak for the first six games. As of the 2017 game, 14 trophies have been awarded\u2014ten to the Republican Party' team and four to the Democratic Party' team. On June 14, 2017, one day before the annual event, a gunman opened fire on Republican Party members of Congress who were practicing for the next day's game. Bicameral baseball was inaugurated in 1950, when Senator Harry P. Cain of Washington joined the Republican Party team and Senator-elect George Smathers of Florida, a former Representative, joined the Democratic team. In the early years of the game, each team wore a uniform that was either plain or had the words \"Republican Party\" or \"Democratic Party\" embroidered on it. The official website of the Congressional Baseball Game for Charity seemingly does not count three of those Republican Party wins, because its History page listed (in 2017, but prior to the 2017 game) the series record as 39\u201339\u20131 (in a blue, red, white, and black bar near the bottom of the page). The same page, however, states\u2014in reference to the Roll Call Trophy\u2014that \"o date, 10 of these coveted trophies have been awarded, eight to the Republican Party and two to the Democratic Party.\" Although the series record that is set forth in the bar near the bottom of the page includes the Democratic Party' seven wins between 2003 and 2016, the bar includes only four of the Republican Party' seven wins during that same time period."

The battle, involving up to 200,000 men in one of the largest of the Roman civil wars, consisted of two engagements in the plain west of the ancient city of Philippi. A second encounter, on 23 October 0042, finished off Brutus's forces after a hard-fought battle. Norbanus and Saxa passed the town of Philippi in eastern Macedonia and took a strong defensive position at a narrow mountain pass. This brought about a general battle on 03 October 0042 42 BC. The total casualties for the second battle of Philippi were not reported, but the close quarters fighting likely resulted in heavy losses for both sides. Many other young Roman aristocrats lost their lives in the battle or committed suicide after the defeat, including the son of great orator Hortensius, and Marcus Porcius Cato, the son of Cato the Younger, and Marcus Livius Drusus Claudianus, the father of Livia, who became Octavian's wife. The Battle of Philippi marked the highest point of Antony's career: at that time he was the most famous Roman general and the senior partner of the Second Triumvirate. Augustus's own version of the Battle of Philippi was: \"I sent into exile the murderers of my father, punishing their crimes with lawful tribunals, and afterwards, when they made war upon the Republic, I twice defeated them in battle.\""

Around 12,300 kilometers separate Chile and Germany but both nations still share a wide range of bilateral relations. The first ties between modern-day Germany and Chile can be traced back to the 16th century when the first German settlers arrived in the newly founded settlements. During the revolution of Germany in 1848, as Chile encouraged Germans to emigrate, more and more German settlers arrived in Chile. In modern days' relationship, Chileans view Germany positively, and in the same reason, Germans view Chile exact similar. The prestige of Germany and German culture in Chile remained high after the First World War but did not return to its pre-war levels. Chile broke relations with Germany and declared war in 1943; during World War II, many German Jews settled in Chile, fleeing the Holocaust, while foreign citizens suspected of Nazi sympathies were sent to the Pisagua internment camp. For example, In Germany is it also possible to find testimonies of the links between Chile and Germany. Several treaties exists between Germany and Chile. Germany is Chile\u2019s principal trading partner within the European Union and continues to rank fifth worldwide among suppliers of Chilean imports. In 2013, Germany exported $3.2bn to Chile and Chile exported $2.1bn in goods to Germany and it is expected that the trade between both nations will continue to increase. Germany\u2019s principal exports to Chile are aircraft, ships, rail vehicles and cars, plant and mechanical engineering products, electricity generation and distribution equipment, electrical goods, medical and photographic equipment, measurement and control technology, chemical products and non-precious metal goods. Copper and related products remain Chile\u2019s principal exports to Germany. Germany also imports from Chile sizable quantities of fruit, preserved foods and juices, wine, fish and processed fish products, meat and animal-derived foods, cellulose, wood and chemical products."

The 2020 Paris-Nice was the last international cycling event, as well as the last sporting event in France, before mass gatherings were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Paris\u2013Nice was created in 1933 by Parisian media mogul Albert Lejeune, in order to promote his Paris-based newspaper Le Petit Journal and Nice-based paper Le Petit Nice. It was held in March, at the end of winter, as one of the earliest French road bicycle racing on the calendar, immediately following the Six-day racing season on the track. In 2002, he sold Paris\u2013Nice to Amaury Sport Organisation. In 2005 Paris\u2013Nice was included in the inaugural UCI Pro Tour, but was at the center of a dispute between UCI and Amaury Sport Organisation just before the 2008 Paris\u2013Nice. In 2012 Paris\u2013Nice England's Bradley Wiggins won the race, as part of his build-up to the Tour de France. The 2020 Paris-Nice was the last international cycling event, as well as the last sporting event in France, before mass gatherings came to a halt due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Known as The Race to the Sun, Paris\u2013Nice is often considered a mini-Tour de France, where riders need to be both competent time-trialists and capable of climbing mountains. In 2002, after the race was obtained by Amaury Sport Organisation, the leader's jersey was yellow and white, before changing it to yellow in 2008, reflecting the Tour de France leader's jersey.

The second hiatus in the history of the race commenced in 1999 when a Queensland government-supported bid saw the Sandown 500 replaced on the Supercars calendar by the Queensland 500, held at Queensland Raceway. By 2003, new owners of Queensland Raceway had tired of the relative expense of the 500 kilometre endurance race format, resulting in the Sandown 500 again being contested by V8 Supercars. After a change of promoter of Sandown Raceway's motorsport activities, a changed V8 Supercars calendar resulted in the 500 kilometre event moving to the Phillip Island Grand Prix Circuit for the 2008 season, while Sandown reverted to hosting a sprint round, an event which became known as the Sandown Challenge. The Sandown 500 returned to the V8 Supercars calendar in 2012, replacing the Phillip Island 500 to again become the traditional lead-in race to the Bathurst 1000. 2015 saw Winterbottom win the Sandown 500 for a second time, having first tasted success in 2006, leading home a Prodrive Racing Australia one-two finish. It was also announced in the months leading up to the event that the Sandown 500 would not return in 2020, to be replaced by The Bend 500 at The Bend Motorsport Park."

The mixed ethnic populations resulted in large parts of Galicia being perceived as Polish or Ukrainian simultaneously, which was the main reason for the Polish\u2013Ukrainian War. On the night of October 31/1918, the Ukrainian National Rada in Lviv issued a proclamation in the name of the West Ukrainian People's Republic.

He may also have believed that his opponents were militia but was comparatively new to command in Canada and relied on information from Lieutenant Colonel John Harvey, the Deputy Adjutant General for the forces in Upper Canada, that even the United States regulars were of poor quality. Early on 05 July 1814, British light infantry, militia and Indians crossed the Chippawa, Ontario ahead of Riall's main body and began sniping at Scott's outposts from the woods to their west. Two days after the battle, Brown completed his original intended maneuver and crossed the Chippawa, Ontario upstream of Riall's defenses, forcing the British to fall back to Fort George. The site is preserved in the Chippawa, Ontario Battlefield Park, a unit of the Niagara Parks Commission, with a battle monument and interpretive plaques south of Niagara Falls in the town of Chippawa, Ontario. The site of the battle was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1921."

The term neo-Nazism can also refer to the ideology of these movements, which may borrow elements from Nazism doctrine, including ultranationalism, anti-communism, racism, ableism, xenophobia, homophobia, anti-Romanyism, antisemitism, up to initiating the Fourth Reich. Following the defeat of Nazism Germany, the political ideology of the ruling party, Nazism, was in complete disarray. Few of the major theorists of Holocaust denial (who call themselves \"revisionists\") can be uncontroversially classified as outright neo-Nazis (though some works such as those of David Irving forward a clearly sympathetic view of Hitler and the publisher Ernst Z\u00fcndel was deeply tied to international neo-Nazism), however, the main interest of Holocaust denial to neo-Nazis was their hope that it would help them rehabilitate their political ideology in the eyes of the general public. Indeed, the revival of National Bolshevism was able to steal some of the thunder from overt Russian neo-Nazism, as ultra-nationalism was wedded with veneration of Joseph Stalin in place of Adolf Hitler, while still also flirting with Nazism aesthetics. Neo-Nazism movements in East Germany began as a rebellion against the Communist regime; the banning of Nazism symbols helped neo-Nazism to develop as an anti-authoritarian youth movement. Under the subsequent leadership of Nick Griffin, the BNP distanced itself from neo-Nazism, although many members (including Griffin himself) have been accused of links to other neo-Nazism groups. neo-Nazism in Canada began with the formation of the Canadian Nazism Party in 1965. Blair Cottrell, former leader of the United Patriots Front, has tried to distance himself from neo-Nazism, but has nevertheless been accused of expressing \"pro-Nazism views\"."

The plan was to seize a luxury hotel in Tel Aviv and take tourists and foreign ambassadors hostage in order to exchange them for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. According to a Fatah commander who had helped to plan the attack, the timing was aimed at scuppering the Israeli-Egyptian peace talks between Menachem Begin and Anwar Sadat and damaging tourism in Israel. Time magazine characterized it as \"the worst terrorist attack in Israel's history.\" Setting off down the highway toward Tel Aviv, they hijacked a chartered bus carrying Egged bus drivers and their families on a day outing, along the Highway 2. The IDF spokesman stated, \"The objective of the operation is not retaliation for the terrorists' crimes, for there can be no retaliation for the murder of innocent men, women and children \u2013 but to protect the state of Israel and its citizens from incursions of members of the Fatah and PLO, who use Lebanese territory in order to attack citizens of Israel.\""

The rebirth of the Rijeka Carnival started in 1982. First the mayor of Rijeka hands the symbolic key of the city over to Me\u0161tar Toni, who is \"the maestro\" of the carnival, and he in turn figuratively becomes the mayor of the city during the carnival season. As all the cities around Rijeka have their own events during the carnival time, the Queen and Me\u0161tar Toni would be in attendance at most of them. The other event is the children's carnival, held, like the main one, on Rijeka`s main walkway Korzo. In the front there are the real mayor of Rijeka, the carnival Queen and Me\u0161tar Toni. This tradition is held in all places around Rijeka, but it is held on Tuesday or Wednesday after the carnival. In the last few years there are several parties held on various locations in Rijeka, some starting day before the carnival, and end in the night after the carnival."

Romney campaigned hard in Nevada and did not campaign in South Carolina, while the other leading Republican candidates, John McCain and Mike Huckabee, kept their focus on South Carolina.

Hunter, though already out of the race, still remained on the ballot in the Florida primary. Mike Huckabee challenged John McCain to a debate before the March 4 primaries, and the Values Voter coalition stepped in, arranging for a debate hall and inviting both McCain and Huckabee, as well as Rep. Ron Paul to participate in a March 3 debate event. John McCain officially clinched the Republican presidential nomination on 2008, sweeping the primaries in Ohio, Texas, Rhode Island, and Vermont.

The Act received the Royal Assent on 18 July 1947 and thus Dominion of India and Dominion of Pakistan, comprising West (modern day Dominion of Pakistan) and East (modern day Bangladesh) regions, came into being on 15 August. Clement Attlee, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, announced on 1947 that: Attlee wrote to Mountbatten on 1947: \"It is, of course, important that the Indian States should adjust their relations with the authorities to whom it is intended to hand over power in British India; but as was explicitly stated by the Cabinet Mission His Majesty's Government do not intend to hand over their powers and obligations under paramountcy to any successor Government. There was much violence, and many Muslims from what would become Dominion of India fled to Dominion of Pakistan; and Hindus and Sikhs from what would become Dominion of Pakistan fled to Dominion of India. The state of Jammu and Kashmir was contiguous to both Dominion of India and Dominion of Pakistan, but its Hindu ruler chose to remain initially independent. Following a Pakistani tribal invasion, he acceded to Dominion of India on 1947, and the state was disputed between Dominion of India and Dominion of Pakistan. Following a breakdown of law and order, its Dewan requested Dominion of India to take over the administration on 1947. Between 1947 and March 1948 the rulers of several Muslim-majority states signed instruments of accession to join Dominion of Pakistan. The Indian Independence Act 1947 was subsequently repealed in Article 395 of the Constitution of Dominion of India and in Article 221 of the Constitution of Pakistan of 1956, both constitutions being intended to bring about greater independence for the new states."

For its part, Vietnam is backing Luxembourg's candidacy for the post of non-permanent member at the UN Security Council. Vietnam is one of the ten key countries in Luxembourg's development cooperation program. At a meeting between Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguy\u1ec5n T\u1ea5n D\u0169ng and his Luxembourg counterpart, Jean-Claude Juncker, in September 2006, the two Prime Ministers agreed the need to boost bilateral trade ties based on the combination of Luxembourg's advanced technology and Vietnam's intensive labour force. Covering the period of 2006 to 2010, the second Indicative Cooperation Programme (ICP) aligned Luxembourg's interventions with Vietnam's five-year Socio-Economic Development Plan and supported, with a budget of 50 million EUR, development policies and strategies to achieve the MDGs of the Vietnamese government. The Luxembourg development cooperation contributes to the One UN Fund (2012-2016) which directly supports the implementation of the One UN Plan in Vietnam. A mid-term evaluation of the current ICP, conducted in June 2014, underlined the important and visible results and impacts reached by Luxembourg's development cooperation and its Vietnamese partners on provincial level, be it in strengthening health care in Cao Bang and Bac Kan provinces, in improving income of vulnerable groups in remote areas of Nghe An province, in providing high standard vocational training for tourism and hospitality students in Hue Tourism College and associated schools and in supporting the Vietnam States Securities Commission in creating a better environment for foreign investors."

However, The International 2015 champion team Evil Geniuses did not receive a direct invite due to breaking Valve Corporation's rules on roster swapping after the completion of the last premier Dota 2 tournament, the Manila Major, in June. (Note: Prizes are in USD) The crowdfunded prize pool of US$20,770,460 surpassed the The International 2015's total of $18.4 million, overtaking it as the largest esports tournament prize pool in history until being surpassed by the The International 2017. The venue where the event took place, the KeyArena in Seattle, was sold out, with millions of additional spectators watching the event via livestreaming platforms worldwide. Seattle KCPQ reporter Kaci Aitchison, who co-hosted the event, thought that due to the International's large prize pools and production values, esports had become a true spectator sport which deserved the same level of respect of traditional sports."

        "story": "On 25 December 1084, at the Battle of Piedra Pisada, the Taifa of Zaragoza fought and probably defeated the Kingdom of Aragon on the road south from Naval, Huesca to El Grado. The battle was a minor engagement of the ongoing Reconquista of Aragon, the process by which the riverine valleys of the southern slopes of the Pyrenees were gradually conquered and returned, after centuries of Muslim rule, to the control of Christian princes. The ruler of Aragon, who personally led his men in battle at Piedra Pisada, Sancho Ram\u00edrez, also ruled Kingdom of Navarre and was a major figure in the contemporary Reconquista. In a document nearly contemporary with the battle, Peter I of Aragon and Navarre, Sancho's son and successor, enumerated the parishes whose tithes belonged to the church of Santa Mar\u00eda of Alqu\u00e9zar in geographic order from east to west, placing Petra Pisata between Naval, Huesca and Salinas de Hoz. Since neither surviving record of the battle, both Christian, records the outcome and Naval, Huesca is known to have lapsed out of Christian control soon after its conquest, it is probable that the battle was a loss for Sancho."
