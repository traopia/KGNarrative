       "[{'story': 'German Know-How For China\\'s Energy Sector Energy is becoming a scarce resource in China and Beijing is looking for alternatives. On Friday, Germany\\'s foreign minister inaugurated one of the largest German-Chinese joint ventures for solar energy there. The facility in Jinan is being billed as the largest solar collector plant in the world. The site in this eastern Chinese city, run by a Sino-German joint venture, produces solar collectors to heat water. It is a market that promises massive electricity savings in a country struggling with a potential shortfall this year of 30 million kilowatts. \"China has recognized the urgent ecological issues that go along with strong economic growth and the increasing need for energy,\" German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer told German business representatives at the inauguration ceremony. \"I am especially happy that China has made decisive steps towards using renewable energy and the development of a more environmentally-friendly energy sector,\" he added. Solar power instead of chocolate The joint venture is owned by the German vacuum tube solar collector manufacturer Paradigma, Karlsbad, and Chinese glass tubing producer Linuo in Jinan. Paradigma\\'s major shareholder is Alfred Ritter, better-known for his chocolate company Ritter Sport. \"With this joint venture, we are following a strategy to go where the markets are,\" Ritter said. \"In China, we\\'re producing for the Asian market, in Germany, for the European market.\" Germany sees the Shangdong Linuo Paradigma plant as the largest new venture in a virtually untapped market. \"There are extraordinary opportunities here not only for large corporations, but also for mid-sized and small German companies,\" said Fischer, who is currently touring Asia with a German business delegation. China\\'s energy resources are running out China, the world\\'s largest solar energy market, is facing its worst energy crisis since the 1980s. It has been set off by the rapid development of power-hungry industries such as automobiles, iron and steel, as well as rapid urbanization and a rise in living standards. Energy production relative to buying power is four times more expensive in China than in other industrialized nations. At the same time, it is drastically depleting its coal deposits and oil imports are soaring. The symptoms of the shortages are visible throughout China. In order to feed Beijing\\'s growing energy needs, frequent blackouts occur across the country. Many companies have begun working at night and on weekends to avoid high-use periods and more than 6,000 companies in Beijing have ordered one-week paid vacations this summer to save energy.',\n",

       " {'story': 'Iran calls for end to Saudi air campaign, as US warns Tehran over Yemen Iran\\'s president has called for an end to Saudi-led airstrikes on Houthi rebels in Yemen. This came after the United States warned Tehran against its alleged involvement in the conflict in Yemen. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani used an address broadcast live on national television on Thursday to call on the coalition led by Saudi Arabia to immediately halt its campaign of air strikes on the Shiite Houthi rebels seeking to overthrow Yemeni President Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi. Shiite Iran is widely thought to be supporting the rebels, while Sunni Saudi Arabia supports President Hadi, who fled to the Saudi capital, Riyadh over a week ago, as Houthi forces approached his southern Yemen stronghold of Aden. Earlier, Iran\\'s naval commander announced that two war ships were being deployed to the Gulf of Aden, in a move seen as raising tensions in the region. Habibollah Sajjari, though, said in remarks reported by Iran\\'s official Islamic Republic News Agency that the redeployment was meant only to protect commercial shipping lanes from the threat of attack by pirates. Meanwhile, the United States has warned Tehran against meddling in the conflict in Yemen. US Secretary of State John Kerry told the American public broadcaster PBS on Wednesday that Washington would stand by its allies in the Middle East, who in light of the current conflict in Yemen felt threatened by Iran. \"We\\'re not looking for confrontation, obviously, but we\\'re not going to step away from our alliances and our friendships and the need to stand with those who feel threatened as a consequence of the choices that Iran might be making,\" Kerry said. Situation in Aden \\'nearly catastrophic\\' Meanwhile, heavy fighting was reported on Wednesday between forces loyal to President Hadi and the Houthi rebels who are still trying to take control of the southern port of Aden, which relief workers have warned is facing a humanitarian catastrophe. A spokesperson of for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in Yemen told the Reuters news agency that the situation in Aden was \"nearly catastrophic.\" \"Shops are closed, so people cannot get food, they cannot get water. There are still dead bodies in the street. Hospitals are extremely exhausted,\" Marie Claire Feghali said. Another aid organization, Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), though, said a ship carrying 2.5 tonnes of medicine had docked in Aden\\'s port on Wednesday, marking the first medicinal aid shipment since the fighting broke out in the city three weeks ago. The ICRC also said that a surgical team had arrived by boat in Aden. pfd/jil (Reuters, dpa, AP)',\n",

A DW film team has been following him around the world for more than a year. A lonely rubber boat is drifting in the Aegean Sea between Turkey and Greece. In it, Ai Weiwei. He cannot swim. Is this performance art? \"We are all refugees,\" he says. Ai Weiwei displays his solidarity with the refugees and goes to meet them in Greece, Turkey and Gaza, producing a major documentary on the way. His current works deal with the fate of refugees, turning their abandoned boats, life vests and discarded clothing into memorials. Flight and exile have been constant themes in his life. He is currently writing his memoirs, set for publication in 20 languages. His father, a well-known poet, fell into disfavor during Mao\\'s Cultural Revolution and Ai Weiwei grew up in exile. As the Einstein Visiting Professor at Berlin\\'s University of the Arts, he also sets his students project work on the refugee issue. But when Ai Weiwei imitated the photo of the dead refugee boy Alan Kurdi with his own body, many thought he was going too far. Was it sensationalism? Provocation? \"Oh,\" he seemed to say, \"so now you care?\" Ai Weiwei recognizes no boundaries. Our film gets close to him and gives us an insight into his artistic work as well as his private life - with his mother in Beijing, with his son and partner in Berlin and in moments never before shown on film. But a lot about him remains a riddle. Just who exactly is Ai Weiwei?

       " {'story': 'Turkey summons German envoy for second time in two days Ankara has summoned Germany\\'s ambassador for the second time in as many days with tensions between the two countries showing no sign of ending. It is the 17th time Berlin\\'s envoy has been summoned in two years. Germany\\'s ambassador to Ankara was called in to Turkey\\'s Foreign Ministry on Monday just 48 hours after responding to a previous summons over the weekend, German officials said. German Foreign Office spokesman Martin Schäfer confirmed the summons, but did not elaborate on what the reason was. The spokesman noted, however, that it was the 17th time Ambassador Martin Erdmann had received such an order since he began his tenure as Berlin\\'s envoy to Ankara in 2015. Read more: Can Merkel push the EU toward a new Turkey policy? Schäfer noted that the number of summonses that Erdmann had received was \"very unusual\" between \"partners within NATO.\" German news magazine Der Spiegel reported that Erdmann was summoned over a German parliamentary motion last year that declared the 1915 massacre of Armenians by Ottoman forces as a genocide. Turkey has long fiercely rejected the term. Read more: Turkey: Is Germany Recep Tayyip Erdogan\\'s \\'best enemy?\\' Summons over Kurdish rally Erdmann was previously summoned on Saturday over a Kurdish festival that was held in the western German city of Cologne. The slogan of the festival referred to Abdullah Oclan, the jailed leader of the Kurdistan Workers\\' Party (PKK) which has been designated as a terrorist group in the European Union and Turkey. Turkey\\'s Foreign Ministry said on Saturday that the country\\'s condemnation of the Cologne event was relayed to the German ambassador. Summoning an ambassador is one of the harshest diplomatic protest measures a country can order. Germany\\'s Foreign Office has also summoned Turkey\\'s ambassador multiple times – most recently over Turkey\\'s imprisonment of human rights activist Peter Steudtner. Relations between the two countries plummeted after a series of diplomatic crises that followed last year\\'s failed attempt to overthrow President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Berlin has strongly criticized Ankara\\'s post-coup crackdown that has seen over 50,000 people arrested. rs/kl (AFP, dpa)',\n",

       " {'story': 'Medvedev seeks investment at Davos economic forum More than 2,500 business leaders, lobbyists, economists and politicians have convened in the Swiss ski resort Davos for the World Economic Forum. Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev was among the first major speakers. Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev urged foreign investors to pump more capital into Russia in his keynote speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday. Medvedev said increased external investment was crucial for the government to meet its goal of raising annual economic growth figures from 3.5 percent to Moscow\\'s desired 5 percent. \"We have very ambitious goals in the investment field, to increase the volume of investment from 20 to 25 percent of GDP, to increase investment in transportation, in energy infrastructure … and foreign direct investment would be instrumental in achieving this goal,\" Medvedev said. Medvedev pointed to Russia joining the World Trade Organization as a sign of progress, but also acknowledged that his country might suffer from an image problem on the global stage. \\'Resilient dynamism\\' The Russian prime minister, whose country holds the rotating G20 presidency, was the first major political speaker at the economic summit, which runs through Saturday. German Chancellor Angela Merkel is to address some of the roughly 2,500 business leaders in the Swiss ski resort on Thursday afternoon, as will British Prime Minister David Cameron - who on Wednesday pledged an \"in/out\" UK referendum on EU membership, if he wins re-election. European Central Bank President Mario Draghi, International Monetary Fund head Christine Lagarde, Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti and Israeli President Shimon Peres are among the other major scheduled speakers. Organizers chose the 2013 motto \"resilient dynamism,\" saying it pointed to required improvements in the global economy so that it could better cope with issues like the ongoing sovereign debt difficulties in the eurozone.

       " {'story': \"Ex-CIA fugitive Robert Seldon Lady detained in Panama Former CIA station chief Robert Seldon Lady has been detained in Panama. In 2009 he was convicted in absentia in Italy of kidnapping a Muslim cleric in what was the first trial involving the CIA's rendition program Former CIA Milan base chief Robert Seldon Lady has been detained in Panama, Panamanian and Italian officials said late Thursday. Interpol had issued a request for Lady's arrest. It was not immediately clear where Lady would be taken as Italy and Panama have no bilateral extradition treaty. In 2009, an Italian judge sentenced 23 CIA employees, including Lady, in absentia for the abduction of the Egyptian cleric Osama Moustafa Hassan Nasr. The imam, also known as Abu Omar, was taken from a Milan street in 2003 and flown to Egypt for interrogation, where he claims he was tortured. Lady had left Italy early into the Italian investigation and retired from the CIA. He was handed a nine-year jail term, which merits an extradition request under Italian legal guidelines. It was the first trial in the world involving the CIA's extraordinary rendition program. Such renditions, which most famously took terror suspects to the US detainment facility at Guantanamo Bay, were part of the policies launched in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks by then-US President George W. Bush. In February, Italy's former military intelligence chief, Nicolo Pollari, was sentenced to 10 years in prison for his role in the kidnapping. hc/av (Reuters, AP)\",\n",

       " {'story': 'Nearly 10,000 migrants rescued on Mediterranean in two days Italy witnessed a surge of migrant arrivals at the end of August amid favorable weather conditions on the sea. Rome has warned would-be migrants of the perils of the deadly voyage after 3,000 died this year. The Italian coastguard on Tuesday rescued some 3,000 migrants in the Strait of Sicily with the aid of the EU\\'s border agency Frontex and humanitarian organizations, bringing the total to nearly 10,000 in two days. Italy has witnessed a surge in migrant arrivals due to favorable weather conditions on the central Mediterranean Sea, with Monday marking one of the highest single-day rescue operations. \"Nearly 7,000 people in a day is really quite a lot. If it\\'s not a record, then it\\'s close to it,\" said International Organization for Migration (IOM) spokesman Flavio Di Giacomo. More than 100,000 migrants have made the perilous journey across the central Mediterranean in 2016, many of them fleeing conflict and extreme poverty in Africa and the Middle East. Some 3,000 of them are estimated to have died during the journey this year. However, the number of migrants arriving to the EU has fallen compared to the same period last year. IOM said some 12,600 people made it to the bloc in August, down from 23,500 in the same month last year. In July, Italy\\'s interior ministry launched a media campaign in partnership with IOM in a bid to dissuade African migrants from making the deadly journey across the Mediterranean. The \"Migrants Aware\" campaign featured content in English, Arabic and French, and targeted 15 countries in North and sub-Saharan Africa. However, thousands of migrants continue to make the voyage since the campaign was launched. More than 1 million migrants fled to Europe in 2015, according to IOM figures, prompting a political crisis among EU member states as to which countries will host them. ls/gsw (Reuters, dpa)',\n",

       " {'story': 'Parents of US hostage Kayla Jean Mueller issue appeal to \\'IS\\' captors The parents of a US humanitarian aid worker who her captors claim was killed in a Jordanian airstrike have said they are hopeful that she is still alive. They have also asked their daughter\\'s captors to contact them. Carl and Marsha Mueller, the parents of 26-year-old Kayla Jean Mueller, released a statement on Friday in which they appealed to \"Islamic State\" (IS) militants, who have claimed to be holding their daughter, to contact them privately. The statement came after the jihadis claimed earlier in the day that Kayla Jean Mueller had been killed in an airstrike by Jordanian fighter jets on the building where she was being held captive in the Syrian city of Raqqa. \"This news leaves us concerned, yet, we are still hopeful that Kayla is alive,\" the parents said in the statement. Addressing directly \"those in positions of responsibility for holding Kayla,\" the parents said: \"You told us that you treated Kayla as your guest, as your guest her safety and well-being remains your responsibility.\" Mueller, of the US state of Arizona, had been working for a humanitarian aid organization when she was seized by IS militants while leaving a hospital in the northern Syrian city of Aleppo in August 2013. No US confirmation US officials said on Friday that they were unable to confirm the IS claim that Mueller had been killed. \"We are obviously deeply concerned by these reports. We have not at this time seen any evidence that corroborates ISIL\\'s claim,\" National Security Council spokeswoman Bernadette Meehan said, referring to the IS by an acronym that they previously used. Jordan, meanwhile, questioned the jihadist group\\'s claim. The country\\'s foreign minister, Nasser Judeh, used his Twitter account to reject the claim as \"an old and sick trick used by terrorists and despots for decades: claiming that hostages human shields held captive are killed by air raids.\" Jordan, a member of the US-led coalition involved in an air campaign against IS militants in Syria and northern Iraq, stepped up its air strikes on IS after the jihadists posted a video on the Internet earlier this week showing captured Jordanian pilot Muath al-Kasseasbeh being burned alive in a cage. pfd/sms (Reuters, AFP)',\n",

       " {'story': 'Air Berlin Executives Accused of Insider Trading German prosecutors said on Tuesday that they had raided the homes and offices of top executives of German low-cost carrier Air Berlin as part of an investigation into possible insider trading. About 50 police officers and employees of the financial sector watchdog BaFin had searched a total of 10 premises in Berlin, Stuttgart, Munich, Düsseldorf and Langenfeld on Tuesday morning as part of the probe, the Stuttgart public prosecutors said in a statement. The investigation centered on at least five officials, including chief executive Joachim Hunold, and supervisory board head Johannes Zurnieden, they added. The insider trading allegations are connected with Air Berlin\\'s takeover of rival airline DBA last year. \"There is a suspicion that the accused made use of insider knowledge over the planned takeover of a Munich-based airline by a Berlin-based airline,\" the prosecutors\\' statement said. Effect on stock price was unclear The company officials are suspected of having bought around 1.5 million euros ($2.0 million) of Air Berlin shares in June 2006, shortly after having signed a confidentiality agreement and just before takeover talks began. Hunold and Zurnieden are suspected of having bought 1.47 million euros worth of shares alone, the prosecutors said. Hunold, a media-savvy businessman who has led the airline\\'s rapid expansion, confirmed he was among those named in the inquiry and issued a statement denying the allegations. \"There was no knowing how much or even if the share price of Air Berlin would rise after the announcement,\" he said. \"I first bought shares at the start of June 2006 when a lock-up period imposed on me under stock-exchange rules had expired.\" He said all the purchases had been duly reported to financial regulators and disclosed online. \"Absurd inquiry\" Air Berlin spokesman Peter Hauptvogel added that the shares were bought well before Air Berlin decided to buy DBA, a move that sent the Berlin airline\\'s stocks soaring. Hauptvogel, who said searches were also made at the homes of the suspects, described the inquiry as \"absurd,\" adding that it involved relatively modest sums of money. Air Berlin, Germany\\'s second largest airline after Lufthansa, acquired DBA in August 2006 in a bid to take on flag carrier Lufthansa in the fierce battle for domination in the skies above Germany.',\n",

He also made a number of contacts in France and was looking for weapons, tipping off investigators, RTBF reported. Belgium remains on high alert There was no apparent connection with the attacks at Brussels airport and the city\\'s metro on March 22, in which 32 people were killed, the prosecution office said. Nor were weapons or explosives found in the raids ordered by the judge specializing in counterterror cases Belgian authorities last month charged two men with terrorist offenses amid reports of a planned attack on a Euro 2016 fanzone in central Brussels.

       " {'story': 'Shell sells North Sea oil fields to rival group  Royal Dutch Shell has agreed to sell 3.6 billion euros ($3.8 billion) worth of its North Sea assets to oil explorer Chrysaor as part of its debt restructuring plan aimed at adapting to lower oil prices. Ten Shell-owned oil fields in the North Sea will go to smaller rival group Chrysaor under the deal, reducing the anglo-dutch energy giant\\'s output by over half. Some 400 employees are expected to transfer to Chrysaor. The transaction, which is still subject to regulators\\' approval, is slated for completion in the second half of 2017. The move is an integral part of Shell\\'s strategy to adapt to lower oil prices and pay off debt in the wake of its massive takeover of rival BG group. \"This deal shows the clear momentum behind Shell\\'s global, value-driven $30 billion divestment program,\" said Simon Henry, Shell\\'s chief financial officer, adding that the \"value here represents a profit against the book values of the assets, and a breakeven oil price above that for the BG acquisition.\" Shell took over BG Group for $52.6 billion last year, increasing its proven reserves by 25 percent. Many critics questioned the logic of the move at a time when oil prices hit 12-year lows amid slowing economic growth in China and increased production in the US. Oil prices have since rebounded somewhat, with Brent crude currently back above $50 a barrel. hch/uhe (AP, DPA)',\n",

       " {'story': \"Opinion: The biggest loser of the polls is Europe itself Europe has voted and not even half of the electorate bothered to cast their vote. That's shameful. So little commitment for the only democratically-elected institution of the European Union is alarming. The supranational parliament of 27 states is unparalleled in the world. But this unique chance doesn't seem to matter at all to most Europeans. It's not just lazy voters who are to blame for the debacle, European politicians are also largely to blame. As is normally the case, 27 national election campaigns were fought, with little evidence of any specific European election campaigns. At home politicians tend to lay into those politicians in Brussels, although they often share responsibility for decisions taken at EU level. In Eastern Europe's younger democracies the situation is even worse. There seems to be no comprehension of how important the European Parliament is in all areas of daily life. As in previous EU elections, governments are punished with only a few exceptions. The results of the European elections themselves point towards continuity. Victory for the conservative and center-right parties. The Socialists remain the second strongest force and the liberals stay the third strongest block. The Euro-sceptics and right-wing extremists might have caused uproar in a few countries, but they do not play a large role in the general make-up of the European Parliament. Even if they were to form into a parliamentary grouping, they do not have any major influence. EU Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso has even reason to celebrate. The conservative politician can remain in office for another five years, because it's usually the case that the Commission President comes from the same political family as the majority party represented in parliament. In the largest EU member state, Germany, it was the same story as in the rest of the EU. National topics dominated the scene. The election winners from the conservative CDU, the Left Party, the liberal FDP and the Greens declared the election a test for the federal polls in September. The election losers, the Social Democrats, though, dismiss any idea that Sunday’s outcome will affect the national vote. It's the same old story after every election. But because of the exceptionally low electoral turnout it is indeed hard to make a reliable prediction for Germany's upcoming national elections. One thing's for certain: The election loser is Europe, because far too many voters are not interested in European politics. Author: Bernd Riegert Editor: Andreas Illmer\",\n",

       " {'story': 'Final four square off in German Cup semifinals Bremen\\'s unprecedented four-match battle with Hamburg gets underway with the Cup semifinal on Wednesday. But before that Leverkusen try to seize their last chance for some silverware against Mainz. Among the high hopes Leverkusen carried into this season, one is still alive. If they can get past second-division Mainz, the underachieving squad will book a place in the Cup finals in Berlin on May 30. After topping the table for parts of the first half of the season, coach Bruno Labbadia\\'s charges have been wretched of late, winning only three of their last 10 matches and dropping down to ninth in the league. One reason is that, with their own stadium undergoing renovations, they\\'ve had to play their home matches in Duesseldorf. That\\'s also the case with Tuesday\\'s semifinal. Still, Leverkusen have to fancy their chances -- with no major injury problems against an opponent from Division Two. And winning the Cup would go a long way toward salvaging a disappointing season and probably save Labbadia\\'s job. Mainz, for their part, are certain to pack defenders into their own half and hope for a late goal, a strategy that worked well in their quarterfinal upset of first-division Schalke in early March. Epic rivalry The other Cup finalist will be determined when Bremen travel to Hamburg on Wednesday. It\\'s the first of a four-game series between the Northern German rivals -- with a UEFA Cup semifinal tie and a league match to follow later in April and in May. Bremen, who have slipped down to tenth in the Bundesliga table, have been on cruise control in the league. But it will be a different story in the two cup competitions, with titles and a spot in international competition up for grabs. Bremen goalkeeper Tim Wiese has promised his side will try to \"get on Hamburg\\'s nerves\" and win all four matches. The visitors will be bolstered by the return of superstar playmaker Diego who was rested with a perhaps fictional injury in the league last weekend. Hamburg, meanwhile, are third in the league and have an outside shot at winning a triple. But they should beware, if they think they\\'re bound to be victorious in something. As recently as 2002, Leverkusen had a chance to win the Bundesliga, the Cup and the Champions League -- only to emerge, in the end, empty-handed. Author: Jefferson Chase Editor: Trinity Hartman',\n",

       " {'story': 'November sees first pan-Iberian anti-austerity strike Spanish trade unionists have called a general strike against Madrid\\'s austerity program. The protests will coincide with a similar strike in neighboring Portugal to make it the first concerted Iberian labor action. The Spanish trade union confederation CCOO called Friday for a general strike for November 14, saying it would be directed at Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy\\'s recent austerity policies. The labor action will coincide with a general strike in neighboring Portugal, prompting organizers to speak of the first joint Iberian workers protest. \"The strike has good chances of spreading to other European countries, especially in the south,\" CCOO representative Fernando Leczano told reporters in Madrid. Leczano insisted that all EU countries that have applied austerity measures have become worse for it and said the strike in November was aimed at forcing governments to modify their economic and budgetary policies. Government not amused In a first response to the announcement, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said the strike would not improve the image of his country abroad. Though he acknowledged that people are concerned about the government\\'s harsh cuts, Rajoy insisted that the measures are required to wriggle out of recession. \"We do it because it must be done, and because it will create the basis for economic recovery,\" Rajoy said on the sidelines of an EU reform summit in Brussels. Madrid had announced the toughest budget cuts in decades in a bid to reduce public deficit from 9.4 percent of gross domestic product last year to 6.3 percent in 2012. Spain has slipped into recession for the second time in three years. The government\\'s reforms aim to convince investors that the country can pull itself up by its bootstraps without a full-blown sovereign bailout by European lenders. hg/mkg (dpa, AP)',\n",

Having a Hausdrache (lit: house dragon) in the household is quite a different matter! A Drache is a mythical beast which spits fire, battles knights in shining armour, and steals beautiful princesses. A Hausdrache is equally unpleasant and describes a domineering housewife. \"Take your shoes off, I just cleaned the floor,\" \"don’t talk with your mouth full,\" \"go and tidy your room,\" she shouts angrily.

       " {'story': 'Austrian foreign minister suggests \\'refugees should be held offshore\\' Austria\\'s foreign minister has suggested that the EU\\'s refugees be interned offshore rather than allowed on to the continent. He said the EU should look to the Australian example of dealing with migrant entries. Austrian Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz (photo) of the rightist Austrian People\\'s Party told a newspaper that Australia\\'s immigration policy should be replicated by the EU in order to deal with the current influx of refugees. Migrants who try to reach Australia by boat are turned back or sent to internment camps in the Pacific Ocean countries of Nauru and Papua New Guinea where they are held indefinitely while their cases are processed. The system has been criticized by human rights groups amidst reports of rape and suicides among detainees. \"The Australian model of course cannot be completely replicated but its principles can be applied in Europe,\" Kurz, who at 29 years old is Europe\\'s youngest minister, told Die Presse in an interview published Sunday. Australia makes zero exceptions Kurz commented that in the first half of the 20th century the United States held new arrivals on Ellis Island as they travelled to New York. In fact, Ellis Island was an immigration inspection station that processed thousands of new arrivals every day. Immigrants were only held in the station\\'s infirmaries if they were suspected of carrying infectious diseases but otherwise were not interned, as the minister suggested. But in an apparent attempt to stake out a tough approach to refugees, Kurz told the newspaper that the EU should adopt a resolution whereby those who try to enter Europe illegally lose their right to demand asylum. Far-right parties have made sweeping gains in recent Austrian elections. Austria, governed by a coalition of social-democrats and conservatives, allowed some 90,000 asylum seekers to enter the Alpine country last year. But Vienna has since hardened its conditions of asylum and tried to close the migrant route from Greece to the north of Europe via the Balkans. At least 204,000 migrants and refugees have crossed the Mediterranean to Europe since January, the United Nations refugee agency said this week. More than 2,500 people have died trying to make the sea crossing as Europe faces the largest wave of migration since World War II. jar/jm (AFP)',\n",

       " {'story': 'Open EU to African goods, German development minister says Completely opening up the EU market to African goods would help reduce migration, German Development Minister Gerd Müller has said. In particular, he wants barriers to agricultural trade taken down.   The European Union should completely open its market to products from Africa in order to promote development and stem migration flows, German Development Minister Gerd Müller said Wednesday. \"Open the market for all African goods,\" he told Die Welt newspaper in an interview. Read more: African countries agree to continental free trade area Agricultural products from Africa must be able to enter the EU without tariffs and quotas in order to provide work for millions of people on the continent, Müller said. The EU currently has separate trade agreements with African countries or regional economic blocs. In addition to tariffs and quotas, agricultural products face a hurdle being exported due to the EU\\'s strict sanitary and phytosanitary standards. Müller also suggested that as part of an agreement with the EU, African countries should take back migrants who entered the bloc without proper approval. In return, the EU should open up avenues for Africans to come to the EU for legal employment. Only around 1,000 out of 3.5 million German companies are active in Africa, Müller said, highlighting the massive potential in the continent of 1.2 billion people. On the other hand, China, Russia and Turkey have aggressively entered the Africa market. Read more: Africa needs unified regulations against cheap Chinese imports Support from coalition, farmers Müller, a member of the Christian Social Union (CSU), the Bavarian sister party of Chancellor Angela Merkel\\'s Christian Democratic Union (CDU), received support for his ideas from the Social Democrats (SPD). SPD agriculture spokesperson Bernd Westphal told the daily Berliner Zeitung on Thursday that opening the EU\\'s agriculture markets would improve employment prospects in Africa and reduce migration pressures. Read more: Undocumented African migration to Germany: What can and should be done The German Farmers Association also supported the idea of duty- and quota-free African agriculture exports to the EU. At the same time, the association\\'s general secretary, Bernhard Krüsken, said processed and value-added agriculture products should be encouraged because they provide more employment and wealth creation. EU Africa Commissioner Müller also called for a new EU Africa commissioner position to be created to coordinate and expand policy towards the continent. In addition, at the EU level more money should be spent implementing the bloc\\'s Africa policy, he said. cw/sms (AFP, dpa)',\n",

       " {'story': 'Heaven\\'s Meadow - The Small Wonders of Baan Gerda A German former executive turns a dream into reality, using donated funding to build a village for HIV-infected orphans. The global death rate is mounting rapidly for HIV-infected children and teenagers, many of them AIDS orphans. On June, 27, 2007, DW-TV will be airing a documentary on this important topic and at the same time presenting an extraordinary project: \"Heaven\\'s Meadow - The Small Wonders of Baan Gerda\", by Detlev F. Neufert, a film-maker in Berlin. In 2002, former Henkel executive Karl Morsbach and his wife Tassanee started a project intended to help AIDS orphans live with dignity for the time alloted to them. Many of them had been turned out of their home communities and were already resigned to their fate. But then something unexpected happened: the children lived. Now Baan Gerda is a thriving village in Thailand. The Morsbachs follow the principle that only a child who\\'s happy has a chance of recovery. They found loving surrogate parents for the AIDS orphans and built a village for them to live in. The mothers and fathers are also HIV-positive and have found a new meaning for lives in their new roles. Since 2002, nine residences, a small hospital, a \"star house\" with a large kitchen, a playground and a guest house have been built in Baan Gerda. Altogether, they make up a loving and well-maintained environment where both children and adults fighting AIDS can live in safety and security. Baan Gerda, or \"Gerdas Village\", named after Karl Morsbach\\'s mother, can stand as an example internationally. It demonstrates how AIDS orphans can live as normal, well-looked-after children with comparatively little expense and lots of love. This documentary was started on a loan of 3000 euros, and a third of its budget was covered by sponsors, making this production a little miracle in itself. It took a total of 26 months to make. Film-maker Detlev F. Neufert: \"The \\'Baan Gerda\\' project can help save the lives of AIDS orphans. The documentary serves as their ambassador.\"',\n",

       " {'story': 'Estonian couple arrested for giving secrets to Russia A husband and wife duo was arrested in Estonia under suspicion of delivering state secrets to Russia over a period of several years. A man who worked for many years in Estonia\\'s security police was arrested along with his wife on Wednesday for allegedly turning over state secrets to Russia. Aleksei and Viktoria Dressen were arrested at Tallinn Airport as they prepared to board a flight for Moscow. Aleksei Dressen has worked in Estonia\\'s counter-espionage and anti-terrorism force for nearly 20 years. As a member of the security police, Dressen had access to state secrets, but prosecutors did not say what those may have been. \"Dressen is suspected of collecting classified information for years and was caught with evidence,\" state prosecutor Norman Aas told reporters in the capital Tallinn. \"His wife was also arrested Wednesday morning at Tallinn airport as the couple planned to board a Tallinn-Moscow flight.\" Dressen\\'s wife does not work for the government but allegedly acted as a courier, brining classified documents to agents with the Russian security agency, the FSB. According to prosecutors, the 44-year-old Aleksei Dressen could face a prison sentence of three to 15 years in prison if found guilty of treason. Tensions between Russia and the former Soviet satellite are tense. After gaining its independence in 1991 following 50 years of rule from Moscow, Estonia joined the European Union and NATO in 2004. In 2009, Estonian Herman Simm was convicted of treason and sentenced to twelve and a half years in prison for selling NATO secrets to Russia. mz/acb (AP, Reuters, AFP)',\n",

       " {'story': 'Russian experts open black box of jet downed by Turkey Moscow has begun examining the contents of the black box from the jet that was shot down by Turkey last month. Ankara said the Russian Su-24 jet was violating its airspace. Technicians in Moscow used screwdrivers, drills and vacuum cleaners to open the black box on Friday, as diplomats from Britain, India and China witnessed the procedure that was broadcast on state television. Fourteen countries were invited to observe the investigation, Sergei Dronov, deputy chief of the Russian air force, told journalists. \"We have sufficient evidence that proves that the Russian aircraft did not violate Turkish airspace,\" Dronov said, adding that the warplane had been flying in Syrian airspace and within 5.5 kilometers (three miles) of the Turkish border. Results of the examination would be revealed on December 21, he announced. Russian officials retrieved the black box after Syria\\'s special forces \"liberated\" rebel-held territory where the warplane was shot down by Turkey, Russia\\'s Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said earlier this month. Russian President Vladimir Putin also said the black box would help reveal the exact position of the flight and where it was downed. Ankara said the Russian plane strayed into its territory despite repeated warnings, but Moscow maintains that the jet did not cross the Syrian border with Turkey. Russia accused Turkey of provoking it deliberately and described the event as a \"stab in the back.\" Putin also said it was \"practically impossible\" to overcome tensions with Ankara after this event. mg/sms (AP, AFP)',\n",

       " {'story': 'FAO: World food prices \\'stabilizing at high level\\' The United Nations\\' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has registered the first drop in global food prices in April after months of increases. Record crops this year are expected to meet rising global food demand. World food prices were stabilizing at a \"relatively high level\" in April, after they had been steadily rising in the first three months of the year, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said Thursday. FAO\\'s Food Outlook - a twice-yearly global market analysis - said food prices fell by 1.4 percent from March to April this year, driving down the organization\\'s Food Price Index to 214 points from 217 points registered in the previous month. The FAO index measures monthly price changes for a food basket containing cereals, oilseeds, dairy products sugar and meat. \"Although the index is significantly down from its record level of 235 points in April 2011, it is still well above the figures of under 200 which preceded the 2008 food crisis,\" FAO said in a statement. In its forecast for the coming 12 month, FAO predicts generally higher food supplies, but also rising demand for various agricultural produce. Unstable prices The FAO wouldn\\'t rule out that in spite of expected record crops for the 2012/2013 harvest season, prices could rise again because strong demand would fall on low initial stocks. While 2012 cereals production was forecast to reach a new record with 2.37 billion tons, wheat production - a part of the cereals sector - is expected to fall 3.6 percent due to large declines in Ukraine, Kazakhstan, China, Morocco and the EU, the FAO report said. In addition, global soybean prices, which are already at their highest since July 2008, are likely to \"rise further\" as a result of tight supplies on the back of \"continuous purchases\" from the world\\'s biggest buyer China, FAO analyst Abdolreza Abbassian told Reuters news agency. Abbassian added that further support for higher soybean prices would come from a 9.5 percent drop in output predicted for 2012 as soybeans would have to compete with maize for cropland especially in the United States. The FAO reports said that higher prices in the coming months were also due for oil crops and derived products which had been rising since the beginning of the year, facing an \"increasingly tight\" supply and demand situation. Steady or even falling prices the FAO predicts for rice, sugar and meat production as well as for milk and fishery products - sectors which are all in for substantial production growth in the coming months. uhe/gb (dpa, Reuters)',\n",

       " {'story': 'Libyan militias clash in Tripoli Rival armed groups battled in a central area of Tripoli, setting fire to a former intelligence building. The clash is one of the worst breakdowns in security in the capital since Moammar Gadhafi’s fall in 2011. Armed men sealed off roads near Zawiyah Street, which was at the heart of the battle between two rival groups, residents said. \"Five people have sustained gunshot wounds in these clashes,\" a medical official at Zawiyah Street Medical Center said, adding that there had been no fatalities. Night-time clashes between rival groups are not unusual in the capital, which is still saturated with arms left over from the 2011 conflict that brought to an end Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi\\'s 42-year rule. The violence underscored the challenge faced by Libya\\'s new government in controlling militias that gained power during the conflict. By early afternoon, a building belonging to the Supreme Security Committee (SSC), which was set up last year to try to regulate armed groups, was in flames and being looted by members of a rival militia, witnesses said. The head of the SSC, Mohammed Suweysi, said one of the militias attacked the other, accusing its members of detaining a man from their neighborhood and beating him to death. \"We called the police early in the morning to help us stop the shooting, but no one came,\" resident Khaled Mohamed told Reuters. After more than 12 hours, the army moved in to restore order. On Sunday, violence also erupted outside the capital, where a car bomb exploded in front of a police station in Benghazi. Injuring three police officers, the incident is the latest in a series of attacks on security officials in Libya\\'s second largest city, where the US ambassador was killed in September. hc/rc (Reuters, AFP, AP)',\n",

       " {'story': 'Gunman kills three in shooting at South Korean store Police in South Korea say a gunman killed three people at a convenience store then set it on fire before fleeing. He was later found dead from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. Authorities say the man shot and killed a 74-year-old man and his 50-year-old son connected to the store\\'s owners, as well as another 52-year-old man, in the attack on Wednesday. The shop is located in Sejong City, around 120 kilometers (75 miles) from the South Korean capital Seoul. Many of the country\\'s government offices are located in the area. In a news conference, the head of the Sejong Police Agency, Lee Ja-ha, stated that the 50-year-old gunman\\'s body was discovered on a nearby riverbank, in an apparent suicide. One shotgun was found on the man, and another in his car. Lee described the attack as \"a pre-meditated crime caused by a combination of spurned affection and a row over how to divide property.\" The daughter of the eldest victim told police she had been living with the gunman before ending the relationship around 18 months ago. They had recently fought over financial issues, with him claiming he had a stake in the store. The woman had since moved in with the 52-year-old victim. She was not present at the time of the shootings. The assailant had taken the guns from a police station in the nearby city of Gongju in central South Korea, about two hours before the shooting took place. South Korean citizens can acquire licenses for weapons used to hunt animals, but these must be stored in police stations during the off-season. Lee confirmed that the shotguns used in the killings belonged to the man, who had obtained the required licenses for them last year. Sejong police said the suspect shot the son as he sat in a car in front of the store, then went into a house next door and killed the father. Once he entered the store he gunned down the other man before pouring paint thinner on the floor, and setting it alight. The Asian nation\\'s level of gun crime is extremely low, with strict laws around gun possession. Wednesday\\'s shootings received wide coverage across news agencies nationwide. In recent years there have been several shooting deaths among soldiers, including an incident in June last year where five members of one unit were killed and seven wounded, in an attack near the border with North Korea. Under South Korean law all men have to serve two years in the military. an/sms (AP, AFP, DPA)',\n",

       " {'story': 'Germany to Send Intelligence Agents to India to Aid Terror Fight Germany plans to send intelligence agents to India as part of efforts to step up cooperation in the fight against terrorism, German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said Friday, Dec. 12. The two countries wanted to improve the exchange of information, the minister said after talks with Home Affairs Minister P Chidambaram and national security adviser MK Narayanan in New Delhi. Schaeuble said he had asked Indian authorities to allow Germany\\'s anti-terrorism unit GSG 9 to make an intensive inspection of the scenes of last month\\'s terrorist attacks in Mumbai. Germany would be prepared to help India in the fight against terrorist in any way it could, the minister said. Schaeuble said the Pakistan militant Lashkar-e-Taiba, which has been blamed for the attacks in Mumbai, had members in Germany, although the group had no organizational infrastructure there. The minister said there were no indications the group was plotting to target Germany despite \"obvious links\" to the Islamic Jihad Union, an Uzbek group accused of planning attacks on German soil. India has accused Pakistan of being behind the Mumbai bloodbath, which left more than 170 dead. The aim of the terrorists was to provoke India and increase tension with Pakistan, Schaeuble said. Internet terrorists an integral part of network In other security developments, Germany\\'s prosecutor general said that Islamists who post fierce messages on the internet along with bomb-making instructions are becoming a key part of international terrorism. The internet served as a means of communications between different terrorist groups and as a source of information on how to mount attacks, Monika Harms said in Karlsruhe. \"The internet has become the home handyman store for the do-it-yourself terrorist,\" said Harms at a news conference. \"The desk man in front of a personal computer has become an essential component of the global jihad,\" she said, referring to the Arabic term for \"struggle.\" She said this had been proven with a trio of men detained in Germany earlier this year on suspicion of planning bombings. Her office is also investigating a German-language Islamist site, the Global Islamic Media Front (GIMF), and seeks to prosecute its writers on the serious charge of supporting of terrorism. Half the group are said to be German converts to Islam. This week, magistrates released two of the GIMF suspects on bail.',\n",

Republican primary presidential contender Mitt Romney won Washington state\\'s caucuses, giving the former Massachusetts governor renewed momentum in the run up to the 10 primary contests being held across the US on Tuesday. \"I\\'m heartened to have won the Washington caucuses, and I thank the voters for their support today,\" Romney said in a posting on Twitter and Facebook, after US broadcasters CNN, ABC and CBS projected him the winner. He took 37 percent, leading the other Republican contenders by double digits with 93 percent of the vote counted. Texas Congressman Ron Paul and former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum were in a virtual dead heat for second place with 25 and 24 percent respectively, while former House speaker Newt Gingrich trailed with 11 percent. In addition to Washington state, Romney bagged wins in Michigan, Arizona and Wyoming this week. In a volatile primary race, the former governor has won six states overall, compared to four victories for Santorum and one for Gingrich. Paul has not won a state yet. The four candidates are battling to clinch the Republican nomination and face off against President Barack Obama in November. The candidates now head into so-called Super Tuesday, in which 10 states are holding primary contests, with 400 delegates up for grabs. In order to win the Republican nomination, a candidate has to secure 1,144 delegates. Romney currently has 150 delegates, while his closest rival, Santorum, has 70. There were 40 delegates at stake in the Washington caucuses. slk, ncy/ai (AP, Reuters, AFP)',\n",

FC Kaiserslautern came away 1-0 victors over Borussia Mönchengladbach in the Bundesliga on Friday night after Gladbach keeper Logan Bailly gifted the visitors an own goal just past the 60-minute mark. A poor clearance by the Belgian goalie gave away a corner to Kaiserslautern midfielder Christian Tiffert, which Bailly then punched into his own net. Both teams began the match cautiously and chances were hard to come by in the first half. Kaiserslautern's Rodnei cleared a Martin Stranzl shot off the line and minutes later at the other end the Brazilian defender almost scored when his header hit team mate Mathias Abel. Christian Tiffert then went close with a low drive for the visitors. Gladbach's increasingly desperate attempts for an equalizer late in the match failed to trouble goalkeeper Kevin Trapp, playing in his second Bundesliga game. Marco Reus was unable to get to a cross from Mike Hanke for a late equalizer. Bottom-placed Gladbach had come into the match in desperate need of all three points to keep alive their hopes of avoiding relegation with only seven rounds remaining. Mired on 23 points, they now face the prospect of falling five points behind the pack in the hunt for safety should results not fall their way. Kaiserslautern, meanwhile, move up to 12th place on 31 points ahead of the remaining games to be played over the weekend. Author: Darren Mara (AFP, AP) Editor: Joanna Impey\",\n",

       " {'story': 'Kim Jong Un says ICBM testing in \\'final stage\\' North Korea is close to developing an intercontinental ballistic missile after several nuclear tests, said the state\\'s leader Kim Jong Un. He also urged the US to stop their \"anachronistic\" policy towards his country. The isolated state has \"soared\" as a nuclear power, Kim Jong Un said in his New Year\\'s address on Sunday. North Korea was now a \"military power of the East that cannot be touched by even the strongest enemy,\" said Kim. The nation was preparing a test launch of an international ballistic missile, and the process has already \"reached the final stage,\" he insisted. Pyongyang has far conducted five nuclear tests, shrugging off international sanctions which aggravated the already poor economic situation in a tragically impoverished country. North Korea claims one of those tests was for a hydrogen-based weapon. Many experts dispute the claim, saying that all weapons tested were comparably less destructive atom bombs. There have also been contrasting reports on Pyongyang\\'s ability to miniaturize a nuclear warhead and mount it on a missile. An ICBM projectile, armed with a small nuclear warhead, could potentially be used by North Korea against targets on US soil. In the address broadcast on Sunday, Kim praised \"marvelous feats\" aimed at boosting the North Korean military power. At the same time, he said efforts should be made to defuse the possibility of another Korean war between Pyongyang and Seoul. He also stressed the importance of building the economy under a five-year plan first published in May. Commenting on the US, Kim he called on Washington to make a \"resolute decision to withdraw its anachronistic hostile North Korea policy.\" Despite President-elect Donald Trump saying he might consider meeting with the communist leader, such a move seems unlikely. North Korean defector Thae Yong Ho, who served as deputy ambassador in London before defecting in 2016, has said that Kim was preparing a \"prime time\" nuclear weapons push to take advantage of leadership changes in Washington and Seoul. dj/rc (AP, AFP, dpa, Reuters)',\n",

He was found dead early on Sunday in his hotel room in Udine, where the team was due to play a Serie A match.  Fiorentina captain and defender Davide Astori died of a sudden illness on Sunday morning at the age of 31, the Serie A club said, leaving Italian football in a state of shock. Italian media reported that Astori was found by his team-mates in the early hours in his hotel room in Udine, where the team was staying ahead of an Italian league match. The German news agency DPA said the cause of death appeared to be cardiac arrest. The center back had just become a father two weeks ago. Fiorentina released a brief statement saying it is \"profoundly shaken\" by Astori\\'s death. \"For this terrible and delicate situation, and above all out of respect for his family, we appeal to the sensitivity of the media,\" the club said. Former Italy Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, a former mayor of Florence, said Astori\\'s passing \"seems impossible,\" adding that he was \"in a state of disbelief and I cry with his family and all for Fiorentina.\" Football\\'s world governing body FIFA said everyone within Italian football was huddling around Astori\\'s family. Astori joined Fiorentina on loan in August 2015 and the club signed him outright a year later. He previously spent six seasons at Cagliari and one on loan at AS Roma. He made 14 appearances for Italy\\'s national side between 2012 and 2017. Fiorentina\\'s match against Udinese has been called off along with all of Sunday\\'s other matches, including the derby between AC Milan and Inter Milan. AC Milan coach Gennaro Gattuso had asked before the announcement for all games to be called off. \"I can\\'t think of the derby after a tragedy like that,\" he said on Twitter. mm/rc (AFP, AP, dpa, Reuters) Each evening at 1830 UTC, DW\\'s editors send out a selection of the day\\'s hard news and quality feature journalism.

       " {'story': 'Namibian Police Continue Hunt for German Tourist\\'s Killers Police in Namibia were searching Tuesday for two men who shot dead a German tourist and kidnapped his wife shortly after their arrival in the normally tranquil desert state at the weekend. Johannes F., 56 and his wife Elke, 52, were hijacked at gunpoint by two men on Sunday after they had stopped at a bridge in the mountainous Khomas region west of the capital Windhoek to take photos, police spokesman Angula Amulungu said. The couple had arrived hours earlier in Namibia and were en route to the coastal resort of Swakopmund. The attackers shot and killed Johannes, kidnapped his wife, drove around in the couple\\'s rental car for hours before dumping the body in a dry riverbed before becoming embroiled in a high-speed chase with a local farmer, according to local newspaper reports. Local Afrikaans daily Republikein reported that Johannes was shot after arguing with the hijackers and that he bled to death on his wife\\'s lap. German media reported that he was shot in the head and killed instantly when the hijakers emerged from the bush. The car later overturned and the men fled, leaving behind Elke F., who was taken to hospital, where she was treated for minor injuries. Elke F. was in \"severe shock,\" according to Ute König, permanent representative at the German embassy in Windhoek. Police are combing the Khomas Hochland area for the attackers, police spokesman Amulungu said. The attack dominated newspaper headlines Tuesday in Namibia, a quiet former German colony of around 2 million people famous for its desert scenery. \"The horrified reaction (to the attack) in the country reflects the exceptional nature of this crime,\" König said.',\n",

       " {'story': \"Record Number of Germans Moving Abroad Despite an improved economic situation, more Germans relocated outside the country in 2007 than in any year since reunification in 1990, raising concerns over a demographic crisis in the near future. Figures released on Monday, May 19, by the Federal Statistics Office showed that 165,180 German citizens migrated elsewhere last year, an increase of nearly 10,000 from 2006. The top destinations were Switzerland, the United States, Poland and Austria. A total of 111,291 Germans returned from abroad in 2007, resulting in a net loss of 53,889 citizens, the third straight year in which more Germans have left the country than returned. Both the number of Germans leaving the country and the net loss of German citizens were the highest since reunification in 1990, adding to concerns that Germany is heading towards a demographic crisis. Population experts have long been warning that Germany's ageing, shrinking population will be detrimental to Europe's largest economy in future. Population dropped for fifth year in a row The Statistics Office reported that, with a net total of 101,691 foreigners moving to Germany last year, there was a net gain from migration of 47,802. Additionally, the country saw its first increase in the number of births in a decade, with some 690,000 births recorded. But these numbers combined were not enough to offset the estimated 825,000 deaths in 2007. Overall, this resulted in a drop in the German population for the fifth straight year. Experts have predicted that the German population could fall to as low as 69 million in 2050 from some 82 million today.\",\n",

       " {'story': 'Germany Chooses \"Culture Capital\" Finalists Two very different German cities -- Görlitz and Essen -- have been chosen as finalists from among 10 hopefuls to compete for the title \"European Capital of Culture\" in 2010. The jury which made the decision said it chose Essen due to its successful transformation from an industrial hub at the heart of the Ruhr region to a center of culture and science whose influence extends beyond its municipal borders. Görlitz/Zgorzelec, a city on the German/Polish border that was split in two by political developments, was chosen because judges said it represents a spirit of reconciliation and a Europe which is growing ever closer together after a century of war, expulsion and division. Tourist magnet The citizens of Görlitz let the champagne corks fly when the news was announced on Thursday evening. The city worked hard to restore its historic city center, left intact after the war, to its former glory, and for that reason, has become a tourist magnet in eastern Germany. But beauty aside, the town has been hit hard by the unemployment, westward migration and high vacancy rates seen throughout the eastern states. City officials are counting on the title of Culture Capital to dispel some of the gloom. \"We were both anxious and hopeful,\" said Kai Grebasch, spokesman for the city\\'s Culture Capital office. \"When the good news finally came, we were all speechless with joy.\" In Essen, too, the relief over remaining in the race was palpable. Faced with the decline of traditional industries such as mining, the Ruhr region is attempting to reinvent itself, in the same way that British industrial cities such as Manchester and Liverpool have transformed themselves into hip cultural centers. Whole new future \"The jury picked up exactly our concern, which is to rededicate the whole region culturally, and make a whole new future possible,\" said North Rhine-Westphalia\\'s Minister for Culture, Michael Vesper. The jury judged each candidate city\\'s application on whether it presented a theme which explored ideas that were central to the European experience. And in this, Essen and Görlitz came out ahead of the other candidates Braunschweig, Bremen, Halle, Karlsruhe, Kassel, Lübeck, Potsdam and Regensburg. Germany is expected to pass on the recommendations to Brüssels in the fall, where the final decision will be made in 2006.',\n",

       " {'story': 'UN: South Sudan leaders schedule talks this week in Ethiopia UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has traveled to South Sudan in an effort to broker face-to-face talks with the leaders of the country\\'s warring factions. He said a meeting between the sides was likely later this week. On Tuesday, Ban Ki-moon said from Juba that the leaders of South Sudan\\'s warring factions – rebels led by former Vice President Riek Machar, and supporters of President Salva Kiir – were to meet for direct talks with each other this week in Ethiopia. \"Fighting must end. Much damage has already been done. It may take long to heal,\" Ban said. \"The country\\'s leaders must close the wounds they have opened. They must support justice and accountability for the crime committed and they must act to address the root causes of the conflict.\" The meeting in Addis Ababa is to be facilitated by the prime minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn. Heartbreaking, says Ban The conflict has been broiling since December. A peace agreement reached in January did not hold, and thousands of people have been killed in the meantime. In addition, the United Nations human rights chief has cautioned that the situation needs to be brought under control before turning into a Rwanda-like genocide or a devastating famine. In Juba, Ban met with Kiir and refugees in a UN camp that is filled beyond capacity by many thousand people. \"What I have seen and heard today breaks my heart and enrages my soul,\" Ban said, adding the \"conflict destroying this fragile young country is senseless.\" During a joint press conference, Kiir said he would attend the meeting in Addis Ababa. Machar spoke with Ban by phone and said he would do his best to make it there by Friday, the date put forth by Ethiopian\\'s Desalegn. \"He said he will try his best, because he is in a very remote area,\" Ban said. mz/ipj (AP, Reuters, AFP)',\n",

       " {'story': 'Xi meets with S African President Zuma ahead of BRICS summit Chinese President Xi Jinping is meeting with his South African counterpart Jacob Zuma ahead of the BRICS summit in Durban. Joining Brazil, Russia and India, the five nations are seeking to establish a development bank. Xi received a formal welcome complete with a 21-gun honor guard salute Tuesday in the South African capital, Pretoria. Zuma and Xi are expected to sign several agreements before traveling to Durban later in the day. BRICS summit to kick off Finance ministers at the BRICS summit, which will begin its fifth edition with a dinner banquet hosted by Zuma, are expected to present a feasibility study on the establishment of a new development bank to challenge the World Bank\\'s decades-long dominance. Many in the developing world consider the World Bank, as well as the International Monetary Fund, to be western-dominated. Each of the five nations could be expected to contribute as much as $10 billion to capitalize the bank. Some have suggested that South Africa, the smallest country in the group, could host the bank in Pretoria in lieu of providing a large cash injection. Zuma has said the summit is also an opportunity to address South Africa\\'s economic problems. \"BRICS provides an opportunity for South Africa to promote its competitiveness,\" he said. \"It is an opportunity to move further in our drive to promote economic growth and confront the challenge of poverty, inequality and unemployment that afflicts our country.\" Presidents Dilma Rouseff of Brazil, Vladimir Putin of Russia, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of India, as well as Xi and Zuma, will be in attendance for the presentation from economics ministers on Wednesday. Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa account for 25 percent of global GDP and 40 percent of the world\\'s population, economic data show. African investment The Chinese president arrived in South Africa from Tanzania, where he signed agreements to boost Beijing\\'s trade, economic and cultural ties with the country. It is Xi\\'s first since taking office. During a speech in Dar es Salaam Tuesday, Xi vowed to continue a $20 billion (15.5 billion euro) credit line to African nations over the next two years. China has become one of the world\\'s leading investors in Africa. Trade last year between China and South Africa totaled $60 billion, accounting for almost one third of China\\'s trade in Africa. Trade with the continent reached around $200 billion last year, up from just $1 billion in 2000. After the BRICS summit, Xi will travel to the Republic of Congo. dr/hc (AFP, dpa, PTI)',\n",

       " {'story': 'Swiss open probe into spying on its Turkish community A criminal investigation has been opened into allegations that the Ankara government has spied on expatriate Turks. Several academic events in Switzerland were reportedly filmed and photographed by unspecified agents. Swiss prosecutors said on Friday they had \"concrete suspicions [of espionage] against the Turkish community in Switzerland [by] a political intelligence service.\" The Office of the Attorney General confirmed it had opened a criminal investigation on March 16, after receiving a green light from the Swiss government. Prosecutors, however, refused to provide details on which specific people or organizations the investigation was targeting. University events filmed The investigation follows reports that in January, two men took photos of the participants at a University of Zurich seminar discussing the 1915 Armenian genocide by Ottoman Turks, a term which the Ankara government vehemently rejects. Local media reported that other events at the University in late 2016 and early 2017 were filmed or photographed, including one where the editor in chief of the Turkish newspaper \"Cumhuriyet\" was honored. On Thursday, the Swiss foreign minister told his Turkish counterpart that his country would \"rigorously investigate\" any illegal spying by Ankara on expatriate Turks and urged Turkey to comply with Swiss law. Close to 70,000 Turkish citizens live in Switzerland, according to Swiss government statistics, while the Turkish embassy\\'s website refers to 130,000 Turkish nationals. Guarded response Still, the Swiss government has been trying to avoid a confrontation similar to those seen in Germany and the Netherlands in recent weeks after Turkish ministers were banned from attending political rallies in support of a referendum on Turkey\\'s new draft constitution. The vote on April 16 would see Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\\'s powers massively expanded, amid criticism that he has already sought to crack down on dissent. Switzerland has not blocked the campaign events, but Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu did call off a visit earlier this month after the hotel he had booked for a rally refused to host it. Separate lawsuit In mid-March, a member of Switzerland\\'s upper house of parliament, Josef Dittli, filed a lawsuit accusing two Turkish organizations of spying on Turkish citizens and dual nationals living in Switzerland and requested an investigation. His suit singled out the Swiss Turkish-Islamic Foundation (TISS) and the Union of European Turkish Democrats and said Turkish diplomatic institutions might also be involved, according to the ATS news agency. Allegations of intelligence gathering by Erdogan supporters have arisen elsewhere in Europe. Last month, German police raided the apartments of four imams suspected of spying for Turkey\\'s government on followers of US-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, accused by Ankara of organizing a failed coup last July. mm/sms (AFP, Reuters)',\n",

       " {'story': 'Eurozone inflation still in \\'danger zone\\' in June Annual inflation in the 18-member eurozone has remained at levels far too low to disperse protracted deflation worries in the bloc. Adjusted ECB forecasts see the problem lingering on for years. Annual eurozone inflation remained at just 0.5 percent in June, initial figures from the EU statistics office, Eurostat, showed Monday. The figure marked the ninth consecutive month that consumer prices stayed well below what the European Central Bank had called a \"danger zone\" of under 1 percent. Rises in energy and services costs were easily offset by falling food, alcohol and tobacco prices, Eurostat noted. No reason to panic The ECB insisted that despite the June stagnation there was no acute risk of outright deflation in the 9.6-trillion euro ($13.1 trillion) economy, although three individual member countries had experienced deflation in May. Analysts had penciled in a slight rise in the annual cost of living after the ECB cut interest rates to an historic low in an effort to tackle low inflation. The bloc\\'s central bank had lowered its long-term forecast for eurozone inflation, predicting that it would reach 1.4 percent in 2016, still off the bank\\'s own target of below, but close to 2 percent. hg/rs (dpa, Reuters)',\n",

       " {'story': 'Ex-KGB spy Litvinenko\\'s autopsy \\'world\\'s most dangerous\\' Pathologists in the UK carried out one of the most dangerous autopsies when cutting into former KGB spy Alexander Litvinenko, an inquiry heard. The former agent died in 2006 after he drank tea poisoned with polonium. The post-mortem of former KGB spy Alexander Litvinenko was \"one of the most dangerous\" ever, according to experts speaking in London on Wednesday. Litvinenko, who is believed to have been poisoned with radioactive polonium-210, died on November 23, 2006. \"It has been described as one of the most dangerous post-mortem examinations ever undertaken in the Western world,\" Nathaniel Cary, one of the pathologists inquiring into Litvinenko\\'s case told the Associated Press. Those involved in the investigation had to wear white protective suits with specialized hoods that supplied filtered air. Inquiry into former spy\\'s death Litvinenko suddenly fell ill in November 2006 after drinking tea with two Russians he met at a London hotel. The former spy\\'s death deteriorated rapidly after the meeting and he died within three weeks of multiple organ failure. Litvinenko was living in exile in London as a former KGB agent who had become a critic of the Kremlin. In the inquiry into Litvinenko\\'s killing, which started on Tuesday, police said Litvinenko suspected Russian President Vladimir Putin of personally ordering his death. The reason was to cover up Kremlin\\'s link with the mafia, which Litvinenko was helping Spanish intelligence expose, Reuters news agency reported the Litvinenko family lawyer as saying. Two police suspects, Dmitry Kovtun and Andrei Lugovoi, are still officially wanted for murder. The pair, however, have denied involvement in Litvinenko\\'s death and Russia has so far refused to extradite them. They have been invited to speak at the inquiry via video link, but cannot be forced to do so. Lugovoi denounces UK investigation Meanwhile, Lugovoi told the Associated Press that the evidence being presented at the inquiry was \"nonsense.\" \"Such evidence simply does not exist because Russia wasn\\'t involved,\" he said. Lugovoi also accused the inquiry of trying to cover up a possible involvement of the British intelligence agency MI6. The controversy generated by Litvinenko\\'s killing severely impacted UK-Russian relations. An inquiry was delayed after London\\'s ties improved with Kremlin, but the Ukraine crisis last year prompted Britain to commence the proceedings. mg/sms (Reuters, AP)',\n",

       " {'story': \"Two deadly explosions rock Mogadishu Two explosions have rocked the center of Mogadishu. A Somali police official confirmed that gunmen have also forced their way into a prestigious hotel in the Somali capital. Eyewitnesses reported that the first of the two blasts could be heard 15 kilometers (10 miles) outside of the city on Friday. It reportedly took place at a central hotel in the city and was accompanied by heavy gunfire. A second explosion was later confirmed by a government employee. Residents reported a large plume of smoke rising above the city. Police said a suicide bomber had rammed his car into the SYL hotel's entrance at 7:45 p.m. local time (1645 GMT) and that a number of gunmen had then entered the premises after an exchange of gunfire with hotel guards. There was no definitive information on casualties but the German news agency dpa reported that at least 20 people had died, citing a local government spokesman. Several more were wounded, it said. Police Major Ahmad Ismail told the Reuters news agency that it remained unclear whether the fighters were still inside the hotel. Al-Shabab claims responsibility The SYL hotel, also known as the Somali Youth League hotel, is located across from the presidential palace in Mogadishu and is frequented by government officials and business executives. The Islamic extremist al-Shabab group, which is affiliated with the al Qaeda terrorist network, claimed responsibility for the attack. Earlier this month, the group attempted to bomb a Daallo airlines flight en route from Mogadishu to Djibouti. The blast tore a gaping hole to the plane's fuselage and sucked the attacker out of the plane. Al-Shabab carries out attacks government facilities in Mogadishu on a regular basis, seeking to establish an Islamist state in Somalia. ss/sms (AFP, AP, Reuters)\",\n",

       " {'story': 'Muslims in France, Italy join Catholic mass to mourn French priest Muslims in France have attended Catholic mass in churches and cathedrals across the country in a show of solidarity following the gruesome murder of a French priest. Interfaith services were also held in Italy. Dozens of Muslims were among the faithful who packed into the Gothic cathedral in the town of Rouen, northern France, on Sunday. Policemen and soldiers stood guard outside, seeking to reassure a jittery community five days after two jihadi teenagers killed an 85-year-old priest inside a church just a few kilometers away in Saint-Etienne-du-Rouvray. \"This morning we extend a special welcome to our Muslim friends,\" Rouen Archbishop Dominique Lebrun said in his homily. \"I thank you in the name of all Christians. In this way you are affirming that you reject death and violence in the name of God.\" A number of Muslim leaders attended the service, along with three nuns who were at the church in Saint-Etienne-du-Rouvray when Father Jacques Hamel was brutally murdered at the altar. The killing gave rise to questions about lapses in security after it was reported that both 19-year-old offenders were known to authorities and had attempted to reach Syria. There were also fears the attack could create possible tensions between the religions and add to divisions in French society. French Prime Minister Manuel Valls on Sunday called for a new \"pact\" with the country\\'s 5 million Muslims, which make up the largest Muslim population in Europe. \"Islam has found its place in France... contrary to the repeated attacks of populists on the right and far-right,\" he said, calling for the rejection of Islam to be combatted \"with the greatest strength.\" Churches in other French cities also opened their doors to Muslims on Sunday. Dalil Boubakeur, the rector of the Mosque of Paris, was among those who attended a service in the capital\\'s iconic Notre Dame cathedral. \"The situation is serious,\" he told broadcaster BFMTV. \"Time has come to come together so as not to be divided.\" Multifaith services were held across Italy too, notably at Rome\\'s Santa Maria di Trastevere church. In Naples, Abdullah Cozzolino from Italy\\'s Islamic Confederation spoke in the Treasure of St. Gennaro chapel next to the Duomo cathedral, stressing the \"need of dialogue, more affirmation of shared values of peace, of solidarity, of love, out of respect for our one God, merciful and compassionate.\" nm/ rc(AP, AFP)',\n",

       " {'story': 'New floating objects spotted as stormy weather grounds aircraft searching for MH370 Thailand has said its satellite images showed 300 floating objects near the search zone in the southern Indian Ocean. Meanwhile, thunderstorms and strong winds have forced search teams to temporarily suspend operations. Thailand said on Thursday it could have a lead on possible wreckage from missing Malaysian Airlines flight MH370, according to media reports. Its latest satellite images revealed roughly 300 floating objects, ranging from two to 15 meters (6.6 to 50 feet) in size. The images pointed to an area some 2,700 kilometers southwest of Perth, within the zone where officials believe the plane crashed after losing contact with air traffic control on March 8. Search halted Earlier Thursday, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) cancelled reconnaissance flights to Thursday\\'s search zone in the southern Indian Ocean after severe weather forecasts proved too dangerous. The suspension grounded six military planes and five civilian aircraft participating in the search and rescue operation for the missing Boeing 777. The aircraft were in the air \"maybe two hours,\" ASMA spokesperson Sam Cardwell said. \"They got a bit of time in, but it was not useful because there was no visibility.\" Five ships would remain out at sea for the time being, ASMA confirmed. Rescuers on Thursday had been scheduled to reach the search zone where satellite images had spotted 122 \"potential objects,\" which Malaysian officials said they believed could be wreckage from MH370. AMSA had issued a similar suspension earlier in the week, a move which sparked protests in Beijing. Distraught family members of the missing passengers marched on the Malaysian embassy, demanding more answers from officials. Two-thirds of the passengers on board MH370 were Chinese nationals. Logistical problems The international search team - relying on logistical support form the US, China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand - is tasked with searching an area of 1.6 million square kilometers (622,000 square miles), which is roughly the size of Iran. Not only have poor weather conditions impeded search efforts, but the remoteness of the area has also made the recovery of any possible debris extremely difficult. Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott described the search area \"as close to nowhere as it\\'s possible.\" Experts have moreover warned that the unchartered terrain in the southern Indian Ocean could also prove dangerous to the crew. \"This is a really rough piece of ocean, which is going to be a terrific issue,\" the director of the Earth Observatory of Singapore, Kerry Sieh, told news agency AFP. \"I worry that people carrying out the rescue mission are going to get into trouble.\" kms/msh (AP, AFP, Reuters, dpa)',\n",

       " {'story': 'Climate activists receive Alternative Nobel Prizes An award for activism, dubbed the \"alternative Nobel prize\" has been awarded to four individuals for their work in fields such as climate change, medicine and preventing deforestation. Four activists were awarded the 2009 Right Livelihood award in the Stockholm parliament on Friday for \"offering practical and exemplary answers to the most urgent challenges facing us today.\" The so-called \"Alternative Nobels\" have been awarded since 1980. David Suzuki of Canada won an honorary award for \"his lifetime advocacy of the socially responsible use of science,\" as well as his contributions to highlighting the issue of climate change. He expressed concerns before the awards ceremony that the imminent Copenhagen conference would result in a contract emphasizing economics over the environment. \"The worst possible thing would be a half-hearted agreement,\" he told the dpa news agency, saying it was better to work for a better deal next year. \"We have partied as if there is no tomorrow, using things up and throwing them away without regard to the future,\" Suzuki said on Thursday. \"Well, the party\\'s over and we have to sober up, clean up our mess, assess our situation and get on with acting for a future.\" He also admitted doubting the Canadian government\\'s commitment to dealing with climate change, saying that Ottawa \"would try to prevent any hard targets and time frames and enforcement mechanisms.\" Prize winning activism Other laureates honored were Rene Ngongo, of the Democratic Republic of Congo, who won for his courage in establishing conservation efforts for the rainforests of the Congo. \"Climate change is the biggest threat our planet has to face right now,\" Ngongo said. \"The world must act now - if not, we risk suffering from growing and irreversible disturbances that will exceed our capacities to adapt.\" New Zealand\\'s Alyn Ware won for his work promoting peace education and campaigns against nuclear weapons. In Ethiopia, Australian-born Catherine Hamlin, was awarded the prize for her 50 years of work dedicated to treating obstetric fistula patients. Co-winners Ware, Hamlin and Ngongo are to receive 50,000 euros ($73,000) in prize money. sjt/dpa/AP Editor: Sean Sinico',\n",

       " {'story': \"War crimes spokeswoman on trial over Milosevic secrets A former spokeswoman for the tribunal set up to deal with Yugoslav war crimes was has gone on trial there herself. She is charged with contempt of court over the publication of classified information. Florence Hartmann, who was spokeswoman for the former chief war crimes prosecutor, Carla Del Ponte, between 2000 and 2006, is accused of having disclosed confidential information about the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in a book and an article published after she left her post. The publications allegedly cite confidential documents and court decisions made during the trial of former Serbian leader, Slobodan Milosevic, which implicate the Serbian state in the 1995 massacre of thousands of men and boys in the Bosnian town of Srebrenica. In his opening speech, ICTY prosecutor Bruce MacFarlane said he would show that the accused had consciously published information from classified documents. But Hartmann's lawyer, Guenael Mettraux, says she did no wrong as the information referred to in her article and her book, entitled “Peace and Punishment: The Secret Wars of Politics and International Justice” was already in the public domain when her work went into print. Online support The journalist's supporters, many journalists themselves, are running an internet petition which calls for the case to be dropped. They say Hartmann was merely doing her job “by rigorously searching for and publicizing the truth.” The petition goes on to say that making Hartmann appear before a court established to try those guilty of genocide “will tarnish the image of the international justice system.” Hartmann, who could face seven years in prison or a fine of €100,000 ($139,000) if found guilty, declined to enter a plea on either charge. The court entered two pleas of “not guilty” on her behalf. The trial is expected to continue until Wednesday. tkw/AFP/AP/dpa Editor: Jennifer Abramsohn\",\n",

       " {'story': 'India to push US to extradite former Union Carbide chief A ministerial panel has presented several recommendations to the government after a court sentenced former Union Carbide employees to only two years in jail earlier this month, prompting widespread public outrage. Ever since a lenient verdict on the 1984 Bhopal disaster earlier this month, the Indian government has faced mounting criticism. Victims and activists called the Bhopal ruling a travesty of justice because of the paltry sentences, the long delay in bringing justice and the inadequate clean-up of the disaster site. On Monday, a group of survivors from the Bhopal gas tragedy staged a demonstration in front of India\\'s Home Ministry in New Delhi demanding adequate compensation for the victims. So as to mitigate people\\'s anger, which has been exacerbated by the fact that the current ruling party was already in power when the world\\'s worst industrial disaster happened, the government had formed a panel of senior ministers to draw up recommendations for fresh action. Panel urges government to make great efforts In its report, presented on Monday, the panel recommends that the government make strong efforts to seek the extradition of the ex-Union Carbide chief Warren Anderson, who has been classified as an absconder. \"India will make vigorous efforts\" to have Anderson extradited, the Indian Minister for Urban Development, Jaipal Reddy, told the AFP news agency. Anderson, who is now retired, was arrested after the gas leak but he then fled the country. Opposition parties accused the ruling party of letting Anderson escape Bhopal on a government plane. Repeated requests by the Indians for his extradition turned out to be in vain. Enhanced compensation for victims and relatives The ministerial panel has also finalized a package worth rupees 1,500 crore, or nearly 325 million US dollars, for enhancing compensation for the relatives of those who died and those who were debilitated by the disaster. The gas leak at the Union Carbide plant in Bhopal claimed an estimated 15,000 lives. Many thousands were permanently disabled or are still suffering from critical ailments. According to Reddy, as cited by AFP, the government has recommended the setting up of a federal medical research facility in Bhopal to monitor the health conditions of survivors and newborns. The ministers have also recommended that the government help clean up the site and bury toxic material. Home Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram said the panel\\'s report would be discussed at a cabinet meeting on Friday. du/AFP/Reuters/PTI Editor: Anne Thomas',\n",

       " {'story': 'AirAsia search team finds four \\'large objects\\' The Indonesia Search and Rescue Agency searching for AirAsia flight 8501 has found two more \"large parts\" of the crashed jet, bringing the total to four pieces of debris. The plane had been carrying 162 people. Agency chief Fransiskus Bambang Soelistyo said on Saturday that the four large objects were found in the Java Sea using an Indonesian ship equipped with sonar technology. Despite high waves on Saturday, search teams extended their hunt for bodies and wreckage. So far, some 30 bodies have been found. Two other objects were also found earlier on Saturday, some 30 meters (90 feet) below the surface. No survivors have been found. \"We managed to detect two large objects - one three-dimensioned, another two-dimensioned,\" Soelistyo said, adding there were signs of an oil spill. \"I can confirm that they are parts of the plane we are looking for,\" he said. The Airbus A320-200 disappeared during a flight from the Indonesian city of Surabaya to Singapore, after losing contact with air traffic control on December 28. Prior to losing contact, the pilot requested to ascend to avoid approaching threatening clouds. Permission was denied, however, due to heavy air traffic. On Saturday, Indonesian authorities also grounded all AirAsia flights from Surabaya to Singapore, saying that the airline had not had a permit to fly on Sundays - the same day that the AirAsia 8501 flight went down over the Java Sea. ksb/se (Reuters, AFP, dpa)',\n",

Leader Marine Le Pen has threatened to lodge a complaint over the \"false allegations.\" The investigation centers around 20 members of the National Front, who were paid out of the EU budget for assisting members of the European Parliament, but who allegedly work for the party in France. Assistants receiving wages from the European Parliament must work directly for parliamentary MEPs. On Monday, EU parliament president Martin Schulz informed the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) of the suspected fraud, which some sources say could amount to 7.5 million euros ($8.1 million) over the current legislature, from 2014 to 2019. \"It is not for Parliament to draw conclusions, it is the OLAF to decide in its capacity as the EU anti-fraud agency,\" said European Parliament spokesman Jaume Duch. Schulz has also written to French Justice Minister Christiane Taubira to express his suspicions, the EU body said in a statement. \\'Big guns\\' National Front Vice President Florian Philippot said the allegations were \"trumped up.\" \"In a way, Schulz is right,\" he tweeted. \"Our assistants don\\'t work for the European Union but against it.\" The party\\'s leader, Marine Le Pen (above right), accused the current French prime minister Manuel Valls of \"mobilizing his Socialist friends against the National Front.\" \"The EU parliament\\'s president is bringing out the big guns. A complaint will be filed against him (Martin Schulz) for making false allegations.\" The OLAF will now to decide whether to start an investigation, and it could take several months before a decision is made. Fears of an \\'unprecedented\\' far-right score French Prime Minister Manuel Valls warned during the weekend that the National Front could win the next presidential election in 2017, saying their policies were a \"disaster\" for the country. Polls showed that the far-right party could win an \"unprecedented\" score in local elections on March 22 and 29, Valls said. \"I fear for my country. I fear that it will smash itself to pieces against the Front National,\" Prime Minister Manuel Valls told Europe 1 radio at the weekend. Most political analysts believe that, while Le Pen could reach the runoff round in the 2017 presidential election, it would be far harder for her to defeat the mainstream candidate and win the position. dj/jr (AFP, Reuters, dpa)',\n",

       " {'story': 'Russian court sentences Ukrainian pilot Nadezhda Savchenko to 22 years for murder The Ukrainian pilot received her sentence a day after being found guilty by a Russian court over the killing of two journalists. Savchenko has been at the center of the conflict between Kyiv and pro-Moscow separatists. The 34-year-old Savchenko was sentenced to 22 years in jail after the court found her guilty of giving the coordinates used in an attack that killed two journalists who worked for the Russian state TV broadcaster VGTRK. Savchenko has become one of the most famous faces of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine after she was taken into custody by pro-Moscow rebels in June 2014. Following her arrest, Kyiv granted her diplomatic immunity by appointing her as a representative to the Council of Europe. However, Moscow argued she still had to stand trial, as the alleged crime occurred after the appointment was made. She has denied any wrongdoing, and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has called on Moscow to return her to the country. Russian officials have suggested they are open to handing Savchenko over as part of a prisoner swap. The pilot responded to the sentencing in court by singing aloud the Ukrainian national anthem. Complicit in murder Savchenko was also found guilty of illegally crossing the Russian border. On Monday, the Russian court declared that Savchenko, \"having skills of military training, and experience in military actions in Iraq, while on a holiday, on her own choice in order to participate in the armed conflict in Ukraine\\'s southeast, came to the Aidar batallion under commander Sergey Melnichuk, which was located in the town of Schastye in the Luhansk region.\" The court said Melnichuk was primarily responsible for the killings, and that he\\'d supplied the pilot with the gear and equipment. Savchenko has called the accusations a \"lie,\" something also echoed by both Brussels and Washington, who believe the pilot was abducted by pro-Moscow rebels and falsely charged. Russia has been accused of backing the rebellion in the eastern part of the country, which erupted after demonstrators forced President Viktor Yanukovich out of office in February 2014.

       " {'story': 'Saudi-led warplanes pound Yemen after ceasefire ends The Saudi Arabia-led coalition has resumed airstrikes in Sanaa, hours after a three-day truce expired in Yemen. The ceasefire was declared in order to supply crucial humanitarian aid to civilians. Yemen\\'s government continued to blame Shiite Houthi rebels for not upholding the 72-hour truce, forcing the Saudi-led coalition to strike targets in the capital, Sanaa. \"The [Houthi] coup militias deliberately thwarted the truce, and that further convinced our military and political leadership of their unwillingness to accept peace,\" Yemen\\'s army chief of staff Mohammed Ali al-Miqdashi told reporters. Airstrikes were reported from military sites near Sanaa, in the Hafa camp towards the east and the Nahdein area in the south. Planes also targeted the Houthi-controlled city of Hodeida and Taiz, the Reuters news agency reported residents as saying. Fierce fighting was also reported in the country\\'s northern regions along the border with Saudi Arabia. Ten rebels and four Yemeni soldiers were killed over the weekend, media agencies reported. The strikes occurred hours before UN Special Envoy for Yemen, Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmad, arrived in Sanaa for talks with Houthi representatives. Ahmad had earlier appealed for an extension of the truce to enable humanitarian aid to reach war-ravaged areas. \"We noted over the last days that food and humanitarian supplies were provided to several affected neighborhoods and that UN personnel were able to reach areas that were previously inaccessible,\" Ahmad said on Saturday. He had appealed to parties to extend the ceasefire, which began on Wednesday, for another 72 hours. But Yemeni Foreign Minister Abdulmalek al-Mekhlafi said the call was \"useless\" because rebels were ignoring the truce. \"We respect the UN envoy\\'s call for an extension, but in effect, there was no truce due to the violations\" by the rebels, Mekhlafi told the Agence France-Presse news agency. Nearly 7,000 people have died since early last year, when Saudi Arabia formed a coalition to prevent Iran-backed Shiite Houthi rebels from deposing President Abd Rabbo Mansour Hadi and taking over the country. Hadi is now in exile in Riyadh. The war has plunged the country into chaos, with millions facing starvation and an acute shortage of medical supplies. mg/jlw (AFP, Reuters)',\n",

       " {'story': 'Russia calls UN Security Council meeting on Yemen strike pause The UN Security Council will meet on Saturday at Russia\\'s instigation to discuss the situation in Yemen. Moscow is proposing a pause in Saudi-led airstrikes in the country. The meeting was called amid growing concern over the humanitarian crisis in Yemen, which is experiencing a rising civilian death toll from fierce fighting. A Saudi Arabia-led campaign, which began on March 26, has pounded key locations across Yemen with airstrikes in an attempt to halt an advance of Shiite Houthi fighters. Riyadh maintains the Houthis are backed by Iran. The Houthis are allied with former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who was forced out in the country\\'s 2011 Arab Spring uprising. The latest fighting prompted President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi to flee to Saudi Arabia last week. Aid agencies have reported that more than 500 people have been killed and three times as many injured in the past two weeks. Russia\\'s mission to the UN said it called the meeting of the 15-member Council to \"discuss an issue of humanitarian pause during coalition airstrikes in Yemen.\" The Houthis seized power in the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, in February, with Hadi declaring a provisional capital in his stronghold Aden, a southern port city. The UN backs Hadi as the legitimate leader of Yemen. Saudi Arabia and several regional allies have vowed to continue the airstrikes until the Houthis \"withdraw and surrender their weapons.\" Russia\\'s proposal came as several Gulf countries called for a UN resolution imposing sanctions and an arms embargo on the Houthis. But Russia wants amendments to apply an arms embargo to the whole country, and limit sanctions. jr/gsw (Reuters, AFP)',\n",

       " {'story': \"The New York Wheel is growing  Construction on the world's tallest observation wheel is progressing in New York City. The gigantic attraction will, however, be significantly more expensive and its completion delayed.   On a tour of the site in the borough of Staten Island, spokeswoman Tiffany Townsand said that the budget is currently 590 million dollars (about 555 million euros). That would make the New York Wheel more than twice as expensive as originally planned. At first its developers announced total costs of 250 million dollars and an opening date in 2015. Now the wheel is expected to start turning in spring 2018. A shopping mall, hotels, public parking garage and green areas will surround the planned attraction. The project's developers hope it will enhance the most suburban and least populated of the city's five boroughs. To this day, many tourists take the free ferry ride to Staten Island in order to enjoy the view of Upper New York Bay, the Statue of Liberty and the city skyline, but they usually go straight back to Manhattan. It's hoped that the New York Wheel will attract three million visitors annually and that they will spend time on the island's north shore. Right now, it would be the tallest observation wheel in the world, but because several similar projects are in the planning, its height could be exceeded before it's finished. At present the record-holder is the High Roller Ferris wheel in Las Vegas, Nevada, at just under 170 meters. The New York Wheel is expected to take 38 minutes for one rotation and accommodate up to 40 passengers in each of its 36 transparent capsules. Three capsules will have built-in bars and one will be a dining capsule. The new attraction was designed by Starneth B.V. - the company that built the London Eye in 1999. The 135-meter-tall wheel in the UK capital is visited by 3.5 million tourists a year. is/cho/ms (dpa, afp, newyorkwheel.com)\",\n",

Vladimir Klitschko knocked out US challenger Eddie Chambers to retain his three heavyweight boxing titles late Saturday in front of 51,000 fans in Duesseldorf\\'s soccer stadium. The 33-year-old Ukrainian boxer saved the best for last, landing his knockout punch five seconds before the end of the 12-round fight to defend his WBO, IBF and IBO heavyweight titles. After a furious final round \"Fast Eddie\" Chambers slumped to the canvas, finally succumbing to Klitschko\\'s poweful punches. Chambers needed a few minutes to recover from the pounding he received at the end of the title bout. Klitschko dominated the fight and ended it with a left hook to score his 48th KO in 53 professional fights. Ahead of the bout he had promised to \"make a statement.\" \"Eddie Chambers was damn quick, but without the support by the fans in Duesseldorf, the 12th round wouldn\\'t have ended like it did. Thank you,\" said the former Olympic boxing champion as he celebrated in the ring with a bottle of local beer. Klitschko, weighing in at 111 kilograms (245 pounds), had a chance of knocking down Chambers early on in the second round with a combination of solid jabs and straight punches, but Chambers, who weighed in at 95 kilograms (209 pounds) stood his ground. This was Chamber\\'s second defeat in 37 fights with 18 knockouts. nrt/dpa/Reuters Editor: Holly Fox',\n",

       " {'story': 'UN: Cyprus reunification talks to resume The leaders of ethnically-split Cyprus have agreed to restart peace talks in a bid to reunify the island. The election of a moderate leftist Turkish Cypriot has raised hopes of a breakthrough after 40 years of division. A United Nations envoy said the leaders planned to resume the stalled talks on Friday May 15, seizing a \"unique opportunity\" for peace on an island that\\'s been divided along ethnic lines since 1974. Diplomat Espen Barth Eide made the announcement after hosting a dinner between Greek Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades and newly-elected Turkish Cypriot leader Mustafa Akinci. \"They agreed it was important to use the momentum created and opportunity to move forward without delay,\" Eide told journalists in the capital Nicosia. It was the first meeting between the two leaders since Akinci, a moderate leftist and reunification advocate, defeated veteran nationalist Dervis Eroglu in elections last month. It\\'s believed the leadership change could give new momentum to reunification efforts. Eide, a former foreign minister for Norway, said Friday\\'s talks would involve a \"general exchange of views\" and address the structure of future negotiations. \"I think this is a unique opportunity that will be grasped and it\\'s truly rewarding to work with two leaders with such a strong commitment to seeing a shared challenge that can only be solved through shared effort.\" Four-decade split The Mediterranean island split into a Turkish North and a Greek-supported South in 1974, when the Turkish army invaded, itself in response to a coup seeking a union with Greece. Since then, there have been a number of failed attempts at peace. In October, Greek Cypriots walked away from UN-brokered talks in protest of Turkish exploration of the island\\'s offshore oil and gas reserves. Although the rival sides agree that there should be a two-state federation, negotiations have stalled on issues such as territorial adjustments, security, property rights of internally displaced people, and power sharing. Turkey supports Northern Cyprus militarily and financially, and is the only country to recognize it as a separate state. The Greek Cypriot leadership theoretically represents the whole island in the European Union, although it technically only governs the south. nm/msh (Reuters, AP, AFP)',\n",

       " {'story': 'German media: indication that German co-pilot \\'rehearsed\\' crashing the plane The co-pilot of the Germanwings plane had put the aircraft into an unnecessary descent on the way to Barcelona, before the doomed flight back to Düsseldorf, a German newspaper says. The crash killed 150 people. Ahead of Wednesday\\'s expected release of an interim report on the Germanwings crash, German mass-circulation newspaper Bild reported that flight data from the day of the deadly plane crash suggested that the young co-pilot had practiced downing the aircraft. The 27-year old co-pilot, Andreas Lubitz, allegedly put the plane into a \"controlled, technically unjustified dive, which lasted several minutes\" while traveling to Barcelona on the day of the crash, the newspaper said, citing sources close to the French BEA agency, which is in charge of investigating aviation accidents. He is suspected of intentionally flying the plane with 150 people on board into a mountainside in France during the return flight on March 24. The newspaper also speculated that the dive might not have been just a practice run, and that the co-pilot might have wanted to crash the plane on the way to Barcelona. A BEA spokeswoman confirmed to the DPA news agency that an interim report on the accident is set to be published online Wednesday, but did not immediately comment on the content. Signed off sick Lubitz had suffered from severe depression and received treatment for \"suicidal tendencies\" before obtaining his pilot\\'s license, German authorities have said. Although doctors had no indication that the co-pilot intended to harm himself or others, he was signed off sick from work a number of times, including on the day of the crash. He apparently decided to cover that up. In addition, German investigators found that he had researched methods of suicide and ways of blocking the cockpit door online. The captain is heard no the audio from the flight unsuccessfully trying to force his way back in after briefly leaving the cabin. All the 150 people in the aircraft were killed in the crash. dj/kms (dpa, Reuters)',\n",

       " {'story': 'ABC faces job cull over budget cuts The Australian Broadcasting Corporation has warned hundreds of jobs are likely to be slashed after government funding cuts. Opposition leaders said reduced funding was retaliation for unfavorable coverage. More than 400 jobs could be lost at the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, ABC Managing Director Mark Scott said Monday. \"We anticipate that more than 400 people - close to 10 percent of our ongoing workforce - face potential redundancy as we adjust our activities over coming months,\" Scott said in a statement. The government currently provides the ABC and ethnic broadcaster SBS some 1.4 billion Australian dollars ($1.2 billion, 970 million euros) annually, but Canberra announced last week the budget would be cut by 254 million Australian dollars over the next five years. Scaling back infrastructure Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull said the ABC should be able to fund those cuts through efficiencies and without sacrificing programming. ABC Managing Director Mark Scott said the station would have to review its property holdings, with one Sydney site to be sold and an Adelaide TV production studio and five regional radio stations facing closure. Opposition leader Bill Shorten said the cuts were \"retaliation for unfavorable coverage of the government.\" Prime Minister Tony Abbott had earlier been quoted as saying the ABC \"takes everyone\\'s side but Australia\\'s\" in its news coverage. hg/cjc (dpa, AFP)',\n",

       " {'story': 'Bayern\\'s Uli Hoeness hopes for March release from prison A court in Augsburg, Bavaria, is examining whether Uli Hoeness should be freed on probation at the mid-way point of his sentence. The longstanding Bayern Munich boss is serving three and a half years for tax evasion. From February 29 next year, Bayern Munich\\'s former commercial manager and president, Uli Hoeness, could be fully released on parole - less than two years after his conviction for tax evasion. An Augsburg court on Tuesday confirmed that it had received an application to consider Hoeness for release at the half-way point of his sentence. \"After hearing from the convicted, the chamber will have to decide whether the legal conditions for this have been fulfilled,\" the court said in a press release. Spokesman Claus Pätzel said that a decision was highly unlikely before mid-January. Hoeness\\' lawyer first said in November that his client would seek the release, often dubbed a \"half sentence\" in German legal circles. Hoeness was sentenced in March 2014, after dramatically confessing to tax evasion worth some 28.5 million euros ($31.2 million at today\\'s exchange) in court. Much of the money hailed from successful speculation on the stock markets, he said. The 63-year-old Hoeness has already been granted day-release prisoner status; he works with Bayern Munich\\'s youth setup during the days, spending five nights a week at an open prison in Rothenfeld. He\\'s permitted to spend most weekends in his family home at the lakeside town of Tegernsee, south of Munich. Home for Christmas, listening to Adele Hoeness, who has three days off work at the Bayern academy for the festive period, offered Bavarians something of a status update on Monday, calling private radio station \"Antenne Bayern\" to say how important it was to him to be able to spend Christmas with his family. He and his wife Susi had agreed \"that we will not give each other gifts, because I can be at home,\" Hoeness said. \"That\\'s enough of a present.\" He also donated 10,000 euros to a charitable cause on air, requesting that the station play \"Hello\" by UK popstar Adele; Hoeness dedicated the donation and song to \"my beloved wife Susi, my children and my son- and daughter-in-law,\" saying that they had made it possible for him \"to get through this difficult time.\" Various factors could speak in Hoeness\\' favor for early release. His 2014 conviction was his first offense, and according to recent reports from the \"Bild\" newspaper, he has repaid his outstanding taxes plus interest. msh/pfd (dpa, SID)',\n",

       " {'story': 'Deadly sectarian violence continues in Myanmar Sectarian violence has broken out in western Myanmar, leaving dozens dead. The United Nations has called for calm amid the ongoing clashes which have destroyed thousands of homes over five days. Nearly sixty people have died as a result of ongoing violence between Rohingya Muslims and Buddhists in Myanmar, which persisted Thursday for a fifth day. The western state of Rakhine has suffered the brunt of the conflict. According to Rakhine state spokesman Win Myaing, 25 men and 31 women were reported dead as of 7 p.m. local time in four townships. Myaing added that 1,900 homes had also been burned down. Security forces have struggled to quell the unrest in Myanmar since violence broke out in June. At least 80 have died as a result of the conflict, and around 75,000 people have been displaced. UN \\'gravely concerned\\' The UN called for an end to the violence, saying that the struggle has forced thousands of displaced refugees into \"already overcrowded\" camps near the state capital of Sittwe. \"The UN is gravely concerned about reports of a resurgence of inter-communal conflict in several areas in Rakhine State which has resulted in deaths and has forced thousands of people, including women and children to flee their homes,\" said Ashok Nigam, UN humanitarian coordinator in Myanmar, in a statement. Nigam asked for the \"immediate and unconditional access to all communities in accordance with humanitarian principles.\" Unrest after reforms The violence has dampened the widely-praised political reforms brought on by President Thein Sein, which included the release of hundreds of political prisoners. Rights groups have said the death toll could far exceed official numbers. \"The way in which the situation has developed is very worrying,\" said Chris Lewa, head of the Arakan Project which campaigns for Rohingya rights. \"It seems that there is a desire to eliminate Rohingyas from all the townships where they are a minority, continuing what occurred in Sittwe.\" The Rohingya have long been considered to be one of the most-persecuted minorities on the planet by the UN. dr/ccp (AFP, Reuters, AP)',\n",

       " {'story': 'France\\'s Fabius delivers doubts over moderate Syria opposition French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius has said he is \"pessimistic\" about the strength of the moderate opposition to Syria\\'s government. Fabius voiced skepticism about the likelihood of success at planned peace talks. The French Foreign Minister said that, while France would continue to work towards proposed talks in Geneva in January, hopes that they would provide any kind of resolution were becoming increasingly remote. \"On Syria, I\\'m unfortunately rather pessimistic,\" Fabius said as he left the World Policy Conference, a meeting of political and business leaders in Monaco. \"The moderate opposition that we support is in serious difficulty,\" he said. Talks have been scheduled for January 22 in the Swiss city - the next stage of extensive diplomatic efforts to bring together warring factions from within Syria\\'s borders. However, Fabius said there were concerns that any progress would be made. \"My fellow European ministers and I are working to make (the talks) a success, but there\\'s room for lots of doubts,\" said Fabius. \"And unfortunately, if this meeting\\'s not a success, it means this martyred country is going to keep suffering - and neighboring countries, too,\" he said. The Syrian government and opposition are to send delegates to the so-called Geneva-2 conference. However, Fabius said that the weakened position of the opposition led him to believe it had lost bargaining powers with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad\\'s regime. \"Bashar al-Assad says he will send representatives to Geneva,\" said Fabius. \"While Mr Assad has a lot of faults, he is not an idiot... we can\\'t see why he would hand over all his powers.\" The more moderate factions of the opposition to al-Assad have faced mounting difficulties this year, increasingly losing ground to Islamist fighters. There was a further blow on Thursday when the US and Britain said they would suspend the provision of non-lethal aid to the Free Syrian Army after an increasingly strong rebel group, the Islamic Front, took over a Turkish border crossing and weapons warehouses nearby. The civil war in Syria has now raged for more than two-and-a-half years and killed more than 126,000 people. rc/lw (AFP, Reuters)',\n",

       " {'story': 'India\\'s Spicejet in \\'game-changing\\' deal with Boeing Indian budget airline Spicejet has said it\\'s buying hundreds of Boeing planes as it seeks to hike its share of the world\\'s fastest-growing passenger aviation market. It will be able to expand into long-haul flights. Indian low-cost airline Spicejet announced Friday it was buying up to 205 planes from Boeing in a deal worth $22 billion (20.6 billion euros). The carrier said the contract included 100 737 jets from Boeing\\'s new Max family of aircraft, which it said would help reduce fuel costs by up to a fifth. The deal also included the option to buy 50 wide-body planes suitable for long-haul flights. Spicejet, which currently has just 49 planes, said the order would enable it to boost its domestic operations and potentially expand into long-haul international flights. \"This is the largest deal for Spicejet, it\\'s one of the largest in Indian aviation and is the largest for Boeing in India,\" Spicejet Chairman Ajay Singh said in a statement. Changing environment India\\'s aviation market is growing at double the pace of China\\'s, as an emerging middle class takes to the skies. The latest industry figures from the International Air Transport Association (IATA) show India\\'s domestic air traffic grew by 22.3 percent in November year on year, followed by Russia at 15.5 percent and China in third position at 14.9 percent. The deal with Boeing marks a turnaround for Spicejet, whose planes were briefly grounded in 2014 after suppliers refused to refuel them due to unpaid bills. Most of India\\'s airlines are still making losses, while state carrier Air India has long relied on government support. But lower fuel prices and a rise in economic growth have boosted the sector and enhanced airlines\\' profit prospects. hg/jd (AFP, dpa)',\n",

       " {'story': 'It\\'s a Dog\\'s Life Hmm, a mint biscuit or a garlic cookie? There are some difficult culinary decisions facing pampered pooches in Germany. Dogs in Wiesbaden -- one of Germany\\'s most affluent cities -- have a tough life. First, there is the arduous stroll through the haute couture stores in the luxurious Wilhelmstrasse. Then there is the patient wait while owners take a flutter at the casino or a dip in the thermal springs. But, fortunately, the poor pooches have some compensation -- their very own bakery offering a choice of tuna cookies, love bones, vitality bars and other tasty creations for the affluent, urban dog. A former florist, Janine Saraniti-Lagerin, set up her \"Dog\\'s Goodies\" bakery for canine customers three months ago after being inspired by a television report about similar US shops. In a stylish city where it just wouldn\\'t do to be seen with a chubby canine, the tidbits on sale are, of course, non-fattening and sugar free. They also contain no salt or chemicals that might harm the sensitive little beasts. Pricey treats for pets Although Germans might spend the least in Europe when it comes to putting food on the table, it seems they\\'re willing to make an exception for the chow that lands in their best friend\\'s bowl. Business is booming at the bakery even though the prices for the tasty treats range from 19 to 32 euros pro kilo ($10.90 to $18.60 per pound). Even if not every dog owner frequents the doggy biscuit shop, the bakery is the talk of the town. \"The doggy bakery is what we owners have all been talking about when we walk our dogs,\" said customer Jutta Schneider. Schneider said she brings her male Havanese, Amor, to the shop once a week for his favorite snack, potato balls. And in case Wiesbaden\\'s inhabitants fail to find just the right gift for their cherished pets at the city\\'s famous Christmas markets, the bakery will be offering Christmas stockings filled with doggy cookies during the festive season.',\n",

       " {'story': 'Supreme Court blocks Madoff victims from recovering billions A ruling by the US Supreme Court could block victims of Bernard Madoff\\'s Ponzi scheme from recouping billions of dollars from investors who cashed out before the enterprise of the disgraced financier went bust in 2008. The high court on Monday said federal bankruptcy law did not permit trustee Irving Picard to recover billions of dollars in payments from some clients of Madoff\\'s fraudulent investment scheme who profited from the now defunct company. Those former Madoff customers sold their shares in Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities more than two years before the firm collapsed on Dec. 11, 2008, walking away with handsome profits. Picard, the bankrupt firm\\'s liquidator, subsequently took action to recover the money that Madoff had swindled from unsuspecting investors, many of whom saw their entire life savings evaporate. Picard sought to win back some $4 billion (3.5 billion euros) from people who withdrew more than they invested, but a federal court barred him from doing so late last year. Monday\\'s Supreme Court decision let that ruling stand. \\'Clawbacks\\' According to lawyers in the case, the courts have blocked Picard and the Securities Investor Protection Corporation - a nonprofit that helps customers recover funds when brokerages go under - from directly recoving some $2 billion. It also complicated the process of getting back a further $2 billion. The courts\\' recalcitrance was due to clauses in federal bankruptcy code that aim to prevent such \"clawbacks.\" When Congress wrote the laws, representatives hoped to preclude the kind of \"significant market disruption\" that recovering lost funds from brokerages could cause. Madoff was exposed a fraud when the financial crisis struck and it became clear that he had perpetrated the world\\'s greatest known financial fraud. The impact of his Ponzi scheme has meanwhile been estimated at $65 billion. cjc/hg (AFP, Reuters)',\n",

       " {'story': 'Sydney terror suspects plans revealed The Australian government has released details about the two terror suspects it arrested earlier in the week. The men threatened stabbings and claimed to be operating on behalf of \"Islamic State.\" The two suspected terrorists arrested in Australia on Tuesday were identified on Thursday as Omar Al-Kutobi, 24, and Mohammad Kiad, 25. Besides the knife, machete, and homemade \"Islamic State\" flag seized at their Sydney home, the Australian government also released details of a video in which one of the men threatens to stab the kidney and necks of Australians. After watching the video, Prime Minister Tony Abbott told parliament it depicted a man kneeling before the black flag with a knife saying \"I swear to almighty Allah, we will carry out the first operation for the soldiers of the caliphate in Australia… I swear to you almighty Allah, blond people, there is no room for blame between you and us. We only owe you stabbing the kidneys and striking necks.\" Sydney police said they responded to a tipoff that Kutobi and Kiad were planning to carry out violence on Tuesday when the pair was arrested and charged with intent to launch a terrorist attack. Neither has asked for bail or entered a plea to the charges, which carry a possible life prison sentence. Immigration Minister Peter Dutton responded to reports on Thursday that the men came to Australia as refugees, and perhaps with fake passports. Dutton admitted that one of them may have entered the country with \"some false documentation\" and called for an urgent review of the matter. \"Monstrous extremism\" \"I don\\'t think it would be possible to witness uglier fanaticism than this, monstrous extremism than this, and I regret to say it is now present in our country,\" Prime Minister Abbott said. Whether the two men actually have ties to the IS terrorist group is under investigation. The government believes that at least 70 Australians are fighting with IS in Syria and Iraq, helped by around 100 Australia-based facilitators. In December, Man Monis, an Iran-born self-styled cleric with a criminal record, took 18 people hostage in a downtown Sydney café. Among his demands that he be delivered an \"Islamic State\" flag, though investigators later established he hadn\\'t had any contact with the jihadist group.

       " {'story': \"IMF's Lagarde should face court in Tapie affair - prosecutor A French prosecutor says IMF chief Christine Lagarde should face trial over a massive state payout to tycoon Bernard Tapie. The Supreme Court is now due to rule on the recommendation on July 22. The prosecutor recommended Friday that Lagarde's appeal against charges of misuse of public funds be rejected. Lagarde, who is head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), appealed an earlier Court of Justice ruling in December that she should face trial over a case where prominent French businessman Bernard Tapie received 404 million euros ($450 million) in taxpayer funds while she was French finance minister. The case dates back to 1993, when Tapie sold his majority stake in the sports giant Adidas to become a French cabinet minister. He later sued the French bank Credit Lyonnais, which bought the stake, accusing the lender of undervaluing the company. More than a decade later, Tapie backed Nicolas Sarkozy for president. In 2008, once elected, Sarkozy's government intervened in the court case when Lagarde ordered that the dispute transfer to binding arbitration. Judges later ruled that Tapie should receive hundreds of millions of euros in compensation. France's Supreme Court is expected to rule on Friday's recommendation on July 22. If the original order is upheld, the 60-year-old Lagarde will be tried in the Law Court of the Republic, which handles cases concerning offences committed by sitting government ministers. Prosecutors say Lagarde failed to challenge the arbitration ruling at the time, which they say was prejudicial to the state. She could face a year in jail if convicted as well as a fine of 15,000 euros. Lagarde has denied any wrongdoing or that she acted on orders from Sarkozy. Separately, Tapie was eventually charged with fraud, before being ordered to repay the cash in February 2015. He lost an appeal against the ruling on Thursday. Despite the case hanging over her, IMF's Lagarde to run for second term the IMF has named Lagarde to a second term as managing director, which officially starts next week. mm/kl (AFP, Reuters)\",\n",

       " {'story': \"Prosecutor requests Sarkozy stand trial over 2012 campaign funds The Paris state prosecutor has recommended former French President Nicolas Sarkozy face trial over alleged illegal funding of his failed 2012 campaign. The case could ruin his chances of running for president in 2017. The Paris prosecutor's office said Monday it had asked investigating magistrates to send former French President Nicolas Sarkozy and 13 others to court. The judges in charge of the case must now decide whether to follow the prosecution's recommendations. Sarkozy is accused of false accounting that allowed him to significantly exceed campaign spending limits in 2012. He was handed preliminary charges over the scandal and put under investigation in February. Re-election bid Sarkozy served as president of France between 2007 and 2012, before losing his re-election bid to current Socialist President Francois Hollande. The 61-year-old has announced plans to run for the presidency again in next year's elections, but a criminal trial could hurt his chances of success. To get a spot on the 2017 ballot, Sarkozy will first have to win backing from his conservative party in primaries set for November. His main rival for the nomination of Les Republicains (The Republicans) is Alain Juppe, 71, who has served as prime minister and minister of defense plus foreign minister. Allegations of illegal overspending The illegal funding case hinges on the activity of public relations firm Bygmalion, which organized some of Sarkozy's campaign appearances and is accused of using an invoice system to conceal unauthorized overspending. Bygmalion allegedly charged 18.5 million euros ($21 million) to Sarkozy's right-wing party - then called the UMP, but since renamed Les Republicains - instead of billing the campaign. According to the prosecution, the incorrect invoicing allowed it to greatly exceed the legal spending limit of 22.5 million euros. nm/jil (Reuters, AFP)\",\n",

The proximity of the US missile batteries to the Russian border should have convinced officials in Washington of the need to brief their counterparts in Moscow about plans to build portions of an anti-missile shield in the two eastern European countries. \"One should have spoken with Russia earlier as the sites where they (the missiles) are to be stationed are edging closer to Russia,\" Steinmeier told the German business daily Handelsblatt in an interview to be published Monday. \"Given the strategic nature of such projects, I call for a prudent approach and intensive dialogue with all partners who are directly or indirectly affected.\" Russian President Vladimir Putin last week accused the United States of making the world a more place with its plans for an anti-missile system. \"One-sided illegitimate action hasn\\'t solved a single problem and has become a generator of many human tragedies, a source of tension,\" Putin said. Iran not a threat to Europe US Secretary of Defense Robert Gates insisted that the missile system, which calls for placing 10 interceptor missiles in Poland and the Czech Republic, was not directed against Russia but to protect Europe from missiles launched in the Middle East. Steinmeier, however, dismissed any potential threat posed by Iranian rockets, saying Tehran did not possess the technology to make such an attack. He also spoke out against any immediate new sanctions against Iran over its nuclear policies. \"The most recent resolution of the UN Security Council does not contain any automatic mechanism for the situation where Iran does not fulfill its obligations,\" he said. US waiting for Poland\\'s official answer The leader of the oppositions Greens party, Fritz Kuhn, said the German government needed to make it clear to US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice during her visit to Berlin this week that it would not support placing missiles in the two EU and NATO member countries. \"What the USA is doing can only be understood by Russia as a provocation,\" he told Monday\\'s Saarbrücker Zeitung. Exactly how much criticism Germany needs to give the US remains unclear as Poland has yet to decide if it will allow the Americans to station missiles within the country. \"We are preparing an answer that I think we will give to the American administration by diplomatic means within two weeks,\" new Polish Defense Minister Aleksander Szczyglo told Poland\\'s PAP news agency on Sunday.',\n",

       " {'story': 'Russia mulls resuming direct flights to Egypt Russia\\'s top diplomat has announced Moscow\\'s intentions to resume flights to Egypt after 2015\\'s aviation tragedy. Metrojet, the downed aircraft\\'s operator, was banned from undertaking domestic and international flights. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov announced on Wednesday that Moscow was working with Egyptian authorities to resume \"direct air links\" to Egypt, in comments carried by Russia\\'s state-owned TASS news agency. \"We agreed to restore air links as soon as possible, provided the highest security standards are guaranteed for Russian citizens,\" Lavrov said after meeting with Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry in the nation\\'s capital. Moscow banned all direct flights to Egypt in November after a Russian passenger plane was downed over the Sinai Peninsula shortly after taking off from Sharm el-Sheikh, a well-known tourist destination on the Red Sea. The \"Islamic State\"-affiliated militant group Sinai Province claimed responsibility for bringing down the Airbus A321 aircraft by smuggling a bomb onto the passenger plane. In a statement posted online, the militant group said the attack was made in retaliation for Russian airstrikes against \"Islamic State\" targets in Syria. Russian investigators confirmed the plane was brought down by an explosive device, although Egyptian authorities said there was a lack of evidence to prove the militant group\\'s claims. \\'Security for our citizens\\' Lavrov said Russian and Egyptian authorities have been in contact to ensure the necessary security measures have been implemented by Cairo. \"Specific recommendations were formulated. Our specialists are certain they will provide reliable security for our citizens who travel to Egypt and from Egypt by air. The Egyptian side has considered these recommendations and, as far as I understand, were supported in general,\" added Russia\\'s top diplomat. Egypt\\'s Red Sea tourist destinations, including Sharm el-Sheikh and Hurghada, were considered some of the most popular vacation spots for Russian citizens prior to the aviation disaster. Moscow\\'s decision to ban direct civilian flights to Egypt further damaged the country\\'s ailing tourism industry, one of its main sources of foreign currency. Meanwhile, Russia\\'s Federal Air Transport Agency on Wednesday banned Kogalymavia, which operated the downed flight under the name Metrojet, from undertaking international and domestic flights due to \"discrepancies and violations\" following safety inspections, TASS reported.',\n",

       " {'story': 'Germany\\'s opposition slams Berlin refugee deal Germany\\'s opposition parties have criticized a deal forged by coalition partners to control migration flows in Germany, saying it produces \"little concrete action.\" Germany has struggled to cope with the influx. Robert Habeck, a member of Germany\\'s opposition Green Party, lambasted a migrant deal struck on Thursday by leaders of the ruling Christian Democratic Union (CDU), its Bavarian sister-party the Christian Social Union (CSU) and its coalition partner the Social Democrats (SPD). \"In other countries, most people have to wait a year before they can even apply for asylum. In this context, it is a complete mystery how the Federal government intends to conclude the process at special registration centers within a few weeks,\" Habeck told DPA news agency. Top Left Party politician, Bernd Riexinger, further pointed to the plan creating new problems. \"There\\'s the danger that these people won\\'t receive a fair asylum procedure,\" Riexinger said. The deal - announced by Chancellor Angela Merkel, Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel and Bavarian premier Horst Seehofer on Thursday - purports to set up three to five reception centers where asylum seekers must wait until a decision is made on their application. It would also penalize those who would leave the centers\\' grounds multiple times. Prior to the deal, the SPD was critical of proposals for transit zones and migrant detention centers. However, Thursday\\'s coalition agreement has been hailed by the center-left party as a step forward to managing the migration crisis. \\'Little concrete action\\' Meanwhile, Habeck, the Greens\\' politician, who wants to be the party\\'s top candidate for the 2017 parliamentary elections, said he also considers it wrong to restrict family reunification, one of the latest provisions to be accepted under the deal, which would impede family reunification until the refugee has lived in Germany for two years. \"In sum, the proposals bring little concrete action - except a truce between the CDU and SPD,\" Habeck said. Germany has struggled to cope with the wave of migration, which has stretched the country\\'s capacities to register and house asylum seekers. Between 800,000 and one million migrants are expected to arrive in the country in 2015. The EU Commission said Thursday it is working with a \"technical assessment\" that posits three million migrants entering the 28-nation bloc by 2017. ls/kms (AFP, dpa, Reuters)',\n",

       " {'story': 'Stop the nonsense: homeopathy has no place in medicine On Thursday, more than 500 doctors will meet in Bremen for the 165th Annual Congress of Homeopathic Doctors. It’s scandalous that medical professionals still adhere to such superstitions, says DW\\'s Fabian Schmidt. Homeopathy is nothing but an obscure mistaken belief. It explains alleged successes in healing patients with a mystic and magic \"memory of water,\" with ominous \"energy\" and \"vibrations.\" This hocus-pocus is no more scientific than Santeria incantations by Haitian voodoo priests. Homeopathy has been clearly proven to be pharmaceutically useless in proper medical trials. Therefore, its only place is in the cabinet of horrors of historical medical and anthropological research institutions. The best would be to store homeopathy in the last corner on some dusty shelf, somewhere hidden far away behind behind Berlin\\'s famous 19th century doctor Rudolf Virchow\\'s pathological collections of jars with diseased body parts and organs. After all, his terrifying exhibits were part of real scientific medical research. They represent the foundation of our modern medicine. Medicine must not be arbitrary Since Virchow researched cells and his contemporary Robert Koch discovered the importance of bacteria a lot has happened: Our medical research today is focusing on the level of molecules. With the decoding of the human genome, medicine has become better and more powerful than ever before. At no point in history have humans better understood how all the various processes in the body influence each other. Never before have we known more about the functions of all those enzymes, hormones and proteins. Today, even the use of custom made molecules for individual treatment is a common practice against some cancers. It\\'s called personalized medicine. Scientific knowledge today is precise, thorough and verifiable. That\\'s why the medical profession must not allow medicine to be devalued by unscientific and ideologically tainted belief-systems from the Napoleonic era. There must be no place for such arbitrariness in this noble scientific discipline. Doctors need to take a stand For the sake of their own reputations, but even more for the protection of patients and customers, the medical professional organizations, universities and the research-based pharmaceutical companies must take a clear stand: homeopathy must be outlawed. It has no place in medical practices, pharmacies or serious research laboratories. The curricula of medical faculties also need to be free of these esoteric teachings. Leave the globuli - the homeopathic tablets - to those who can really use them: to historians, who are researching the errors of ancient medicine, to anthropologists who are looking into creepy superstitious rites or to the incorrigible shamans and druids. At least those self-appointed healers do not have a medical license.',\n",

       " {'story': 'Egypt bans Hamas, labels it a terrorist organization An Egyptian court has banned all activities by the Palestinian militant group Hamas in Egypt. Cairo’s relations with the group have fallen apart since president Morsi’s military-backed ouster. A Cairo court on Tuesday ruled on the ban and ordered that Hamas offices in the country be shut down and all dealings with the group suspended. The court also branded Hamas as a terrorist organization. The country\\'s relations with Hamas, which rules neighboring Gaza Strip, have sharply deteriorated since the military removed Islamist president Mohammed Morsi last July. Hamas, the Palestinian chapter of Morsi\\'s Muslim Brotherhood, denounced the move saying it \"serves the [Israeli] occupation.\" Egyptian officials have accused Hamas of plotting with Morsi and his Muslim Brotherhood to carry out \"terror attacks\" in the country. The country\\'s new military-installed authorities, led by military chief Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, were angered by Hamas officials who openly criticized their decision to outlaw the Muslim Brotherhood, the target of a deadly crackdown since Morsi\\'s ouster. hc/ccp (AFP, AP)',\n",

       " {'story': 'Czech court keeps Europe waiting The Czech Republic\\'s highest court said it will deliver a ruling next week on a complaint filed by Czech senators against the European Union\\'s Lisbon Treaty, which could hold up reform of the unwieldy 27-member bloc. The Czech Constitutional Court heard the case Tuesday and will likely announce its decision on Tuesday, November 3, according to secretary-general of the court, Tomas Langasek. The proceedings at the Czech Constitutional Court have stirred intense international interest because the Lisbon Treaty, designed to streamline the administrative and decision-making processes in the EU, hangs in the balance. The Czech Republic is the only country yet to ratify the treaty. Without its signature, the European Commission, the EU\\'s executive body, would be in legal limbo and unable to fill appointments set to expire at the end of this month. \"Only when we have legal clarity about the (Lisbon) Treaty can we decide about the new top posts in the EU,\" said Sweden\\'s Minister for European Affairs, Cecilia Malmstrom, whose country currently hold the rotating EU presidency. The group of Czech senators who filed the complaint say the treaty undermines national sovereignty and is at odds with the Czech constitution. Czech President Vaclav Klaus has also been very critical of the treaty, demanding an \"opt-out\" clause with regard to the EU\\'s human rights charter. Klaus has said that if the treaty were approved as is, it would allow ethnic Germans, expelled under the Benes Decrees in postwar Czechoslovakia to reclaim their property and file damage claims. Slovakia now eager to have the same privilege The move by the Czechs has led neighboring Slovakia to demand a similar opt-out. Foreign Minister Miroslav Lajcak on Monday said his country \"would insist on the same political and legal protections as the Czech Republic\" because it shares the same post-World War II law that deported millions of ethnic Germans and Hungarians from then-united Czechoslovakia. Most legal experts say the Czech court, which has already rejected one challenge by the Senate, will throw out the senators\\' appeal. It could issue a ruling on Tuesday, or take longer to do so. Czech Prime Minister Jan Fischer, who would like to see the Lisbon Treaty ratified, said on Monday that he did not expect the final ruling until later. Rejection of the appeal would give President Klaus the legal authority to sign the Lisbon Treaty. He cannot sign before the ruling. However, if the court accepts the appeal, the Czech constitution would have to be changed to allow ratification. And this could be a lengthy process with an uncertain outcome. gb/dpa/AP/Reuters Editor: Nancy Isenson',\n",

       " {'story': 'Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal ends exile with Gaza visit Khaled Meshaal, the leader-in-exile of Hamas, has crossed into Gaza for the first time ever. There is fierce speculation over whether the visit marks a political comeback for Meshaal or the end of his time as leader. The exiled leader of Hamas, the political group that runs the Gaza Strip, set foot on Palestinian soil for the first time in 45 years on Friday. Khaled Meshaal, who has not returned to the Palestinian Territories since he left the West Bank aged eleven, kissed the soil on his arrival before greeting Gaza\\'s prime minister, Ismail Haniya of Hamas. Meshaal was accompanied by his deputy, Mussa Abu Marzuk, and a party of other senior officials as he drove through the Gaza crossing. Meshaal will stay in Gaza for around 48 hours. He is expected to attend an open-air rally on Saturday, which will celebrate Hamas\\' 25th anniversary and what the group refers to as its victory against Israel last month. Bouncing back or saying goodbye? Meshaal, who survived an Israeli assassination attempt in Jordan in 1997, was based in Syria from 2004 until January this year; by that point the war between Syrian President Assad and rebels meant the arrangement was no longer workable. The position of the 56-year-old briefly suffered as a result- he had derived much of his authority from cultivating close ties with both Damascus and Tehran from that base. But the exiled leader, who now runs Hamas from Qatar and Cairo, regained ground during the confrontation which erupted between Israel and Gaza on November 14 and left 174 Palestinians and six Israelis dead. He worked closely with Cairo to broker the ceasefire which brought the fighting to an end. Nevertheless, there is speculation that Meshaal\\'s Gaza trip marks the conclusion of a secret leadership election for his successor. Broader unease about the position of the Palestinian Territories vis a vis Israel parallels such uncertainty over leadership. At the end of November, the UN voted to upgrade the status of the Palestinian Territories to \"non-member observer status.\" But Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to plow ahead with controversial plans to build 3,000 settler homes in the West Bank, a move that German Chancellor Angela Merkel cautioned against during talks with Netanyahu in Berlin on Thursday. sej/rg (Reuters, AFP)',\n",

       " {'story': 'Key European nations call for new sanctions against Belarus Key European nations are calling for new sanctions against Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko as his regime continues to try and imprison former presidential candidates and opposition members. Poland, Germany and France have called on the European Union to impose sanctions against Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko. The new round of sanctions would target 13 other individuals and possibly certain companies. Brussels has already placed sanctions against around 150 people associated with President Lukashenko. \"Not a general embargo, but something which will make life difficult for companies which finance the regime,\" said Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski. \"We will increase pressure on the Belarus regime as long as it does not change its politics.\" German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said the sanctions would be designed to impact only the targeted officials. \"The sanctions will affect the regime, not the people,\" Westerwelle said. French Foreign Minister Alaine Juppe also hinted that he would back the sanctions. The EU\\'s 27 foreign ministers are set to discuss Belarus when they meet in Brussels on Monday. Trials continue Belarusian courts continue to try and convict presidential candidates who ran against President Lukashenko in the election last December. Vladimir Neklyayev and Vitaly Rymashevsky were found guilty of organizing actions that violated public order. The sentences for both men were suspended by two years. Neklyayev credited his relatively soft sentence to support at home and abroad. \"If it was not for the support from the US and the European Union I would not be standing here in front of you but would rather be in prison answering the question about who I am spying for,\" he told reporters. \"This is (also) the result of people\\'s solidarity.\" The convictions come after Lukashenko\\'s main opponent during the December elections, Andrei Sannikov, was sentenced to five years in prison for organizing mass disturbances. Lukashenko won another term as president with 80 percent of the vote in an election in December condemned by the West as manipulated. Mass demonstrations erupted after the election, leading to a government crackdown in which hundreds of people were arrested. Author: Spencer Kimball (Reuters, AFP) Editor: Toma Tasovac',\n",

       " {'story': 'Cologne considers emergency plan for Rose Monday holiday Just over a year since the collapse of the Cologne archives building, authorities have expressed concern over ongoing underground subway work in the city, German media says. Concerns over underground subway work in the western German city of Cologne prompted city authorities there to consider evacuation plans for the upcoming Rose Monday public holiday festivities, German media reports. The precautions come less than a year after the Cologne City Archives building collapsed into the ground, along with an apartment building, killing two people. The collapse occurred during building work aimed at expanding Cologne\\'s underground train network. The buildings were above one of the construction sites. However, city manager Guido Kahlen said party-goers and locals were safe on Cologne\\'s streets during the carnival festival. \"There is no danger of collapse,\" Kahlen told a news conference on Friday. \"Even during the festivities, we will be able to react quickly.\" The Rose Monday festival see hundreds of thousands of Germans descend upon Cologne, placing a huge strain on the city\\'s streets and public transportation network. Extra precautions Cologne public prosecutors said they had communicated their concerns over the upcoming public holiday to the city\\'s public transport authority, the KVB, which is overseeing the ongoing underground work, German newsmagazine Der Spiegel reported. City chiefs then reportedly consulted specialists to create an emergency plan for the area around Cologne\\'s Waidmarkt tram stop. However, after further examination of the danger posed by the mass crowds the plan was reportedly dropped. Meanwhile, Cologne city authorities said Thursday they had learned that less than one-fifth of the steel brackets purchased for the underground line beneath the Heumarkt tram stop were in place, the daily Koelner Stadt-Anzeiger reported. The paper said that upon investigation it was found that 83 percent of the brackets, purchased to reinforce the concrete walls of the underground tunnels, were used during construction. Der Spiegel reported that the site\\'s foreman and several employees were believed to have stolen many of the brackets and sold them to a scrap metal merchant. dfm/dpa/AFP Editor: Rob Turner',\n",

       " {'story': \"German nurse suspected in 24 more patient deaths A male German nurse has been accused of killing dozens of patients over the years with a potent heart drug. The suspected death toll would make him one of Germany's worst post-war serial killers. The number of possible murder victims rose of convicted male nurse Niels H. rose to at least 24, German police said on Wednesday. The former nurse was already found guilty of two murders and three attempted murders of intensive-care patients in February of 2015 and was imprisoned for life. Niels H. already admitted in court to injecting around 90 patients with an unprescribed heart drug and claimed to have killed around 30. After injecting his victims, he would then try to revive them in order to stand out amongst his peers. During the investigation, he said he felt overjoyed when he managed to bring a patient back from the brink of death, and was devastated when he failed. Police in the German town of Oldenburg said on Wednesday that they have exhumed and tested 77 sets of mortal remains from patients who had been under the care of Niels H. Besides the 24 suspicious cases where traces of the drug were found, police are still awaiting results from seven additional bodies. Police are looking into some 200 fatalities at the Delmenhorst hospital where Niels H. worked, as well as at the nurse's previous places of employment which include a nursing home, a clinic, and an emergency medical service. Investigators hope to have all the test results by mid-June, where they will then release detailed information to the public about the cases. The case dates back to 2005 when a coworker witnessed Niels H. administering the drug to a patient in Delmenhorst. After the patient survived, he was arrested and sentenced for attempted murder. A woman then contacted police, voicing suspicion that her mother may have also been a victim of the nurse - leading to the exhumations which sent Niels H. to prison for life. rs/kms (AFP, dpa)\",\n",

       " {'story': 'Thousands protest against neo-Nazis in Dresden More than 6,000 people from across Germany gathered in the eastern city of Dresden on Saturday to protest a planned Neo-Nazi demonstration, which was canceled beforehand. Thousands of protesters took part in an anti-neo-Nazi demonstration in the eastern German city of Dresden on Saturday. According to the organizers of the event, the left-wing group \\'Nazi-free Dresden,\\' 10,000 people took to the streets. Police, who said the demonstrations were largely peaceful, said attendance was closer to 6,500. Protesters demanded that the right-wing NPD party be banned and that the police in the state of Saxony do more to bring neo-Nazis to book. Dresdencouncil had also organized an event at a separate location, which around 1,500 people attended, among them Saxony\\'s state premier Stanislaw Tillich and Dresden mayor Dirk Hilbert. The demonstrations were originally intended to counteract a planned neo-Nazi march, which was called off after similar marches in 2010 and 2011 were successfully disrupted by anti-far-right protesters. An alternative neo-Nazi march in Gera, in eastern Thuringia, did not attract many demonstrators. Each February, Dresden commemorates the allied bombing and destruction of the city in World War II on February 13, 1945. Far-right groups from across Europe normally use the occasion to stage a march. Only in the last few years have they experienced large-scale organized resistance from groups like \\'Nazi-free Dresden.\\' Dresden\\'s mayor Hilbert said that it was no longer enough to commemorate in silence, but that it was crucial to also \"send a signal\" to the far-right. Sunday\\'s demonstrations follow similar protests last Monday, when around 1,600 neo-Nazis gathered in Dresden. But the march had to be cut short because of massive counter-demonstrations. ng/ccp (epd, dpa)',\n",

       " {'story': \"GM ditches Chevrolet in Europe to boost Opel, Vauxhall fortunes US auto giant General Motors (GM) has unveiled plans to withdraw its Chevrolet brand from markets in Europe. The move aims to strengthen GM’s other struggling European brands, Opel in Germany and the UK’s Vauxhall. General Motors (GM) will stop selling its Chevrolet models in European markets by 2015, Stephen Girsky, Vice Chairman at the US carmaker announced on Thursday. Speaking to investors in a conference call, Girsky said GM's decision came as part of efforts to focus resources on reviving the company's Opel brand. “We have growing confidence in the Opel and Vauxhall brands in Europe,” Girsky said. German carmaker Opel and its UK equivalent Vauxhall have competed against Chevrolet for customers ever since GM introduced smaller Chevrolet models to European markets in 2005. While Opel/Vauxhall secured a 6.7 percent market share on the continent in recent years, Chevrolet barely managed to reach 1 percent. Moreover, Chevrolet sales slumped 17 percent year-on-year to just 25,000 cars by September. “Basically we will shut down the 1-percent-share company in Europe. The financial results have been unacceptable,” Girsky said. The GM vice chairman also said that the US auto giant would set aside up to $1 billion (740 million euros) over the next two years to cover the costs arising from closing Chevrolets about 1,900 dealerships in Europe. The move forms the latest effort by GM to turn around its European operations amid the ongoing car slump on the crisis-hit continent. GM also announced that it would continue to sell its smaller Chevrolet models in Russia and other former Soviet markets. In Western Europe, however, Chevrolet would only be present with its iconic Corvette model after 2016. uhe/pfd (dpa, Reuters, AFP)\",\n",

       " {'story': 'Prague seeks to calm China over Dalai Lama visit  The Czech president has tried to limit damage to his country\\'s efforts to coax Chinese investment, after the Dalai Lama met with officials. The Tibetan spiritual leader arrived in Prague on Monday. Czech President Milos Zeman, the prime minister and two parliamentary speakers sought to reassure China, after the exilted Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama met with politicians in Prague. In a joint statement on Tuesday, the group said the Czech Republic \"respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity\" of China, adding that: \"we consider the relationships between our countries and their remarkable development in recent years most beneficial for both parties. \"The private activities of some Czech politicians do not signal a change in the Czech Republic\\'s official policy and we would consider it unfortunate if someone perceived them as such,\" said the leaders. The Dalai Lama arrived in Prague on Monday to attend the pro-democracy Forum 2000 conference, co-founded in 1996 by the late Czech president Vaclav Havel, who had close personal links with the Nobel Peace Prize laureate. The 80-year old met politicians from the small centrist Christian and Democratic Union party, the junior partner in the leftist-led coalition government: Deputy Prime Minister Pavel Belobradek, Culture Minister Daniel Herman and the deputy speakers of both houses of parliament. Before coming to Prague, the Dalai Lama met Slovak President Andrej Kiska in Bratislava, a visit that also angered Beijing. Money talks Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Prague with a business delegation in March and subsequently China\\'s CEFC - one of the country\\'s top 10 private firms - recently spent around a billion euros on stakes in a Czech airline, a brewery, two media groups and a top football team. Beijing maintains that the Dalai Lama supports separatism and violence in Tibet, a region China has ruled since 1951. The Dalai Lama fled to India after a failed uprising in 1959, but is still deeply revered by many Tibetans in China and beyond. jbh/jr (AFP, Reuters)',\n",

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday equated Palestinian criticism of Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank to \"ethnic cleansing,\" drawing sharp criticism from Washington, its key ally. In a video disseminated on social media platforms, Netanyahu said he had \"always been perplexed\" by the claim that settlements are an \"obstacle to peace.\" \"The Palestinian leadership actually demands a Palestinian state with one pre-condition: No Jews. There\\'s a phrase for that: It\\'s called ethnic cleansing,\" Netanyahu said. US State Department spokeswoman Elizabeth Trudeau told reporters on Friday that \"type of terminology is inappropriate and unhelpful.\" \"We obviously strongly disagree with the characterization that those who oppose settlement activity or view it as an obstacle to peace are somehow calling for ethnic cleansing of Jews from the West Bank,\" she added. Trudeau said Israel\\'s expansion policy raised \"real questions about Israel\\'s long-term intentions in the West Bank.\" Last week, the US took a stronger tone on Israeli settlement expansion after a military committee approved hundreds of complexes in the West Bank, which the Palestinians hope will form part of an independent state. The international community maintains that settlement activity in the West Bank is illegal and counter to peace efforts aimed at ending the conflict. However, the Israeli government rejects such claims, saying Jews have lived in the territory for thousands of years and that settlements do not undermine a peaceful resolution. ls/cmk (Reuters, AP)',\n",

       " {'story': 'Costs of cleaning old Sellafield nuclear site soar The British government has been forced to admit that it doesn\\'t know the ultimate cost of closing down and cleaning up its hazardous nuclear site Sellafield. The latest figure was 53 billion pounds. The cost estimate of cleaning up the hazardous waste at Sellafield reached 53 billion pounds ($79.18 billion, 74 billion euros) in February, a new National Audit Office report said. That estimate is up 5 billion pounds from March last year, and the figure is expected to rise above 70 billion pounds. Last year, Britain\\'s Committee of Public Accounts criticized the management of Sellafield for huge cost over-runs, delays on projects and expensive staff. The committee, which assesses whether taxpayers\\' money is being spent properly, on Wednesday asked the government, the site\\'s owner, the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA), Sellafield Ltd and former managers Nuclear Management Partners (NMP) whether costs would continue to rise. The NDA is aiming to clear Sellafield, called Britain\\'s \"largest and most hazardous nuclear site\" by the NAO, by 2120. \\'Unprecedented difficulties\\' \"It is impossible to know that (...) we find difficulties at the site which are pretty much unprecedented,\" Stephen Lovegrove, permanent secretary at the government\\'s Department of Energy and Climate Change, told the committee. Britain\\'s worst ever nuclear accident happened at the site in 1957. Sellafield stopped generating electricity in 2003. It is now a reprocessing and waste storage facility which deals with spent nuclear fuel from Britain and other countries. Despite the dangers of nuclear power - illustrated by the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011- the EU in September recommended approval of Britain\\'s ambitious plan to build its first nuclear plant in a generation - the Hinkley Point project - with backing from French and Chinese energy giants, after ruling that it met state aid rules. bk/hg (Reuters, AFP)',\n",

       " {'story': 'Peru earthquake: Casualties reported after powerful quake hits south coast  A strong earthquake has struck off the coast of southern Peru, killing at least one person and injuring more than 60. The jolt damaged roads and homes, and authorities warned the death toll could rise.  The 7.1 magnitude earthquake hit Sunday at 4:18 a.m. local time (0918 UTC) in the Pacific Ocean, 40 kilometers (25 miles) offshore from the town of Acari in Peru\\'s Arequipa region, the US Geological Survey reported. Peru\\'s Geophysics Institute said it had measured a magnitude of 6.8. Read more: Magnitude 7.6 earthquake hits coast of southern Chile The powerful tremor caused 171 homes to collapse, displacing the same number of families, Peru\\'s National Emergency Operations Center said on its website. At least 736 families had been affected in some way by the tremor, they added. Roads also collapsed and left several municipalities without power. Officials said the only confirmed fatality was a 55-year-old man, who died in the town of Yauca after being crushed by rocks. Read more: Waterfalls dry up after Mexico quakes Peru\\'s Civil Defense Institute (INDECI), which is coordinating emergency help, said 65 people were injured. Many of those injured were in Caraveli province, a coastal area dependent on fishing and mining that is popular with tourists, officials said. INDECI chief Jorge Chavez said damage to roads was hampering efforts to reach the worst-affected areas. Workers used large tractors to clear away boulders and debris that crashed down and blocked some roads. Aid for victims President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski traveled to the towns of Chala and Acari, where he said the quake had toppled around 100 houses. \"We are going to send everything that is needed, such as tents for people whose homes were destroyed,\" Kuczynski told reporters. The US Pacific Tsunami Warning Center initially warned that \"hazardous tsunami waves are forecast for some coasts\" and that large swells could hit Peru and Chile. But it later downgraded the threat and said no tsunami waves had been spotted. Earthquakes are fairly common in Peru, which is on the so-called \"Ring of Fire\" — an arc of fault lines that circles the Pacific Basin. A 2007 quake in the country\\'s southern Ica district killed 595 people. In November 2015, two major 7.6 magnitude earthquakes hit eastern Peru near the border with Brazil. The tremor comes as Pope Francis prepares to visit Chile and Peru from January 15-21. Some damage occurred in communities that Pope Francis was scheduled to visit this week, but officials said the damage would not change the pontiff\\'s tour. law,nm/ng (Reuters, AP, EFE, dpa)',\n",

       " {'story': 'Obama announces deployment of 300 troops to Cameroon US President Barack Obama has said he will send troops to Cameroon in order to counter the terror group Boko Haram. The central African country was the target of an attack this past weekend. President Obama informed Congress on Wednesday it was sending 300 soldiers to Cameroon as part of the fight against the terrorist organization Boko Haram. The White House said 90 troops had already been deployed to the central African nation. The force, which officials say is armed for self defense, will remain in the country until their presence is no longer needed. White House press secretary Josh Earnest said the deployment was in coordination with the Cameroon government. \"It will be part of a broader regional effort to stop the spread of Boko Haram and other violent extremist organizations in West Africa,\" he said. Boko Haram, a Nigeria-based militant group affiliated with the \"Islamic State\" terrorist organization, began stepping up attacks in Cameroon earlier this year. A report released by Amnesty International in September said that almost 400 people in Cameroon had been killed by Boko Haram fighters since January 2015. On Sunday, a sucide attack killed nine people and injured 29 in a northern part of the country. blc/msh (AFP, AP, dpa, Reuters)',\n",

       " {'story': 'Air India to cut cost amid industry turbulence The Indian airliner has announced plans to slash staff and cut costly routes amid increasing pressure from cut-rate competitors. The move comes as the company eyes a possible turn-around after a long spell of losses. India\\'s state-owned aviation giant Air India announced late on Sunday that it plans to cut costs by 14 billion rupees (195 million euros, $227 million), or about 6 percent of its total outlays, in the next financial year. The announcement comes after the government asked the loss-making carrier to improve its fiscal health. The airline said that it would identify \"surplus staff,\" freeze contractual hiring and discontinue loss-making routes, in a move meant to reduce its variable spending of 140 billion rupees by a tenth. \"The ministry of civil aviation has directed that a 10 percent cut must be imposed,\" the company\\'s chairman and managing director Robit Nandan said in a circular to senior staff. The company has also restricted staff travel, while pilots and cabin crew must stay in hotels near airports to cut transport costs. In addition, the circular said, \"wage increases for local staff... will not be entertained.\" Stiff competition The move comes as Air India faces cut-throat competition from cheaper, private-sector rivals. The country\\'s former aviation monopoly now controls just a fifth of the domestic market and hasn\\'t turned an annual profit since 2007. In 2012, the government handed the flat-lining carrier a 300-billion-rupee bailout package, which was to be administered over a nine-year period, despite opposition from several ministers. The state run airline has reduced its losses over the last two fiscal years, with total year-on-year revenue rising by 6.5 percent in December 2014.

       " {'story': 'New Italian Law Grants Immunity to Premier Berlusconi Italy\\'s lower house of parliament has passed a bill that will grant immunity to Premier Silvio Berlusconi, who has had his share of run-ins with the law over corruption allegations in connection with his media empire. The bill got 309 yes votes from lawmakers, with 236 opposed and 30 abstentions. The adoption of the new law is a victory for Berlusconi, who began his third round as prime minister in April. The bill gives legal immunity from prosecution to the president, prime minister and the speakers of the two chambers of parliament while in office, and is now expected to become law in record time when it advances to the Senate in late July. Judges and much of Italy\\'s left-wing opposition opposed the law, which will suspend any statute of limitations to a case until the defendant leaves office. Italian Justice Minister Angelino Alfano said that the bill was a \"response to the need of those in the highest positions of state to work in serenity.\" Opposition leader Walter Veltroni, whose Democratic Party voted against the bill, commented last month that \"Berlusconi is in a big hurry on these matters,\" while the billionaire\\'s lawyer Niccolo Ghedini said the prime minister was \"under constant attacks by judges.\" Long list of allegations Berlusconi, a self-made billionaire, has faced charges including corruption, tax fraud, false accounting and illegally financing political parties, but he has never been definitively convicted. On Friday parliamentarians will also vote on a bill to suspend thousands of trials for a year as a means of speeding Italy\\'s notoriously slow justice system for the most serious cases languishing on the books. That law would keep the media tycoon out of the dock this month in a trial on charges of giving $600,000 dollars (380,000 euros) to his British lawyer David Mills in exchange for giving false testimony. Berlusconi is also seeking strict curbs on the use of wiretaps in judicial investigations and stiffer penalties for the publication of their transcripts.',\n",

       " {'story': 'Peru\\'s ex-president Fujimori receives medical pardon Peru\\'s president has pardoned jailed former president Alberto Fujimori after he was hospitalized. The 79-year-old was serving 25 years for rights abuses and corruption. Peruvian President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski announced Sunday that he granted a medical pardon to jailed ex-president Alberto Fujimori for \"humanitarian reasons.\" Fujimori was hospitalized on Saturday, prompting rumors that he could be handed a medical pardon. Fujimori\\'s doctor said Peru\\'s polarizing figure was transferred to Lima\\'s Centenary Clinic after a \"sudden drop in [blood] pressure with marked arrhythmia.\" The transfer came after his daughter, Keiki Fujimori, who leads the opposition Fujimorist Popular Front party, failed in Congress last Thursday to amass enough votes to impeach Kuczynski. Nine opposition members, including the ex-president\\'s youngest son Kenji, abstained in that vote, allowing Kuczynski to dodge censure. Political analysts questioned whether Fujimori\\'s pardon could be a way for Kuczynski to pay off his political debt to Kenji Fujimori. Loathed and lauded Some Peruvians laud the former strongman, who governed Peru from 1990 to 2000, for defeating the Maoist Shining Path guerrillas and stabilizing Peru\\'s economy. Other Peruvians loathe him for human rights violations carried out under his governance. Peruvian law provides that no person convicted of murder or kidnapping can receive a presidential pardon unless in the case of a terminal illness. In a statement Sunday, Kuczynski said a medical board had determined Fujimori \"suffers from a progressive, degenerative and incurable disease and that prison conditions mean a serious risk to his life, health and well-being.\" Three previous requests from Fujimori for pardons since 2013 were rejected after doctors said he did not suffer from incurable illness or severe mental disorder. cw, ipj/aw (AP, AFP)',\n",

       " {'story': 'India hands out life sentences for deadly Gujarat riots Nearly a dozen people have been sentenced to life in prison for their involvement in deadly sectarian riots. But the Indian government has also cracked down on an NGO critical of Modi\\'s involvement in the violence. An Indian court on Friday sentenced 11 people to life in prison for participating in deadly sectarian riots that swept across the state of Gujarat in 2002, leaving over 1,000 dead in its wake. At least 12 more defendants received seven years in prison, while one received a 10-year sentence. \"This is hardly the punishment for the crime they have committed,\" said Zakia Jafri, the widow of the opposition Congress party lawmaker Ehsan Jafri, who was killed in the riots. Indian activist Anand Yagnik said the guilty should have received the death penalty. However, Special Court Judge P.B. Desai rejected the demand, saying the prosecution failed to prove accusations of a criminal conspiracy. The case has plagued Prime Minister Narendra Modi\\'s political career since he served as the state\\'s chief minister at the time of the riots. Activists claim Modi did little to prevent the violence that ensued, while others allege he instigated it. Earlier this month, a court convicted 24 Hindus and acquitted 36 others over the Gulbarg Housing Society massacre, in which a Hindu mob in 2002 set fire to residences and attacked inhabitants of the predominantly Muslim complex. \\'Actions of a bully\\' Meanwhile, the Indian government on Thursday revoked the Sabrang Trust\\'s foreign funding license, citing multiple violations of the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA), including misuse of foreign funds. The non-profit is run by high-profile activist Teesta Setalvad, a staunch critic of Modi who has brought attention to his involvement in the 2002 riots. \"Never be scared of the actions of a bully who only knows the use of brute force. Right shall triumph,\" Setalvad said in a statement posted on Twitter. UN human rights experts on Thursday called on the government to repeal the FCRA. \"We are alarmed that FCRA provisions are being used more and more to silence organizations involved in advocating civil, political, economic, social, environmental or cultural priorities, which may differ from those backed by the government,\" the UN Special Rapporteurs said in a statement. ls/kl (AFP, AP, Reuters)',\n",

       " {'story': \"Eurozone jobs crisis far from bottoming out Unemployment in the eurozone has reached a new all-time high, surpassing the 19-million mark for the first time since the euro was launched. As growth won't pick up this year, Europe's jobs crisis is expected to worsen. Unemployment across the 17-nation eurozone has struck 12 percent for the first time since the introduction of the euro in 1999, the European Union's statistics office, Eurostat, said on Tuesday. As 33,000 Europeans joined the jobless queues in February, the number of jobless in the single currency area surpassed 19 million people, or two million more than in the same month a year ago, Eurostat data showed. For the wider 27-nation European Union, February jobs data also showed a significant increase by 76,000 people to 26.34 million - a month-on-month rise in the rate from 10.8 percent in January to 10.9 percent in February. Describing unemployment as unacceptably high, EU Employment Commissioner Laszlo Andor said the European Union needed to mobilize all available resources to create jobs, most notably for young people. Youth unemployment stood at 23.9 percent in the eurozone and at 23.5 percent in the EU, Eurostat's data showed, with crisis-hit Spain and Greece suffering jobless rates of more than 55 percent among youngsters under 25 years of age, followed by Portugal and Italy in the range of more than 35 percent. Greece and Spain are also leaders with regard to total unemployment figures, with rates of 26.4 percent and 26.3 percent respectively. #video#However, the February figures were compiled before the outbreak of the debt crisis in Cyprus. Many economists believe Cyprus' unemployment, which currently stands at 14 percent, will rise to Greek and Spanish levels as the country's economy is expected to shrink by 10 percent this year. In addition, economic contraction in the eurozone is far from bottoming out as output is forecast to shrink by another 0.3 percent this year. Austria and Germany, which have been faring relatively well in the current economic crisis, had the lowest unemployment rate in the eurozone with 4.8 percent and 5.4 percent respectively in February. uhe/pfd (AP, AFP, dpa)\",\n",

       " {'story': \"Fed hikes interest rates as inflation picks up The US central bank has increased its benchmark interest rate for the first time since last December. Analysts said the move was overdue and reflected a buoyant economy and higher consumer prices. Ending its two-day policy meeting in Washington, the US Federal Reserve reported it had decided to up its key federal funds rate by 25 basis points, up from the current target range of 0.5-0.75 percent. The announcement came after a long period of no changes to the interest rates amid uncertainty over US President Donald Trump's economic agenda. Prior to Wednesday's move, the Fed had raised its key rate last December for only the second time since setting an unprecedented near-zero level at the peak of the global financial crisis in 2008. While markets had fully priced in Wednesday's rate hike, investors had been waiting for clues on the central bank's future monetary policy. There had been little doubt that the lender was now on course for regular three-monthly rises this year, but there was speculation that the rate-hike speed for 2018 and 2019 could turn out to be slightly higher. The bank said Wednesday there could be two more hikes this year, with an accelerated pace envisaged only for 2019. What made the Fed step into action? The Federal Reserve had earlier indicated that stronger signs of inflation had in no small way bolstered the argument for tighter monetary policy. The price index of personal consumption expenditures (PCE) jumped by 0.4 percent in January, showing a 1.9-percent increase for the last 12 months and thus approaching the central bank's own long-term inflation target of 2.0 percent for the first time in nearly five years. The Fed cites the spending-based PCE index as its preferred inflation gauge over the better-known consumer price index. While the latter showed only a slight 0.1-percent rise for February in data released earlier on Wednesday, the index' 12-month reading came in at 0.6 percent, reaching a nearly four-year high. The central bank was also guided by continuously good labor market figures, with roughly 200,000 new jobs created in each of the past three months and the unemployment rate standing at 4.7 percent at present. Fresh figures also showed a pickup in retail sales in the US despite delays in tax return payments, holding spending back somewhat. hg/sri (AP, dpa)\",\n",

       " {'story': 'China protests Myanmar bombing on its territory, sends jets to border Beijing has sent fighter jets to its border and summoned Myanmar\\'s ambassador after a Yangon airstrike within China killed four citizens. The bombing was part of Myanmar\\'s offensive against rebels in its north. Fighter jets monitored China\\'s border to Myanmar on Saturday after a bomb from a Myanmar aircraft hit a sugarcane field in the Chinese border city of Lincang and killed four people. Nine others were injured, news agency Xinhua reported. The strike, which came as Yangon\\'s forces were battling rebels in the north at the Chinese border, followed a similar incident some days back when a stray shell from Myanmar exploded in Chinese territory. The jets were sent to \"track, monitor, warn and chase away\" Myanmar military aircraft flying near the shared border, news agency DPA quoted the Chinese Air Force spokesman Shen Jinke as saying. Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister Liu Zhenmin also summoned Yangon\\'s ambassador Thit Linn Ohn to protest the incident. China \"strongly condemns\" the incident and calls on Myanmar to carry out a thorough investigation, report the findings to China, punish the guilty and take steps to ensure similar events do not occur, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement. Myanmar denies accusations Myanmar officials, on the other hand, said their offensive took place after they informed Chinese officials of their plan and that their attacks were carried out \"strictly adhering to the information we told them.\" \"The targets of all our aerial attacks were inside our territory,\" Yangon official Zaw Htay told Reuters, accusing rebels of \"purposely creating the attacks with the intent of causing misunderstanding between China and us.\" Myanmar\\'s offensive against rebels in its Kokang region, at China\\'s southwest, has sent thousands of people fleeing across the border into China. Myanmar\\'s forces have blamed the latest fighting on a renegade rebel faction led by Phone Kya Shin, who attempted to seize Laukkai, the capital of the self-administered Kokang region. US officials have also accused Phone, also known as Peng Jiashing, of playing a major role in trafficking opium and methamphetamines. The guerrilla faction used to be part of the Burmese Communist Party, backed by China until it signed a ceasefire with Yangon in 1989. Myanmar officials however still accuse former Chinese soldiers of training the rebels, a charge Beijing denies. mg/ng (dpa, AP, Reuters)',\n",

       " {'story': 'Comcast to buy GE\\'s stake in NBCUniversal Comcast Corp. has agreed to buy the remaining 49 percent stake in NBCUniversal from its joint venture partner General Electric. The deal will give Comcast full control of the US media and entertainment behemoth. \"This is an exciting day for Comcast as we have agreed to accelerate the purchase of NBCUniversal,\" Comcast chief executive Brian Roberts said on Tuesday, ending the joint venture between his company and GE that was first created two years ago. Comcast, the largest cable TV operator in the US, now acquires full control of the NBC broadcast empire, cable networks, filmed entertainment, theme parks, regional sports networks and certain digital media properties. The deal calls for $16.7 billion (12.42 billion Euros) for the NBCU brand assets and another $1.4 billion in NBC\\'s interest in the 30 Rockefeller Center office buildings in midtown New York City and CNBC\\'s headquarters in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey. Comcast bought a 51 percent stake in NBCUniversal in January 2011, leaving the remaining 49 percent to GE. Comcast had planned to take a larger stake in it over seven years, paying from operating cash, starting in 2014. The deal is seen as beneficial to both sides. GE will get cash for its stake earlier than expected and Comcast will benefit more from the rising price of the rights to sports and other TV programs. The deal \"allows us to significantly increase the cash we plan to return to shareholders in 2013, to approximately $18 billion, and to continue to invest in our industrial business,\" said GE chairman and CEO Jeff Immelt. \"For nearly 30 years, NBC - and later NBCUniversal - has been a great business for GE and our investors,\" Immelt added. \"We are proud of our stewardship of the business and our association with the NBCU brand.\" Comcast said it would finance the deal, which is expected to close by the end of March, with $11.4 billion of cash on hand, $4 billion in debt owed, $2 billion from its own credit lines and $725 million in preferred stock issued to GE. NBCUniversal is valued at around $34 billion, up from $30 billion when Comcast first acquired its 51 percent stake in the company two years ago. After the deal was announced, Comcast\\'s stock jumped 6.4 percent to $41.46 per share, while GE shares rose 3.6 percent to $23.39. dr/jr (AP, AFP, dpa)',\n",

       " {'story': 'Oscar Pistorius taken to hospital with chest pains, reports say Oscar Pistorius has been taken to hospital for overnight observation. The South African athlete, who is serving a six-year jail term for the murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, was reportedly suffering chest pains. Jailed Paralympic champion Oscar Pistorius was taken from Pretoria\\'s Atteridgeville prison to a medical facility for checks, a spokesman for the South African Department of Correctional Services said Thursday. \"This morning he went for a medical examination and he was scheduled to return back (to jail), but he will now be kept overnight for observation,\" the spokesman, Logan Maistry, said, without elaborating on Pistorius\\'s condition. Local media reported that the 30-year-old double-amputee was suffering from chest pains and was taken by ambulance to the emergency department at Kalafong Hospital. This is the second time Pistorius has left prison for medical treatment. Last August he was taken to hospital with wrist injuries, which prison authorities said he sustained after falling in his cell. Pistorius is one year into a six-year jail sentence for the 2013 shooting death of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp. The Paralympic athlete has always maintained that he mistook Steenkamp for an intruder when he fired multiple times at her through a locked toilet door at his Pretoria home. Sometimes dubbed the \"Blade Runner,\" Pistorius soared to international fame after becoming the first amputee to compete against able-bodied athletes in the 2012 Olympic Games. nm/kms (AP, AFP, dpa)',\n",

       " {'story': 'World Bank Spends Billions to Allay Food Crisis The World Bank on Thursday, May 29, launched a new $1.2 billion program to get emergency aid to countries suffering from global food shortages and surging prices. The new program will get at least $200 billion (128 billion euros) in grants to the poorest countries worst hit by the high cost of food, which the UN and World Bank have said is threatening to reverse nearly a decade of successes in reducing global poverty. Grants totalling $25 million were approved Thursday for Haiti, Djibouti and Liberia -- the first under the new facility. Haiti and others have suffered riots and even the dismissal of its government over food shortages. Another 10 countries have made requests for grants. The remaining $1 billion will be divided up through a mixture of grants and loans in a streamlined process that effectively bypasses the usual votes required by the bank\\'s board of member countries. Plans to step up food production World Bank President Robert Zoellick said developing nations -- especially in Africa -- are seeking immediate resources for projects that could drastically increase food production, such as buying seeds and fertilizers for the upcoming harvest season. \"These initiatives will help address the immediate danger of hunger and malnutrition for the two billion people struggling to survive in the face of rising food prices,\" Zoellick said in a statement. Total World Bank support for agricultural programs will increase to $6 billion in 2009 from $4 billion in 2008, the development bank said. Zoellick said he will push for a clear action plan at a UN meeting in Rome from June 3-5 to tackle the food crisis and provide poor countries with immediate support. \"We don\\'t need to reinvent the wheel. These leaders are asking for action now,\" he told reporters in a conference call from Japan.',\n",

       " {'story': 'Brazil Supreme Court seizes anti-Rousseff lawmaker\\'s alleged assets Brazil\\'s lower house speaker has denied allegations he received kickbacks in the Petrobras scandal. A court decision to seize his alleged assets comes after a report denying \"institutional corruption\" at the oil giant. The Brazil Supreme Court this week seized $2.45 million (2.22 million euros) from Swiss accounts allegedly belonging to Chamber of Deputies Speaker Eduardo Cunha, a self-proclaimed enemy of President Dilma Rousseff. According to Justice Teori Zavascki, who approved the request to seize the speaker\\'s funds, Swiss prosecutors provided documents to Brazilian federal prosecutors linking Cunha and his wife to the assets. However, the house speaker denied the allegations, saying he nor his wife own any bank accounts in Switzerland. Brazilian federal prosecutors say that Cunha is suspected in Brazil\\'s largest kickback scandal, comprising more than $2 billion in bribes paid to several executives and politicians. Cunha allegedly assisted companies in building winning contracts with state-run Brazilian Petroleum Corporation (Petrobras) in exchange for millions of dollars in bribes. If the funds are discovered to be linked to kickback schemes, they will returned to the Brazilian treasury, Judge Zavascki added. \\'Institutional corruption\\' non-existent? However, a Brazilian congressional panel on Friday published its final report on an investigation into corruption at Petrobras, concluding that suppliers and rogue employees were responsible for the graft, just shy of absolving politicians of complicity. Instead, the panel said that \"institutional corruption\" was non-existent at Petrobras, adding that police and prosecutors poorly handled Operation Car Wash, a probe into contract fixing, political kickbacks and bribery, with a focus on the oil giant. Rousseff, who served as chairwoman of Petrobras during much of the time the corruption took place, is facing calls from the opposition to resign or face impeachment over her possible involvement in the kickback scheme, though she has yet to be named by prosecutors. Opposition lawmakers allege that she also manipulated public accounts prior to her narrow reelection to boost government spending, a charge that could serve as grounds for impeachment. ls/bw (AP, Reuters, EFE)',\n",

       " {'story': 'Storms lash western France, southern England Bad weather overnight to Sunday left thousands of homes in the French region of Brittany without power. In the English Channel, a cargo ship and its crew were rescued after it hit a barge.  Strong winds that lashed France\\'s western and northwestern coast overnight to Sunday left nearly 70,000 homes without power, according to the national electricity grid Enedis. France\\'s national weather agency, Meteo France, said winds that reached up to 160 kilometers (100 miles) per hour battered the Breton peninsula and the Normandy coast, and that two other regions also remained under a storm alert. Power was off in the morning hours in 33,000 homes in Normandy, 18,700 in Brittany and 16,500 in the Loire-Atlantique region south of Brittany, according to Enedis. Local officials said a woman suffered serious injuries when she ran into a fallen tree in her car in Brittany\\'s Cote d\\'Armor department. Meteo France said the stormy conditions resulted from a rare combination of bad weather in the northeastern Atlantic and a strong airstream directed at northwestern France. The winds were expected to die down on Monday. Media reports said that many trees and roofs were torn down in the violent winds. Ship in distress On the other side of the English Channel, a storm affecting England\\'s south coast has brought a cargo ship into difficulty, British coast guards said on Sunday. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency said the 650-foot (200-meter) vessel, carrying 23 people, lost power near the southern port city of Dover, causing it to drift into a rock-laden barge. The agency said a tug was being sent to tow the leaking ship to safety, and that 11 crew members were evacuated by helicopter. Local media reported the name of the ship as the Saga Sky. The storm, called Angus, is the first big one of the autumn-winter season in Britain. Forecasters said the southern coast had been hit by 110 kph winds, with one offshore gust reaching 156 kph. The government issued at least 20 flood warnings. The port of Dover earlier said ferry movements had been temporarily suspended owing to \"very high winds.\" Weather warning in Germany The German Weather Service (DWD) issued a level 2 significant weather warning for the north and northwest of the country valid for Sunday evening and early Monday. DWD warned of squalls packing winds of between 85 and 110 kilometers per hour in parts of Lower Saxony and Schleswig Holstein, as well as the city states of Bremen and Hamburg. On the coastal islands and inlets of the Wadden Sea, the DWD issued a level 3 severe weather warning with wind gusts of up to 100 kilometers an hour. tj/jlw (AP, AFP, Reuters)',\n",

       " {'story': 'Fake medicines inundate EU market The EU\\'s outgoing industry commissioner warns that the bloc has been swamped by spurious pharmaceutical products. Guenter Verheugen is calling for steps that will criminalize offenses and protect potential victims. The Industry Commissioner said in an interview published in the German daily Die Welt on Monday that the trade in counterfeit medicines in the European Union had exceeded the body\\'s worst fears. Guenter Verheugen said the EU had seized fake tablets worth millions within a short period of time. \"In just two months, the EU seized 34 million fake tablets at customs points in all member countries. This exceeded our worst fears,\" he said. He told Die Welt that antibiotics, cancer treatments and Viagra were among the counterfeit medicines. Other fake drugs seized included anti-malaria medicines, analgesics and anti-cholesterol treatments. Verheugen is Germany\\'s commissioner to the European Union and will hold the portfolio until commissioner-designate Antonio Tajani of Italy is approved and takes office early next year. Verheugen said the European Commission, the bloc\\'s executive arm, was very concerned about the situation, adding that he expected the EU to take action to fight the menace of fake pharmaceutical products. \"The number of counterfeit medicines arriving in Europe ... is constantly growing. The European Commission is extremely worried,\" Die Welt quoted Verheugen as saying. An EU report in July said that many of the fake pharmaceuticals seized in 2008 came from India. Call to criminalize Verheugen said counterfeiting drugs should be treated as a serious crime and punished severely. \"Every faked drug is a potential massacre,” he said, adding: \"Even when a medicine only contains an ineffective substance, this can lead to people dying because they think they are fighting their illness with a real drug.\" The outgoing EU commissioner expressed optimism that there would be progress in tackling the problem of fake medicines in the coming year. \"I expect the EU will agree in 2010 that a drug\\'s journey from manufacture to sale should be scrutinized carefully. There will also be anti-counterfeit markings on packaging – in particular a barcode and seal, to show clearly if a package has been opened,\" he said. In June, EU health ministers gave a warm reception to a legal proposal aimed at stopping fake drugs entering the legal supply chain. The plan included stepped-up security measures on packaging, including barcodes, seals and holograms, as well as tighter controls on suppliers. Some analysts have welcomed the proposal, saying it could help to better regulate distributors. rb/AFP/AP/dpa Editor: Kyle James',\n",

       " {'story': 'Baltic Beach Battle The Baltic Sea stretching from eastern Germany to Poland used to be a Mecca for beach bums who prefer skin to skivvies, but is an onslaught of prudish Western visitors spoiling the tradition? Back in the days of Communism, as many as 90 percent of beach-goers along the East German-controlled stretch of the Baltic Sea preferred to bathe in their birthday suits, au natural. Fifteen years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, it\\'s a different story. Today, officials are buckling under pressure from tourists from western Germany who have demanded the nudists, known here as Free Body Culture (FKK), be pushed to the fringes of public beaches. According to a report by news agency Reuters, the tensions have pitted the nudes against the prudes. \"I grew up being naked at the beach and it\\'s the only way to spend the summer here,\" Susanne Koch, 31, told Reuters. \"Being nude on the beach feels completely normal.\" To cover or uncover? The dispute, unfortunately, has also tapped into divisions between the eastern Germans and their western German neighbors, who sometimes pejoratively refer to each other as \"Ossis\" and \"Wessis.\" \"Western tourists are ruining the atmosphere,\" Koch said. \"The tensions are unfortunate. They don\\'t know what they\\'re missing, It\\'s a shame westerners are so intolerant.\" But the resort town of Warnemünde, a coastal outpost near Rostock, is one of many in the area that reply heavily on tourism for its survival. Officials in the town have divided the beaches between \"textile\" areas and \"FKK\" sections. And there are even reported incidents of nudists taking one false step and winding up with a handful of sand in their faces. Keen to cash in on their higher spending power, tourism officials have sought to appease visitors from the west like Dirk Richter of the central western city of Hanover. \"I really don\\'t want to see naked bodies all around me,\" he said. \"It\\'s not for everyone and it\\'s often not a very attractive sight. It\\'s tough luck for the natives if that\\'s the way it used to be. Times change.\" But few believe the nudists will go without a fight -- including people like Maron Mock. \"It\\'s not fair,\" the 25-year-old primary school teacher said. \"We\\'re being pushed off our own beach into a crummy little zone on the edge. Being nude is not a crime!\"',\n",

       " {'story': 'German Left stalwart Gregor Gysi to run for Bundestag Gregor Gysi, a Left party veteran renowned for his rhetoric, says he\\'ll run again for parliament next year. He says Chancellor Merkel\\'s conservatives must be voted into opposition to make the right-wing AfD superfluous. Gysi, who stood down as the opposition Left\\'s parliamentary group leader last year after a 10-year tenure, said Thursday that his party must again strive for an alliance with the center-left Social Democrats (SPD) and the Greens. In an apparent bid to reassure the Left\\'s younger heads, Gysi said he was \"pulling on the same rope\" as co-leaders Katja Kipping and Bernd Riexinger and its leading Bundestag parliamentarians Sahra Wagenknecht and Dietmar Bartsch. \"Angela Merkel has undone solidarity in Europe like no other chancellor before,\" Gysi told the Berlin Kurier newspaper, adding that he would only stand as a direct candidate in his Berlin electorate of Treptow-Köpenick. \"The protest against Merkel must be channeled in the correct direction so that finally something can develop positively in this country,\" he said. Germany and Europe needed \"a different, a social, a peaceful and democratic political agenda,\" he said. That could only be achieved with a strong left, capable of relegating Merkel\\'s CDU/CSU conservatives into the opposition and thereby making superfluous the upstart Alternative for Germany (AfD), he asserted. Gysi said he reached his decision after \"careful consideration,\" prompted by \"requests and signals,\" particularly from within his own electorate. His announcement precedes Berlin city-state\\'s election due on Sunday. Gysi, who was a lawyer in former communist East Germany before being first elected to the Bundestag in 1990, had until Thursday stayed mute on whether he would run again. Two weeks ago, Gysi accused Merkel\\'s coalition government - comprising her conservatives and the center-left SPD under Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel - of distancing itself from the German federal parliament\\'s condemnation of Turkey\\'s World War One massacre of Armenians.

       " {'story': 'Poland swears in Komorowski as new president Bronislaw Komorowski has been sworn in for a five-year term as Poland\\'s president, promising greater inter-party cooperation and improved relations with the European Union, the United States and Russia. One month after winning a runoff snap election, liberal Civic Platform leader Bronislaw Komorowski took the oath of office for Poland\\'s presidency in a ceremony at parliament in Warsaw on Friday. In his inauguration speech, the 58-year-old said Poland needed more cooperation between the various branches of government as well as among political parties. \"Only we can determine if the inevitable disagreements dig valleys between us, or if we lead a democratic debate while upholding mutual respect and concern for priorities,\" he said. He promised to modernize Poland\\'s infrastructure and to improve ties with the United States, NATO, the European Union and EU hopefuls like Ukraine. Addressing Poland\\'s relationship with Russia, which has worsened since the signing of a missile defense shield deal between the United States and Poland, Komorowski said \"there will be no stable development of our region without working together with Russia. Rival a no-show Notably absent from the ceremony was Komorowski\\'s rival Jaroslaw Kaczynski, identical twin to late president Lech Kaczynski, whose death in a plane crash in April caused the snap election. Kaczynski\\'s absence drew criticism from several politicians, including former center-right prime minister and current European Parliament President Jerzy Buzek. \"There are certain events in a democratic state when all should be present, and when their absence is regarded as a deliberate protest,\" Buzek said. A spokesman for Kaczynski\\'s conservative Law and Justice party defended the party leader\\'s absence. \"Civic Platform politicians made brutal verbal attacks on President Lech Kaczynski when he was alive, and some continue to do so even after his death,\" Mariusz Blaszczak told AFP news agency. Komorowski is Poland\\'s fourth democratically-elected president since the fall of communism in 1989, an event which he worked toward as part of the pro-democracy Solidarity movement.

       " {'story': 'Polish Nobel Laureate Lech Walesa admits to \\'mistake\\' after spy accusations Former Polish President Lech Walesa has denied cooperating with Communist intelligence agencies during the Soviet era. He did, however, admit to making a \"mistake.\" In an entry on his blog on Friday, Lech Walesa denied all accusations of working with security agencies while Poland was a Soviet satellite state. \"I did not cooperate with the security agency. I did not take any money,\" Walesa wrote, adding that he had made a \"mistake.\" He added that he would not reveal details of the \"mistake.\" \"There is a person - a perpetrator, who is still alive who should reveal the truth and I\\'m counting on it. I had a soft heart,\" the Nobel Laureate said in his microblog. Walesa\\'s comments came a day after Lukasz Kaminski, director of Poland\\'s National Remembrance Institute (IPN), reported about a secret service document signed by Walesa. The IPN is responsible for prosecuting Communist-era crimes. The paper included a commitment to provide information from 1970-1976 and had been signed by Walesa under the codename \"Bolek.\" However, IPN\\'s Kaminski said on Thursday that every historical document had to be verified and an authentic intelligence agency document did not necessarily mean that its content was true. Walesa, currently on a trip to Venezuela, admitted he had signed a commitment to be an informant during the 1970s, but said he never acted on it. A special court cleared him of charges of collaboration 16 years ago. The 72-year-old leader is best known for launching the workers\\' party Solidarity in 1980, against the wishes of the Communist regime. He served as Poland\\'s first post-Communist president from 1990 to 1995. The leader is still politically active and launched a scathing attack against the government last year, calling for early elections. mg/sms (dpa, AP, AFP)',\n",

       " {'story': 'Terror attack arrests in Paris as US\\' Kerry visits France to pay respects US diplomat John Kerry meeting top officials in Paris says his country shares France’s pain over last week’s Islamist attacks. Kerry\\'s visit comes as French authorities arrest a dozen people in relation to the violence. US Secretary of State John Kerry met with top officials in Paris Friday to convey America\\'s solidarity with France after the deadly terrorist attacks last week. \"I know you know that we share the pain and the horror of everything that you went through,\" said Kerry as he met the president, referring to the September 11, 2001 attacks on the US. \"We share this pain and that is also the sense of our meeting today, as well as the friendship it displays…We must work together to find the necessary response,\" he added. Kerry met earlier on Friday with French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius at the French foreign ministry, explaining he could not have attended last Sunday\\'s unity marches in Paris as he was on a scheduled trip to India. \"It\\'s good to be with you,\" Kerry said on his arrival. \"We have a lot to talk about.\" The Obama administration came under fire for failing to send a cabinet-level official to the French capital for the rally. More than 40 world leaders, including Germany\\'s Chancellor Angela Merkel, and a million demonstrators gathered in solidarity for the march on Sunday night. Kerry met with Fabius and Hollande before laying wreaths at the offices of French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo and a kosher supermarket. Kerry, who announced he was in France \"to share a big hug with Paris,\" will meet the capital\\'s mayor later in the day to express his sympathy. Meanwhile, a dozen people were arrested Friday morning in connection with last week\\'s terror attacks in Paris that left 17 people dead. Nine men, and three women were arrested, French daily Le Monde reported Friday, citing an unnamed judicial source.

Merkel said that despite differences the two neighbors\\' policies align. Merkel said in her weekly podcast that the French invitation to attend the ceremonies honoring the dead from Battle of Verdun highlighted the degree of trust and cooperation between two neighbors that fought two bloody wars in the 20th century. \"To be invited to these commemorations shows the extent to which relations between France and Germany are good today,\" said Merkel, who will join French President Francois Hollande on Sunday at Verdun to remember the 350,000 killed in senseless fighting during one of the bloodiest battles of WWI. The German Chancellor said the Franco-German experience of working to build a united Europe showed that despite occasional differences of opinion compromises can be forged. She cited cooperation during the euro-crisis as an example. \"Again and again Germany and France have a common position,\" Merkel said. The comments come as France and Germany seek to tackle persistent economic woes, the bloc\\'s border security, counter terrorism, and prevent a British exit from the EU, among other issues. \"Europe faces difficult tasks, there is no doubt about that,\" the German leader said. \"Europe has problems, but Europe has also done and achieved many things.\" cw/jm (AFP, dpa)',\n",

       " {'story': 'Afghan unity government in jeopardy as presidential candidate rejects vote audit Afghan candidate, Abdullah Abdullah, says he will not accept the \"fraudulent\" results of the presidential run-off. His announcement dashed hopes for a national unity government with his opponent, Ashraf Ghani. The Afghan election commission is expected to announce the results of the second round of the presidential elections later this week following a vote audit monitored by the United Nations. The stalemate over alleged fraud in the June 14 vote has raised fears of renewed violence in the South Asian country. Abdullah said on Monday he believed he won both rounds of the polls. \"We were the winners of the election,\" Abdullah told his supporters. \"We do not accept fraudulent election results, and we will not accept a fraudulent government for one day,\" he added. While he acknowledged the \"necessity\" of a unity government, Abdullah said \"the political process had been deadlocked\" due to differences over government posts and the division of powers. Officials from both camps say there are two key impediments to forming a unity government: \"The role and power of the proposed chief executive position and the manner in which the audit results are announced, these are the two issues,\" said Mujib Rahimi, an advisor to Abdullah. Abdullah - who won the first round of the elections but failed to win a clear majority - had rejected the initial results of the second round won by his rival Ghani. The feuding candidates agreed to form a national unity government after US Secretary of State John Kerry held separate talks with them. Kerry also brokered an agreement for a UN-supervised audit of the 8.1 million votes cast in the runoff. Ghani\\'s camp made no immediate response to Abdullah\\'s speech. Obama\\'s phone call The US wants an immediate end to the Afghan political impasse. Washington hopes that the new president would sign the pending Bilateral Security Agreement (BSA), which allows the US to keep some of its troops in the country after the scheduled withdrawal of NATO forces by the end of this year. US President Barack Obama telephoned the two candidates over the weekend and urged them to finalize the deal. \"The president emphasized the importance of concluding a deal on the national unity government as soon as possible in the interest of shoring up international support for Afghanistan and preserving Afghan stability,\" the White House press office said in a statement on Saturday. shs/ksb (AP, dpa, AFP)',\n",

       " {'story': 'Dutch Government Collapse Brings EU Enlargement Jitters With the clock ticking for the European Union’s expansion in 2004, the crisis in The Hague could derail the whole process. EU leaders, however, are putting on a brave face. Brussels is trying to reassure the 10 countries waiting to join the European Union that the collapse of the Dutch government barely a week before a key EU summit will not upset the bloc\\'s plans for eastern enlargement. The Prime Minister Jan-Peter Balkenende\\'s center-right coalition resigned on Wednesday over a feud within one of the three member parties. The government had been in office for less than 100 days. The issue of EU enlargement was a key factor in the break-up. In a cabinet row last Friday, Balkenende’s two junior coalition partners, the liberal VVD party and the anti-immigration List Pim Fortuyn (LPF), both opposed the admission of Poland, Slovakia and Cyprus to the EU in 2004. Caretaker government has authority to vote A caretaker government will run the country for the time being. Constitutional experts in the Netherlands insist it will have the legal authority to participate fully in next week\\'s Brussels summit, which is due to approve the new members’ accession and agree on the terms for financing enlargement. Caretaker cabinets are expected to refrain from decisions on \"controversial\" subjects but can interpret this flexibly and have done so in the past. With Ireland due to hold a referendum on enlargement on Saturday, the political crisis in The Hague has added to diplomatic tensions within the EU. But Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen, who currently holds the EU’s rotating presidency, said he did not believe it would prove an obstacle. The EU hopes to close accession talks with the 10 candidate states at a summit in Copenhagen in December. European Commission statement points to concern EU Enlargement Commissioner Guenter Verheugen also put on a brave face, saying he thought it unlikely the Dutch would overturn decisions which had already been taken. However, the Commission has taken the unusual step of issuing a statement commenting on the political situation in a member state. \"Obviously it is up to the Netherlands to decide, in the current situation, whether or not they can take a position on the next steps of the enlargement process and if so, which position,\" it said. Some Dutch politicians, including members of the outgoing government, have criticized the scale and estimated cost of enlargement, but EU diplomats said they were confident a broad majority in the Dutch parliament backed it.',\n",

       " {'story': 'HSBC roars back from costly write-downs London-based banking giant HSBC has said its huge restructuring drive is finally bearing fruit. The behemoth has seen its profit rise in recent months thanks first and foremost to its brisk Asia business. Pre-tax profits at HSBC leapt fivefold in the third quarter, the company reported Monday. The massive jump came weeks after a new chief executive was unveiled as part of a management overhaul that has seen the banking behemoth deal with costly write-downs. John Flint, head of retail banking and wealth management, will take up his position in February next year when current CEO Stuart Gulliver steps down in a bid to \"accelerate the pace of change.\" The Asia-focused lender has been on a recovery drive to streamline its business and slash costs since 2015 when it set out a plan to axe 50,000 jobs and exit non-core markets as it also navigated a series of damaging probes. Among other things, HSBC was fined by US prosecutors for failing to enforce anti-money laundering rules, exposing it to exploitation by drug cartels and terrorist organizations. Uncertainties remain \"HSBC has had to spend a lot of money to hire more lawyers to help it fix legal problems and enhance its compliance department,\" said Kingston Securities Executive Director Dickie Wong, adding that it may still feel the effects of legal challenges and expenses. But given the lender\\'s third-quarter performance, Wong insisted HSBC was \"one of the best international banking stocks at this moment.\" Q3 net earnings also rose to $2.96 billion (2.55 billion euros), up from a loss of $617 million in the same quarter a year earlier. \"Our pivot to Asia is driving higher returns and lending growth, particularly in Hong Kong,\" CEO Stuart Gulliver said in a statement Monday. hg/jd (AFP, Reuters, dpa)',\n",

       " {'story': 'Swiss politician threatens to expose German officials over tax-dodging A Swiss parliamentarian said he would aim to expose German public figures over alleged tax manipulations, if Berlin goes ahead with plans to buy stolen data on tax-evaders with Swiss bank accounts. Alfred Heer of the right-wing Swiss People\\'s Party (SVP) told the German daily Bild on Saturday that he and his party would aim to have the law changed so that names can be published. According to the Heer, financial sources in the Alpine republic have evidence that politicians and judges from Germany keep accounts in Switzerland and Liechtenstein for the purposes of evading tax. \"If Germany buys stolen bank data, we will work for a change in the law so that the complete Swiss accounts of German people holding public office have to be disclosed,\" he said. Heer is head of the right-wing SVP in the canton of Zurich and president of the Switzerland\\'s taxpayers\\' federation. Thousands of names Switzerland is concerned about Germany\\'s intent to buy a stolen disc containing names of 1,500 people with Swiss accounts who may have evaded German taxation. German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said at the beginning of February that Germany was prepared to pay 2.5 million euros ($3.5 million) for the disc. The German state of Baden-Wuerttemberg has been offered a second disc containing 2,000 names, which according to German daily newspaper Frankfurter Rundschau includes information from bank groups UBS and Credit Suisse. Rising tension The tax data affair has soured relations between Germany and its Alpine neighbor, which sees the purchasing of the disc as another attack on its cherished banking secrecy. \"Here we have a new form of bank robbery,\" Swiss lawmaker Pirmin Bischof told Germany\\'s Deutschlandfunk radio earlier this month. \"Before, you had to go to the bank and get hold of the money with a weapon. Today you can do it electronically by stealing data.\" But Schaeuble has said that the government would be legally justified in buying the stolen data. Chancellor Angela Merkel is also in favor of acquiring the CD. \"In principle, the decision was made two years ago,\" Schaeuble told the Augsburger Allgemeine newspaper, referring to a similar case in 2007, when the government handed over as much as five million euros for stolen tax data from Liechtenstein. rc/AFP/Reuters/dpa/AP Editor:Toma Tasovac',\n",

Berlin, Duesseldorf, Hamburg and Hanover are all in the running to host the 2011 Eurovision Song Contest. The four cities submitted their bids to the German broadcaster Norddeutscher Rundfunk (NDR) on Friday, August 20. Now it\\'s up to NDR and fellow public broadcaster ARD, in collaboration with the European Broadcasting Union, to decide which city should have the honor of hosting the popular European music competition. Germany won the chance to stage the event after 19-year-old Lena Meyer-Landrut from Hanover won the international competition in Oslo in May this year with her song \"Satellite.\" Lena is planning to sing for her country again at next year\\'s contest. New format for the contest The Eurovision Song Contest now takes place over three evenings of fast-paced and flashy entertainment. Smaller countries have to compete in two semi-finals, broadcast in the week running up to the grand final. \"The proposals we\\'ve received are very detailed and impressive,\" said Thomas Schreiber, entertainment coordinator for German public television. \"We\\'re going to go through the documents carefully, to work out which place has the best facilities to produce three TV shows, which venue has the most convincing infrastructure and the best economic conditions,\" Schreiber said. \"The cities which have applied are highly motivated,\" he added. The decision is expected to be announced in the coming weeks. The final of the Eurovision Song Contest 2011 will take place on Saturday, May 14.

       " {'story': 'Twitter\\'s rainbow reaction to marriage equality vote in Germany Germany\\'s historic same-sex marriage vote saw an outpouring of jubilation on social media. Hashtags like #MarriageEquality and #LoveWins were used to broadcast the news. \"Such a beautiful morning for Europe and the world,\" tweeted Dustin Lance Black, the American screenwriter and LGBTQ rights activist who won an Oscar for \"Milk\" (2008), the film tracing the life of the gay rights icon Harvey Milk. In the US, media outlets quickly took to Twitter to spread the news. Slate Magazine retweeted a picture of the German Green Party celebrating the yes vote by cutting a rainbow marriage cake crowned by two women. Meanwhile, the Stop Homophobia advocacy group urged its followers in Germany to \"Now go and get married!\" German author and journalist Carolin Emcke, winner of the Peace Prize of the German Book Trade in 2016, said that the \"feeling of happiness on this day cannot be damaged by all the slurs,\" referring to conservative politicians\\' statements against the vote. Feminist editor and author Teresa Bücker, also from Germany, was brought to tears. \"Cry and I cry with you. Thanks to all who have fought so long for this day!\" she tweeted. Some were disappointed that Angela Merkel voted against the bill. Berlin-based gay travel writer, Adam Groffman, set off a flurry of debate when he pointed out Merkel\\'s no vote. With the vote on same-sex marriage happening early morning Berlin-time, Australians were among the first to receive the news (Australia is eight hours ahead) and quickly took to social media to register their rainbow-colored support. They included the Australian Sex Party, which has been contesting elections since 2009. Popular singer and TV host David Campbell quickly noted that Australia, which has still to legalize same-sex marriage, has fallen behind Germany. Advocacy group Australian Marriage Equality was quick to note that Germany was the 23rd country to sanction same-sex marriage. Finally, Conchita Wurst, Austrian winner of Eurovision in 2015, sent out a live congratulations on Twitter, calling it a \"wonderful day\" for the LGBTQ community in Germany.',\n",

       " {'story': 'Lukashenko protesters return to Belarusian streets Over 2,000 people staged a protest in the Belarusian capital, Minsk, on Sunday, in the first opposition demonstration since Alexander Lukashenko banned such gatherings following his disputed election win in 2010. Participants waving the red-and-white flags of the historical republic as well as flags of the European Union gathered under the watchful eyes of a large contingent of riot police, singing songs and holding up signs with names of opposition figures who have been imprisoned. No arrests were reported in the protest that was unexpectedly allowed to take place by authorities. The march took place on Belarus\\'s \\'Day of Freedom,\\' an unofficial holiday that marks the day an independent state of Belarus was created in 1918. A number of prominent leaders from the opposition were on hand for the demonstration, including Vital Rymasheuski, who ran in the 2010 presidential election. \"The Lukaschenko regime has only one weapon: fear,\" he said at the rally, adding a call to boycott the next election. Relations between the EU and Belarus have reached a new low point because of continuing repression in the country, and the EU has been trying for years to step up pressure on the regime in Minsk through sanctions. On Friday, the EU agreed to expand these sanctions by freezing the assets of more companies and expanding a list of officials who are banned from entering the EU. Lukashenko has led the country since 1994, and has retained Soviet-style control, cracking down on opposition politicians and independent media. mz/tj (AFP, dpa)',\n",

       " {'story': '\\'Islamist\\' shot dead in Berlin after knife attack on policewoman A 41-year-old man of Iraqi origin has been shot dead in Berlin after he stabbed a policewoman. State prosecutors say the man was an \"Islamist.\" The attacker died in a police operation on Thursday, shortly after he stabbed a policewoman with a knife. Police said the man lived in Berlin and had been sentenced to prison by the regional court in Stuttgart in 2008. He was subsequently released on parole and also wore an electronic tag, which he removed on Thursday morning before the attack. Investigators first learned of the incident via a phone call from a passer-by on Heerstrasse in western Berlin\\'s Spandau area, according to local public broadcaster RBB. The caller said a man with a knife was threatening people. Four police cars reached the area, a police spokesman told reporters. The man attacked one of the officers, who stepped out of her car. Several shots were fired after that, although it is not known how many police officers shot at the attacker. The man died of his wounds despite repeated attempts to resuscitate him, police said. The policewoman, who was brutally injured in the knife attack, was flown to a hospital in a rescue helicopter. Berlin\\'s homicide squad is currently investigating the case. mg/msh (dpa)',\n",

       " {'story': 'Nearly 60 hurt in New York City ferry accident Nearly 60 people have been injured in a New York City commuter ferry accident. The boat crashed into a pier during rush hour, leaving two people in critical condition. The Seastreak catamaran ferry, en route from New Jersey on the East River, hit Pier 11 in lower Manhattan Wednesday morning. \"The latest report we have is that 58 people were injured. Two of those were critical,\" coast guard spokesman Charles Rowe said, adding that an investigation would be launched. Both of the passengers in critical condition suffered head injuries, authorities said. Witnesses said the ferry was moving too quickly as it approached the pier, but Rowe said the cause of the accident was not yet known. Weather conditions were good at the time of the incident, with little wind and good visibility. \"Basically, it was a hard landing,\" city transportation comissioner Janette Sadik-Khan said at a news conference, adding that the ferry was traveling at a speed of 10-12 knots when it missed its docking target. Most of the injured were standing near the bow of the ship waiting to disembark and were thrown back into the ferry or below deck. Nobody fell into the water. There were 326 passengers and five crew on board the vessel at the time of the accident, said Rowe. Television images showed police and firefighters evacuating the injured on stretchers, and a large gash was visible on the ferry\\'s hull. Dozens of ferries shuttle thousands of commuters from Brooklyn and New Jersey into Manhattan every day, but accidents are rare. In October 2003, 11 people were killed and 70 others injured when a Staten Island ferry hit a pier at full speed. dr/ipj (AFP, dpa, AP)',\n",

       " {'story': 'Man found guilty of abusing Russian-German teenager who fabricated rape story A man found guilty of abusing a minor has been handed a 21-month suspended sentence. The case involved the same teenager caught up in last year\\'s \"Lisa case,\" which caused a diplomatic row between Germany and Russia. Ismet S., aged 24, was found guilty of child abuse and producing child pornography after he admitted before a Berlin court to having consensual sex with a minor and filming it. The case garnered widespread attention as the minor in question was the same girl implicated in last year\\'s \"Lisa case.\" That case, which received global media attention, involved a 13-year-old German girl of Russian origin saying that she had been kidnapped and raped, implying people of Middle Eastern origin were to blame. The girl, identified only as Lisa, told her parents that she was kidnapped on January 11 by three men, who looked \"southern\" and spoke broken German. Her lawyer then said that was taken to an apartment, where she was abused and raped. However, police said they had not found evidence to support the rape claim. Nevertheless, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov accused Berlin authorities of trying to cover up the case, which in turn caused outrage in the Russian media The case strained diplomatic ties between Germany and Russia before \"Lisa\" admitted that she had lied. She had in fact run away from home and was staying with a 19-year-old male friend. As part of the investigation into the alleged rape, authorities also came across another older man Ismet S., who had had sex with Lisa a few months earlier, knowing that she was underage. Despite qualifying as abuse, consent proves crucial the ruling The court recognized that the defendant had cooperated during police questioning and hearing, sparing Lisa from going before the court. Nevertheless, she was present in the Tiergarten court when the judgment was read out. A speaker for the court also said they had taken into account that Ismet S. and Lisa had In Germany, the age of consent is 14. While non-consensual sex with a minor is considered statutory rape under German law, in cases where the act is considered consensual the crime is treated as child abuse. That worked in Ismet S\\'s favor as he received 21-month suspended sentence. Any sentence longer than two years cannot be suspended and he would have faced prison. He was also ordered to pay a fine of 3,000 euros, which will go towards a victim compensation fund. dm/msh (AFP)',\n",

Japan aims to beat deflation by printing money. Japan's Nikkei stock market index surged more than 2 percent on Monday and the yen weakened further in Asian foreign exchange markets following tacit support from after the Group of Twenty (G20) nations for Tokyo's monetary policy at their weekend meeting. In a statement Sunday, the G20, which includes the world's top industrialized nations and emerging economies, pledged to refrain from competitive currency devaluation and said they wouldn't use exchange rates for gaining a competitive advantage. The G20 decided not to single out Japan for criticism although Japan's national currency has fallen 17 percent against the US dollar and 25 percent against the euro, leading to accusations that Tokyo had manipulated the yen to gain a trade advantage. Japan's newly-elected Prime Minister Shinzo Abe reiterated Monday that his policy was aimed at beating years of deflation, and not at manipulating foreign exchange markets. However, Abe also warned the country's central bank, the Bank of Japan (BoJ), that he would press for a revision of Japan's central bank law if the BoJ failed to commit to the aim of aggressive monetary easing to foster growth. Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa, who disagreed with Abe on this policy, is to resign from his post next month, several weeks ahead of the end of his term in office. uhe/kms (AFP, Reuters, dpa)\",\n",

       " {'story': 'Earthquake Rocks Indonesia A strong undersea earthquake of a magnitude of 6.7, at a depth of 45 kilometres, has rocked the eastern province of Maluku, scaring the residents. An initial tsunami warning was later lifted. Sulawesi Island in the east is being swamped by torrential rain and floods, with at least 60 dead so far. Tens of thousands of people have lost their homes in the central and southern parts of Sulawesi province, where many villages have been completely damaged. The authorities have deployed helicopters loaded with food and drinking water and have sent health teams with medicine to the affected areas, but they said continuous rain and floods had hindered their access. Aswi Nugroho from the Indonesian Red Cross said that:\"most of the relief agencies had been finding it difficult to transport deliveries because of blocked roads and bridges.\" Buried alive According to local officials, at least 40 people are believed to be buried alive in the central part of the province but the bad weather is hobbling efforts to rescue them. The situation is equally bad in the north-eastern part of the province, where days of heavy downpour have caused floods up to three metres high, submerging hundreds of homes and leaving thousands of people stranded. Deadly landslides occur frequently in Indonesia, where millions of people live in mountainous regions and near fertile flood plains close to rivers. Experts, however, blame illegal logging and deforestation for making the soil loose and causing landslides. Precaution measures \"How can we prepare ourselves for such a disaster?\" is the question on Aswi Nugroho\\'s lips. \"How can we prepare ourselves so that the impact of such disasters is reduced?\" For many, the answer lies clearly in fighting global warming and climate change, which are held responsible for the changing weather conditions. Peter Rees, the Red Cross\\' Head of Disaster Response, told an Australian radio station, the number of natural disasters in the world has tripled in recent years as a result. No increase in geo-physical disasters \"Between 2004 and 2006, there was an increase of catastrophe cases from 278 to 481, including 137 floods. And this year there have already been 75 flood catastrophes. And it\\'s clearly linked to the weather,\" said Rees. He explained that there had been no increase in geo-physical disasters such as earthquakes or volcano eruptions but a clear increase in weather-related catastrophes. Farmers in Central Sulawesi, which is one of Indonesia\\'s key cocoa growing areas, are worried about their crop.

       " {'story': \"Amazon close to launching new streaming service Amazon is reportedly a month away from launching a new subscription-based music streaming service. Once licensing agreements are signed, Amazon will enter a crowded market dominated by Spotify and Apple Music. The online retail giant Amazon is close to signing licensing deals with some of the world's preeminent record labels, a final step in its bid to claim a chunk of the digital music market, according to a report in the Financial Times. The newspaper cited two people familiar with the matter, who said Amazon could launch its streaming service as soon as September, though the company has yet to officially confirm a launch date. Another player looking to enter the music streaming fray was Pandora, until now a provider of internet radio. That company was similarly close to inking agreements with the holders of music rights and could introduce its service by the end of the year, Financial Times noted. A subscription to both companies' new streaming platforms would cost $9.99 a month, according to the Financial Times. Other industry players, including Spotify, Apple, SoundCloud, Deezer, Tidal and Google Play, all offer similar services for that price. According to the report, Amazon would pay the same level of royalty fees as Apple, which pays a bit more than Spotify. Spotify, which counts more monthly subscribers than any other music streaming service, diverts about 70 percent of its revenue to copyright owners. cjc/uhe (Financial Times, dpa)\",\n",

       " {'story': 'South Sudan expels UN aid coordinator The United Nations has announced the expulsion of one of its deputies from South Sudan. Authorities have offered no official explanation, but the UN has pointed to the aid coordinator\\'s critique of the government. The South Sudanese government has decided to expel Toby Lanzer, the outspoken deputy chief of the United Nations mission to the country, UN officials said Monday. The announcement came after Lanzer was refused entry into South Sudan as he tried to return to wrap up official business ahead of the end of his assignment there later this month. Authorities in Juba have not offered an official explanation for the decision, but the UN has suggested that it stems from Lanzer\\'s critique of the government and the rebels over the recent increase in sectarian fighting. \"Mr. Lanzer has been instrumental in addressing the increasing humanitarian needs of conflict-affected communities in the country and ensuring that life-saving humanitarian assistance reaches the most vulnerable,\" said a UN statement. UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon called on Juba to immediately rectify the situation by allowing Lanzer to finish his work in the country before he is replaced by Eugene Owusu of Ghana at the end of the month. Humanitarian crisis rapidly escalating In May, Lanzer released a statement noting his dismay after fighting in the Unity and Upper Nile states forced 100,000 people to flee their homes in the course of a single week. Following the advance of the South Sudanese army on the rebel-held town of Leer, Lanzer argued that the military operations had \"devastated countless lives\" after witnesses told him tales of rape and civilian murders. On social media last week, Lanzer tweeted: \"4.6 million people in South Sudan will be severely, yes severely, food insecure by July. That is 800,000 more than in July of last year.\" Lanzer is due to take up his new post as UN regional humanitarian coordinator for the Sahel in a matter of weeks. es/cmk (AFP, dpa)',\n",

       " {'story': 'German football president Niersbach wants FIFA spot Germany\\'s most powerful football chief wants to become a key decision-maker at FIFA. The world\\'s governing body continues to go under serious scrutiny around ongoing corruption allegations. It\\'s official: Wolfgang Niersbach, the president of the German Football Association (DFB), wants to be Europe\\'s next representative on FIFA\\'s executive committee when current board member Theo Zwanziger steps down next year. Zwanziger, Niersbach\\'s predecessor at the DFB, will step down on May 24, 2015 at the FIFA Congress in Zurich. Niersbach will need to gain the support of UEFA\\'s member countries in March to be then put forward as Europe\\'s voice on the Executive Committee. \"I\\'m standing for this election because I want to defend the European position (in FIFA) and I\\'m convinced that German football should not lose its voice on the most important decisions,\" the 63-year-old said in a statement on Friday. Niersbach, though, will not challenge Sepp Blatter for the main post at FIFA and Michel Platini, the president of Europe\\'s governing association UEFA, has declined to stand against Blatter too. Loud German voice Several German football officials have been criticial of the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cup, which has come under scrutiny over allegations of potential corruption and the handling of Michael Garcia\\'s report. Niersbach has previously spoken in favor of a public release of the report, while Reinhard Rauball, president of the organization responsible for running Germany\\'s top two divisions, the DFL, has suggested World Cup boycotts and even a potential split between UEFA and FIFA. \"He (Niersbach) can be the one to fight here for transparency and clearing everything up,\" Rauball said. \"He has outstanding international contacts and enjoys the full backing of German football.\" Delay the maiden Arab Cup On Friday, Zwanziger told German newspaper \"Rheinische Post\" that the 2022 tournament should be cancelled and spread around various Arab nations four years later in the winter. \"The United Arab Emirates, Oman and Qatar: it\\'s a larger area and it could be held in winter from the start,\" he told the paper. \"That is what I would consider to be an acceptable solution, as it allows for society in the Gulf region to undergo a change.\" Zwanziger believes \"world football will not come to peace\" unless the small, oil-rich country Qatar is stripped of its right to host the tournament in 2022. rd/al (AP, dpa, Reuters)',\n",

       " {'story': 'Report: Exercises for military deployment in Germany expected to start soon Exercises for an internal German military deployment could start as soon as November, a state interior minister has told media. The anti-terror drills involving Bundeswehr and police would be the first of their kind. Klaus Bouillon, the head of Germany\\'s interior ministers\\' conference, said Bundeswehr anti-terror exercises could be approved by the end of the month, in an interview with the \"Rheinische Post\" on Saturday. \"I expect that Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen and Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere will greenlight the exercises on August 31,\" Bouillon, who is also the state of Saarland\\'s interior minister, told the newspaper. \"Exercises could begin already in November for an internal Bundeswehr deployment,\" added the minister. So far, military and police exercises are planned in the German states of Saarland, Baden-Württemberg and Saxony-Anhalt, the journalists\\' consortium \"Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland\" reported on Saturday. SPD shift on deployment Bouillon, who is a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel\\'s center-right Christian Democrats (CDU) party, said that he believed the exercises would take place \"in the majority of states.\" Even states led by the Social Democrat party (SPD), which have opposed constitutional changes on the internal deployment of German armed forces in the past, are starting to shift, the interior ministers\\' conference chief said. \"I also see a movement in SPD-led states for cooperation between police and the Bundeswehr in case of terror and catastrophes,\" Bouillon said. Lower Saxony\\'s SPD interior minister, Boris Pistorius, reportedly suggested in a letter to Bouillon that all of Germany\\'s 16 states should conduct the police and military exercises together. Pistorius suggested that the exercises take place nationwide according to the law and under police command, \"Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland\" reported, quoting the letter. New military strategy Germany\\'s constitution, in reaction to the misuse of the military for state-sponsored terror during the Nazi era, allows for domestic military deployments only under special circumstances, including natural disasters and imminent external threats. A 2012 Constitutional Court decision found that the Bundeswehr could also be deployed in the event of terrorist attacks. In July, the Defense Ministry confirmed the legal situation in its \"White Paper\" mapping out Germany\\'s military strategy. The exercises would be the first cooperation between police and armed forces to prepare for terror attacks. Following a spate of violent attacks in Germany, some of which were claimed by the militant \"Islamic State\" group, Chancellor Merkel called for the internal deployment of the military if a major act of terrorism took place. rs/tj (AFP, dpa)',\n",

       " {'story': 'Eurozone wants tough mechanism to defend stability of the euro European Union leaders are working around the clock to create a new measure to defend the euro before financial markets reopen on Monday. EU finance ministers will meet on Sunday to discuss the plan. European Union leaders are working overtime to construct new crisis defense mechanisms to safeguard the euro currency and crack down on market speculation before the Asian financial markets reopen on Monday. On Sunday, European Union finance ministers debated proposals to set up a 600 billion euro ($765 billion) rescue fund for member countries states that fall into financial trouble, said diplomats in Brussels. The package would consist funds raised by the EU\\'s executive, the European Commission, loans from eurozone states; and money from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), diplomats said. German Chancellor Angela Merkel was holding a crisis cabinet meeting in Berlin late Sunday, to deal with the consequences of a prospective rescue system being negotiated in Brussels,officials said. A clear signal \"Taking into account the exceptional circumstances, the European Commission will propose a European stabilization mechanism to preserve financial stability in Europe,\" Herman Van Rompuy , the president of the EU, said in a statement released in the early hours of Saturday morning. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the move will send \"a very clear signal\" to market speculators by creating a common fund to support economies in difficulty. The European portion of the bailout will amount to some 80 billion euros ($102 billion) over three years, with Germany set to provide the lion\\'s share.The IMF has approved 30 billion Euro loan for Greece. Despite the 110 billion euro bailout, financial markets reacted negatively to the continued uncertainty, prompting EU leaders to consider new steps to prevent similar financial chaos from spreading to other member states. The unprecedented Greek bailout is due to be transferred to Athens within days. Greeks oppose cuts The emergency summit in Brussels coincided with ceremonies to commemorate the end of World War II in Europe, forcing some European leaders to cancel their plans to attend the events. French President Nicolas Sarkozy and Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi have both pulled out of Sunday\\'s war commemorations in Russia to deal with the financial crisis, but German Chancellor Angela Merkel has arrived in Moscow and will attend the ceremonies. Investors are keeping a close watch on Greek opposition to Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou\\'s austerity plans, concerned that prolonged protests could weaken his resolve to push through the cuts passed by the Greek parliament on Thursday. On Saturday, opinion polls showed a majority of Greeks support further protests against the austerity measures. smh/AFP/AP/dpa Editor: Rick Demarest',\n",

       " {'story': 'China trade figures uninspiring Chinese trading activities have taken a beating in recent weeks, official figures have shown. Both sales abroad and imports logged a hefty drop, leaving economists wondering about the nation\\'s growth prospects. China\\'s exports contracted by a staggering 15 percent in March year-on-year, the General Administration of Customs reported Monday. The tumble in shipments abroad marked the sharpest monthly dip since the global financial crisis. It came against the backdrop of a 12-percent rise in exports penciled in by economists. Analysts said the decline was heightening worries about how a rising yuan had hurt demand for Chinese goods and services abroad. Worrying signals Providing a sign that domestic demand was also tepid in the Asian nation, imports into the world\\'s second-largest economy shrunk by 12.7 percent in March year-on-year, the customs agency announced, the biggest slump since May 2009. \"[The figures] lead to warning flags both on global demand and China\\'s competitiveness,\" RBS economist Louis Kuijs told Reuters. The government in Beijing wants to protect jobs, knowing that higher unemployment could fuel social unrest, but anemic growth in the trade sector could hurt the labor market. So far, though, the jobs market appears to be holding up well despite signs that economic growth is steadily grinding to its lowest in a quarter of a century, nearing the 7-percent mark. hg/jil (AFP, dpa)',\n",

       " {'story': \"Bundesliga: Mario Gomez at the double as Stuttgart go seven unbeaten A return to the international fold was celebrated in style as Stuttgart grabbed another three points on the road. The win lifts them to eighth in the table and an outside shot at European qualification. Freiburg 1-2 Stuttgart, Schwarzwald-Stadion (Petersen 53' — Gomez 4', 75') Never mind a return to the national squad, on this evidence, Gomez will have given Germany coach Jogi Löw plenty to chew as he considers his starting XI to face Spain next Friday night. The veteran striker staked his claim with a brace that gave Stuttgart a sixth win in their last seven league games, lifting the club into European contention. It also showed why he remains one of the best around when it comes to giving himself that crucial yard of space in the penalty area. His first goal arrived in only the fourth minute of a boisterous encounter, which often lacked quality but rarely lacked passion. Gomez drifted into space to meet Dennis Aogo's inswinging freekick to give the visitors a flying start. He should have doubled his side's lead in the 13th minute. A poorly placed Robin Koch backpass sent the 32-year old clean through, but he failed to make decent contact. It looked as if he might live to regret it, too, after another experienced German striker leveled the contest with a moment of brilliance. Nils Petersen has genuine cause to feel aggrieved at not being called-up for Germany's pre-World Cup friendlies. He is, after all, the highest scoring German in the Bundesliga this season, and his goal here was disptached with sublime efficiency. After racing onto Nicolas Höfler's through-ball, the Freiburg captain took a touch away from a chasing defender and lifted the ball deftly over the oustretched fingertips of Ron-Robert Zieler. It was his 13th league goal of the campaign. But it was Gomez, and Stuttgart, who would have the last laugh. When Andreas Beck's searching cross in the 75th minute found the former Bayern man, the outcome was inevitable. His initial header was straight at Alexander Schwolow, but ricocheted straight back to him for the simplest of winners. Stuttgart find themselves just three points off Europa League qualification, with seven games still to play. An already dramatic battle for European places just found a new contender.\",\n",

       " {'story': 'US executes man despite disability claim A man has been executed in the US after a final appeal by his lawyers who said he was intellectually disabled was turned down. Warren Hill was killed by lethal injection in the southeastern state of Georgia. The 54-year-old murderer was initially sentenced to life imprisonment for killing his 18-year-old girlfriend in 1986, whom he shot 11 times. While serving that sentence, however, Hill beat fellow inmate Joseph Handspike to death using a nail-studded board. In 1991, Hill was convicted of Handspike\\'s murder and sentenced to death. His execution was delayed three times between July 2012 and July 2013 following various challenges. In their final appeal, Hill\\'s lawyers argued that his execution was prohibited by the Constitution because he was intellectually disabled. According to Hill\\'s representatives, he had an IQ of 70 and the mental capacity of an 11-year-old. A number of experts and state doctors had also testified to Hill\\'s mental disability. The Supreme Court turned down the appeal, however, after the court voted 7-2 to not take up the petition. Despite being the first US state to ban the execution of mentally disabled inmates, critics say Georgia has the toughest standard for proving intellectual disability in the US. Global calls for mercy The European Union (EU), lawyers and doctors, as well as public figures including former US president Jimmy Carter, had also called for mercy for Hill. \"This execution is an abomination,\" said Hill\\'s attorney Brian Kammer, following the Supreme Court\\'s decision not to take up Hill\\'s petition. \"Today, the court has unconscionably allowed a grotesque miscarriage of justice to occur in Georgia. \"The memory of Mr. Hill\\'s illegal execution will live on as a moral stain on the people of this state and on the courts that allowed this to happen.\" According to the Death Penalty Information Center, Hill was the fifth US inmate executed this year and the second in Georgia. ksb/bw (Reuters, AFP, AP)',\n",

       " {'story': 'Vatican will take over Knights of Malta following condom row Pope Francis requested Grand Master Matthew Festing to step down from the Knights of Malta. The decision comes during an ongoing argument between church liberals and conservatives over the use of condoms. Grand Master Matthew Festing is out of the Knights of Malta following a request by Pope Francis. \"The Grand Master was received on Tuesday by Pope Francis who requested his resignation, which the Grand Master agreed to,\" a spokesman for the Order told French press agency AFP. Festing\\'s resignation still must be confirmed by the Knights of Malta\\'s sovereign council, which is scheduled to convene on Saturday. The Vatican said a papal delegate would be named to lead the Order. Condoms at the forefront Grand Masters of the Knights of Malta are usually in the position for life, but the disagreement over the use of condoms to prevent the spread of AIDS, and the controversy following the removal of Knights\\' Grand Chancellor Albrecht Freiherr von Boeselager for allowing the distribution of condoms in the Order\\'s humanitarian aid agency pushed Francis into action. Festing also claimed in a leaked letter that three Vatican appointees had a conflict of interest due to links to a Geneva-based fund the Order also had a stake in. It appears the defiance of papal authority was the final straw. Von Boeselager was health minister of the order when the Malteser International was found to have distributed condoms in Myanmar under his watch. The church forbids the use of condoms or other forms of artificial contraception. Von Boeselager said he shut down two programs in Myanmar but kept a third going as it was the only supplier of basic medical services for needy people. Liberals vs. conservatives Von Boeselager\\'s dismissal is seen as being due to him being too liberal for Cardinal Raymond Burke, a conservative figure from the US and the Vatican. Burke has been outspoken in his views, which directly contrast with Pope Francis. Francis, as well as his predecessor Benedict XVI, said the use of condoms to preserve life is acceptable in AIDS-ravaged communities. The Knights of Malta was founded in Jerusalem in 1048 as a community of hospitals. After it was recognized by the pope in 1113, it now operates in 120 countries with 13,500 members and 100,000 employees and volunteers. kbd/rc (AFP, AP, Reuters)',\n",

       " {'story': 'Christmas market in Germany begs visitors to stop coming Thousands of visitors caused chaos as they flocked to the idyllic forest market in Velen near the Dutch border, a village of only 75 people. Some 85 million people visit Germany\\'s Christmas markets every year. A Christmas market in the German town of Velen has had to implore visitors to stop coming after a heavy influx of tourists descended on the tiny village near the Dutch border. \"As a result of the massive rush of visitors we must cancel this event!\" organizers from Velen\\'s small hamlet of Landgut Krumme wrote on Facebook, \"the Christmas market in the forest remains a market for visitors from the area!\" The post asked that people from outside the region find another place to get their mulled wine and holiday handicrafts: \"Thank you for understanding.\" Tourists from all over Germany and neighboring countries, especially Belgium and the Netherlands, flock to the country\\'s December markets to enjoy drinks, treats and the festive atmosphere. Looking at the pictures both on social media and those promoted by the tourism board of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, where Velen lies, it is not difficult to see why people would converge on the community\\'s Christmas market. Tucked inside an idyllic forest northwest of Dortmund, the market also boasted a \"living Nativity\" scene and locally-made delicacies. But this proved too popular for Landgut Krumme, which local newspaper Westdeutsche Allegemeine Zeitung wrote has only 75 inhabitants. On the first weekend of advent, thousands gathered in the hamlet, blocking the small streets for several kilometers in every direction. According to the Kölner Stadt-Anzeiger, a daily from Cologne – the site of Germany\\'s most-visited Christmas markets – the number of foreign guests to the markets more than doubled over the past few years, and each year a total of about 85 million visitors make their way to the holiday staple. The tradition of Christmas markets in Germany-speaking countries dates back to the Middle Ages, with the oldest thought to have started in Vienna in 1298 and the most famous being Nuremberg\\'s \"Christkindlmarkt.\"',\n",

       " {'story': \"Wife of Belgian serial killer and pedophile is freed A Belgian court decided to release the ex-wife and accomplice of the serial killer and pedophile Marc Dutroux. The decision relating to a crime that shocked the nation is likely to prove controversial. Two appeals against Michelle Martin's release were rejected by Belgium's highest court on Tuesday. Martin had served 16 years of a 30-year prison sentence for helping Dutroux, who kidnapped and raped six girls in the 1990s. Four of the girls, who were confined in a dungeonlike cellar, died. The court said 52-year-old Martin was free to leave prison immediately, backing the decision of a regional court to release her into a convent under strict parole terms. Belgian law dictates that, having served a third of her sentence, Martin can be set free if a rehabilitation program is in place. National debate sparked The regional ruling had provoked anger among victims' families, leading to demonstrations around the convent in the community of Malonne. It also triggered a debate bout the need to impose full-term jail sentences without parole for those crimes deemed the most serious. The appeals, one led by the father of a victim and another lodged by prosecutors, were judged to be inadmissible or unfounded. Martin, who had sought release on several previous occasions, claimed she was under Dutroux's spell and that she helped him reluctantly. Judges had approved a conditional release last year, but this was blocked when - in light of the public outcry at the time - a French convent went back on its offer of a place for Martin. rc/mkg (AFP, dpa)\",\n",

       " {'story': 'US to deploy hundreds of Marines to Afghanistan The US will send 300 Marines to train Afghan forces in the embattled Helmand province, adding to nearly 10,000 US troops still in the country. The Taliban claimed most of the opium-making region after NATO withdrawal. The troops are set to be deployed in spring of 2017 as a part of NATO\\'s advise-assist mission, the US Marine Corps announced on Friday. A 300-person force, led by a brigadier general, would \"train and advise key leaders\" within Afghanistan\\'s security forces in the southern Helmand region. Both the Afghan army and the police are struggling to contain the Taliban insurgency, which took large swaths of territory by storm after NATO ended combat missions in 2014. The Taliban currently hold around 85 percent of the Helmand province and launch attacks on the remaining districts. The region is known for its massive opium trade. \"The Marine Corps has an operational history in Afghanistan, particularly in Helmand province,\" the officials said in the statement, adding that the Marines \"will assist in preserving gains made together with the Afghans.\" Opium output grows Although no foreign troops are currently fighting the Taliban, the United States still keeps nearly 10,000 troops in the war-torn nation under the so-called Resolute Support mission. While the Obama administration made plans to reduce this number in 2017, the fate of the mission is unclear as US President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office later this month. US officials believe that the Taliban cooperate with opium traffickers in the embattled province, with criminal networks aiding the insurgency. Last month, the chief US and NATO commander in Afghanistan, John Nicholson, stated that Kabul directly controls some 64 percent of the Afghan population, 4 percent less compared to his September estimate. The UN estimated that Afghanistan\\'s opium production rose sharply during 2016. dj/sms (dpa, AFP)',\n",

       " {'story': 'German welcome for Italian mafia sentences Until six people were shot dead at an Italian eatery in Duisburg in 2007, no one considered Germany mafia heartland. An Italian court has sentenced eight men, including the mastermind of that shooting, to life in prison. A court in Locri in Italy handed down eight life sentences to a group of gangsters from the Calabrian \\'Ndrangheta mob. Among those it convicted was 32-year-old Giovanni Strangio, charged with masterminding six simultaneous shootings outside an Italian restaurant in Duisburg in western Germany. The city center attack took place within a stone\\'s throw of the city\\'s main rail station. \"I am happy that the excellent, meticulous work of investigators in Duisburg made this verdict possible,\" the interior minister for the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, Ralf Jäger, said on Tuesday. \"This success is also thanks to the intensive cooperation between Italian and North Rhine-Westphalia police forces. It shows that international cooperation in the fight against organized crime is working.\" Strangio was arrested in Amsterdam in 2009, and investigators concluded that the six shootings in Duisburg were a revenge attack for a 2006 Christmas Day killing of his cousin Maria Strangio, allegedly carried out by members of the rival Pelle-Vottari crime family. These killings were all part of an ongoing feud between the two families, which is thought to have begun in 1991 when youths from the Nirta-Strangio clan started throwing eggs at members of the Pelle-Voltari family. About fourteen people have been killed since, with what the German press called \"the Duisburg massacre\" the most notorious single example. The \\'Ndrangheta, based in Calabria - the \"toe\" of Italy - is not as well known as its Sicilian counterpart, the Cosa Nostra, or the Neapolitan Camorra, but authorities have repeatedly warned of the danger posed by their activities like drug trafficking and weapons smuggling.

       " {'story': 'Chirac Launches Development Aid Foundation Former French President Jacques Chirac has started a private foundation dedicated to development and environmental issues, as well as cultural preservation. Meanwhile, Chirac still faces corruption accusations. Chirac will officially inaugurate the foundation at a ceremony in Paris on Monday, June 9, together with supporters like former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan and Nobel Peace Prize winner Mohammad Yunus. \"In the face of major world challenges, I still want to fight,\" said Chirac last week in an interview with the French daily Le Figaro -- his first public interview since leaving office last year. \"The foundation is the perfect tool for this. \"I want to stir and awaken consciences.\" Named after the 75-year-old former president, the foundation has begun half a dozen projects since it was legally established in March with a one-million euro ($1.57 million) endowment and a small staff. The endeavors focus on providing access to clean water and medicine, combating deforestation and preserving dying languages. Chirac is to announce the next set of projects on Monday. Under investigation The inauguration event marks a rare public appearance by the former head of state, who has been battling corruption allegations since losing his presidential immunity last year. He is under suspicion of embezzling city funds for political purposes during his time as mayor of Paris between 1977 and 1995. Last November, he was placed under formal investigation, a major step toward full criminal charges. Chirac denies the allegations.',\n",

       " {'story': \"Neymar has millions in assets frozen in Brazil A Brazilian court has accused international football star Neymar of evading millions of dollars in taxes. Now the Barcelona Forward could face fines worth even more than that. The judge accused 23-year-old Neymar of tax evasion on Friday, freezing 188.8 million reals ($47 million, 42 million euros) of his assets. The Sao Paulo-born star forward, now with FC Barcelona in Spain, is suspected of evading taxes worth 63.6 million reals. Carlos Muta, the Brazilian judge who made the ruling, said he had frozen three times the amount Neymar has been accused of not paying in order to cover potential interest and fines, according to a document released by the court. The alleged evasion dates back to 2011-2013, before Neymar's move to last year's Champions League winners, when he starred for top-flight Brazilian club Santos. The player will still have access to his bank accounts and liquid assets, but will not be able to sell any of his assets before the case comes to a close. Because the fines amount to more than 30 percent of Neymar's total declared assets -- about 244 million real ($61 million, 54.5 million euros) -- Brazilian authorities also froze assets belonging to his family. Prosecutors allege that the player purposefully omitted sources of income from abroad, including FC Barcelona. This isn't the first time Neymar has been embroiled in a tax-related scandal. In 2014, Barcelona's Sandro Rosell resigned as president of the club following allegations that he had failed to report the full cost of Neymar's transfer to the Spanish club from Santos. Afterward, FC Barcelona paid Spanish tax authorities a total of 13.5 million euros. blc/msh (Reuters, AFP, dpa)\",\n",

       " {'story': 'Dresden asylum camp cleared after neo-Nazi attack An asylum camp set up in front of Dresden\\'s Semperoper opera house has been cleared. Refugees and supporters moved just a day after radical PEGIDA members and neo-Nazis attempted to storm the site. Local authorities had originally planned to clear the refugee camp, which had been set up on Saturday, by Monday evening. The administrative court of Dresden successfully filed an appeal, however, which appeared to fuel an attack on Monday night by radical members of PEGIDA and neo-Nazis. Following the usual rally held by the right-wing PEGIDA movement on Monday evening, some 100 radicals flocked to Dresden\\'s Theaterplatz demanding for the asylum seekers\\' camp to be cleared. Others could be heard shouting \"Germany for Germans, foreigners out!\" and were reportedly seen throwing bottles and fire crackers in the direction of the camp. In what appeared to be a coordinated attack, about two dozen radicals attempted to storm the anti-PEGIDA rally from two directions. The counter protest was held by local refuges and supporters of the groups \"Asylum Movement,\" \"Dresden for All,\" and \"Dresden Nazi-free.\" Dresden police managed to fend off the PEGIDA members and neo-Nazis as they formed a chain of officers between the two protest groups, before later setting up a fixed cordon around Theaterplatz. Around 500 supporters of the refugees also gathered around the asylum camp to protect the tents. PEGIDA, which roughly translates as \"Patriotic Europeans against the Islamization of the West,\" has been holding demonstrations in Dresden and a host of other German cities since October. At its peak, the group saw a turnout of some 25,000 in Dresden. Figures have decreased in recent weeks, however, particularly after images of leader Lutz Bachmann posing as Adolf Hitler went viral. ksb/rg (AFP, dpa)',\n",

       " {'story': 'German students protest university reforms Students throughout Germany are protesting reforms to the country\\'s university system. But Germany\\'s education minister says the changes will go ahead as planned - preferably sooner rather than later. German university students staged demonstrations across the country on Thursday to protest recent reforms to the country\\'s degree system and tuition fees. They also complain that colleges are underfunded and understaffed. By 2010, Germany will follow the Bachelor-Master-Doctorate format as part of the Council of Europe\\'s Bologna reforms, aimed at synchronizing Europe\\'s higher education standards. But critics say the new system will be too intense, as the time to complete one\\'s degree will be shorter. \"The students are protesting against the workload that results from this more condensed course and fear that a bachelor\\'s degree will not be enough when entering the job market,\" said Susanne Schilden, a spokeswoman for the German Rectors Conference, a group representing 265 of the country\\'s 300 universities. Demonstrators, who occupied lecture halls in 20 German cities, including Berlin, Hamburg and Munich, also said they want tuition fees to be scrapped. Police evicted around 200 protesters from a university lecture hall in Tuebingen. Inspiration from Austria Since 2005, German universities have been allowed to charge tuition fees, which now run between 100 to 500 euros ($150 to $750) per semester. \"No one can force an academic reform against the will of the students,\" a statement from the Munich students said. \"Therefore we call for rights of co-determination for all decision-making processes that affect studies at the university.\" Education Minister Annette Schavan has called for Germany\\'s 16 states to quickly implement the planned reforms. \"The students need a clear signal that the corrections that have been decided are being incorporated into the academic system,\" Schavan told broadcaster Suedwestrundfunk. The demonstrations began on Wednesday. They were inspired by student protests in Austria that have been underway for the past three weeks. There, too, the students are protesting against the Bologna reforms as well as plans to introduce tuition fees and to limit admissions to certain courses of study. vj/AFP/dpa Editor: Nancy Isenson',\n",

       " {'story': \"Leaders head to Paris for Syria talks Leaders have headed to Paris for fresh Syria due to kick off tomorrow. But China and Russia look set to snub the event, as the bloodshed on the ground continues. Foreign ministers headed to Paris on Thursday ahead of a Friday meeting on how to resolve the Syria conflict, although the talks look set to be boycotted by Russia and China. The Friends of Syria meeting, due to kick off on Friday, is being attended by the United States, Germany, Britain, France, and Arab nations including Saudi Arabia and Qatar, among other countries. Talks will focus on strategies for ending the violence in Syria. It follows similar talks in Tunis in February and in Istanbul in April. Leaders from Moscow do not look set to attend the event, however, as rumors circulated in the Russian press that the United States was seeking to persuade Russia to host an exiled Assad. Hosting Assad idea 'a joke' But the idea of Russia hosting Assad, which was first raised by German Chancellor Angela Merkel at a meeting in June, was dismissed as a joke by Russia's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov on Thursday. “Our side thought this was a joke and responded with a joke - how about you, the Germans, take Mr Assad instead,” Lavrov said in Moscow during a joint press conference after a meeting with his German counterpart Guido Westerwelle. Nor does Beijing seem likely to attend the Friends of Syria meeting. The foreign ministry spokesman Liu Weimin told reporters that his country “at present does not consider attending the meeting.” Bloodshed in Syria On the ground in Syria, at least 27 people were killed on Thursday, according to the Syrian Observatory on Human Rights, a day after violent convulsions swept through the country, reportedly killing 99 people. The figures emerged on the same day that Syrian troops advanced into Khan Sheikhoun, a rebel-held town in the country's north, killing at least 11 people according to activists. And in an attempt to add his own voice to continued political discourse on the Syria situation and remind the world of his ability to hang on to power, President Assad also spoke out on Thursday, about the rebellion and his political survival so far. “The big game targeting Syria is much bigger than we expected,” he said in an interview with Turkey's Cumhuriyet newspaper. “The fight against terrorism will continue decisively in the face of this.” sej/msh (AFP, Reuters)\",\n",

       " {'story': 'French President Emmanuel Macron signs controversial anti-terror law The new law gives French police permanent powers to shutter places of worship and conduct on-the-spot identity checks. Critics have decried the measure for its restriction of civil liberties and for targeting minorities. French President Emmanuel Macron signed a controversial raft of anti-terror legislation into law on Monday, ending the two-year state of emergency enacted after the November 2015 terror attacks in Paris that killed 130 people. The new measures give security services permanent authority to shut places of worship deemed to be fostering extremism, confine the movements of terrorism suspects and search their homes without necessarily seeking the approval of a court first. Police are also allowed to demand identity documents from anyone they deem suspicious at border areas, ports, train stations and airports. \"This law will allow us to end the state of emergency from November 1 while fully ensuring the security of our citizens,\" Macron said as he signed the document, which was approved by a parliamentary majority earlier this month. Debate over basic freedoms The bill sparked considerable debate over the past two weeks in French parliament, with critics arguing that it will be used to persecute minorities, particularly Muslims, with impunity. Macron has promised that the law will be reassessed in two years for its effectiveness. According to a poll by Le Figaro newspaper, 57 percent of the French public backs the measures, although 62 percent agreed that it was a restriction of basic freedoms. Interior Minister Gerard Collomb defended the laws, saying that \"everyone noticed we needed a fair balance between security and freedom, and I believe this text meets this need.\" Under the state of emergency, 11 religious centers have been shuttered \"for incitement to commit terrorist acts\" and 41 individuals have been placed under house arrest for harboring extremist sympathies. es/jm (AP, AFP)',\n",

       " {'story': 'UK spy chief warns of terrorist threat, seeks more surveillance powers In the first ever live interview by the chief of a UK spy agency, MI5 head Andrew Parker has appealed for more surveillance powers. He said Britain\\'s security forces had thwarted six plots in the past year. The head of the UK\\'s domestic intelligence agency is pushing for expanded government surveillance powers to respond to a rising homegrown terrorism threat. MI5 Director General Andrew Parker said in an interview with BBC Radio 4 on Thursday that terrorists were increasingly using advanced technology and social media to plan attacks and spread propaganda for the self-styled \"Islamic State\" (IS). \"They are using secure apps and Internet communication to try to broadcast their message and incite and direct terrorism amongst people who live here who are prepared to listen,\" Parker told the \"Today Programme.\" The British government estimates that at least 700 of its citizens have joined IS in Syria and Iraq, prompting the government last year to raise its security threat level to \"severe.\" The designation, the second highest, means authorities consider a terrorist attack to be highly likely. Parker said the terrorist threat was \"continuing to grow largely because of the situation in Syria and how that affects our security.\" However, the record number of refugees fleeing conflict for Europe is not \"the main focus of where the threat is coming from,\" Parker said. The spy chief said security services had thwarted six terrorist plots in the past 12 months, while last week British police carried out a record number of arrests on suspected terrorists. British Prime Minister David Cameron\\'s government plans to introduce new laws to strengthen police and intelligence agencies\\' surveillance powers, but the measures face stiff opposition from human rights and privacy groups - and quite probably from new opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn. Opposition to government surveillance has mounted following revelations from NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden showing the US and British governments cooperated in conducting mass surveillance. Parker, however, brushed aside fears the government would conduct mass surveillance against ordinary citizens. \"We\\'re focused on the people who mean us harm,\" he said.\"We\\'re not about browsing through the private lives of the citizens of this country. We do not have population-scale monitoring or anything like that.\" cw/msh (AP, Reuters)',\n",

       " {'story': 'Republican vice-presidential candidate Ryan attacks Obama Paul Ryan, the US Republicans\\' vice-presidential contender, has accepted his party\\'s nomination at its convention with a verbal attack on the economic polices of President Barack Obama. Ryan, a Wisconsin congressman regarded by Republicans as their fiscal expert, accused Obama of enacting \"big government\" policies and presiding over ballooning debt and joblessness. \"The choice is whether to put hard limits on economic growth or hard limits on the size of government, and we choose to limit government,\" Ryan said. \"We are going to solve this nation\\'s economic problems,\" Ryan said while hailing the Republican\\'s presidential candidate Mitt Romney as the man with business acumen to give America a \"turnaround.\" \"I have never seen opponents so silent about their record and so desperate to keep their power,\" said Ryan, who was little-known nationally or internationally until he was named as Romney\\'s running mate on August 11. Speech awaited from Romney On Thursday, Romney is due to formally accept the Republican presidential nomination at the convention after three days of motivational addresses by party stalwarts. Obama\\'s campaign team hit back on Thursday, accusing Ryan of misleading voters of Republican intentions on Medicare, which Obama recently reformed, and a deficit reduction plan discussed in Congress. Obama\\'s team mocks Ryan \"If Paul Ryan was Pinocchio his nose would be back in Janesville about now,\" said Obama campaign spokeswoman Jen Psaki in a reference to Ryan\\'s hometown in Wisconsin. Obama is due to accept the Democratic nomination to run for a second term in the White House at his party\\'s convention next week in Charlotte, North Carolina. Romney and Obama have been running close in most national surveys of voters ahead of the November 6 election. Unemployment, which approached 10 percent in the aftermath of the 2008-2009 recession, remains at 8.3 percent in the United States, while second-quarter economic growth was 1.7 percent. ipj/rg (Reuters, AFP)',\n",

       " {'story': 'Jammeh defeated in landmark Gambian election Longtime strongman Yahya Jammeh has lost Gambia\\'s presidential election to businessman and political newcomer Adama Barrow. Jammeh has now formally conceded defeat in the polls. In a shock result, Gambia\\'s president Yahya Jammeh has conceded defeat after 22 years in power to political newcomer Adama Barrow, the head of the country\\'s electoral commission said Friday. \"It\\'s really unique that someone who has been ruling this country for so long has accepted defeat,\" Alieu Momar Njie told reporters ahead of the release of the results of Thursday\\'s presidential election. Jammeh has staunchly held onto power since he staged a 1994 military coup that ousted Dawda Jawara, who himself had been president since 1970, just five years after the country\\'s independence from Britain. A little known businessman, the 51-year-old Barrow was picked by a group of political parties to head the opposition ticket under his United Democratic Party. The electoral commission said Barrow received 263,000 votes to Jammeh\\'s 212,000, giving him a five year mandate in the poor country of some 890,000 people. Mama Kandeh, a third candidate of the only opposition party not to join Barrow\\'s coalition, got 102,969 votes. The longtime head of state, who represents the Alliance for Patriotic Reorientation and Construction party, was expected to make a televised address later in the day. Jammeh, who has previously said that with the will of God he could rule for a billion years, has been accused by rights groups of abuses, including killing political opponents and clamping down on journalists and gays. During his reign he swung the country in an Islamic direction, last year declaring the country an Islamic Republic. Previous elections since he came to power have been marked allegations of rigging. Thursday\\'s election was impacted by an internet backout and a heavy security presence that extended into early Friday. The United States said the voter turn out appeared to be high and took place under \"generally peaceful conditions.\" But the State Department voiced concerned about the arrest of opposition supporters, the internet blackout and disruption of phone services. If Jammeh concedes, it would be remarkable transition in the West African country and the continent, where few leaders step down through elections. cw/kl (Reuters, AFP, KNA)',\n",

       " {'story': 'Boy on cruise ship racks up €12,000 roaming bill A German family received an unwelcome surprise after returning home from a family cruise to Norway. The son had used just under a half a gigabyte worth of data while at sea, and was billed more than €12,000 as a result. A German family is seeking legal counsel after they arrived back home from a family holiday, only to find a phone bill totaling more than €12,000 (around $14,000). The family had taken a short cruise from the northern German city of Kiel to the Norwegian capital of Oslo. It was during that trip that the 12-year-old son decided to unwind and watch some videos on his phone. The catch: He was connected to the cruise ship\\'s own phone network, which connects to the internet via satellite. While anyone can join the network, it is generally only intended to be used by the ship\\'s crew to communicate with other vessels. In fact, German mobile phone networks can demand as much as €30 per megabyte of data downloaded through a satellite connection. The EU\\'s abolition of roaming charges does not apply at sea. Read more: Germany, land of woefully slow internet As a result, the family was ordered by their network provider to pay almost €12,500 for just 470 megabytes of data. Legal counsel sought The phone network did agree to reduce the bill, admitting it was clear the son had connected to the cruise ship\\'s network without knowing. Nevertheless, it still demanded €5,000. The family has since employed a lawyer to try and settle what they consider to be an \"immoral\" bill. The Norwegian cruise line operator Color Line said it regretted the incident but that it was unable to help. Read more: Smartphone tariffs: Germany, US charge \\'exorbitant\\' prices Tips for surfing and roaming at sea: Before setting off, ask your network provider what its fees are for making calls and roaming via satellite connection. These will almost certainly be far higher than usual and is almost always best avoided, unless it is an emergency. Before even reaching the port, be sure to disable mobile data usage. This will ensure you don\\'t connect to a docked ship\\'s phone network before you\\'ve even set off. Find out if the cruise operator you\\'ll be travelling with offers internet access on board that\\'s intended for travelers, and what the prices and conditions are. While it will be expensive, the pricing will at least be transparent.',\n",

       " {'story': 'Vatican-backed Venezuela crisis talks to resume Friday Venezuelan government and opposition leaders prepared to resume talks on the country’s crisis Friday. Neither side is expecting a positive outcome. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and opposition leaders will meet Friday to ease the political standoff and economic crisis gripping the South American nation. Neither Maduro nor Jesus Torrealba, Executive Secretary of Venezuela\\'s coalition of opposition parties (MUD) seemed optimistic heading into the Vatican-backed talks. Both sides declared a delicate truce at the previous meeting on October 30, which required opposition leaders to suspend protests and moves to hold a political trial against Maduro, but insults lobbed by both sides continued. For dialogue to continue, the opposition is demanding the release of more than 100 activists in jail, access for international humanitarian assistance, and the naming of a new board of directors to the elections council. In response, Maduro demanded Congress respect a court sentence that effectively stripped the opposition of a super majority won last year, a sentence the opposition considers fraudulent. Government and opposition forces did not appear optimistic going into the talks scheduled for Friday afternoon. Torrealba has warned that his side will seek early elections, if Maduro refuses a referendum over a possible presidential recall. \"The MUD is seeking an electoral solution to this crisis through the negotiating table,” said Torrealba. \"Venezuela is a pressure cooker. The recall vote was an escape valve, and the government sealed it up.\" Torrealba added the truce was \"over.\" Analyst Luis Vicente Leon said he did not believe Maduro would go through with a referendum. \"The likelihood that the government, in negotiations, will accept a referendum or early elections is practically zero,\" said Leon. If Maduro agreed to a referendum, Leon said, it \"is absolutely certain that would mean handing (the opposition) his head.\" Venezuelan constitutional rules dictate the opposition must secure a referendum before January 10 if it wants to rid Maduro of his duties. If that does not happen, Maduro and his coalition will stay in power until 2019. Mediators at the talks include Vatican envoy Claudio Maria Celli and former Spanish prime minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero. \"We need a spirit of respect and coexistence. Dialogue is not only a means for reaching agreement - it is an end in itself,\" said Zapatero. There is a risk of violence surrounding the talks. Anti-government riots in 2014 left 43 dead. Protestors have taken to the streets in protest of Maduro in recent weeks. Maduro has low approval ratings according to recent polls. kbd/rc (AFP, Reuters)',\n",

       " {'story': 'Submarine to be deployed in search for missing Malaysian Airlines plane Australian officials have said they will deploy a submarine to search for any wreckage of missing flight MH370 on the seafloor. The move will bring the search underwater 38 days after the plane disappeared. Search crews will, for the first time, send an autonomous submarine to determine whether signals detected by sound-locating equipment are from the missing plane\\'s black boxes, the Australian head of search Angus Houston said at a news conference Monday. \"Ocean Shield will cease searching with the towed pinger locator later today and deploy the autonomous underwater vehicle Bluefin-21 as soon as possible,\" Houston said. The sub can create a sonar map of the area to chart any debris on the ocean floor, but Houston warned the submarine will not automatically \"result in the detection of the aircraft wreckage. It may not.\" He also said it would be \"a slow and painstaking process,\" because canvassing the area with sub could take six weeks to two months. Over the past two weeks, crews have picked up a series of underwater \\'pings\\' in the southern Indian Ocean consistent with an aircraft\\'s black box, which has helped narrow the area of the search. The batteries in the plane\\'s flight data recorders are now two weeks past their 30-day expected shelf life with the last \\'ping\\' signal logged six days ago. \"Despite the lack of further detections, the four signals previously acquired taken together constitute the most promising lead we have in the search for MH370,\" Houston added. Recovering the plane\\'s black box is essential for investigators to try to figure out what happened to Flight 370, which vanished March 8 while en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people on board. Houston also said an oil slick was detected in the current search area, which is about 2,200 kilometers (1,400 miles) northwest of Perth. Several liters of the oil were retrieved for testing but results will still not be available for several days. A visual search for debris was also planned for Monday over 47,600 square kilometers (18,400 square miles) of ocean. hc/av (Reuters, AP)',\n",

       " {'story': 'Studying in Goettingen: In the footsteps of Nobel winners In Goettingen, you can study almost anything while balancing university and private life. The two campuses outside the city center house most of the university\\'s institutes, but students aren\\'t cut off from Goettingen. Georg August University was opened in 1737. It is the largest and oldest still-surviving university in Lower Saxony. In the 2009-2010 winter semester, there were 24,000 students enrolled here. Since 2007, the university\\'s concept for the future has been based on Germany\\'s Initiative for Excellence. One important component of this is creating a connection between the university and other research institutes in the city. This involves the Goettingen Academy of Sciences, the five Max Planck institutes, the German Aerospace Center and the German Primate Center. Tradition and variety What was unusual at the time of the university\\'s establishment is today the norm: thinking for yourself and doing your own research. The 13 faculties offer almost all courses of study except for engineering. Some of the main focus points in research include chemistry, solid-state physics, materials science, biodiversity and mathematics, as well as German language studies, oriental studies, archaeology and theology. The university places a lot of value on having a broad curriculum. Books, books, books A great treasure of the \"Georgia Augusta,\" as the university is sometimes called, are its books. The old library contains some of the most important collections of German science literature from the 18th and 19th centuries. The books are accessible to all students, although they cannot be borrowed. And while this library reflects the glory of the university\\'s early years, the Goettingen State and University Library, located on the humanities campus, shows the university\\'s modern side: well-arranged and spacious. The Nobel Prize wonder So far in history, 12 Nobel Prizes have been awarded to researchers who made outstanding discoveries during their time at Goettingen. Among them is Werner Heisenberg (1901-1976), who received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1932 for his work in quantum mechanics. There is also Bert Sakmann (born in 1942), who received the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1991 for his findings related to ionic channels within cells. Renowned abroad Goettingen University doesn\\'t only enjoy a good reputation in Germany, but also abroad. This is why each year more than 2,500 foreign students come here to study. Most of them are from China, Poland and Turkey. Mathematics, forestry and philosophical subjects are especially popular among these students. Author: Anna Grabowski',\n",

After completing his education, he began to work first at the consumer products company, Colgate-Palmolive in Hamburg in 1986. He then moved to Herzogenaurach in the Franconian countryside to work for sporting goods manufacturer Puma in 1988. From there, he rose rapidly though the ranks to become head of marketing in 1991 and vice president – international and head of the global marketing and sales department. At the age of 30, he became chairman of the board of Puma 1993, making him the youngest CEO of German firms with commercially traded stock. Zeitz shifted production to China and altered the brand’s image, transforming Puma into a lifestyle product. By 2005, his efforts led to a tripling of the company’s sales. Since then Zeitz has been said to be Germany’s best paid business executive. In addition, the businessman is also dedicated to improving society.

       " {'story': 'Baseball star Jose Fernandez dies in boat crash Miami Marlins pitcher Jose Fernandez has died in a boating accident off Miami Beach. The 24-year-old ace was one of the brightest stars in the game. Miami Marlins pitcher Jose Fernandez, a two-time All-Star selection and winner the National League Rookie of the Year Award, died in a boating crash early Sunday in Florida. He was one of three men killed when a 32-foot boat collided with jetty off Miami Beach, the US Coast Guard said. The right-hander, who was the team\\'s first round draft pick in 2011 and made a debut in April 2013, was a hero in the Cuban-American community. \"He was one of our game\\'s young stars who made a dramatic impact on and off the field,\" Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement. Fernandez was born in Cuba and, after three attempts, made it by boat to the United States with his mother at the age of 15. He became a naturalized US citizen. With his steaming fastball, Fernandez had an average 12.49 strikeouts per nine innings, the best in both the National and American leagues. He pitched a career 38-17 in four seasons with the Marlins. Adding to the tragedy, Fernandez posted pictures on Instagram last week of his girlfriend, saying they were expecting a baby. Fernandez\\'s death drew shock and tribute across baseball. The Marlins team gathered at the ballpark wearing black jerseys. \"A lot of words were said - meaningful words and emotion and prayer,\" team president David Samson said. \"Jose is a member of this family for all time.\" Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission spokesman Lorenzo Veloz said it was believed that the boat\\'s speed contributed to the accident. He said drugs or alcohol were not believed to be a factor. \"It does appear to be that they were coming at full speed when they encountered the jetty, and the accident happened,\" he said, adding the star pitcher died from trauma and not drowning. None of the three were wearing life jackets. The names of the other two on the boat were being withheld pending notification of family. cw/rc (Reuters, AP)',\n",

       " {'story': \"Corporate maneuvering at Samsung in full swing South Korean corporate giant Samsung has announced the planned merger of two of its companies. The move is widely seen as a measure to strengthen the position of the ailing chairman's son, Lee Jae-yong. Samsung on Tuesday announced the merger of Cheil, the company's fashion business and theme park operator, with the firm's C&T construction and trading firm. News agencies interpreted the move as a step to ensure that the son of the group's ailing chairman inherited control of the conglomerate. Analysts argued the transaction would give Samsung heir Lee Jae-yong a big say in the enterprise, including its crown jewel, Samsung Electronics. Preparing the ground Lee is vice chairman of Samsung Electronics and will own 16.5 percent of the new C&T unit, making him the post-merger firm's largest shareholder. The whole family's direct stake in the combined entity, including that of Lee's father and his sisters, will amount to 30.4 percent. The merger plan comes as Samsung Electronics Chairman Lee Kun-hee, 73, has been hospitalized for more than a year after suffering a heart attack in May 2014. Experts said the transaction would be completed by early September. Shares of Cheil and C&T soared by the daily limit of 15 percent on the announcement. hg/pad (AP, AFP)\",\n",

       " {'story': 'Data Watchdog Questions EU\\'s Controversial Fingerprint Plan A potential scandal over infringements on privacy rights has surfaced in Brussels after it was revealed that the EU is considering launching a fingerprinting drive which would involve citizens as young as six years old. The plans to add fingerprints to the new European passports and store them in a centralized database was launched in Brussels on Oct. 18 by EU Justice, Freedom and Security Commissioner Franco Frattini, the just as European leaders gathered for an important summit in Lisbon, the dpa news agency reported. But after Peter Hustinx, the head of the European data protection watchdog [EDPS], announced the watchdog agency\\'s concerns on Thursday, march 27, EU officials worked to calm fears over the potential for privacy infringements. Hustinx\\'s main concerns focus on controversial plans to fingerprint children as young as 6 years old and elderly people who would be physically unable to provide theirs, as well as the creation of a centralized database, which would hold a copy of fingerprints belonging to all EU citizens. Civil liberties advocates fear that such a database could be violated and used for criminal purposes. EU defends plan to fingerprint children Frattini\\'s office on Thursday rejected calls for the 6-year-old exemption limit to be raised to include children under the age of 14 so that it may be brought \"in line with international practice,\" arguing that the measure was needed to prevent child-trafficking. Officials also said they were willing to address Hustinx\\'s concerns about the centralized database and respond within \"a matter of weeks.\" \"We have just received the comments, and we want to take them serious,\" said Friso Roscam Abbing, Frattini\\'s spokesman. \"Creating big databases poses data-protection challenges, nobody will deny it. However, precisely because we are aware of those challenges we will do everything that is needed to address them ... and ensure that we are taking duly into consideration all legitimate data protection concerns.\" Brussels claims citizens no longer hold concerns Officials in Brussels also argued that a growing number of EU citizens no longer fear being likened to potential suspects simply because their fingerprints are taken, noting that biometric data of this kind has become increasingly common, for instance as an added security measure in laptops. Slovenian Interior Minister Dragutin Mate, whose country holds the rotating presidency of the EU, acknowledged to reporters that the proposal will likely encounter difficulties when it is due to be discussed by the European Parliament and by member states.',\n",

       " {'story': 'EgyptAir crash investigator downplays possibility of explosion The head of Egypt\\'s forensic team has downplayed the theory of an explosion bringing down the EgyptAir flight. Investigators are struggling to work out why the Airbus 320 jet crashed with 66 people on board. \"Whatever has been published is baseless and mere assumptions,\" Hisham Abdel-Hamid, head of Egypt\\'s forensic authority, told the country\\'s MENA news agency on Tuesday. Forensic experts had floated the theory of an explosion triggering the crash after they collected wreckage (pictured above) and body parts, believed to belong to the travelers on the flight. They said the largest of these was barely bigger than than the palm of a hand and suggested there had been an explosion. However Abdel-Hamid and other forensic experts downplayed the claim and the government of Cairo also released a statement, warning media outlets \"to avoid chaos and spreading false rumors and damaging the state\\'s high interests and national security.\" Meanwhile, Greek officials said they would start dispatching key data on the disaster on Wednesday. According to a Greek defense ministry official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, the plane had lurched violently in mid-air before plunging into the Mediterranean Sea. Egyptian officials however denied they saw the plan swerve on their radar screens. French investigators, who are helping Egyptian officials look for clues, said the plane sent a series of warnings, indicating there was smoke on board and that possible computer faults had occurred shortly before it disappeared. The EgyptAir Airbus 320 was flying from Paris to Cairo last Thursday when it vanished from radar screens and plunged into the Mediterranean Sea. There were 66 passengers and crew members traveling in the plane. Investigators are trying to find the machine\\'s black boxes, which could reveal what went wrong. mg/jm (Ap, Reuters)',\n",

Dozens of others have been wounded. The rocket was assumed to have been fired amid fighting between Afghan Taliban insurgents and the army, which has been battling insurgents in the six months since US forces withdrew from the area. \"At least 15 people were killed and 45 wounded when the rocket struck in a firefight between Afghan security forces and the Taliban,\" said Fareed Ahmad Obaid, police spokesman for Helmand province, earlier Wednesday. Karem Atal, head of Helmand\\'s provincial council, confirmed the incident and said the death toll could increase as many of the wounded were rushed to the hospital. The Associated Press put the death toll higher, saying at least 26 had been killed and that the number could go up to 30. Civilian casualties high in 2014 According to the United Nations, nearly 10,000 civilians and 5,000 soldiers have been killed in Afghanistan this year, 75 percent of them in attacks by the Taliban. Afghanistan\\'s counterterrorism forces have faced a tough challenge in the run-up to the withdrawal of NATO\\'s International Security Assistance Force in January. Afghan security forces will mark the transfer of responsibility from NATO on Thursday. The NATO mission will be reduced to 12,500 troops in 2015, with another 17,000 staying on to assist local police and the army. mg/cmk (AP, Reuters)',\n",

       " {'story': 'French Companies Merge to Create New European Energy Giant French President Sarkozy has successfully negotiated the merger of Paris-based Suez group and state-controlled Gaz de France, which was announced Monday. GDF-Suez will become one of Europe\\'s biggest energy conglomerates. French President Nicolas Sarkozy brokered terms of the deal, which the companies\\' boards agreed to late Sunday. The new company, called GDF-Suez, will become one of Europe\\'s largest energy conglomerates along with Russia\\'s state-run Gazprom, Electricite de France and Germany\\'s EON. The two companies have a combined market value of 90 billion euros ($122.8 billion) although Suez will spin off many of its environmental assets, valued by analysts at 18-20 billion euros. Merger of equals The merger was first conceived 18 months ago, but was delayed by disagreements over valuation and control. The final agreement will include a share exchange ratio of 0.9545 to 1, or 21 Gaz de France shares for 22 Suez shares, the groups said in a joint statement. Sarkozy, who was elected in May and has promised economic reforms, pressured Suez to abandon most of its water and waste assets to focus on energy. Besides distributing gas and electricity, Suez runs power stations, pumps water and manages waste. Under terms of the deal, Suez will divest 65 percent of its environmental activities through a stock market listing, scheduled to take place at the same time as the merger. Unions oppose privatization Sarkozy pushed for the merger to prevent a foreign takeover of Suez and to strengthen Gaz de France\\'s power assets. The deal is the latest version of a plan first announced by former Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin in early 2006 to protect Suez from a possible takeover by Italy\\'s Enel. France\\'s unions and the Socialists have opposed the merger because it would remove the government\\'s control over Gaz de France. The government owns 80 percent of Gaz de France. Finance Minister Christine Lagarde said the government will keep significantly more than a blocking minority of 35 percent. The combined group will be led by Suez Chief Executive Officer Gerard Mestrallet with the state-owned gas utility\\'s Jean-Francois Cirelli becoming the vice chairman. The merged company has set a cost savings target of 1 billion euros by 2013, according to Bloomberg news service. The transaction to create GDF Suez will be completed \"as early as possible\" in 2008, the companies said in a statement. \"Recent developments in the energy sector reinforced the strategic and industrial logic behind the transaction,\" which creates a \"global energy leader,\" the two companies said.',\n",

       " {'story': 'Canada: Bomb blast injures over a dozen at Indian restaurant At least 15 people were injured in an explosion at an Indian restaurant outside of Toronto. Police are searching for two men suspected of setting off the bomb in the Bombay Bhel restaurant before fleeing the scene. Several people were injured during a blast at an Indian restaurant in the Canadian city of Mississauga on Thursday night, local authorities said. Two men are suspected of setting off an explosive device in the restaurant, with authorities asking for information about their identities and whereabouts. What we know so far: The blast took place around 10:30 p.m. local time (0230 UTC) at the Bombay Bhel restaurant in Mississauga, Canada. Paramedics took 15 people to the hospital — three sustained critical injuries while the others were less severely injured. Police sealed off the shopping plaza where the explosion took place. Authorities said there were no indications that the bombing was an act of terrorism or a hate crime. Two suspects on the run Peel Regional Police said on Twitter that they were looking for two male suspects who are believed to have set off an \"improvised explosive device within the restaurant.\" Both were wearing dark zip-up hoodies and one appeared to be carrying an object. Both men were described as having light or fair skin, with one of them believed to be in his mid-20s. \"We have no indication to call it a hate crime or any kind of terrorism act,\" Peel Region Sergeant Matt Bertram said. \"Nothing was said by these individuals,\" Peel Region Sergeant Matt Bertram said. \"It appears they just went in, dropped off this device, and took off right away.\" Where did the blast take place? Mississauga is Canada\\'s sixth-largest city, located around 20 miles (32 kilometers) west of Toronto. The three people who were critically wounded were taken to a trauma center in Toronto. Shortly after Toronto attack: Thursday night\\'s blast comes one month after a man drove a white rental van into a lunch-time crowd in Toronto, killing 10 people and injuring 15. Although police have not disclosed a motive, the attacker referenced a misogynistic online community in social media posts prior to the attack. Most of the victims were women. rs/sms (dpa, Reuters)',\n",

       " {'story': 'Report: German MPs advised not to visit Turkey Germany\\'s Foreign Ministry has advised lawmakers with a Turkish background to avoid going to Turkey in the near future. Politicians of Turkish origin are facing a backlash over a Bundestag vote on the Armenian genocide. An internal assessment from the German Foreign Office said the safety of parliamentarians traveling to Turkey could not be guaranteed, news magazine \"Der Spiegel\" reported on Saturday. The warning followed Ankara\\'s angry reaction to the Bundestag\\'s adoption of an Armenian genocide resolution last week. Germany is the 26th country to recognize the massacre of up to 1.5 million Armenians at the hands of Ottoman forces in 1915-16 as genocide. Turkey rejects the term genocide and insists the Ottoman Empire had no plans to deliberately eliminate the Armenian minority. Following the vote, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan lashed out at the 11 politicians of Turkish descent from the CDU, SPD, Greens and the Left party who had backed the motion. He accused them of siding with the outlawed Kurdish militant PKK and suggested their blood was \"tainted.\" Threats to safety Green Party co-leader Cem Özdemir, who spearheaded the vote, has reported receiving dozens of death threats from Turkish nationalists. He is under police protection and has boosted security around his Berlin home. \"Der Spiegel\" said a number of Bundestag officials with Turkish heritage had canceled business trips to Ankara and summer vacation plans on the Bosphorus. Germany\\'s Integration Commissioner Aydan Özoguz, of the Social Democratic Party, said the developments were unfortunate. \"It is indescribable knowing that it\\'s not possible to fly there at the moment,\" he said. \"Erdogan needs to understand that we are not an extension of Turkey.\" Sevim Dagdelen, a Left party MP, called on the German government to take action. \"Merely issuing a travel warning to us deputies isn\\'t enough,\" she told AFP, adding that the ruling coalition should hit Turkish officials behind attacks on German MPs with an entry ban. nm/bk (AFP, dpa)',\n",

The new figures do however put Germany near the European average. Germany in 2016 recorded its highest fertility rate since 1973, the Federal Statistics Office reported on Wednesday. The latest figures are part of an upward trend for Germany, Europe\\'s biggest country by population, which has suffered from low birth rates since the 1970s. Read more: Let\\'s talk about overpopulation... What the numbers tell us: The fertility rate — the average number of births per woman — was 1.59 in 2016, a considerable increase from 1.5 in 2015. The 2016 rate was the highest recorded since 1973. Experts consider 2.1 to be the level at which the population in a developed country replaces itself with each generation. The fertility rate for women with German citizenship increased from 1.43 in 2015 to 1.46 in 2016. The rate for foreign women increased from 1.95 in 2015 to 2.28 in 2016. Slightly more than 790,000 babies were born. That was around 54,500 more — a 7 percent increase — compared to 2015. German women gave birth to just over 605,000 babies. Foreign women gave birth to just below 185,000 babies. 2016 was the fifth year in a row in which the total number of newborns increased. The last time women in Germany had as many children was 1996. Read more: Record rise in babies with foreign mothers in Germany Why are there more babies? The Federal Statistics Office said women between the ages of 30 and 37 were more frequently having children. Many of them did not have children when they were younger, which was in stark contrast to older women, who more frequently had children before they turned 30. Middle of the EU pack: Germany\\'s 1.59 fertility rate put it near the 1.6 average for all 28 European Union countries in 2016.

Germany came sixth in the Athens 2004 medal table with 13 gold medals, 16 silver and 20 bronze. Its overall score of 49 medals was good enough for joint fourth place with Australia, with the US leading the table with 36-39-27 medals and the overall list with 102 medals. \"We want to achieve a good result, finish at the same level as in our sixth-place finish in Athens, or even move up one position,\" said the DOSB\\'s vice president, Eberhard Gienger. The German team of around 450 athletes also features table tennis ace Timo Boll, who hopes to scare the hosts at their number one sport. Other bright lights Canoeing 2004 champion Andreas Dittmer, dressage star Isabelle Werth, the men\\'s field hockey and handball teams are also major medal hopes. Steffen, meanwhile, rose to stardom with four golds and one silver at the 2006 European championships although she had to settle for a bronze and a silver at the 2007 worlds. Now the 24-year-old is hoping to deliver Germany\\'s first swim gold since 1992, in the 50m or 100m freestyle races. \"I am so scared to finish the 100m in second place and not to be happy with it. I don\\'t even know if I could be happy with gold because that result would only confirm the expectations,\" Steffen said. Hambuechen won world championship gold for Germany on the horizontal bar, all-around silver and team bronze. The diminutive 20-year-old, known as the \"gymnastics professor,\" now hopes to cap his career in Beijing and said he will be not be to the forefront when it comes to criticism of China over human rights and other issues. \"I have a critical view of the political situation in China but at the Olympics in Beijing I will only think about my competition,\" said Hambuechen, the German Sportsman of the Year in 2007.',\n",

       " {'story': 'Credit rating agency slaps Italy with negative forecast Standard & Poors has slapped Italy with a negative forecast, raising the prospect that the credit rating of the eurozone\\'s third-largest economy could be slashed. The credit rating agency Standard & Poors has downgraded its forecast for Italy from \"stable\" to \"negative,\" citing a weak economy and poor prospects for reducing Rome\\'s massive debts. The negative forecast implies that there is a one-and-three chance Italy\\'s credit rating could be downgraded within the next 24 months. A downgrade of Rome\\'s credit rating may raise fear among investors that the debt crisis which has gripped Greece, Ireland and Portugal will spread to Italy, the eurozone\\'s third largest economy. \"In our view, Italy\\'s current growth prospects are weak and the political commitment for productivity-enhancing reforms appears to be faltering,\" Standard & Poors said in a statement. \"Potential political gridlock could contribute to fiscal slippage. As a result, we believe Italy\\'s prospects for reducing its general government debt have diminished.\" Italy reacts The Italian Department of the Treasury strongly criticized Standard & Poors, saying that data on its economic growth and public accounts had \"constantly been better than expected.\" The treasury went on to say that major international organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the European Commission have given \"very different\" assessments of Italy\\'s economy. The negative forecast comes after Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who faces a string of corruption and sex trials, suffered a major setback in local elections in his hometown Milan.

       " {'story': \"South Korea latest US ally to join AIIB Washington looks increasingly isolated as another important ally joins the China-backed Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB). Australia and Taiwan could be next, as a deadline for founding members approaches. Shares in South Korean iron and steel companies shot up after Seoul announced Thursday it would seek to join the controversial Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB). Histeel and Hanil Iron and Steel are likely to benefit from contracts when the China-backed bank begins pumping billions into infrastructure projects in the region later this year. A South Korean finance ministry official said companies in the communications, energy and transport companies would also gain contracts. South Korea is the latest in a growing list of countries who are accepting Beijing's invitation to become founding members of the AIIB before a March 31 deadline. But it is also one of the United States' closest allies in Asia, and Washington opposes the AIIB because it believes it will undercut the World Bank, where it dominates policy. Japan, which together with the US controls another Asian development lender, the Asian Development Bank, is still holding out. Strained relations Also in the region, Taiwan's president Ma Ying-jeou said on Friday his country should investigate opportunities in joining the bank, in spite of its strained relations with Beijing. Britain, another key ally of Washington, became the first EU country agreeing to join the AIIB two weeks ago. Since then, other European governments have been lining up to get in on the action. France, Germany, Italy and Switzerland have agreed. Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has also hinted his country will join the more than 30 nations so-far agreeing to take part in the AIIB, which includes India and all members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). kc/uhe (dpa, AP)\",\n",

       " {'story': 'Kurdish YPG, Assad regime clash in Hasakeh The Kurdish YPG militia has launched a bid to take Hasakeh after calling on pro-government militias to surrender. Fighting over the divided city marks the most violent confrontation between the YPG and Syrian regime yet. Kurdish militia launched a major assault Monday to capture the entire city of Hasakeh and called on remaining pro-government forces to surrender. The fighting appears to have undone tacit understandings between the YPG and the Syrian army that had kept Hasakeh relatively calm during the past five-year conflict. The Syrian air force attacked the armed Kurdish group for the first time during the war last week, prompting the US-led military coalition to scramble aircraft to protect American special forces troops deployed alongside the YPG. US Navy Captain Jeff Davis warned Damascus that the US-led coalition would do what was needed to protect its forces on the ground. \"The Syrian regime would be well advised not to do things that would place them at risk,\" Davis said Friday. Syrian state media accuses the YPG-affiliated security force known as the Asayish of violating a ceasefire. That was denied in a leafleting campaign that said the YPG intended to take control. \"To all the elements of the regime and its militias who are besieged in the city you are targeted by our units,\" the leaflets read. The loss of Hasakeh would be a strategic blow to President Bashar Assad\\'s government and would be a setback for Russia, which has given air support to Assad\\'s forces to prevent further territorial losses in the country. Thousands of civilians in the city, which is a mix of Arabs and Kurds, including members of the Christian community, have fled to villages in the countryside as the fighting intensified, residents said. Fighting around Hasakeh has killed 43 people including 27 civilians, among them 11 children, since Wednesday, according to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Thousands of civilians have now fled Hasakeh, where electricity has been cut and bakeries shut. jar/rc (Reuters, AFP, AP)',\n",

A two time Oscar winner, Spacey was involved in some of the musical numbers and did impressions. He won a Tony Award in 1991 for his role in \"Lost in Yonkers.\" Spacey currently plays ruthless politician Frank Underwood in the Netflix series \"House of Cards.\" James Earl Jones, most well known for the voice of Darth Vader from the \"Star Wars\" franchise, received a lifetime achievement award. kbd/jm (AP, dpa, Reuters)',\n",

       " {'story': 'French traveling groups block highway after Roma evictions Ethnic Roma and French travelers have staged a protest on a major highway after hundreds were evicted from an illegal site. The French government is cracking down, vowing to close 300 campsites. Members of France\\'s ethnic Roma group and members of the country\\'s native traveler minority blocked a major highway outside Bordeaux on Sunday after being evicted from a campsite near the city. The blockade was the first major protest in the wake of a government crackdown on unauthorized sites across the country. Protesters used cars, trucks and caravans to block the Bordeaux bypass and a bridge over the River Garonne in the southwest of the country. Police and road safety officials said traffic in the direction of Paris was backed up for five kilometers (three miles) on a summer public holiday weekend. The protesters blocked the bridge for some five hours, leaving to try to gain access to a sports ground. They were stopped by riot police and reoccupied the bridge for another hour-and-a-half. Forced to leave site The group of travelers and Roma had been forced to leave a campsite in the nearby town of Anglet, and had been denied access to an exhibition ground by authorities. French President Nicolas Sarkozy last month announced plans to dismantle 300 unauthorized campsites within three months, following a clash between Roma, mainly of Bulgarian and Romanian origin, and police. The raids, being investigated by the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, were met with criticism from committee members at a meeting last week. A lawmaker from Sarkozy\\'s ruling UMP party, Jean-Pierre Grand branded the evictions \"disgraceful\" on Saturday, likening them to roundups of minorities during World War II.

       " {'story': 'Court Refuses to Return Seized Art to Nazi Doctor\\'s Relatives A Federal Administration Court in Leipzig has decided the town of Chemnitz does not have to return confiscated art objects to the heirs of a Nazi doctor. The Federal Administrative Court in the city of Leipzig said there were no grounds for the restitution of art which has been confiscated by Soviets after World War Two because the doctor in question had been a promoter of Adolf Hitler\\'s ideology. \"The aim of this function was to spread national socialist ideology,\" said the court in a statement. Hundreds of oil paintings, etchings and drawings were allegedly confiscated from Gustav Schuster, who was Director of the Chemitz Women\\'s Clinic, during the Second World War. The artworks, which include paintings by Ludwig Richter, Max Liebermann and Max Klinger, are worth at least 500,000 euros ($662,550). The decision, had it have been different, could have opened the doors to thousands of other claims for compensation for artworks, property and other goods confiscated from 1945 to 1949 by the Soviet forces which occupied the eastern part of Germany after WWII. As it is, legal experts say the ruling could set a different precedent and negatively affect similar restitution claims that could number into the thousands, according to the Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper, which quoted an official from the German Finance Ministry. Nazis aren\\'t eligible for compensation The German \"Compensation and Just Satisfaction Act\" law, which was passed in 1994, exempts the state from paying compensation if the person from who the goods were confiscated \"extensively\" supported the Nazi regime, or had committed \"crimes against humanity.\" This can give rise to the problem that heirs are disinclined to probe deeply into their family\\'s background. The Süddeutsche Zeitung reported that the lawyers for Schuster\\'s family have presented the court with documents showing that there were 14,427 senior positions in the Nazi regime at the municipal level. The family argues that as one under thousands, Dr. Schuster therefore was only responsible for 0.006 percent of what occurred. However, according to the Süddeutsche Zeitung, there is not doubt that Schuster was jointly responsible for deciding on, and conducting, the forced sterilization of dozens of women. The newspaper quotes the example of a similar court decision made in October when the son of a lawyer for the Nazi regime was awarded compensation for two properties confiscated from his family. Only after the court case, was it revealed that the lawyer was probably involved in the hanging of a deserter in the last days of the war.',\n",

       " {'story': 'US shuts down popular file-sharing site A number of people have been arrested in New Zealand in a US effort to crackdown on online pirated material. Among those arrested was the German former CEO of the world\\'s most popular file-sharing site, Megaupload. Four people have been arrested in New Zealand on US accusations of facilitating millions of illegal downloads of film and music content, costing copyright holders at least $500 million (386 million euros) in lost revenue. Among those arrested were Kim Dotcom, the founder, former CEO and current chief of innovation officer of Hong-Kong-based Megaupload. The 37-year-old man holds Finnish and German citizenship and was formerly known as Kim Schmitz and Kim Tim Jim Vestor. Two other German citizens and one Dutch citizen were also arrested, while another German, Slovakian and Estonian are still at large. A grand jury in Virginia had indicted and charged Megaupload with racketeering conspiracy, copyright infringement and conspiring to commit money laundering. The US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has called it one of the \"largest criminal copyright cases ever brought by the United States.\" According to information provided by the FBI and the US Justice Department, $50 million were seized in the operation along with 18 domain names. Cyber war The crackdown comes just a day after popular Internet companies Wikipedia and Craigslist shut down their services to protest two bills currently going through US Congress - the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and the Protect IP Act (PIPA) - which aim at curbing copyright infringement by going after sites offering pirated online material. Although the company operated out of Hong Kong and its former CEO lived in New Zealand, the company allegedly used servers in Virginia, giving US prosecutors reason enough to act. The Electronic Frontier Foundation, an online freedom advocacy group, said in a statement that the indictments set \"a terrifying precedent.\" \"If the United States can seize a Dutch citizen in New Zealand over a copyright claim, what is next?\" the group asked. The hacktivist group Anonymous responded to the arrests and shutdown of Megaupload by launching a cyber attack on the FBI and Justice Department websites, which were up and running again early Friday after being shut down for several hours. Megaupload was the world\\'s largest file-sharing site with 150 million registered users, around 50 million daily hits and endorsements from music superstars.

       " {'story': \"ICC weighs war crimes case on Ivorian ex-president Gbagbo The International Criminal Court is weighing the prosecution’s case against the former president of the Ivory Coast. Laurent Gbagbo faces four counts of crimes against humanity for post-election violence in 2010-2011. Former Ivorian president Laurent Gbagbo faced the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague for a pre-trial hearing on Tuesday, making him the first former head of state to appear before the world's permanent war crimes tribunal. A three-judge panel is considering whether or not the case against Gbagbo is enough to send the ex-president to trial. The judges have until February 28 to make their decision. Gbagbo faces four counts of crimes against humanity – including rape and murder – for allegedly fomenting violence after he refused to concede a November 2010 presidential election to his opponent Alassane Ouattara. Four months of fighting followed the contested election, leaving some 3,000 people dead. Gbagbo was ultimately ousted by French forces, UN peacekeepers and pro-Ouattara forces. Allegations of massacres The prosecutors argued that Gbagbo tried to “stay in power by all means…through carefully planned, sustained and deadly attacks” against perceived supporters of Ouattara. They accused Gbagbo forces of massacring at least 80 people in Yopougon – a suburb of the capital, Abidjan – one day after the ex-president was arrested in April 2011. But the defense called for the case to be declared inadmissible, arguing for Gbagbo to face trial in the Ivory Coast. The ICC is a court of last resort, intervening only when the local judiciary proves either unable or unwilling to prosecute war crimes and crimes against humanity. “Ivory Coast is neither unable nor unwilling to prosecute President Gbagbo,” defense lawyer Dov Jacobs told the judges on Tuesday. Victor's justice? Some 300 Gbagbo supporters gathered outside of the court in The Hague, calling for the former president to be freed. “We're here today because President Gbagbo is to appear before the ICC even though he's a democratically elected president and the charges against him should be for Alassane Ouattara,” Hubert Seka, who travelled from Italy, told the AFP news agency. Although the New York-based Human Rights Watch (HRW) praised the proceedings against Gbagbo, the group also expressed concern that investigations against pro-Ouattara forces were not moving fast enough. “Holding Gbagbo to account is a critical step for victims in [Ivory Coast],”Param-Preet Singh, senior international justice counsel at HRW, said in a release. “But the slow pace of investigations against pro-Ouattara forces feeds the perception that the ICC is going along with victor's justice.” slk/dr (AP, AFP)\",\n",

       " {'story': 'Myanmar opens up for foreign investors The government of Myanmar has indicated that it plans to usher in a new era of business transparency in its oil, gas and other industries. Auctions for the rights to explore deposits are being prepared. Myanmar\\'s government on Monday announced a new drive to open its economy to badly needed foreign investment. Energy Ministry officials pledged a new era of transparency particularly in the country\\'s oil and gas industry. The ministry\\'s assistant director, Aung Kyaw Htoo, promised international standards would be upheld in auctions for the rights to explore and exploit lucrative energy reserves. \"Transparency is the most important word,\" he said at a conference in Yangon with several major foreign oil firms attending. In January, Myanmar, which is also known as Burma, invited potential investors to tenders for 18 onshore oil blocks, with a further 50 offshore blocks expected to be opened to offers by April. Overcoming past restraints The government is under pressure to make sure its approach to natural resources will bring wider development to its people and is carried out sustainably, with all contract-related payments to be published for scrutiny. Western powers have been rolling back sanctions against Myanmar in response to political reforms. Transnational energy giants Total and Chevron were among the Western corporations represented at the conference. Myanmar theoretically produces enough natural gas to meet its domestic demand, but it has been forced to export some 80 percent of it to Thailand under contracts signed when the government was desperate for foreign currency. The pending auctions are part of an effort to help overcome an energy deficit that\\'s a legacy of the deals made by the country\\'s former military rulers. hg/pfd (AFP, AP)',\n",

       " {'story': 'One Million Revelers Line Streets of Cologne for Carnival The World Cup was the theme, but revelers also poked fun at the bird flu crisis as one million people took to the streets of Cologne on Monday for the biggest carnival of the season in Germany. The Rose Monday parade is the high point of a week of festivities which sees Germans letting down their hair, donning silly costumes and consuming liberal quantities of sweets and beer. People braved freezing temperatures in Cologne to line the seven-kilometer (four-mile) route of the parade to catch a glimpse of the 96 floats which began rolling at the traditional time of 11:11 am. \"Carnival is part of life, like eating and drinking. You should never miss carnival, even if there is rain and snow,\" said Gisela Gehlen, 66, who was part of a group of women waiting to see their grandchildren on one of the floats. The nearby cities of Düsseldorf and Mainz also held carnival parades on Monday, attended by hundreds of thousands. No bird flu blues in Cologne In line with the generally irreverent atmosphere, some revelers in Cologne donned face masks and what appeared to be white chemical protection suits marked with the words \"I will survive H5N1\" to poke fun at the stringent measures introduced following the recent outbreak of bird flu in several German regions. One man dressed as a bird wore a notice saying \"I have been vaccinated\". With the World Cup kicking off in just over 100 days, many revelers wore football jerseys or black and white hats to resemble balls. Wolfram Teggen, a 46-year-old reveler from Cologne, went one step further, dressing in an oversized green tunic made to look like a soccer pitch. \"I am not even a football fan. I\\'ll just be glad if Germany gets through the first round, but I don\\'t think they\\'ll reach the final,\" he said. Pure fun Sweets and chocolates rained down on the crowd from the floats, as marching bands played music that was upbeat if not always in tune. Carnival is a tradition stemming from Catholic regions in the west and south of Germany, but it is rapidly being adopted by cities in the north and east, such as in Berlin where half a million people gathered for a parade on Sunday. It is held before the Christian season of Lent, which starts on Wednesday.',\n",

       " {'story': 'UN criticizes Israel over Gaza bombing A United Nations investigation into attacks by Israeli forces on UN installations during the Gaza war four months ago has strongly criticized Israel for gross negligence and recklessness. The report, produced by a four-member inquiry board appointed by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, found that the Israeli army failed to protect UN personnel and civilians sheltering in UN buildings. Israel has rejected the report as one-sided and biased. The UN inquiry led by Briton Ian Martin, a former head of rights group Amnesty International who later joined the United Nations, investigated nine incidents of damage to UN property. It found Israel to blame in six incidents when people sheltering in UN buildings were killed or injured. Report highlights Jabalia incident The report highlighted the firing of artillery shells near a UN-run school in Jabalia where Palestinians had sought refuge on January 6. Seven people were wounded inside the school, but an estimated 30-40 people were killed nearby. In several cases, the report found Israel had \"breached the inviolability of United Nations premises,\" had not respected UN immunity and was responsible for deaths and injuries. The board of inquiry also criticized Israel\\'s use of white phosphorus shells which the UN says damaged the UN\\'s main food warehouse in Gaza. The UN report says the Israeli military took \"inadequate\" precautions to protect UN premises and civilians inside and recommends further investigation into possible war crimes. Israel rejects allegations Israel\\'s deputy UN ambassador, Daniel Carmon, called the report one-sided and unfair. \"We were really shocked to see a report where the board is limiting itself to the facts of the damages only, ignoring the context, ignoring that there is war against terrorism,\" he told Reuters. UN Chief Ban Ki-moon said he would seek compensation from Israel for damage to UN property, estimated at more than $11 million, but would not follow the panel\\'s call for further investigations.',\n",

But now there seems to be a prank war on between the two sides\\' fans: one with potentially mouth-watering rewards. A hotel bar in the western German city of Dortmund has offered a year\\'s worth of free beer to an unknown fan of the Borussia Dortmund soccer team. According to a report in the German tabloid Bild, an unidentified man climbed to the top of archrival team Schalke\\'s stadium - currently under construction - where he placed the Dortmund flag. \"This act must be rewarded,\" said Christoph Andruszewski of the Hotel Specht in Dortmund, referring to the desecration of the Veltins Arena in Gelsenkirchen. \"Our hotel is a meeting place for Borussia fans, so we are offering the unknown hero free beer for a year and a box seat in front of our projection screen,\" he told the paper. Bild has offered to act as a go-between, putting the Dortmund hero in contact with the bar if he or she can prove he put up the flag. Meanwhile, former Dortmund player and fan liaison Alfred \"Aki\" Schmidt is convinced that the flag attack was an act of revenge. In 2006, a 41-meter (135-foot) Dortmund banner went missing, allegedly stolen by Schalke fans. The case remains unsolved even to this day. Author: David Levitz Editor: Sean Sinico',\n",

Earlier, the storm cost six lives and injured hundreds of people in Taiwan. Typhoon Soudelor slammed into the east coast of China late on Saturday, causing a number of deaths as high winds and heavy rain battered the region. The typhoon, which earlier caused widespread devastation in Taiwan, was downgraded to a tropical storm as it moved inland from Fujian province towards the neigboring provinces of Zhejiang and Jiangxi on Sunday. At least 12 people were killed and five reported missing in the city of Hangzhou in Zhejiang amid torrential rain and strong winds that knocked down trees and caused flash floods and mudslides, according to AFP news agency, quoting state media. Some 250,000 people were evacuated from their homes along the coast in Fujian and Zhejiang ahead of the typhoon's arrival, while state-run news agency Xinhua said more than 530 flights were canceled and two million households suffered power outages. Wencheng county saw 645 millimeters (25.4 inches) of rain in 24 hours - the most recorded in a century - after the typhoon made landfall Saturday night, Xinhua news agency reporterd. Devastation in Taiwan In Taiwan, where authorities say the typhoon caused at least six deaths and injured nearly 400 people on Saturday, a typhoon warning has been lifted as weather conditions ease. However, the Central Weather Bureau warned of further heavy rains in the south as emergency teams began clearing up the damage. More than 4 million households lost electricity due to the storm, and more than 500 flights were canceled or delayed. Typhoons are common in the South China Sea and Pacific at this time of year, deriving their power from the warm waters before unleashing it on the land in the form of winds and torrential rain. tj/jlw (AFP, Reuters, AP)\",\n",

French President Nicolas Sarkozy laid a wreath Tuesday at the statue of Charles de Gaulle, to begin VE Day celebrations in the French capital Paris. Known around the world as VE Day, the 8th of May marks the surrender by Germany to Allied forces 67 years ago at the end of World War II. In what is set to be one of the final official ceremonies of his single five year term, Sarkozy then inspected French troops at the Arc de Triomphe war memorial. The Arc de Triomphe has a special significance for World War II since Adolf Hitler marched his Nazi troops through the iconic monument when Germany took over France in 1940. \"Issues that unite us all\" In his first official function since winning the election on Sunday, President-elect Francoise Hollande then joined Sarkozy at the Arc de Triomphe to take part in a wreath laying ceremony for World War I veterans. Sarkozy and Hollande stood side-by-side as a military band played the Marseillaise and the Chant des Partisans, the anthem of the French Resistance, before both shook hands with veterans. \"There are issues that unite us all, beyond the person of Nicolas Sarkozy or of me,\" Hollande told journalists in a brief statement after the ceremony. The 57-year-old Socialist won elections on Sunday, ousting right-winger Sarkozy, and is due to take office formally on May 15. al/mz (AP, AFP)',\n",

Italy’s Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini will head the bloc\\'s diplomatic relations. On Saturday, European Council President Herman Van Rompuy (center in photo) announced on Twitter that EU leaders had chosen Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk (left) to succeed him and Italian Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini (right) to take over from Catherine Ashton as the bloc\\'s new top diplomat. It had been expected that the EU leaders who gathered in Brussels on Saturday would agree on key appointments to the bloc. \"Elected,\" Van Rompuy wrote on Twitter. \"The European Council has elected PM Donald Tusk as the next president of the European Council and Euro Summits.\" And, then, shortly thereafter: Tusk said it was possible to combine austerity and expansion in Europe. \"My experience as prime minister points to the fact that fiscal discipline on one side and economic growth on the other, combining these two challenges is possible,\" Tusk told a news conference in Brussels. The 57-year-old career politician also said he would take on Britain\\'s concerns over the EU: \"No reasonable person can imagine the EU without the UK,\" he said. For his own country, Tusk said his appointment was a strong signal for Poland\\'s future in the Eurozone, although the date and the final decision would be decided by the government in Poland. Mogherini has been Italy\\'s top diplomat since February. The 41-year-old center-left politician said she would work to promote European projects on the international stage: \"We are a dream come true, having to be careful that the dream doesn\\'t turn into a nightmare,\" she said. Mogherini takes up her five-year posting in November. mkg,jm/jr (AFP, dpa, AP)',\n",

       " {'story': 'European drought impacts people and environment It\\'s official: Europe experienced a severe drought this summer. DW looks at the key points of a new analysis reflecting impacts of high temperatures and low rainfall on the environment and people. It\\'s official: Europe suffered a severe drought in June and July of 2015. This is according to the European Drought Observatory\\'s analysis of data through the end of July. Not only did virtually the entire European continent see a shortage of rainfall this summer, but it also experienced \"thermal anomalies\" in July - that is, heat waves that were hotter and longer than average. The drought had a number of consequences for people and the environment. High heat caused soils to dry out, also drying out plants. This facilitated the spread of wildfires, like this one in Greece. The impact of the lack of rain and high temperatures could be felt across many sectors. Agricultural production was reduced, and forests dried out and became more susceptible to insect attacks. Hydropower production decreased, rivers fell to record low levels, and inland water transport was completely shut down in some places. Tourism, however, was boosted - along with \"open-air\" activities, the observatory noted. The conditions allowed certain grape varieties to flourish, and of course benefited solar energy. The joint research project presented the analysis in its Drought News August 2015 publication. Although low rainfall and high temperatures were present across many European regions, France, Germany, Hungary, the Czech Republic, the Benelux block, northern Italy and northern Spain experienced exceptionally hot and dry conditions. In these areas in June and July, it was warmer than 30 degrees Celsius for 30 days - while Spain (pictured below) saw 40 days over that temperature.',\n",

       " {'story': 'Probe blames Cypriot president for deadly munitions blast An official investigation into a deadly blast on Cyprus which killed 13 people and badly damaged the country\\'s economy has found the Cypriot president bore \"serious\" personal responsibility for the incident. The president of Cyprus was blamed Monday by an official investigator for negligence leading to a huge explosion that killed 13 people in July. The blast triggered a government crisis and led to talk that the island may need an EU bailout. Speaking on national television, investigator Polys Polyviou told a news conference that President Demetris Christofias bore a \"serious and very heavy personal responsibility\" for the accident. The explosion occurred when nearly 100 containers of seized Iranian munitions being stored at the Evangelos Florakis Naval base in Mari blew up. The explosion severely damaged a nearby major power plant, causing electricity shortages to about half the country. Experts predicted it would take at least one year to fix at a cost of more than 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion). Polyviou said the manner in which the decaying munitions were stored was \"completely irresponsible,\" adding that the president was responsible for allowing and keeping the cargo in Cyprus and for approving its storage near the base. Unexpected result The outcome of the probe was surprising considering it had been ordered by Christofias himself. Many had expected the inquiry to clear the head of state of any wrongdoing. Cyprus\\'s defense and foreign ministers have already resigned over the affair. Christofias, meanwhile, has rejected responsibility for the explosion. The crisis sparked rounds of protests outside the presidential palace in which thousands were calling for the president to step down. \\'Making a stand\\' The issue has dominated headlines on the divided island for months. There\\'s been a lot of interest in the case because so many people were affected by it. \"It\\'s a very small island, so lots of people were close to the explosion and saw the knock on effects of it,\" pointed out Chris Yearley, a journalist at the local English-language daily Famagusta Gazette. Yearley said there was a sense of surprise across the island that the finger of blame has been pointed so clearly at the president. \"I think that when we discovered that the president had arranged for the investigation to take place, we were expecting for him to come off scot-free. That hasn\\'t happened, and personally, I\\'m quite shocked by this and it will be interesting to see what happens next.\" Many commentators predict Christofias will stand down before the end of the year.

       " {'story': 'Banking on fortified flour in Nairobi Muguika Kaburu manufactures fortified flour for people with special dietary requirements. A former banker, he\\'s convinced he\\'s found a niche market with excellent growth prospects. It was merely by coincidence that 60-year-old entrepreneur Muguika Kaburu ended up in the food business. He used to work in banking but in 2007 was given the chance to do research on fortified foods for an international aid organization. He was then appointed as a distributer for extruder machines that are used in the manufacture of fortified flour. He took the opportunity to buy a second-hand machine for himself at a cost of two million Kenyan shillings ( $25,000, 18,000 euros ). Kaburu\\'s company Prosoya Kenya produces high fiber cereal flour fortified with vitamins. It is mixed with water and heated and then ready to eat as nutritional porridge. Initially his chief clients were hospitals, schools and orphanages, but now he is entering the retail market. Secret of success The company is only three years old and has been doubling its sales annually. Projected sales for 2017 are 4.8 billion Kenyan shillings. \"Our future plan is to get in the whole of Africa with fortified products,\" he told DW. Malnutrition is high in Africa and there is a demand for inexpensive food. Kaburu wants his son Kinoti to take over the business when he retires. Like his father, Kinoti is a banker by profession, having worked for Barclays before leaving to join his father\\'s company. In a recent inteview with local media, Kaburu senior revealed the secret of his success as an entrepreneur. You have to take care of three groups, he said, \"your products, your customers and your staff - then you are home and dry.\"',\n",

       " {'story': 'Australian stock exchange boss steps down The head of Australia\\'s stock exchange resigned Monday amid allegations of bribery at a gambling group he previously ran. Elmer Funke Kupper had been CEO of the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) since October 2011. Funke Kupper has also taken a leave of absence from the board of Tabcorp, Australia\\'s largest bookmaker, which is currently being investigated by the Australian Federal Police. The allegations center on a payment of $151,460 (134,535 euros) to the bookmaker by relatives of Cambodia\\'s Prime Minister Hen Sen. Tabcorp, a publicly listed company, had reportedly been looking to expand into the country. Funke Kupper told the media last week that he had no recollection of such a payment during his four years at the helm of Tabcorp, which said it did not pursue the expansion opportunity in Cambodia. ASX chairman Rick Holliday-Smith said the board \"accepted that Elmer wanted to direct his full focus to the investigations which may be made into the Tabcorp matter - and not have them interfere with the important role of leading the ASX\". A statement by the ASX announced that Rick Holliday-Smith will take over Funke Kupper\\'s duties until a replacement is found. AFP, ASX (hch/bea)',\n",

       " {'story': 'Photos show Earth from dark side of the moon New images published by NASA show the Earth\\'s surface from the side of the moon invisible from the planet\\'s surface. The DSCOVR satellite was set into orbit to investigate storms from space. The satellite DSCOVR took photos of the moon crossing in front of the Earth. NASA, the US space agency, has published the stunning images on Wednesday. The spacecraft snapped the pictures from the dark side of the moon from about 1.6 million kilometers (1 million miles) away in mid-July. The Earth\\'s satellite is in a synchronous rotation, meaning the same side of the moon always faces our planet. The first sighting of the lunar rear side was from the Soviet probe Luna 3 in 1959. The Earth-facing side of the moon has large, dark basaltic plains not visible on the far side. The dark side\\'s most remarkable features are the Mare Moscoviense on the upper left and the Tsiolkovskiy crater on the lower left. \"It is surprising how much brighter Earth is than the Moon,\" said Adam Szabo, DSCOVR project scientist, to NASA. \"Our planet is a truly brilliant object in dark space compared to the lunar surface.\" The US aerospace company SpaceX launched the $340 million (300 million euro) observation satellite into space in February. The operation is a joint force between SpaceX and NASA, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the US Air Force to explore weather in space and potentially harmful impact on Earth. The spacecraft will serve as an early warning system for solar storms, which are seen as auroras on Earth, but can also cause disruptions to telecommunications. \"DSCOVR\" is an abbreviation for Deep Space Climate Observatory. The mission is scheduled to last five years. kb/sms (AFP, dpa)',\n",

       " {'story': 'Love-Struck German Judge Turns Blind Eye to Justice Wearing black robes and being addressed as \"Your Honor\" apparently doesn\\'t keep people from doing really, really stupid things, as one love-struck German judge recently proved. No one can blame Wolfgang W. for falling in love. The 63-year-old Munich judge (whose full last name has been withheld for legal reasons) might have been married, but he wouldn\\'t be the first man to leave his wife for a younger woman. What does matter a little in this particular case is that W. met Fatime L. in his courtroom. The 30-year-old Albanian woman was attending the robbery trial of her lover. All that might have kept most people from going further than a friendly smile. The judge, however, pulled out his mobile phone and reportedly began sending the woman explicit text messages such as \"I\\'m kissing you awake\" and \"Alone with you in bed. I want to drag you into bed before breakfast and sleep with you.\" He might have gotten away with it all. But then W. withdrew an offer to sentence Fatime\\'s boyfriend to no more than 22 months in prison and asked her to help him decide on the man\\'s jail time. \"He should be sent away for longer so that you\\'re at peace or he should be sent to his wife, which might also help,\" the judge wrote. \"It\\'s up to you.\" That did it for Fatime, who forwarded the messages to her boyfriend\\'s defense lawyer. It shouldn\\'t come as a surprise that court officials accepted her application to remove the judge from the case. W. will have lots of time for text messaging in the future: He faces disciplinary action and charges of abuse of office, which could send him to prison for up to five years.',\n",

       " {'story': 'Fuel prices weigh heavily on German spending Retail sales in Germany fell for the fifth consecutive month in February - against expectations of a rise on the back of positive economic data. But year-on-year figures remain fine. February retail sales data for Germany showed a drop of 1.1 percent compared with the previous month, according to figures published by the federal statistics office, Destatis, on Friday. It\\'s the fifth consecutive month that saw sales drop and has surprised analysts, who had expected an increase of 1.2 percent for February in a survey carried out by Dow Jones Newswires. Annalisan Piazza, an analyst for Newedge Strategy, says the drop is only a \"sign of caution\" in the current, uncertain retail environment - rather than a \"symptom\" of German domestic demand actually \"collapsing.\" Compared with figures from February 2011, Destatis says German retail sales rose by 1.7 percent. Confidence vs. concern German consumer confidence has edged higher since the beginning of 2012, supported by a strong labor market and signs that the Germany economy is picking up speed again. But rising oil prices are \"taking their toll\" and diminishing \"spending power,\" according to Stefan Schilbe, an analyst with HSBC Trinkhaus. \"Concern over higher fuel prices will continue for a while because the Easter holidays will definitely bring higher prices again,\" he added. Christian Schulz of Berenberg Bank says sluggish retail activity can also be attributed to Germans not being \"convinced that the eurozone debt crisis is over.\" Combined with higher prices at the pump, Schulz says ongoing fears about the debt crisis will weigh heavily on people\\'s willingness to spend. According to indicators published by market research group GfK earlier this week, consumer confidence in Germany is expected to stagnate next month due to high oil prices. But it is thought that household spending will be robust enough to prevent Europe\\'s biggest economy from falling into recession. uhe/za (Reuters, AFP, dpa)',\n",

       " {'story': 'German Criminal Police Chief Warns of Possible Terrorist Attacks Islamic militants trained in Pakistan and Afghanistan are planning attacks in Germany, although there is no evidence of any imminent threat, the country\\'s top police officer was quoted as saying on Sunday. Joerg Ziercke, head of the Federal Criminal Police (BKA), told Der Tagesspiegel newspaper that more than 50 militants had traveled from Germany to training camps in Pakistan and Afghanistan run by the Taliban, al Qaeda and the Islamic Jihad Union (IJU). When asked by the German daily if it was safe for the nation to breathe easy again, Ziercke said that he was unable to sound the all clear, as Germany has repeatedly eluded catastrophe by a mere hair\\'s breadth. \"Considering the statements from al Qaeda and the IJU, we are convinced it has been decided to mount attacks in Germany,\" he said. \"However, there is currently no concrete evidence of imminent strikes.\" 900 Hezbollah supporters The interview with Ziercke came on the heels of a secret report release by the BKA saying that the Lebanese-based Hezbollah movement has the capacity to undertake damaging attacks in Germany. The German weekly Focus reported that the militia had the logistics to carry out wide-scale attacks on physical and human targets. The BKA is reported to number Hezbollah supporters in Germany at around 900. Focus pointed to the case of a 29-year-old medical student at Germany\\'s Goettingen University, who was detained in Israel last month. It reported the man was suspected of making contact with Hezbollah supporters in Germany and of having received $20,000 (13,300 euros) for espionage work. Germany untouched so far In contrast to European neighbors such as Spain or Britain, Germany has not suffered a major recent attack on its own soil. But Ziercke said German investigators had foiled seven plots, including attacks planned by three men arrested in the western Sauerland region last year who authorities believe were targeting US installations in Germany. Altogether, there are currently 200 investigations linked to Islamic terrorism being conducted by the BKA, Ziercke told Tagesspiegel, saying that the danger has therefore in no way diminished. \"A single-digit number of militants had returned to Germany from the training camps and were among around 100 suspects considered a threat,\" he said.',\n",

       " {'story': 'Europol launches pan-European counterterrorism center The EU law enforcement agency has announced the formation of a strategic center to combat terrorism in Europe. The hub is tasked with boosting intelligence-sharing among member states and tracking terrorists\\' finances. EU Migration Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos announced on Monday the creation of the European Counter Terrorism Centre (ECTC), which aims to boost cooperation among Europol member states in their fight against terrorist threats in Europe. \"The establishment of the European Counter Terrorism Centre is a major strategic opportunity for the EU to make our collective efforts to fight terrorism more effective,\" said Avramopoulos, with Dutch Justice Minister Ard van der Steur and Europol Director Rob Wainwright at a press conference announcing the center\\'s creation. Europol said that the ECTC, based in The Hague, would focus on \"tackling foreign fighters, sharing intelligence and expertise on terrorism financing, online terrorist propaganda and extremism, illegal arms trafficking and international cooperation to increase effectiveness and prevention.\" The initiative follows the Paris attacks claimed by the so-called \"Islamic State\" militant group in November, which killed at least 130 people and wounded hundreds more. The assault on the French capital prompted fears of similar attacks across the continent. Europol chief Wainwright said that some 5,000 European nationals had left to fight alongside militant groups in Syria and Iraq, warning that they posed significant threats upon returning to their countries. \"Our ambition is for the ECTC to become a central information hub in the fight against terrorism in the EU, providing analysis for ongoing investigations and contributing to a coordinated reaction in the event of major terrorist attacks,\" said Wainwright. Increased intelligence sharing among EU member states - notably France and Belgium - in the wake of November\\'s attacks led to the agency receiving 2.7 terabytes of information, \"resulting in 800 intelligence leads and more than 1,600 leads on suspicious financial transactions,\" Europol said. The law enforcement agency added that the ECTC\\'s organizational structure would mirror Europol\\'s, allowing for cooperation between counterterrorism authorities in the EU.',\n",

       " {'story': 'German investigators search for cause of deadly train crash German officials are continuing their investigation into the cause of the train collision over the weekend that killed at least 10 and left others seriously injured. Two victims were identified Monday as police continued their investigation into the cause of a train crash that killed at least 10 people in the eastern German state of Saxony-Anhalt over the weekend. The crash took place near the city of Magdeburg late Saturday when a goods trains collided head-on with a local passenger train. It is not yet clear what caused the accident, which also injured 23 people, many of them seriously. On Monday, a police spokesman said there were no new facts in the case. On Sunday, the head of the regional government, Wolfgang Böhmer, said human error was the likely cause. Unanswered questions Speaking to journalists, Böhmer said one of the trains had probably ignored a red stoplight on the section of single track where the accident occurred. \"It\\'s likely the stop signal wasn\\'t respected. It\\'s not normal that two trains were running on the same track,\" Böhmer said. However, Saxony-Anhalt Interior Minister Holger Hovelmann has warned against jumping to conclusions, and federal police official Ralf Krüger told a press conference that accident investigators had yet to reach a conclusion. \"The inquiry has been opened. The conclusion will be made public as soon as possible,\" Krüger said. \"The signal system must obviously be checked out.\" Another police spokesman had earlier said authorities were \"investigating in all directions - including human error as well as technical failure.\" He said the trains had hit each other with such force that passengers in the front carriages would have died on impact, which was reportedly heard miles away. Heavy rescue deployment The train, the HarzElbeExpress, carrying around 50 passengers, was traveling on a single track section from Magdeburg to the town of Halberstadt. Several carriages were derailed after the collision. More than 150 firemen, police and rescue workers were deployed at the scene. Traffic was interrupted on the line and bus shuttles were set up. Heavy fog prevented helicopters from airlifting the worst injured. Police weren\\'t ruling out a rise in the death toll because of the severity of the injuries. A spokesman for the Veolia group, which runs the HarzElbeExpress line, said the dead included the train driver and a conductor.

       " {'story': 'Muslim Brotherhood detainees die in Egypt prison convoy Police have cracked down on inmates en route to an Egyptian prison, according to officials. Dozens of detainees were reported dead. Authorities said police were trying to stop an escape by Muslim Brotherhood followers. An alleged prison break sparked a violent reaction from security forces, according to Egyptian media on Sunday evening. Police used force when inmates in a transfer convoy north of Cairo began rioting and attempting to escape, officials said. The official MENA news agency has reported that gunmen attempted to free prisoners during the transfer. Thirty-six Muslim Brotherhood members died in the clash, according to MENA, a figure later confirmed by police. The Interior Ministry said they had died through suffocation from tear gas as police tried to free an officer being held hostage in a van. However, one legal source told the news agency Reuters that the men had died of asphyxiationin cramped conditions during the journey. The news of violence against members of the Islamist group follows several days of police crackdowns on protesters in cities across Egypt. Supporters of ousted and detained President Mohammed Morsi have been demonstrating against the forced removal of protesters from sit-ins on Wednesday, which left more than 600 people dead. Since the crackdown began on Wednesday, some 800 people have died in clashes across Egypt. Police have arrested roughly 1,000 people in connection with this week\\'s protests, according to state media. Of those, about 250 face charges of murder, attempted murder and terrorism. Pro-Brotherhood protesters calling for the release of Morsi took to the streets of Cairo, but were prevented from gathering outside the country\\'s Constitutional Court as they had planned. Other marches took place across the country, including the central Fayyoum province and the Minya province in the south. The protests ended as a dusk-to-dawn curfew declared by the army went into force. At a gathering of military leaders on Sunday, Interim Defense Minister General Abdel-Fatah el-Sissi called for the inclusion of the former president\\'s Islamist supporters in Egypt\\'s political future. El-Sissi had led the July 3 coup that removed Mohammed Morsi from power. \"There is room for everyone in Egypt,\" el-Sissi said, according to the army\\'s official Facebook page. However, the general also cautioned that \"we will not stand by silently watching the destruction of the country and the people or the torching of the nation and terrorizing of the citizens.\" kms,rc/ch (AP, AFP, Reuters)',\n",

       " {'story': 'Mzoudi Verdict Postponed Amid New Testimony Al Qaeda is allegedly trying to assassinate Abdelghani Mzoudi, who is on trial in Germany for his suspected involvement in the Sept. 11 attacks, a witness said on Thursday. The expected verdict has now been postponed. Mzoudi had been released from jail on Dec. 11 after an anonymous witness said he was not involved in planning the attacks. A Hamburg court had been expected to announce its verdict on Thursday but in a surprising turn of events, judges agreed to hear new testimony that allegedly incriminates the 31-year-old. The new witness for the prosecution is a former Iranian intelligence agent, according to Mzoudi’s lawyers. A police officer who interrogated the man said the witness claimed to have received an e-mail in which Mzoudi is named as a member of the outside circle of the Hamburg terrorist cell around Sept. 11 hijacker Mohammed Atta. According to the police officer’s testimony, the e-mail mentioned a person, who is on trial in Germany and has been released to help law enforcement authorities in their search for further members of the terrorist cell. That’s why al Qaeda was allegedly planning to “eliminate” Mzoudi, the officer said. He added that the Iranian intelligence agent had asked for money to testify against Mzoudi. “He said he had to make a living,” the officer said. Allegedly the agent warned U.S. authorities of planned terrorist attacks prior to Sept. 11. The prosecution has asked the court to take a 30-day recess in order to evaluate the testimony. On Thursday, judges will also hear testimony from a federal prosecutor and another police officer who interrogated the man. Acquittal likely until now Mzoudi had been expected to leave the courtroom a free man after his Dec. 11 release from prison: An anonymous witness had cleared him of any involvement in planning the Sept. 11 attacks. Ramzi Binalshibh, the mastermind behind the attacks who is now in U.S. custody, is believed to be that witness. The defense has asked the court to acquit their client, while prosecutors are calling for a sentence of 15 years in prison for belonging to a terrorist organization and abetting murder in more than 3,000 cases. German authorities have said they plan to deport Mzoudi to his home country of Morocco in case of an acquittal. Mzoudi has been trying to stay in Germany, saying that he fears getting arrested in Morocco or facing extradition to the U.S.',\n",

       " {'story': 'South Africa\\'s ANC \\'must end corruption\\' to win back voters The ruling party has published a policy paper calling for an end to internal squabbles, poor governance and corruption. The report predicts that more voters will desert the party if it fails to reform. An ANC policy document released on Sunday warned that the party, which has ruled virtually unopposed since the end of apartheid in 1994, now faced \"declining fortunes.\" The paper, produced by the party\\'s leadership, blamed \"internal squabbles, money politics, corruption and poor performance in government\" adding that they had all conspired \"to undermine its legitimacy in the eyes of the broader public.\" The report also warned that the party must deliver on promises to tackle poverty, in a country where about 35 percent of the labor force is unemployed or has given up looking for work. The ANC suffered its worst-ever results in local polls last August, losing its grip on cities including Pretoria and Johannesburg, amid a slew of corruption allegations against President Jacob Zuma. The party\\'s policy chief Jeff Radebe acknowledged that the party was \"increasingly losing trust of the people.\" Win back trust \"The organization must act urgently to restore its moral character to win back the trust of the people,\" he told a meeting at the ANC\\'s Johannesburg headquarters. More than two decades after the ANC ended white-minority rule with Nelson Mandela at its helm, inequality festers in South Africa. Black people make up 80 percent of the 54 million population, yet the white minority control the lion\\'s share of the economy in terms of ownership of land and companies. The paper contained few specific policies but is to form the basis of debates at the party\\'s national conference which kicks off on June 30, party officials said. Zuma tries to shore up support Zuma called this month for the constitution to be changed so white-owned land could be redistributed to black South Africans without compensation for owners. He has also called for a public expenditure boost to fund a \"radical economic transformation,\" at the same time as his Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan is trying to tackle graft and uncontrolled spending. Zuma\\'s term as ANC leader ends at the end of the year, and a new leader will be picked at the June conference. Analysts said factional fighting over who should replace Zuma, who has governed since 2009, has seen the ANC government take its eye off much-needed policy implementation. The party\\'s constitution does not bar him from standing for a third term, but he has repeatedly said he will not. mm/jm (AFP, Reuters)',\n",

       " {'story': \"Would-be killer of Prophet Muhammad cartoonist stands trial In Denmark, the trial of a Somali man charged with the attempted murder of a cartoonist who drew caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad has begun. Last year the suspect tried to break into the cartoonist's home with an axe. The trial of a 29-year-old Somali man accused of attempting to murder a cartoonist who drew caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad is set to begin Wednesday. The charges stem from an incident in January, 2010 where the suspect tried to enter the home of cartoonist Kurt Westergaard by taking an axe to the front door. Police were quickly on the scene and shot and wounded the Somali suspect, who also faces charges of attempted terrorism, attacking a police officer and illegal arms possession. Westergaard was one of a dozen Danish cartoonists who sparked a deep controversy in Denmark in 2005 when the Jyllands-Posten newspaper published a series of cartoons depicting the Muslim Prophet Muhammad. Controversial cartoons The Muslim world was quick to protest the publication of the cartoons, especially after they were reprinted outside Denmark. Westergaard has received a number of death threats over the drawings. The Jyllands-Posten itself has been the target of violent plots as well. At the end of December, Danish and Swedish police arrested five men accused of planning a killing spree of the newspaper's staff at their offices in Copenhagen.

       " {'story': 'EU to sign off on 1-billion-euro aid pledge to Afghanistan Representatives from 70 countries are set to attend a two-day summit in Brussels to agree on a new aid package for Afghanistan. Ahead of the meeting, the EU sealed a deal to return failed Afghan asylum seekers. The two-day international aid conference in Brussels, which kicks off on Tuesday, is expected to see the EU pledge a total of 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) a year to Afghanistan until 2020. Ahead of the summit, the European Commission said it would commit an extra 200 million euros ($224 million) a year to strengthen state structures in the war-ravaged country. In a statement, the Commission said the funds could be used by the Kabul government \"to finance their own strategic development priorities.\" Dozens of other countries - including the US, Russia, China and India - are also expected to increase their aid commitment to Afghanistan, which is not able to fully support itself after four decades of conflict, and amid a resurgence of the Taliban. As well as seeking a total of 2.68 billion euros a year for the next four years, EU leaders said the meeting would also push for a realistic time frame for a peace process. That fundraising figure is lower because Afghanistan has begun raising its own revenues, but also due to so-called donor fatigue amid multiple high-profile conflicts. Deal to return failed asylum seekers Earlier Monday, the EU sealed a deal with the Afghan government to speed up the deportation of Afghan citizens who do not qualify for asylum in the bloc. Under the plan, the EU will bear the costs of returning the migrants, including travel expenses and re-integration programs, while Kabul has promised to readmit citizens and supply travel documents for migrants without papers within a month. The EU said special cases, such as single women, unaccompanied minors, the old and the sick can only be deported if they have families to return to and their safety can be guaranteed. Germany, which has accommodated more Afghan migrantsthan any other European country, signed a similar deal with the Kabul government on Sunday that will see thousands of failed asylum seekers return home. Observers said the larger EU aid package did not appear to be conditional for accepting the return of migrants. Around 1.2 million Afghans are living as refugees in their own country and another 3 million are living in Iran, Pakistan or seeking asylum in Europe. mm/cmk (AFP, dpa, Reuters)',\n",

       " {'story': 'British air traffic disrupted by computer glitch Flights in an out of London have been disrupted by a computer failure at an air traffic control center in southern England. Aviation officials, however, have said the problem has been resolved. The National Air Traffic Service, (NATS) announced on Friday evening that a technical problem, which had forced it to briefly shut down the airspace over the British capital, had been fixed and service was returning to normal. NATS also said the problem had been caused by a computer failure at its air traffic control center at Swanwick in the south of England (pictured above). \"We apologise for any delays and the inconvenience this may have caused,\" a statement posted on the NATS website said. It also advised passengers planning to fly in or out of London on Friday evening to contact their airline for the status of their flight before making their way to the airport. Heathrow Airport, which is Europe\\'s busiest air travel hub in terms of volume of passenger traffic, reported that no flights were landing or taking off while the airspace over London was shut down. Later, the flight-tracking service FlightAware reported that it had noticed some delays but few cancellations at Heathrow. Service was also briefly shut down at London\\'s other four airports, Gatwick, Stansted, London City and Luton. Airports beyond Greater London were not affected by the problem and both Manchester and Birmingham declared that they were prepared to receive diverted flights. No details of the nature of the computer failure that caused the disruption were immediately available. However, Reuters news agency citied an unnamed British government source who said it did not appear to be related to a security threat. Swanwick no stranger to computer glitches The Swanwick air traffic control center has experienced problems in the past. Last December, the night-operating system at Swanwick failed to properly switch over to daytime mode, causing delays for thousands of passengers. Computer problems at the Swanwick center also grounded scores of flights and inconvenienced thousands of travelers in incidents in 2004 and 2008. In the aftermath of the latest glitch, British Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin released a statement saying that he had demanded an explanation for what he termed \"simply unacceptable\" disruption. \"Any disruption to our aviation system is a matter of the utmost concern, especially at this time of year in the run up to the holiday season,\" he said. \"I also want to know what steps will be taken to prevent this happening again,\" he added. pfd/sms (Reuters, AP, dpa)',\n",

       " {'story': 'German man admits fathering children with stepdaughter in incest case A German man has told a court he fathered seven children with his stepdaughter. He has denied, however, charges of rape and abuse of the girl and two other children. In a case that has shocked the country, a German man admitted Tuesday to fathering seven children with his stepdaughter, but denied raping her and beating his stepson and biological daughter. The 48-year-old, identified as Detlef S., stands accused of raping and brutally abusing the stepdaughter and of abusing the stepson and biological daughter. He faces 350 counts of sexual assault and grievous sexual assault of minors over a period of more than two decades. According to the official charge sheet, the man is accused of first sexually abusing his biological daughter, now in her 20s, when she was nine years old and of abusing her from the age of 12. Public prosecutor Thorsten Kahl said Detlef S. used to beat the three children, and he is also accused of prostituting the daughter and stepdaughter for financial gain. \"I hope he gets the right sentence and that he can never hurt anyone again,\" his stepdaughter told reporters as the trial opened. \\'The German Fritzl\\' In a statement read by his lawyer to a court in the western city of Koblenz, Detlef S. admitted to being the father of the stepdaughter\\'s children, but \"denied the charges made against him.\" Detlef S. faces 15 years behind bars if found guilty. A verdict is expected on February 25. The German media have likened the case to that of Austrian Josef Fritzl, who was sentenced to life in prison in 2009 for holding his daughter in a cramped dungeon for 24 years as a sex slave and fathering seven children with her.

       " {'story': 'Germany\\'s DFB admits 2005 FIFA payment, denies World Cup link The German Football Federation (DFB) has said a payment it made to FIFA had nothing to do with the awarding of the 2006 World Cup to Germany. News magazine Der Spiegel claims a slush fund was used to secure votes. Football\\'s German governing body said on Friday it had found no \"irregularities\" in the awarding of football\\'s showpiece event to Germany. \"Furthermore, there is no evidence that any of the delegates\\' votes were won illegally at any stage in the application process,\" a DFB statement said. However, the DFB said it had become aware of a 6.7 million euro payment - brought to light by an internal investigation. The sum was paid to FIFA in April 2005 from the organizational committee preparing the event in Germany. \"This payment was in no way linked to the awarding of the 2006 World Cup, which had been decided 5 years previously,\" said the statement, albeit acknowleding that the money might not have been used as intended. According to the DPA news agency, FIFA has said it will investigate the possible improper use of the payment. Swiss prosecutors are currently investigating accusations in the selection of Russia and Qatar as the venues for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. Delegates \\'bought off\\' News magazine Der Spiegel reported on Friday that the bid committee had set up a slush fund of 10.3 million Swiss francs ($10.8 million) to help it land the event. A report on the magazine\\'s website on Friday said the money was used to secure the votes of four Asian FIFA delegates who were involved in awarding the World Cup. Der Spiegel said the money had come from Adidas boss Robert Louis-Dreyfus as a secret private donation. The magazine said the bid committee chief Franz Beckenbauer and the current DFB president Wolfgang Niersbach were aware that there was a fund. Germany narrowly pipped South Africa by 12 votes to 11 in the vote by the FIFA executive committee in 2009. Oceania\\'s Charles Dempsey abstained from the ballot and said there had been huge pressure on him from undisclosed parties. Niersabach famously said in a German TV interview a few months ago that he did not know how Germany had won enough votes to tip the scales. The sum was said to have been sent to FIFA for a cultural event. In the end, that event was cancelled. The DFB has said it will look into a possible claim to potential repayment. FIFA, meanwhile, said it had forwarded the case to its audit and compliance commission. rc/msh (dpa, Reuters)',\n",

       " {'story': \"Lufthansa closes in on Austrian Airlines takeover More than 85 percent of Austrian Airlines shareholders have reportedly accepted a public takeover offer by Germany's Lufthansa. But rival airlines continue to object to the move as being unfair. Lufthansa has cleared an important hurdle in its bid to take over cash-strapped Austrian Airlines. Lufthansa holds well over the 75 percent of shares in the company, according to Austrian Airlines (AUA). Shares of AUA rose by more than 12 percent to 4.19 euros ($5.70) after Tuesday's announcement. Austrian Airlines said exact acceptance figures would be made public on Thursday. Lufthansa shares dropped 3 percent on the announcement before recovering to end the day down by one percent. At the end of last year, Lufthansa agreed to buy a 41.6-percent stake in AUA from the Austrian government for 366,000 euros. In exchange, Vienna agreed to assume 500 million euros of the struggling airline's debt. The European Commission opened an investigation after rival airlines complained about Austria's agreement with Lufthansa. The commission is scheduled to rule on the issue by June 17. Lufthansa is reportedly also interested in raising its stake in the British airline BMI to 80 percent this year.\",\n",

       " {'story': 'US and UK create huge new safe havens for marine life Extensive new marine protected areas are being established by nations around the world, particularly the United States and the United Kingdom. The announcements came at the Our Oceans conference in Washington, D.C. More than 20 countries including Lebanon, Cambodia, Malaysia and the Seychelles have announced 40 new marine protected areas and expansions of existing ones, during the two-day Our Oceans conference currently being held in Washington, D.C. Among them were the United States and the United Kingdom, which both announced extensive new MPAs today. US President Barack Obama addressed the conference, saying, \"The notion that the ocean I grew up with is not something that I can pass on to my kids and my grandkids is unacceptable. It\\'s unimaginable.” He added, “the investment that all of us together make here today is vital for our economy, it is vital for our foreign policy, it\\'s vital for our national security, but it\\'s also vital for our spirit. It\\'s vital to who we are.\" Last month, Obama expanded the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument off the coast of Hawaii by more than 1,140,000 square kilometers, creating the world’s largest marine protected area. Today, he designated the first marine national monument in the Atlantic Ocean. The Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument is an area of 12,700 square kilometers off the coast of New England. It encompasses underwater mountains and canyons and is intended to protect marine species, including endangered whales, sea turtles and deep-sea coral. Britain\\'s pledge was even more impressive. At the conference, Sir Alan Duncan, the UK\\'s Minister of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, announced that Britain would be creating MPAs around four islands in its overseas territories in the Pacific and Atlantic, totaling almost 6.5 million square kilometers. The biggest of these MPAs surrounds Pitcairn Island, where the legendary mutineers of the Bounty once settled. In his speech, Duncan made light of the fact that at 840,000 square kilometers it will be smaller than the new record-holder in the U.S. \"Well, this was going to have been my big moment, because until last week the Pitcairn MPA would have been the largest in the world,\" he told the conference. \"But President Obama sort of rather blew that out of the water by announcing an even bigger MPA in Hawaii – trust the Yanks to indulge in a bit of one-upmanship over us poor Brits.

       " {'story': 'Amos Oz Receives German Literary Prize in Dusseldorf Israeli author Amos Oz was presented with a top German award for his political and literary work on Saturday, Dec. 13. Oz, 69, was honored by the city of Dusseldorf with the Heinrich Heine Prize on the 211st anniversary of the 19th century German poet\\'s birth. The award, worth 50,000 euros ($66,000), has been presented every two years since 1972 to personalities who share Heine\\'s values of tolerance, human rights and mutual understanding of peoples. The jury said it chose to honor Oz for his \"literary quality, political sensibility, his humanitarian engagement and his bold clarity and determination in trying to build bridges between Israelis and Palestinians.\" Oz, who was born in Jerusalem in 1939, is one of Israel\\'s best-known authors and political voices. He is a co-founder of the Israeli peace movement and a prominent champion of Palestinian rights. In his acceptance speech, Oz said the Arab-Israeli conflict could only be resolved in the context of European values of tolerance, rationality and pragmatism. However, it \"is being kept alive by fanatics on both sides.\" Having fought in the Six-Day War and Yom Kippur War, Oz has said he does not regret his participation. But in his acceptance speech, he added that he has always drawn \"a very clear line between wars that deal with survival and wars that deal with interests.\" Last month, Oz joined other Israeli intellectuals and dovish politicians to establish a new political party that aims to unite the Israeli peace camp. A former professor of literature at Ben-Gurion University, he won the Israel Prize for literature in 1998, the Goethe Prize in 2005 and Spain\\'s Prince of Asturias Prize in 2007. Among his best known works are \"A Tale of Love and Darkness,\" which appeared in 2003, \"Don\\'t Call It Night,\" published in 1994, and \"Rhyming Life and Death,\" from 2007.',\n",

       " {'story': 'Nigeria declares state of emergency Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan has announced a state of emergency in the country\\'s northeast. He said the government would do everything to put an end to the terrorist attacks. Nigeria put its northeast states of Borno, Yobe and Adamawa under a state of emergency amid an increase of terrorist activity from the Islamist insurgent group Boko Haram in recent weeks. \"These actions amount to a declaration of war and a deliberate attempt to undermine the authority of the Nigerian state and threaten [its] territorial integrity,\" said President Jonathan in a live broadcast Tuesday night. \"As a responsible government, we will not tolerate this.\" The president said the terrorist activities were a \"threat to [Nigeria\\'s] national unity\" and a \"systematic effort\" to destabilize the country. Jonathan ordered troops to help stem the insurgency in the country\\'s northeast where some towns have reportedly fallen under the control of Boko Haram. The state politicians will retain the powers of the offices they hold despite the military deployment to the region. Boko Haram, whose name means, \"Western education is sacrilege,\" in the Hausa language has been calling for shariah law to be imposed across Nigeria. Muslims comprise about half of Nigeria\\'s population of 175 million. About 40 percent of its citizens are Christian. Since launching their insurgency against the central government in 2010, Boko Haram and splinter groups have staged numerous terrorist attacks on security forces and civilians, in which at least 1,600 people were killed. Late last week, 200 heavily armed gunmen staged a coordinated attack on a police station and prison in Borno state in a bid to free inmates. At least 55 people died in the siege. kms/msh (AP, AFP, Reuters, dpa)',\n",

       " {'story': 'Germany: Fire breaks out near train tracks in Siegburg, injuring dozens Dozens of people were injured after a fire broke out near railroad tracks in the drought-hit town of Siegburg. Dry conditions helped the blaze spread quickly to nearby houses, with firefighters facing a \"wall of fire.\" Hundreds of firefighters battled for hours on Tuesday to contain a fire that broke out in the western German town of Siegburg, located near the city of Bonn. The fire started in a grassy area near a key railway route, quickly spreading to nearby houses and shutting down rail traffic for several hours. Dozens injured in blaze: At least 28 people were injured in the fire, three of whom were in a serious condition, according to local officials. Among the injured were 20 local residents, three firefighters and five police officers. Over 520 firefighters took part in the operation, with emergency crews using a police water cannon vehicle and a helicopter to control the blaze. Nine houses were severely damaged, with pictures showing some attics caved in. Crews faced \\'a wall of fire\\' The fire broke out near the train tracks in Siegburg, quickly spreading up a bone-dry, grassy embankment towards nearby houses. \"The first responders were basically faced with a wall of fire,\" one fire department spokesperson told news agency dpa. Investigations into the cause of the fire are still ongoing. Local officials earlier said they suspected that sparks from a train traveling on the tracks may have started the blaze, but later emphasized that other factors could have caused the fire. Train traffic halted: A high-traffic train track runs through Siegburg, servicing a busy, high-speed ICE train line that runs from the city of Cologne to Frankfurt. German rail company Deutsche Bahn told travelers in a statement that delays on the Cologne-Frankfurt route could last into Wednesday. Fire aided by drought conditions: An ongoing heat wave and drought in Germany and other areas of Europe contributed to the spread of the massive fire. The heat has hit farmers particularly hard, with numerous crops damaged and poor harvests expected. Temperatures reached 39 degrees Celsius (102 degrees Fahrenheit) in Siegburg on Tuesday with the area seeing little to no rainfall in weeks. \"When it\\'s 39 degrees, these things can spread quickly,\" a fire department spokesperson said. rs/aw (AFP, dpa)',\n",

       " {'story': 'Europa League finalist Dnipro among three clubs handed European ban Having defied all odds to reach the Europa League final last year, Ukrainian side Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk have now been banned from European competition over financial violations. Last year\\'s Europa League finalist Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk of Ukraine has been named among three clubs banned from European competition by UEFA over financial issues. UEFA announced on Thursday that Dnipro, Azerbaijan\\'s Inter Baku and Romania\\'s Targu Mures would be excluded from the next European competition for which they qualify in the next three seasons. All three clubs had been ordered by UEFA to clear \"overdue payables\" and told they would be excluded from Europe unless they cleared those debts by January 31. \"I did not imagine this could have happened to the club that was playing in the Europa League final half a year ago,\" Dnipro head coach Myron Markevych, whose side knocked out Ajax and Napoli on route to the Europa League final last year, which they lost 3-2 to Sevilla, told the “Segodnya” newspaper. \"How could it happen? I am not aware of the president\\'s plans and how he sees the future of the club. We\\'ve got new debts. I know the foreign players are making new complaints. We have not been paid for four months at all. \"This is very bad for us,\" Markevych added. \"We have been playing on the European stage for 10 years and now we have been kicked off for something which is not the fault of the players and coaches.” UEFA gave no statement on another Romanian club, Astra Giurgiu, which had been given the same January 31 deadline.',\n",

       " {'story': 'German Gymnastics Team Gets Boost from 33-Year-Old Medalist At her fifth Olympic Games in Beijing, 33-year-old gymnast Oksana Chusovitina finally claimed an individual medal. It\\'s her story of determination and heartache that has won the hearts of viewers around the world. Oksana Chusovitina is one of a kind. Not only is she the oldest woman in over half a century to win an Olympic medal in gymnastics, she\\'s been competing for nearly two decades already -- that\\'s longer than many of her teammates have been alive. And she\\'s competed in five Olympic Games under three flags. In 1992, just after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, she joined the unified ex-Soviet squad and in 1996, 2000 and 2004 she competed for her home country Uzbekistan, where she had already become something of a national hero. But this year, after claiming German citizenship in 2006, she is a member of the German team. Germany has traditionally not been shown particular strength in gymnastics and Chusovitina\\'s silver on Sunday in vault was Germany\\'s first Olympic medal in gymnastics in 20 years -- a much needed boost to the team. Son\\'s illness shaped gymnast\\'s path Chusovitina began her Olympic career in 1992 with a team gold in Barcelona. Besides coming up dry after that in Atlanta, Sydney and Athens, the 16-year quest for an individual medal was a rough one for the Uzbek athlete. In 2002, Chusovitina\\'s son Alisher, then three years old, was diagnosed with leukemia. Since she already had close ties to the gymnastics team in Cologne, where she had competed in the German national league, she moved to Germany with her husband Bakhodir Kurpanov, a former successful wrestler, and their son. In Cologne, Chusovitina was able to train with the German team and seek medical attention for Alisher. She competed like mad in the years that followed, using her prize money to cover medical bills. Claiming German citizenship in 2006 allowed the gymnast and her family to stay in Germany for Alisher\\'s follow-up examinations -- and it allowed her to strive for a fifth Games. Chusovitina hadn\\'t abandoned her hopes for an individual. Ready for London in 2012 And Sunday\\'s silver shows that, in a sport dominated by teenage prodigies, she has only improved with age. \"I don\\'t feel 33, I feel 18,\" said Chusovitina. \"This medal is for my son. I can\\'t say how happy I am.\" And she\\'s not thinking about retirement. Instead, she\\'s got the 2012 London Games on her mind. \"By then I\\'ll be 37; if I can I\\'ll do a sixth Olympics,\" she said.',\n",

       " {'story': 'New clashes erupt between Armenia, Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh Clashes between Azerbaijani and Armenian forces have killed at least 13 people in a third day of fighting over Nagorno-Karabakh. Turkey is backing Baku as the worst violence in decades hits the disputed territory. US Secretary of State John Kerry spoke to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov Monday to review efforts to stop the violence that has broken out along the Nagorno-Karabakh line of conflict and how to get Armenia and Azerbaijan to resume talks. Russia and the West have scrambled to call for an end to the fighting. But Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan - a staunch ally of Azerbaijan - insisted that the Armenian-controlled region was rightfully part of Azerbaijan. \"Karabakh will one day return to its original owner. It will be Azerbaijan\\'s,\" Erdogan said in televised remarks. Separatist authorities in Karabakh - which claim independence but are supported by Armenia - said three civilians and two more soldiers were killed in fierce shelling. And Azerbaijan said three of its troops were killed overnight when Armenian forces shelled its positions using mortars and grenade launchers. This comes as Armenia warns of a wider war against its neighbor. \"A further escalation of military actions could lead to unpredictable and irreversible effects, up to a widespread war,\" Armenian President Serzh Sargsyan said at a meeting with an envoy of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Interfax news agency reported. \"This will naturally affect the security and stability of not only the South Caucasus but also Europe,\" Sargsyan was quoted as saying. In an apparent reference to Erdogan\\'s bullish statements, the Russian foreign ministry said: \"Lavrov and Kerry condemned attempts by certain external players to instigate confrontation around Karabakh.\" Decades of conflict in region Ethnic Armenian separatists backed by Armenia seized control of mountainous Nagorno-Karabakh - a majority ethnic Armenian region - during the twilight days of the Soviet Union. The foes have never signed a peace deal despite the 1994 ceasefire and some 30,000 people have lost their lives in the conflict.

       " {'story': 'Only 4 of Germany\\'s 128 Eurofighter jets combat ready — report The report is the latest to cast doubt on Germany\\'s military capabilities and readiness. It raises questions of whether Germany is really meeting its NATO commitments.  Only a handful of the German Air Force\\'s Eurofighter jets are combat ready, according to a report in the magazine Der Spiegel published Wednesday. Due to a technical problem with the defense system of the combat aircraft only 10 of the Luftwaffe\\'s 128 Eurofighters are mission ready, according to the report. The problem stems from a cooling liquid leak in the aircraft\\'s wing pod sensors, which are used to recognize hostile jets or incoming attacks. Without the defense system the Eurofighter jets are not combat ready. The shortage of aircraft means that Germany is unable to fulfill its NATO obligations to have 82 combat ready jets for crisis situations. Read more: How does Germany contribute to NATO? The wing pod issue is only one problem facing the Luftwaffe. Der Spiegel reported that there are only enough missiles to make only four Eurofigher jets ready for combat. The German military confirmed to Der Spiegel the technical problems with the Eurofighter, but would not comment on the number of combat-ready aircraft, given that this information is classified. The revelation in Der Spiegel is the latest report to cast doubt on Germany\\'s military readiness and capabilities. Read more: German military short on tanks for NATO mission Germany\\'s lack of military readiness \\'dramatic,\\' says Bundeswehr commissioner Accounting tricks In a Bundeswehr document provided to the German parliament last year, the military classified 39 of 128 jets as combat ready. A Bundeswehr spokesperson told Der Spiegel that the \"daily actual availability\" of the Eurofighter right now is better than last year. However, Der Spiegel said that the military appeared to count any Eurofighter that can fly as ready, even if they are only available for training or maneuvers without missiles or defense systems. \"These jets are barred from participating in real deployments, such as air patrols in the eastern flank of NATO,\" Der Spiegel wrote.

       " {'story': 'China\\'s new Silk Road summit opens with major funding vision Announcing billions of yuan in financing, China\\'s president has promised to assist countries along the new Silk Road. The ambitious \"One Belt, One Road\" initiative aims to expand links between Asia, Europe and Africa. Chinese President Xi Jinping on Sunday announced that Beijing will lend 380 billion yuan (50.37 billion euros, $55.09 billion) to support cooperation on its ambitious \"One Belt, One Road\" initiative to expand links between Asia, Africa and Europe. \"We should build an open platform of cooperation and uphold and grow an open world economy,\" said Xi during the opening of the two-day summit on the new Silk Road. \"We should jointly create an environment that will facilitate opening up and development - establish a fair, equitable and transparent system of international trade and investment rules,\" the Chinese president added. Xi said that Beijing will also contribute an additional 100 billion yuan to the Silk Road Fund, which aims to bankroll the country\\'s plans to build the infrastructure network for improved intercontinental trade. The attendees included Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni, Russian President Vladimir Putin and UN chief Antonio Guterres. Putin said at the conference that protectionism is a threat to the global economy amid a resurgence of isolationist rhetoric on the international stage. North Korea\\'s shadow Despite the notable absence of Western leaders at China\\'s biggest diplomatic event this year, Xi said all countries are welcome to cooperate on the project. The US embassy in Beijing expressed concern to China for its decision to invite North Korea, which has escalated tensions in the region through multiple missile test-launches since US President Donald Trump assumed office in January. However, China\\'s foreign ministry said in a statement that it did \"not understand the situation.\" \"The Belt and Road initiative is an open and inclusive one. We welcome all countries\\' delegations to attend the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation,\" the foreign ministry said. Earlier on Sunday, North Korea launched a test missile believed to be a new model. The test launch prompted outrage from South Korea and Japan, saying it violated numerous UN resolutions and undermined international security. ls/rc (Reuters, AP, AFP, dpa)',\n",

       " {'story': 'Scientists grow early-stage human eggs in lab to full maturity British and US scientists have developed eggs from an early stage to full maturity in a lab for the first time. The technique could offer cancer patients a promising new type of fertility treatment. Scientists have succeeded in growing early-stage human egg cells to full maturity in a laboratory for the first time, according to a study released on Friday. The findings, which were published in the journal Molecular Human Reproduction, could be used to create new fertility treatments in the future. The work by researchers at the University of Edinburgh and the Center for Human Reproduction took ovarian tissue and matured it to the point at which it could be fertilized. Previous studies had created live offspring from mice eggs matured in a laboratory and developed late-stage human eggs to a later stage of maturity. Potential breakthrough Women who undergo chemotherapy for cancer treatment, which can cause sterility, stand to benefit the most if scientists are able to perfect the new technique. Patients can currently opt to have ovarian tissue removed before therapy to be re-implanted afterwards. But the procedure is risky because the re-implanted tissue can cause a new outbreak of cancer. But with the new technique, eggs could be frozen ahead of the treatment and later matured in a laboratory to the point at which they could be fertilized. More work needed Scientists who were not part of the study welcomed the findings, but cautioned that fertility patients would have to wait for new treatments. \"This is an elegant piece of work,\" Channa Jayasena of the Imperial College London told AFP news agency, yet he added: \"It would take several years to translate this [technique] into a therapy.\" \"Much more work is needed to make sure that the technique is safe and optimized before we ascertain whether these eggs … can be fertilized,\" Ali Abbara, also from Imperial College London, told Reuters news agency.

       " {'story': 'Rights body accuses Mexican police of arbitrary executions Mexico\\'s National Human Rights Commission has said police massacred 22 civilians in the western state of Michoacan last year. Police say they acted in self defense, and that the killings were not arbitrary executions. The National Human Rights Commission (CNDH) on Thursday said the police had committed \"violations of the right to life by excessive use of force that entailed the arbitrary execution of 22 civilians.\" Officers were also said to have been guilty of \"aggravated acts of torture on two people who were detained.\" At least 42 people suspected of being Jalisco New Generation Cartel gang members were killed, while only one police officer died in the raid on a ranch near the small town of Tanhuato. The CNDH said police had lied about their role during the incident, where they shifted 7 bodies and planted weapons on some of them. It was unclear how or why another 15 of those who died had been killed. \"As a result of the investigation done by this organization, based on technical and scientific tests ... we established facts that imply grave human rights violations attributable to public servants of the federal police,\" said Raul Gonzalez, the president of the CNDH. Killings \\'in self defense\\' The findings would appear to contradict the government\\'s claim that 42 people who were killed had attacked officers. A Black Hawk helicopter was employed to \"contain the suspects.\" The Mexican federal police, army and navy have repeatedly been accused of abuses in a drug conflict that has claimed more than 100,000 lives since it began in 2006. Mexico\\'s national security commissioner Renato Sales denied that police had carried out arbitrary killings and executions, and said the investigation was continuing. He urged Congress to pass laws on when security forces can fire weapons. \"In our view, the use of arms was necessary and proportional to the very real, imminent and lawless aggression,\" he said. \"They acted in legitimate defense.\" rc/kl (AP AFP, Reuters)',\n",

       " {'story': 'Documentary on anti-Semitism in Europe to be screened, despite controversy  German-French public broadcaster Arte received criticism for deciding not to show the film. Then, Germany\\'s largest tabloid made it available online. Now, the documentary will be screened on TV. On Wednesday, the documentary titled \"Chosen and Excluded - Jew Hatred in Europe\" will be shown on German television. On June 21, the film will be broadcast at 10:15 pm on the public channel ARD. The documentary about discrimination against Jews in Europe was commissioned by the German-French broadcaster Arte. After an editor accepted the film and the filmmakers Sophie Hafner and Joachim Schroeder received their fee, Arte refused to screen the film. The reason, said the broadcaster, was that the subject matter did not correspond to the project as it was initially described. Instead of focusing on growing anti-Semitism in Europe, the film focused instead on the Middle East. The editorial offices were \"deliberately left in the dark\" about the changes until immediately before the film was delivered, according to Arte. Additionally, there were \"concerns\" related to the film\\'s \"craftsmanship.\" Allegations and accusations without confrontation For this reason, the station WDR, which commissioned the film with Arte, investigated the documentary\\'s content. In the opinion of the review team, it contains facts which are not sufficiently substantiated with supporting documentation. Furthermore, there were allegations against individuals in the film who were then not given the opportunity to comment. Allowing comment is considered standard journalistic practice. However, the documentary will be screened regardless and viewers will be able to make up their own minds about the content. In order to allow different positions to be heard, the station has planned a discussion panel, which will air after the documentary is broadcast. Criticism against public broadcasters Arte and WDR\\'s approach to the issue has caused a stir. The president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, Josef Schuster, said in a letter to the stations he was surprised that the documentary would not be screened as planned. Historians such as Michael Wolffsohn and Götz Aly praised the film. Aly even accused the Arte program director of censorship. On June 13, Germany\\'s largest tabloid \"Bild\" put the documentary online for 24 hours. According to the publication\\'s own data, it received around 200,000 clicks. ld/sh/als (epd, dpa)',\n",

Obama\\'s announcement came ahead of a global climate summit in Paris. In a series of statements on Twitter, the European Union\\'s commissioner for climate action and energy, Miguel Arias Canete, praised the Clean Power Plan, which had been announced by US President Barack Obama on Monday. Canete (pictured) called the plan \"a positive step forward\" in efforts by the US - the world\\'s second-biggest carbon polluter after China - to cut down on its emissions. UN leaders are due to gather in the French capital in four months time for a climate conference (COP21) with the aim of agreeing on measures to limit global temperature increases to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit). The vast majority of scientists accept that climate change caused by human\\'s creation of greenhouse gases is a grave threat to life on Earth. Obama\\'s plan marked the first time power plants in the US have been targeted by mandatory regulations on carbon dioxide emissions. The measures force power plant owners to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 32 percent by 2030, compared to 2005 levels. \"We\\'re the first generation to feel the impact of climate change and the last generation that can do something about it,\" Obama told a gathering of supporters at the White House. Member states of the European Union, which is the world\\'s third largest carbon emitter, have already agreed to cut emissions by 40 percent from 1990 levels by the year 2030. se/sms (AFP, dpa, Reuters)',\n",

This is what DW journalists Nina Haase-Trobridge and Sumi Somaskanda want to find out ahead of the nation’s parliamentary elections. #Germany Decides - the banner under which a team of reporters from Deutsche Welle is driving across the republic this summer and before the country votes for a new parliament in autumn. The reportage aims to chart the country’s mood and answer our international audience’s question: \"What really concerns the German voter?\" September 24, 2017 sees elections to the 19th German Bundestag. Current incumbent Chancellor Angela Merkel is running for a fourth time, this year against the Social Democrats\\' candidate Martin Schulz. Many observers feel German society is becoming increasing polarized. Merkel\\'s refugee policy has drawn sustained attack from the right. One party, the \"Alternative for Germany\" (AfD), has gained significant traction out of it’s anti-islamist stance. Narrowly missing entry into the Bundestag in 2013, will it make it this time? DW journalists Sumi Somaskanda and Nina Haase-Trobridge set off on a journey across the republic. They go to Dresden, city of anti-immigrant rallies, to gauge the strength of right-wing populism. They move on through the Czech Republic to Wegscheid on the German-Austrian border, where thousands of refugees poured into Germany every day in the autumn of 2015. What’s it like in the small border community now? The DW team meets Mayor Josef Lamperstorfer, who expressed his scorn for Germany’s politicians in scathing a letter about the humanitarian disaster. How welcome are refugees now? How fairly are they treated in Germany? How stable will the German economy be in the future? Nina Haase-Trobridge and Sumi Somaskanda want to find out how the people of this Republic are getting on. They meet young right-wingers, managers, politicians as well as the politically disillusioned.

The video was produced by French TV program Le Petit Journal. A video produced by Le Petit Journal of French cable television channel Canal + showed a French father and his child discussing the circumstances of \"Islamic State\"-claimed attacks in Paris, that left at least 129 people dead. In the video, a Le Petit Journal reporter asks the child if he understood why the attacks occurred. \"Do you understand what happened? Do you understand why those people did that?\" the reporter asked. \"Yes, because they\\'re really, really mean. Bad guys are not very nice,\" the child responds to the reporter. However, the child\\'s father later intervenes, responding to his son\\'s statement that they could be shot, saying: \"They might have guns, but we have flowers.\" The father then offers an overview of how flowers and candles \"protect\" people from guns. \"The flowers and the candles are here to protect us,\" the child said, confirming his father\\'s statement. The video went viral following its online release on Monday, garnering more than 80,000 views in less than 24 hours. ls/kms (LPJ, Canal +)',\n",

       " {'story': 'China criticizes EU solar dumping probe The EU has decided to investigate allegations that Chinese solar firms are dumping their wares in Europe. China has promptly articulated its opposition to the move. China expressed its “deep regret” on Thursday over the European Commission\\'s decision to look into allegations that Chinese producers are guilty of solar panel dumping. Chinese Ministry of Commerce spokesman Shen Danyang passed comment after Brussels announced on Wednesday that the Commission would investigate the issue following complaints from European solar companies. \"China expresses deep regret\" about the move, Shen said in a statement published on the ministry\\'s website. \"Restricting China\\'s solar panel products will not only hurt the interests of both Chinese and European industry, it will also wreck the healthy development of the global solar and clean energy sector,\" said Shen, who called for negotiations to solve the dispute. A group of 25 European solar companies, including Germany\\'s SolarWorld, first filed an anti-dumping complaint against China to the European Commission in July. They accuse their Chinese competitors, which receive subsidies worth billions from the Chinese government, of flooding the market with basement-price products. European solar companies are also heavily subsidized at home. Major Chinese companies in the solar panel industry, such as Yingli, Suntech, Trina and Canadian Solar had responded to the complaint by threatening a trade war. The conflict between the two sides was also a topic of conversation during German Chancellor Angela Merkel\\'s visit to Beijing last week. China then called for negotiations in lieu of anti-dumping proceedings.

       " {'story': 'German Cup preview: Bayern set to beat Stuttgart Bayern Munich is set to crown a spectacular season by bagging a third title in addition to their Bundesliga and Champions League wins. They face Stuttgart in Berlin for the final of the German Cup. \"It is more than a trophy we can win. We can write history,\" said Bayern midfielder Thomas Müller. It\\'s true: no German team has ever managed to win the Bundesliga, the German Cup and the Champions League in one season. Bayern are one win away from becoming the first. Bayern are going into the Cup final as the clear favorites, even though they have to do without their Brazilian defender Dante and midfielder Luis Gustavo, who have been called to play for their national team this week. But Stuttgart is not planning to let Bayern have free reign of the pitch. Coach Bruno Labbadia\\'s team has played a disappointing season, ending up in twelfth place. But now they are set to clinch a Europa League spot simply by having reached the final. It has been 16 years since Stuttgart last won the German Cup, but coach Labbadia is optimistic. \"We have our own talents which we can use cleverly against Bayern,\" said the 47-year-old Labbadia, who has been on contract with Stuttgart since 2010 and has quite a bit to show for: He fought off relegation twice and managed to get Stuttgart into the Europa League for two seasons. Coaches eye the same prize As a player with Kaiserslautern, Labbadia won the German Cup in 1990, and as a coach with Leverkusen he reached the final in 2009 – and lost. In that respect he and Bayern\\'s Jupp Heynckes are on the same level: Heynckes has also only won the Cup as a player – 1973 with Mönchengladbach – but never as a coach. Both teams stand to gain financially. Champions League and Bundesliga winners Bayern Munich have already made 9 million euros (11.7 million) in marketing fees for the three live matches they have played this season in the Cup competition. Only one of Stuttgart\\'s matches was broadcast live so far, but that still gave them 3,7 million euros. There is still more money to come from the marketing of TV rights, advertising, and last but not least, ticket sales. Both teams get a bonus of two million euros for having reached the final – and the winner receives 300,000 euros on top of that.',\n",

       " {'story': 'Romania\\'s shaky coalition government collapses Romania\\'s center-left coalition government has collapsed after a group of Social Democrat ministers resigned in protest over the firing of the country\\'s interior minister. After months of an uneasy cohabitation with its centrist Liberal Democrat (PDL) partners, left-leaning Social Democratic Party (PSD) leader Mircea Geoana said on Thursday that nine ministers from his party had quit the government \"in solidarity\" with Interior Minister, Dan Nica. The move ends the shaky nine-month tenure of a coalition consumed by bickering and corruption allegations just before presidential elections scheduled for November 22. Nica was fired by Prime Minister Emil Boc on Monday over comments he made about potential fraud in the run-up to the November poll. Nica\\'s comments were widely interpreted as an accusation that Boc\\'s Liberal Democrats might try to cheat to get President Traian Basescu re-elected. As an interim solution, Nica was replaced by Development Minister Vasile Blaga, who is the PDL campaign chief and a close ally of Basescu. Geoana has blamed the president for the crisis, saying \"nothing was sacred\" to him to ensure he wins another term in office. Coalition had a whole laundry list of problems Divisions between the PDL and PSD have festered since the beginning of the year after the Social Democrats accused President Basescu of interfering in the government decision-making process. Also in January, the PSD\\'s interior minister, Gabriel Oprea, resigned in a dispute over the appointment of an intelligence officer considered too close to the coalition partners. In February, the newly appointed Liviu Dragnea quit the same post, citing insufficient funds allocated to his ministry. In September, Prime Minister Boc threatened to fire the leftist education minister unless she withdrew a controversial decision to allow political appointments in the education sector. Boc said the decision contradicted principles of newly adopted IMF-mandated legislation to reform the country\\'s ailing education system. At the same time, the Social Democrats slammed massive job cuts planned by the government as part of a 20-billion-euro ($29 billion) IMF aid package, saying it would oppose the implementation of such a move. PSD support for parliamentary inquiries investigating PDL ministers Monica Iacob-Ridzi for fraud and Elena Udrea for abuse of power prompted the centrists to ask the PSD whether they wanted to be in government or in the opposition. As it stands now, with the presidential election in November, voters will have the option of sending a signal on which party should do what. gb/dpa/AFP/Reuters/AP Editor: Michael Lawton',\n",

The Norwegian parliament\\'s finance committee announced on Thursday that it intends to divest the country\\'s sovereign wealth fund from the coal industry. Environmental groups have welcomed the Norwegian parliament\\'s decision, saying it shows how lawmakers have responded to public pressure in the global fight against climate change. \"This is very important and will send a very strong signal to coal burning and mining companies all over the world,\" Truls Gulowsen, head of Greenpeace Norway told DW. \"The fund is one of the world\\'s top 10 largest investors in the global coal industry, so this will have a real impact.\" Greenpeace estimates that new regulations would result in around $5 billion (4.6 billion euros) being pulled out of the coal sector. The move has cross-party support, and parliament is set to confirm the decision June 5. \"This is a clear signal to those who use coal that they have to look at other forms of energy,\" Hans Olav Syversen of the Christian Democrats told public broadcaster NRK. The 900 billion euro fund will no longer invest in firms where coal-fired energy accounts for 30 percent or more of their turnover or profit. \"The 30 percent level is a practical and sound approach that others around the world will be able to follow,\" Gulowsen said. Earlier this week, environmental groups delivered a petition with 44,000 signatures urging the Norwegian government to divest from fossil fuels. A recent report co-authored by Greenpeace said that previous moves to withdraw some of the sovereign wealth fund\\'s investment from fossil fuel industry were inadequate, calling them \"pretend divestment.\" Gulowsen told DW that politicians had responded to those criticisms, and that the new decision represented a major step forward. However, he added that Greenpeace and others were calling for a second criteria for divestment, by volume of coal - saying that the fund would still invest in the world\\'s three largest private coal-mining firms. Each of these extracts more than 100 million tons of coal annually, because they are also involved in other mining activities. \"We hope that these miners will also be excluded down the line,\" Gulowsen said. Activists say the global campaign to divest from fossil fuels is gaining momentum, with ever more pension funds, charities, faith groups and universities pulling out of companies that contribute to carbon emissions.',\n",

       " {'story': 'Poland and Industry 4.0 in the spotlight of Hanover industry fair German chancellor Angela Merkel has opened the world\\'s biggest industrial fair. Poland is the partner nation of the fair that also seeks to allay fears from technological advances associated with Industry 4.0. During he traditional opening walk around the Hannover Messe fairground, the German chancellor made a plea for free and open trade, saying isolationism and protectionism would only lead to losses for society as a whole. In Hanover this year, Poland\\'s industry is at the center of the fair. The five-day trade fair, which is in its 70th year, also focuses on networked industry, with robots playing an increasing role in the approximately 6,500 exhibitions from more than 70 countries. Poland is Germany\\'s eighth most lucrative trading partner with a population of 38 million. Last year, German mechanical engineering companies exported assets worth 5.7 billion euros ($6.1 billion) across the border to Poland. The Mechanical Engineering Industry Association\\'s (VDMA) Eastern Europe expert, Yvonne Heidler, says the plan is for growth in 2017. \"Poland is coming, and we are assuming that Poland will become an increasingly important trade partner,\" said Carl Martin Welcker, the president of the VDMA in an interview with Reuters. The focus of this year\\'s fair is Industry 4.0, which exchanges data on manufacturing techologies over cloud computing, energy transformation and automation of labor. Poland is one of the fastest growing markets for automation in manufacturing, but there\\'s still room for industry to improve its competitiveness. \"Many companies are still at the level of Industry 2.0, with only 15 percent of the factories fully automated, 76 percent partly automated, and the rest still being handled by hand,\" explained Heidler. Robots and humans can coexist Amid tensions on factory floors over the risk of losing jobs to robots, the Hannover Messe will attempt to alleviate concerns. Exhibitors will demonstrate how machines can coexist alongside human workers and offer support in factories. Although job changes are inevitable, robots can adapt to the speed and behavioral changes of humans, said trade fair boss Jochen Koeckler. \"Robots learn from robots,\" said Koeckler. \"But it is human beings who tell the robot what tasks need to be done.\" To adapt from manual jobs to commanding robots will demand higher qualifications and greater expertise of technology and programming explained Stefan Assmann, head of Bosch\\'s connected industry unit. There is no need for fewer workers at the automotive supplier company. More than 1,700 panels will take place at the Hannover Messe with 6,500 exhibitors and a further 1,200 journalists from around the globe. uhe/rd (Reuters, dpa)',\n",

       " {'story': \"UK economy picks up speed Britain's economy gathered momentum in the second quarter, fresh figures from the Office for National Statistics have revealed. But pundits believe further economic expansion could be marred by the Brexit vote. The UK economy picked up during the second quarter that concluded with the nation's vote to leave the European Union. Q2 gross domestic product grew by 0.6 percent, up from 0.4 percent in the first three months of the year. Output in the three months to June was 2.2 percent higher than a year earlier, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) reported Wednesday. Crystal ball reading? But economists warned that this robust pace of growth might not last into the second half of the year, given the uncertainties over the medium and long-term impact of the country's pro-Brexit vote in the June 23 referendum. Recent data show unease across British factories, with confidence among UK manufacturers falling in July to its lowest level since early 2009. While consumer optimism tumbled in the aftermath of the Brexit vote, some private sector surveys suggest domestic demand has mostly held up, helped by a strong labor market. But the Confederation of British Industry reported Wednesday that retailers suffered the sharpest drop in sales in four years following the referendum. Orders placed with suppliers fell at the sharpest rate since March 2009 and were expected to decline rapidly in August too. hg/jd (Reuters, AFP)\",\n",

       " {'story': 'EU Commission caves in to Germany on coal subsidy deadline The European Commission has caved in to German pressure over a 2014 deadline for subsidies for failing coal mines. The Commission said Wednesday it would delay the cancellation of subsidies until 2018. Germany has won concessions from the European Union on coal subsidies paid out to loss-making mines. The EU Commission said Wednesday it would push back a phase-out date on subsidies by four years to 2018. The Commission had said in July that failing mines would have to be closed by 2014, arguing that subsidies were bad for the environment and promoted unfair competition. But Germany fiercely protested, saying that the subsidies kept its coal industry afloat, and that a 2014 phase-out would endanger too many jobs. Job security for some 25,000 workers employed at five mines around Germany would have been threatened by a 2014 deadline. Berlin welcomed the Commission\\'s decision as \"a great success,\" government spokesman Steffen Seibert said Wednesday. The extension of coal subsidies to 2018 would enable Germany to meet its social obligations to the country\\'s miners, he added. The premier of Germany\\'s Saarland state, which is home to one of the country\\'s largest mines, welcomed the EU decision to yield to German pressure. Peter Mueller said the continuation of subsidies until 2018 was a \"socially acceptable solution for miners without redundancy deals.\" The four-year moratorium on mine closures should also be long enough to allow Germany to restructure its coal industry without sustaining considerable losses. Of the 26 other EU member states, only Romania and Spain will be directly affected by the new subsidies deadline. The deal is to set to be endorsed by EU competition ministers on Friday. Environmental group Greenpeace\\'s energy policy expert, Frauke Thies, said that in 2008 the German government had subsidized each individual job in unprofitable coal mines to the tune of 235,000 euros ($311,000).

       " {'story': 'Merkel praises Spain\\'s bailout request Angela Merkel has spoken out in favor of Spain\\'s requested bailout of its banking sector for the first time, adding that Spain will face different conditions than countries who received complete sovereign bailouts. For the first time since Spain announced it would be seeking help from the European Union for its banking sector, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has commented on the move, saying Spain had made the right decision in applying for a recapitalization of its banks. However, Merkel was clear to say that any aid for Spain\\'s banking sector would not come without strings attached. \"There will of course be conditions for Spain,\" Merkel said on Tuesday in Berlin at the economic council of her party, the Christian Democrats (CDU). \"Namely, a restructuring of its own banking system to make it fit for the future.\" Different conditions This would be, according to Merkel, different than conditions applied to countries that have sought bailouts to cover an entire sovereign economy, such as Greece, Ireland, or Portugal. In the case of Spain, the bailout only applies to the banking sector. Reflecting on the European Union as a whole, Merkel said the bloc must stick by the agreed reforms until the end to make sure they bear fruit. \"It would be fatal, now that some countries have started to move in the right direction, to stop halfway there,\" she said. The structural reforms, which would include a financial supervisory body at the European level, are seen by some European politicians as necessary to help get the eurozone out of its current crisis. \"If we need European institutions that keep a better eye on things, then we have to give up some of our national jurisdiction,\" Merkel said, referring to concessions that would have to be made to the EU should the reforms be put into place. More than just spending Meanwhile, French President Francois Hollande said in a speech to France\\'s Social, Environmental, and Economic Council that spending alone would not be the only way to spur economic growth and bring about a European recovery. \"[Growth] will not be born of supplemental public spending,\" he said. \"It can emerge from our common European desire to put new instruments in place: eurobonds, financial instruments - we can think big.\" Merkel opposes the idea of \"eurobonds,\" which would be jointly-guaranteed eurozone government debt. She favors a mix of austerity and structural reforms to pull Europe back from the brink. mz/msh (AP, AFP, dpa)',\n",

       " {'story': 'New Belgian Leader Gets Nod from Parliament Belgian members of parliament gave a vote of confidence Saturday to an incoming coalition government led by Flemish Christian Democrat Yves Leterme, sealing the end of a nine-month political crisis. The 97-48 vote, with one abstention, in the lower chamber of deputies, was not unexpected, with the coalition partners -- the Flemish and francophone Liberals and Christian Democrats, plus francophone Socialists -- in favor. Leterme, 47, succeeds Flemish Liberal Guy Verhofstadt with a mandate that should in theory run until 2011 -- but which could well be abbreviated, as his own party has set a July 15 deadline for more powers to be given to Flanders. \"That deadline will be respected,\" Leterme told parliament Saturday, a day after he and his 15-member cabinet were sworn into office by Belgium\\'s King Albert II after protracted negotiations with other political groupings. Uniter, not a divider? Leterme has his work cut out to persuade Belgium\\'s francophones -- concentrated in Brussels and the southern Wallonia region -- of his ability to unite the country in the wake of general elections back in June 2007. Flanders, home to Belgium\\'s Dutch-speaking majority, craves more regional powers to reflect its prosperity. It also resents the dollops of euros it now pays to subsidise the poorer, French-speaking Wallonia region to its south. \"I fear grave institutional chaos\" if the government falls in July, said the new employment minister, Joelle Milquet, leader of the francophone centrists, adding that the danger of Belgium splitting into two nations was now \"real.\" For the international community, such a possibility would be serious, given that both the European Union and NATO are headquartered in the capital Brussels. The new prime minister has promised to raise pensions and offer tax cuts for low earners although government revenues have been lower than expected. His plans have come under increasing scrutiny by the opposition and the media. Leterme -- who once confused Belgium\\'s anthem with that of France and failed in two previous attempts to form a government -- fueled inter-communal anger in 2006 by suggesting that French-speakers were incapable of learning Dutch.',\n",

The company, she said, has developed \"computer-learning\" technology that can identify videos with extremist content or content that risked the safety of child users. The move is part of a broader effort by the company to improve its protection of users and rid the video-sharing website of extremist or offensive content after widespread criticism of its policing policies.

       " {'story': \"Afghanistan market blast kills dozens Officials say dozens of people have been killed in a suicide bomb attack at a busy market in southeastern Afghanistan. The blast underlines the country's fragile political and security situation. A suicide bomber on Tuesday blew up a vehicle packed with explosives at a busy market in southeastern Afghanistan, killing at least 89 people and injuring scores more, according to a Defense Ministry spokesman. Officials said most of the victims were civilians. The explosion also damaged shops, houses and cars nearby, according to witnesses. Several people were said to be still buried under rubble, meaning the death toll could rise further. The attack in the Urgun district of Paktika province is the worst in the war-torn country in months. There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but Taliban insurgents often use suicide attacks as a weapon. The bombing followed just hours after a roadside bomb in eastern Kabul killed two passengers in a minivan carrying employees of the presidential palace. Five others in the van were injured. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid claimed responsibility for that attack in a statement sent to reporters. Perilous instability Attacks by the Taliban are gaining intensity as part of their annual spring offensive. The militants appear also to have stepped up their campaign ahead of the withdrawal of US-led foreign forces by the end of 2014. A UN report last week said civilian casualties in Afghanistan soared by 24 percent to 4,853 in the first half of 2014 compared with the same period in 2013. Tuesday's attacks come just days after a weekend deal between two Afghan presidential rivals brokered by US Secretary of State John Kerry seemed to avert a looming danger to the country's nascent democracy. Abdullah Abdullah and Ashraf Ghani, who have been contending to take over from incumbent President Hamid Karzai, agreed to allow an audit of all eight million ballots cast in a runoff election in which preliminary results showed Ghani as a clear winner. Abdullah had blamed the result on massive cheating. tj/msh (AP, AFP)\",\n",

Encouraged by the success at the London Olympics, what they lack in resources, the runners make up for in determination. Moses Asonya, a retired Ugandan athlete, has embarked on a journey to train his country’s next gold medalists in athletics. After a successful career representing Uganda in several international competitions, the former 400-meter distance runner is training a group of ten young Ugandans with high athletic hopes. Without a classroom or formal academy, Asonya meets his students on a local pitch. The team, ranging in age from 8 to 25 years old, practices for at least an hour every morning. Most of the athletes draw inspiration from global stars like Uganda's London Olympic marathon gold medalist Stephen Kiprotich. Asonya hopes that with hard work and perseverance, Ugandans will soon be able to compete with athletes from other African countries including Kenya, Ethiopia and Eritrea.\",\n",

       " {'story': \"Clashes in Nicaragua over canal construction Nicaraguan police have used tear gas and rubber bullets to break up protesters opposed to a forthcoming $50 billion shipping canal. The government plans to expropriate land for the Chinese-built project. Up to 21 people were injured on Wednesday in clashes between police and protesters in southern Nicaragua, over a planned transoceanic canal. The injured included 15 officers and six civilians. At least 33 people were arrested. The confrontation took place on the Pan American Highway near El Tule, about 400 kilometers (250 miles) southeast of the capital Managua. Police said authorities used force to end a blockade on the highway. The protests began following the inauguration of the canal on Monday when workers broke ground on the $50 billion (41 billion euro), 280-kilometer-long project, which could rival the Panama Canal. The canal will require the expropriation of land, displacing around 30,000 people, and protesters are concerned their homes and farming areas are under threat. It will cross Lake Nicaragua - Central America's largest lake - and run through rainforest and 40 villages. The canal is being built by Chinese firm Hong Kong Nicaragua Development Investment (HKND), owned by billionaire Beijing-based entrepreneur Wang Jing. Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega says property owners affected by the canal's construction will receive a just price for their land. Although the environmental, technical and financial studies of the project are secret, it will include the construction of a railway, ports and an oil pipeline. Officials expect the canal, which will connect the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean, to be operational in 2019. jr/gsw (AP, Reuters, AFP)\",\n",

       " {'story': 'Belarus orders international watchdog to close its Minsk office The world\\'s largest regional security organization must close its doors in Minsk, after the Belarusian government refused to extend its mandate. The OSCE had criticized the election of President Alexander Lukashenko. Belarus has ordered the closure of the office of Europe\\'s main rights watchdog, the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), in Minsk after the body issued a report critical of the December election, in which incumbent President Alexander Lukashenko won around 80 percent of votes. \"The Belarusian side has taken the decision not to continue the operations of the OSCE office in Minsk,\" Foreign Ministry spokesman Andrei Savinykh said Friday. He added that an evaluation of the OSCE\\'s activities in Minsk showed that the mission, which was set up in 2003, had fulfilled its mandate. The government has the right to revoke the mission\\'s permit or refuse to renew it. Tense relations with West Critics expressed concern that the closure of the OSCE office in Minsk would have negative ramifications for Belarus\\' relationship with its western neighbors. \"This will lead to a worsening of relations with the European Union and increase the influence of Russia in Belarus,\" Grigory Kostusev, a member of the Belarusian National Front party who opposed Lukashenko, told Reuters news agency. Lukashenko, who has ruled Belarus since 1992, has been accused by Western leaders in the past of dictatorial rule and suppressing independent media. Germany condemned the OSCE office closure, saying the move was another step backwards for democratic rights in the country. \"With its authoritarian direction, the government in Minsk is separating the country even more from European values of freedom,\" said German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle. \"We will discuss with our partners what consequences are required in the face of the Belarusian government\\'s voluntary policy of isolation.\" In a statement issued Friday evening, the foreign minister of neighboring Lithuania, Audronius Azubalis, expressed \"deep regret\" over Minsk\\'s refusal to extend the mandate of the OSCE office. Ongoing detentions Minsk is still holding hundreds of demonstrators who were arrested during protests following the December 19 election. Five opposition candidates and 22 activists have been charged with organizing mass disorder, which could carry a jail sentence of up to 15 years. Belarus is part of the 56-member OSCE, which was set up during the Cold War as a forum for dialogue between communist states and the West. The organization is made up of European and Central Asian countries as well as the US and Canada. Author: Darren Mara, Sarah Harman (AFP, Reuters) Editor: Nancy Isenson',\n",

       " {'story': 'Swedish military investigating report of Russian submarine wreck Divers have reportedly located the wreck of what could potentially be a Russian submarine off the east coast of Sweden. Authorities have reacted cautiously to the discovery and are examining footage of the wreck. The Swedish military is examining video taken by shipwreck divers purporting to show the wreckage of a Russian submarine just off the eastern coast of Sweden, officials said Monday. The find comes less than a year after Swedish authorities tried unsuccessfully to locate a reported Russian submarine near the capital of Stockholm. The search marked the country\\'s biggest military mobilization since the Cold War. Authorities reacted with caution to the discovery Monday, with Armed Forces spokesman Anders Kallin refusing to say whether the military believed the vessel was Russian. \"We choose not to comment on it before we have seen more material. We will continue the analysis together with the company in the coming days,\" Kallin said. Another military spokesman, Jesper Tengroth, said that it was also too early to say for sure if the find was indeed a submarine. He added that it was better \"to come back with facts rather than speculation,\" and that there was no particular hurry \"because the wreck was not going anywhere.\" Ocean X Team, the diving company that discovered the wreck said on its website the Cyrillic letters on the hull of the craft \"indicate that it is Russian.\" It is unclear how old the vessel is or how long it has been lying on the ocean floor. The vessel is about 20 meters long and 3.5 meters wide, according to Ocean X Team. Officials did not provide the exact location of the wreck, but the Expressen tabloid, which published images of the reported submarine on its website, said it was found about 2.8 kilometers off the east coast of central Sweden. The discovery comes amid renewed concerns about possible incursions by Russian submarines into Western territorial waters and as tensions with Moscow continue to rise over events in Ukraine. Sweden built up an anti-submarine force after a Soviet sub with nuclear weapons ran aground off its southern shores in 1981. Toward the end of the Cold War, the Nordic country sought to destroy suspected Soviet submarines and the Swedish navy periodically carried out searches in its waters. But since then, its anti-submarine program has gradually been dismantled. bw/lw (AP, Reuters, AFP)',\n",

Rescuers are meanwhile working tirelessly to find people buried under the debris. At least 21 people have died and around 60 injured people have been admitted to nearby hospitals, dpa news agency reported. The incident occurred on Thursday morning after 80 meters (260 feet) of the flyover collapsed in Kolkata\\'s busy Burrabazar area. \"The guilty will not be spared. We will take action against builders. This is a very serious incident,\" Mamata Banerjee, chief minister of West Bengal, told reporters. \"But our first priority is to rescue the trapped, treat the injured in hospital and console the families of those who have died,\" she added. India\\'s Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, expressed his condolences on Twitter. Flyover collapse an \\'act of God\\' Some 400 army personnel, including engineers and medical workers, were deployed at the site. The chief of the disaster response force, O.P. Singh, said the operation was a \"very very challenging task.\" Workers used bulldozers, saws, special cameras and sniffer dogs to find survivors. IVCRL, the construction company building the flyover, said it was missing 30-40 people who had been working on the site. \"We completed nearly 70 percent of the construction work without any mishap,\" IVCRL\\'s senior official K.P. Rao told officials. However, the company was widely criticized after another senior employee, named only as Dilip, described the incident as \"a total act of God.\" Many Indians took to Twitter to express their frustration at the hazard. Sonal criticized the builders for calling the tragedy an \"act of God.\" This user criticized the corrupt political system and negligence that led to the flyover crash. mg/rc (AP, dpa)',\n",

       " {'story': \"Heavy snowfall cuts off Alpine towns in Switzerland and Austria Tourists in the Swiss resort town of Zermatt under the Matterhorn mountain peak have been stranded for the second time in a month. Officials expected more snow overnight. Thousands of people were stranded Monday morning in the Alps after heavy snowfall blocked train lines and roads to the towns of Zermatt in Switzerland and St. Anton in Austria. High-level avalanche warnings on Sunday forced local authorities to stop train services to Zermatt, leaving around 9,000 tourists marooned in the popular ski resort town. Some visitors were able to leave the area on Air Zermatt helicopters, but flights were discontinued after the weather worsened. Tickets for the service were also sold out within hours of train cancellations. Read more: Alpine snow leaves thousands of tourists stranded in Switzerland Travel difficulties were also affecting St. Anton where police restricted travel in and out of the town to cars with snow chains. Some buses transported people to a nearby valley under police and firefighter escort. Conditions were set to worsen in Zermatt into Monday with up to 70 centimeters (28 inches) of snow expected to fall overnight. Authorities expect land access to remain closed until midday on Monday. Severe snowfall had cut off 13,000 tourists in the town, which is located under the famous Matterhorn peak, for two days earlier in January. The resort's marketing chief said tourists do not suffer while they are snowed-in. An updated website is providing information for people trying to get in and out of the resort.

       " {'story': 'US prepares for fight over EU subsidies to Airbus EU subsidies for Airbus have long been a source of tension with the United States. Despite EU claims to have ended the financing, a skeptical Washington is now preparing for a fight at the World Trade Organization. United States trade officials said Friday that they were asking the World Trade Organization to sanction the European Union for alleged subsidies to aircraft manufacturer Airbus. Washington said the EU claimed in December 2011 to have removed all subsidies to Airbus that broke the WTO rules, but that the 27-member bloc never provided evidence. The US complained that not only have the subsidies continued, but that new subsidies have been introduced. \"We refuse to stand by while American businesses and workers are disadvantaged,\" US Trade Representative Ron Kirk said in a statement. \"By taking this action today, we are reiterating the Obama administration\\'s commitment to ensuring that every one of our trading partners plays by the rules, and that American companies can compete on a level playing field,\" he added. The formal complaint to the WTO is to be submitted at a meeting of the WTO Dispute Settlement Body on April 13. EU \\'regrets\\' action The WTO ruled last June that the EU and four member states had provided more than $18 billion (13.5 billion euros) in unfair subsidies to Airbus - an amount the EU disputes. The US and the EU began talks in January on compliance with the WTO order, but both sides held their ground. \"We regret that the US has chosen to take this step, since the EU notified its compliance with its WTO obligations in the package of steps taken at the end of 2011, and the US has yet to do the same in the Boeing case,\" said the European Commission\\'s trade spokesman John Clancy. The WTO has also found that the US government paid $3 billion to $4 billion to domestic aircraft maker Boeing in the form of research grants and tax breaks. The US has argued that the EU had made Airbus dependant on its financing for \"every model of large civil aircraft,\" while no similar conclusion was found in the US-Boeing relationship. acb/msh (AFP, Reuters)',\n",

       " {'story': 'Instructions on how to make a vintage sign Today we want to show you how to make this vintage sign. Actually, the sign is new too, I just „aged“ it. A DIY vintage look and making a template are  pretty easy. We’ll show you how to do it yourself. You’ll need a piece of untreated wood. some cardboard in the same size s printout of the text you want steel wool from the hardware store vinegar coffee powder and hot water paint and a sponge a Boxcutter and work gloves. Instructions Glue your printed text onto the cardboard. Cut along the letters with the utility knife. Punch the all of the letters out of the cardboard. There’s your template! Now we’ll create the dye to give the wood a weathered, used look. Put the steel wool into a container and pour vinegar in until it’s covered. If you have a cover, close the container. Pour hot water on the coffee and stir it. You can use instant coffee, too. Let the coffee and steel wool sit for a couple of days. The longer you wait, the darker the steel wool gets. Pour the two liquids together. Use the mix to paint the wood all over. Don’t forget the edges! Don’t worry the smell won’t last long. Once it’s dry, use a brush to remove the coffee grounds. Now center your template on the piece of wood. Use tape to fix it on the sides. If you have putty, use it to get an even firmer fit. If not, roll up some tape. Now use a sponge to dab the paint mix around the template. Go over the template several times. Be sure to press the template onto the wood firmly, so the dye doesn’t seep. Remove the template and remove any tape or putty. There it is, you brand spanking new “vintage” sign. Good to know If you want your sign to look even older, pound on it with a hammer or put in a few nail holes. If you’d like it to look more grey, leave out the coffee and just use the vinegar-steel wool mix.',\n",

       " {'story': 'UK court rules WikiLeaks\\' Assange should be extradited to Sweden A British court has ruled that WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange should be extradited to Sweden where he faces charges of sexual abuse and rape. Assange\\'s lawyer said he would appeal the ruling. A UK court ruled on Thursday that WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange can be extradited to Sweden where he faces charges of sexual abuse and rape. Assange has denied the allegations, and his lawyers said they would appeal the ruling. The defense team argued that the charges were not offenses worthy of extradition and that the Swedish prosecution had no power to issue the European arrest warrant. They also expressed concern whether the 39-year old would be granted a fair trial in Sweden. The lawyers criticized Sweden for seeking to extradite the controversial Internet activist before formally charging him with any crime. They also said the sexual assault allegations against their client did not constitute rape under European law. \"What is rape in Swedish law does not amount to rape in any other country,\" said defense lawyer Geoffrey Robinson. Swedish authorities have said that last year Assange had sex with one woman without a condom while she was asleep, and he had sex with another woman with a broken condom. Such actions are punishable under Swedish law. From Sweden to the US? Australian national Assange said the accusations were politically motivated. He claims that Sweden might hand him over to the United States. His lawyers have said he might face imprisonment at Guantanamo Bay or even the death penalty if he is prosecuted for his part in the publication of classified US documents by WikiLeaks. Australia has called on Sweden to make sure that Assange gets a fair hearing. Australia\\'s ambassador to Sweden, Paul Stephens, said his government expects the case will proceed \"with due process and the provisions prescribed under Swedish law.\" WikiLeaks caught the world\\'s attention with the publication of thousands of secret US reports on the war in Afghanistan last summer. Since then, it has remained in the public eye with similar reports on the war in Iraq and the gradual release of some 250,000 secret US diplomatic cables.

He also criticized the 2011 US operation to kill Osama bin Laden in Pakistan. On Sunday, Musharraf will fly into Karachi, his hometown and Pakistan\\'s largest city. With 18 million people, Karachi is suffering from record levels of violence linked to ethnic and political tensions. He plans to contest May\\'s elections. \"In my time, Pakistan was an emerging country with a budding economy, and terrorism was not as big a problem as it is now,\" Musharraf told the German news magazine Der Spiegel. \"Success in these two political areas is the key to a stable and healthy Pakistan.\" Musharraf faces charges over the assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto; the 2006 death of the Baluch rebel leader Akbar Bugti in a military operation, and the 2007 sacking and illegal arrest of judges. However, legal problems are only one challenge facing Musharraf: The Taliban have warned they have an assassination team ready to kill the one-time military strongman if he sets foot in the country. He brushed the threats off, though: \"In the last 12 years, terrorists have often tried to drive me into hell. Without success.\" \"They won\\'t manage in the future either ...\" Musharraf said. \"Fortune favors the brave.\" \\'A total failure\\' The former army chief of staff, Musharraf seized power in a bloodless coup in 1999 and left the country after stepping down in August 2008, when Bhutto\\'s widower, Asif Ali Zardari, was elected president. \"The last five years ... were a total failure,\" Musharraf said, adding that \"all the economic and social indicators showed that Pakistan was a developing country\" before his self-imposed exile. \"I want to put Pakistan on the road to prosperity and free it from terrorism,\" Musharraf said in the interview, published online Saturday.

       " {'story': 'Building collapses in India, killing several people and trapping others At least 14 workers have been killed after a building on a construction site in southern India collapsed. Dozens are feared trapped under the rubble, authorities say. A five-story building in the southern Indian state of Goa collapsed on Saturday, leaving at least 14 construction workers dead. Many more are believed to be trapped under the rubble, the local IANS news agency reported. Ten people are reported to have been pulled from the building alive overnight. Police Superintendent Shekhar Prabhudessai said it was not known how many people were working on the construction site in Canacona, a city about 70 kilometers (44 miles) south of the state capital Panaji, when it collapsed. Witnesses reported seeing about 40 workers at the site before the building collapsed. \"It was like an earthquake when the building fell,\" witness Ramesh Naik told the Associated Press news agency. \"You could not see what exactly had happened because of the dust.\" Bodies were pulled from the rubble by police and local residents, while fire-fighters and rescue personnel sifted through the debris searching for survivors. Around 20 construction workers were rescued, local police officer Abhay Naik told DPA. At least three of those were transferred by ambulance to a nearby hospital for treatment. \"The rescue operation will go on through the night. Cranes and bull-dozers [will be used] to remove the debris to rescue those trapped,\" Naik said. The cause of the building collapse had not been determined, Superintendant Prabhudessai said. Building collapses are comparatively common in India as a huge demand for housing and second-rate building regulations often encourages builders to use inappropriate materials or add additional floors. Sixty people died when an apartment building collapsed in the city of Mumbai in September. jlw/msh (dpa, AP, AFP)',\n",

       " {'story': 'Second Chord Sounds in 639-Year Long Concert A new chord sounded Thursday in the world\\'s slowest and longest lasting concert of a piece of music that is taking a total 639 years to perform in its entirety. The abandoned Buchardi church in Halberstadt, eastern Germany, is the venue for a mind-boggling 639-year long performance of a piece of music by US experimental composer John Cage (1912-1992). Entitled \"organ2/ASLSP\" (or \"As SLow aS Possible\"), the performance began on September 5, 2001 and is scheduled to last until 2639. The first year and half of the performance was total silence, with the first chord -- G-sharp, B and G-sharp -- not sounding until February 2, 2003. Then in July 2004, two additional Es, an octave apart, were sounded and are scheduled to be released later this year on May 5. New chord will be held down by weights for years But on Thursday, the first chord progressed to a second -- comprising A, C and F-sharp -- and is to be held down over the next few years by weights on an organ being built especially for the project. Cage originally conceived \"ASLSP\" in 1985 as a 20-minute work for piano, subsequently transcribing it for organ in 1987. But organizers of the John Cage Organ Project decided to take the composer at his word and stretch out the performance for 639 years, using Cage\\'s transcription for organ. The enormous running time was chosen to commemorate the creation of Halberstadt\\'s historic Blockwerk organ in 1361 -- 639 years before the current project started. That original organ, built by Nikolaus Faber for Halberstadt\\'s cathedral, was the first organ ever to be used for liturgical purposes, ringing in a new era in which the organ has played a central role in church music ever since. New pipes added in time for new notes As part of Halberstadt\\'s John Cage Organ Project, a brand-new organ is being built specially, with new pipes added in time for when new notes are scheduled to sound. Cage was a pupil of one of the 20th century\\'s most influential composers, Arnold Schönberg (1874-1951). Cage\\'s avant-garde oeuvre includes works such as the notorious \"4\\'33\", a piece for orchestra comprising four minutes and 33 seconds of total silence, all meticulously notated. The organizers of the John Cage Organ Project say the record-breaking performance in Halberstadt also has a philosophical background -- to \"rediscover calm and slowness in today\\'s fast-changing world.\"',\n",

       " {'story': 'Germany, France at Helm of EU Constitution Makeover Sold to the public as an \"EU constitution\" the first time around, the document meant to structure and streamline the bloc failed to fly. Now, France and Germany are hoping a repackaged treaty might prove more marketable. The EU Constitution is being dusted off and given a whole new image in an attempt to make it more palatable to a skeptical public. Overseeing the makeover are German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Jacques Chirac. Critics claimed that the idea of a constitution was too formal and threatening to many voters, especially those in France and the Netherlands, whose populations rejected the draft document when it was put to a referendum last year. The aim now is to give the document a name that more accurately reflects its purpose. According to the Financial Times, one alternative being floated is \"institutional treaty.\" While that may not be a particularly sexy label, it does describe one of the main reasons why the text was conceived -- to streamline and reform the bloc\\'s institutions so that it is better able to cope with enlargement. With Paris and Berlin overseeing the document\\'s future, though, conflict is bound to occur. Berlin has said it prefers to revive the text more or less in its entirety but tinker with the passages that caused concern to make them more acceptable. Paris has indicated that it is reluctant to put the charter to voters a second time, preferring to adopt single elements instead. Reports of a rapprochement between the two positions started to surface earlier this month, however. The German newsweekly Der Spiegel said that, according to plans, the charter would be reduced to its first two parts which set out the EU\\'s competences and the fundamental rights of the union. The third and largest part of the treaty, which focuses on condensing and re-ordering existing EU treaties, would be handled separately. The operation to revive the charter is expected to begin in earnest under the German EU presidency in the first half of 2007.',\n",

       " {'story': 'Public sector workers in Spain strike against austerity measures In a test of the Spanish government\\'s resolve to push forward with tough austerity measures that include cuts to civil servant pay, about three-quarters of Spain\\'s public sector workers have gone on strike. Civil servants in Spain began a one-day strike Tuesday to protest the government\\'s plans to reduce the country\\'s massive budget deficit by cutting their salaries. Strikers included workers in cleaning, postal and health services, educators, firefighters, doctors and transportation workers. Union sources put participation at around 75 percent of the country\\'s approximately 2.3 million public employees, and said Spain\\'s most recent austerity package, totaling 15 billion euros ($18 billion) would give civil servants a 5-percent wage cut in 2010 and a wage freeze in 2011, the first public wage reduction in 30 years. The government\\'s aim is to reduce Spain\\'s public deficit from 11.2 percent in 2009 to 6 percent in 2011. It hopes to reach the eurozone\\'s 3-percent limit by 2013. Ignacio Fernandez Toxo, leader of the CCOO trade union, said Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero\\'s government has \"uncritically\" accepted European Union recommendations, acting \"without any other horizon than cutting costs.\" Unions are typically close to Zapatero\\'s Socialist Party, which has been losing popularity amid gloomy economic forecasts and 20 percent unemployment, the eurozone\\'s highest. Labor market reform Tuesday\\'s strike is a potential preview of a full-fledged general strike that unions are threatening if government plans to enact labor market reform curtail workers\\' rights. Unions, employers and government officials have been negotiating what the reform might entail for months. UGT union confederation leader Candido Mendez has called the discussions \"difficult.\" The government says it will enact the reforms by decree if it cannot reach an agreement through negotiations. The reform would loosen restrictions on severance pay for permanent workers, who have become prohibitively expensive to lay off. These conditions have created a two-tier labor market where about a quarter of workers are left with temporary contracts that provide few rights. Most economists agree that reforming the labor market - together with restructuring banks and reducing the deficit - is necessary to remedy Spain\\'s chronic economic problems.

       " {'story': 'Ban Ki-moon urges calm amid violence between Israel and Palestinians During a surprise visit to Jerusalem, United Nations (UN) Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has cautioned against an escalation of violence. His message to the local populace was marred by more deaths in the West Bank. Speaking during a meeting with Israeli President Reuven Rivlin on Tuesday, Ban called for an end to the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. The UN secretary-general said that a lack of \"political horizon\" was to blame for the recent wave of violent attacks on Palestinian and Israeli territory. \"Violence only undermines the legitimate Palestinian aspiration for statehood,\" Ban said. \"If we do not act fast, the dynamics on the ground will only get worse,\" he warned, adding that it was not yet too late to \"avoid a broader crisis.\" German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier shared a similar message on Tuesday, during a visit to his Jordanian counterpart in Ammam. Steinmeier urged Israelis and Palestinians to avoid action that could \"further inflame\" the unrest, wanring of \"incalculable consequences.\" Death toll rises Ban\\'s visit to Jerusalem on Tuesday was overshadowed by yet more deaths in the West Bank. Israeli police said earlier in the day that a Palestinian had been fatally shot after he drove his car into a group of Israelis near Jerusalem. An Israeli man also died in a separate incident, when he was run over by a truck during a clash with Palestinians. According to a Palestinian security official, the driver turned himself in to police, saying he hit the man by accident. Over the past month, 10 Israelis have been killed in Palestinian attacks, most of which were stabbings. In that time, 43 Palestinians were also killed by Israeli fire, including 20 attackers. An Eritrean migrant also died at the weekend, after being shot and beaten by a mob that mistakenly believed he was a Palestinian assailant. Ban is to meet with Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas on Wednesday. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is in Berlin for talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. ksb/msh (AFP, AP, dpa)',\n",

       " {'story': 'UN-endorsed report finds internal displacement growing in Syria, Africa The world is experiencing a record number of people displaced within their own countries by armed conflict. In Syria alone, one family is displaced every 60 minutes, according to a UN report. A report released Wednesday at the United Nations in Geneva has found that 33.3 million people were displaced within their own countries at the end of 2013 - 4.5 million more than in 2012. The report was compiled by the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC), a part of the Norwegian Refugee Council. \"This record number of people forced to flee inside their own countries confirms a disturbing upward trend of internal displacement since IDMC first began monitoring and analyzing displacement back in the late 1990s,\" said Jan Egeland, the secretary-general of the Norwegian Refugee Council. \"The dramatic increase in forced displacement in 2013 and the fact that the average amount of time people worldwide are living in displacement is now a staggering 17 years, all suggest that something is going terribly wrong in how we are responding and dealing with this issue,\" he added. In cooperation with the UNHCR refugee agency, the IDMC also reported Wednesday that 8.2 million people had fled their homes in 2013, including about 3.5 million in Syria alone, to bring the total of internally displaced people there to 6.5 million. The other two-thirds of the cumulative 33.3 million displaced by war worldwide had fled in previous years and have not yet been able to return to their homes. The figures show that 63 percent of those internally displaced worldwide find themselves torn from their homes in just five countries: Syria, Colombia, Nigeria, Congo and Sudan.

       " {'story': 'Ukraine activist Bulatov reveals details of alleged kidnapping Ukraine activist Dmytro Bulatov has shed light on his alleged kidnapping, and has told reporters he had begged his captors to kill him. Bulatov said he was so desperate to end the ordeal he made false confessions. Bulatov fronted a press conference in Vilnius, Lithuania on Thursday to outline the details of his ordeal, which began with his abduction on January 22. He was discovered eight days later, bloodied and claiming he was tortured by his captors. Bulatov was one of the leaders of the group Automaidan, which uses vehicles to blockade streets in protection of protest groups. He had been active in the anti-government protests gripping Ukraine, with President Viktor Yanukovych under pressure after electing not to sign an association agreement with the European Union in November. False confession Bulatov is one of several prominent activists said to have been abducted, and said his captors repeatedly asked him who was funding the protests. He said he had falsely confessed to having received $50,000 (36,800 euros) from a United States ambassador in an attempt to stop the torture. \"They cut my ear, I couldn\\'t feel how much they cut off my ear. They took the piece of my ear and touched my face with it,\" he told reporters. \"The only thing I wanted was for this to stop … I said whatever they wanted.\" \"On the last day they put me on my knees. They said, \\'We are going to crucify you.\\' I was asking them to kill me because I was unable to stand this any more,\" he added \"Some time later they came and put a bag on my head and took me somewhere. I was hoping my suffering was finished.\" Bulatov flew to Lithuania for further medical treatment, and told news agency Reuters he would not return to Ukraine unless he received guarantees he would not be prosecuted. Constitutional change sought Ukraine\\'s opposition parties are continuing their push to return the constitution to its 2004 form - a move that would shift several powers from the president to parliament. Yanukovych has rejected the proposal, but a spokesman from the president\\'s Party of the Regions said leaders of all parliamentary groups are set to meet in the coming days to discuss a bill. \"Next week, we should take a decision - maybe on Tuesday, Wednesday - to consider this draft law,\" Party of the Regions\\' speaker Volodymyr Rybak told lawmakers. Speaking on Wednesday, EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton called for political action to end the turmoil, saying a potential aid package from the US and EU would be more than simply monetary assistance. ph/dr (Reuters, dpa)',\n",
