        "story": "France's Peugeot 'back in the race' as profit rebounds The French car group PSA Peugeot Citroen has turned the corner on earnings and logged its first profit since 2010. The about-face came in the wake of cost-cutting measures and a joint venture with China. PSA Peugeot Citroen said Wednesday its operating profit in the first six months of 2014 totaled 477 million euros ($640 million), reversing a loss of 100 million euros in the same period one year ago. With 1.54 million cars sold from January to June - a year-on-year increase of 5.5 percent - revenues amounted to 27.6 billion euros. Depressed by currency fluctuations, the figure was slightly lower than last year, PSA Peugeot Citroen. Free cash flow, an important measure for auto makers, improved to 1.7 billion euros from just 203 million a year ago. \"The commitment of all the partners at the group to the Back in the Race strategic plan allowed PSA Peugeot Citroen to reap the first results of its turnaround,\" Chief Executive Carlos Tavares said in a statement.\" Tavares unveiled a four-year turnaround strategy earlier this year aimed at boosting profitability by producing fewer models and expanding sales in emerging markets. In addition, the French state and Chinese carmaker Dongfeng became shareholders in PSA, effectively rescuing the company after losses of more than 7 billion euros in the previous two years. PSA's recovery was led by the group's auto division which had logged an operating profit of 7 million euros. This marked a significant improvement over a loss of 538 million euros in the first half of 2013. Sales grew mainly in European car markets, up 11.7 percent, and in China. In Russia and Latin America, losses were also curbed. uhe/cjc (Reuters, AFP, dpa)",

        "story": "Germans take to the streets to protest anti-Islamization movement Anti-Islamist 'Pegida' supporters have had to cancel their appearance in Cologne, where thousands of demonstrators showed solidarity with migrants. However, thousands of anti-Islamists showed up in the city of Dresden. 20,000 residents in Cologne and neighboring areas gathered on the streets to demonstrate against the anti-immigrant movement, Pegida. Overwhelming support for immigrants and asylum seekers in Cologne led to the Pegida demonstrators cancelling their appearance. Citizens in Cologne shouted out in jubilation, the sole goal of their demonstration being to prevent the K\u00f6gida- the name of the anti-Islam movement in Cologne- from marching in their city. Lights out in Cologne Bridges over the Rhine in Cologne and the Cologne Cathedral were plunged into darkness as demonstrators of the anti-Islamic movement gathered to protest the influx of refugees into Germany. People displayed banners saying \"We are the people\" and \"Nazis, out!\" \"We will not let a racist mob run free on Cologne's streets,\" a pamphlet said, referring to the march and rioting by the group \"Hooligans against Salafists\" last October in Cologne. Around 5,000 protesters gathered in a Berlin neighborhood, calling for more tolerance. Berlin's integration leder Dilek Kolat of the Social Democrats called the Pegida- an acronym for Patriotic Europeans against the Islamization of the West- \"an attack on peaceful co-existence in our society.\" Citizens in Munich and Stuttgart also came out into the streets. Around 1,000 people gathered in Munich's Sendlinger Tor to voice their displeasure against the anti-immigrant movement. Pegida still strong in Dresden Germany's eastern city of Dresden witnessed a strong presence of the anti-Islamists with around 18,000 Pegida supporters, who gather on Mondays, rallying against what they considered a threat to German and European values. Anti-Pegida activists in Dresden offered concrete proposals for negotiation to Pegida demonstrators for the first time on Monday. mg/bw (dpa, EPD)",

India's woefully underfunded railway system is a death trap, killing 15,000 every year. At least 23 people were killed and scores more injured when a train derailed in northern India Saturday. At least five railcars went off the tracks, according to Railways spokesman Anil Saxena, leaving emergency workers and private citizens to pull people out of mangled, upended carriages. \"Rescue and relief operations are continuing,\" G S Priyadarshi, Muzaffarnagar district magistrate, told the AFP news agency.

Some dead bodies have also been recovered,\" fire and emergency officer Naresh Kumar told AFP. Second tragedy in a week The derailment occurred in the north Indian state of Uttar Pradesh and is the second tragedy to hit the state in the past week. Dozens of children died in a hospital there that had run out of oxygen. The national authorities have sent disaster teams to help. \"We have mobilized all our resources to provide the best relief and rescue operations at this time,\" Saxena said on Indian television.

In the past year 146 people died in a similar disaster in Uttar Pradesh. A government report in 2012 said almost 15,000 people were killed every year on India's railways. It described the loss of life as an annual \"massacre\". Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has pledged to invest $137 billion over five years to modernize the crumbling railway network, making it safer, faster and more efficient. bik/rc (AFP, Reuters, AP)",

        "story": "Nigeria hit by fatal bomb attacks Bomb blasts in two Nigerian cities on Sunday have killed at least 38. No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks in Kabuna and Jos, one of which detonated near a church holding Easter services. A car bombing near a church in the northern Nigerian city of Kaduna killed at least 38 people and injured dozens more on Sunday morning as churchgoers attended Easter services, officials in the West African nation said. Most of the fatalities were believed to be motorcycle-taxi drivers and beggars. It is thought the bomber was also among the dead. The All Nations Christian Assembly Church, which appeared to have been the target of the blast, was also severely damaged. \"We were in the Holy Communion service and I was exhorting my people and all of a sudden, we heard a loud noise that shattered all our windows and doors,\" Pastor Joshua Raji said. Second blast Hours later an explosion hit the city of Jos, around 200 kilometers (124 miles) to the south-east, injuring several people. Though no group immediately claimed the Kaduna attack, suspicion immediately fell on the radical Islamist sect Boko Haram, which had reportedly been planning a strike during the Christian festival. The Kaduna bombing was reminiscent of a series of deadly strikes on churches and other locations carried out by Boko Haram on Christmas Day. The bloodiest attack took place outside a church in Abuja, where 44 people died. Boko Haram, whose name means \"Western education is sacrilege,\" is seeking the introduction of strict Shariah law across the country and the release of all imprisoned followers. Its increasingly bloody insurgency has left more than 1,000 people dead since mid-2009. An attempt to hold indirect talks between the sect and Nigeria's government failed last month. Both Kaduna and Jos are situated along the dividing line between the mostly Muslim north and largely Christian south. The region has been the scene of religious tensions. Hundreds of people have died as a result of religious violence in Kaduna over the past few years. Jos was hit by acar bomb outside of a Catholic church just over a month ago, on March 11, killing at least 10. No one claimed responsibility for the attack. Pope sends message Hours earlier Pope Benedict XVI had condemned ongoing religious violence in Nigeria during his Easter speech at the Vatican. \"To Nigeria, which in recent times has experienced savage terrorist attacks, may the joy of Easter grant the strength needed to take up anew the building of a society which is peaceful and respectful of the religious freedom of its citizens,\" he said. ccp, ncy / ai (AFP, AP, dpa)",

        "story": "Obama nominates Merrick Garland to Supreme Court US President Barack Obama has nominated Merrick Garland to serve as the Supreme Court's ninth justice. The president is preparing for a tense battle with Republicans over who will replace the late Antonin Scalia. On Wednesday, President Obama announced his nomination of Garland, the chief judge for the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. At a press conference on the White House lawn, Obama extolled Garland's virtues, including his integrity, modesty and even-handedness, and his attitude \"that all views deserve a respectful ear.\" \"To find someone with such a long career in public service ... who just about everyone not only respects but genuinely likes, that is rare,\" Obama told reporters. \"And it speaks to who Merrick Garland is, not just as a lawyer, but as a man.\" Washington is gearing up for a tense, months-long battle between the White House and the Republican-controlled Senate, which must confirm the nominee. A lot hinges on the choice to replace the late Antonin Scalia - for both Democrats and Republicans. On one side, Democrats want to preserve the Obama administration's liberal agenda by using the opportunity to tilt the Supreme Court in a more left-leaning direction for the first time in generations. On the other side, Republicans are dead-set on ensuring that a replacement stays true to the legacy of Scalia, a revered conservative who died in February. Gearing up for a fight Congressional Republicans have already said they'd refuse to consider Obama's nomination, insisting they would wait until after the presidential election in November before moving forward with the nomination process. During his press conference, Obama spoke out against the Republicans' position, calling it \"unprecedented.\" \"It is tempting to make this confirmation process simply an extension of our divided politics,\" Obama said. \"But to go down that path would be wrong. It would be a betrayal of our best traditions.\" Obama sent an email to his supporters earlier in the day, in which he defended his decision to go forward with the nomination even as the political atmosphere in the country grows more polarized by the day. \"In putting forward a nominee today, I am fulfilling my constitutional duty. I'm doing my job,\" Obama said. \"I hope that our senators will do their jobs, and move quickly to consider my nominee.\" The 63-year-old Garland, considered a moderate, was confirmed to the DC Circuit in 1997 by both Democrats and Republicans.",

        "story": "Lyon win women's Champions League Olympique Lyon's women have won the Champions League final for the second time in a row, again beating German opposition, and again by a margin of 2-0. Lyon have further cemented their place as the best in the world. It was the result observers of the women's game expected. Olympique Lyon went into Thursday's Champions League final in Munich as defending champions. They were also the champions of the French first division for the past five consecutive seasons, with a very real chance of making it six this year. The club is the highest-ranked in the women's game, and won the final at Munich's Olympic Stadium 2-0. German first division side FFC Frankfurt, meanwhile, finished a disappointing season in fourth place, and were something of a surprise entry in the final. Heavy favorites Lyon did the damage in the first half. Striker Eugenie Le Sommer opened the scoring from the penalty spot on 15 minutes. The French international stepped up and placed the ball calmly in the top-right corner. Abily scores in style Just before the half-hour mark, a poor bit of goalkeeping led to a sublime piece of attacking. Frankfurt goalie Desiree Schumann came out of her penalty area and sought to use her head to clear a dangerous long pass. Schumann's header, however, was weak; it fell to veteran French international Camille Abily, who side-footed a beautiful volleyed lob over the stricken Schumann and into the wide open net. Abily's impressive shot was taken from at least 25 meters out. Last season, Lyon dispatched Turbine Potsdam - German league champions for two consecutive seasons now - 2-0 in the final at Craven Cottage in London. An impressive 50,212 fans turned up to watch the match at the Olympic Stadium in Munich, Bayern Munich's former home before moving to the Allianz Arena. Last year's Champions League final drew a crowd of just 14,303. Women's football enjoys a loyal following in Germany - one of the traditional powerhouses of the sport. The 2011 World Cup, held in Germany, broke a string of all-time attendance records for the women's game. Author: Mark Hallam Editor: Charlotte Chelsom-Pill",

        "story": "Fires rage across Spain's Canary Islands Thousands of people have been evacuated on Spain's Canary Islands to escape forest fires sweeping across the islands of La Palma and La Gomera. Fire fighters and the military are trying to bring the flames under control. The fires raged for the second day on Sunday, devastating thousands of hectares of pine forest on the popular holiday island of La Palma. Around 4,000 residents and tourists had to flee their homes and were moved into a temporary shelter. Around 30 homes and several wineries have been burned down. Some 500 firefighters, forest rangers and military personnel, including from neighboring islands, were called in to deal with the fires. Spanish air force planes and helicopters are also involved in efforts to bring the blaze under control. The flames were fanned by strong winds and were spreading on several fronts while a fresh outbreak was detected on the smaller island of La Gomera. Spain has seen temperatures soar to well over 30 degrees Celsius. The fire has struck at the height of the holiday season \u2013 the archipelago off the Atlantic coast of northern Africa entirely depends on tourism. Local authorities said they hoped to bring the blaze under control on Sunday. Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero is expected to fly to La Palma later in the day to oversee efforts to tackle the fire. Since the the start of this year, at least eight people have been killed by fires in mainland Spain. Fires have ravaged some 75,000 hectares of land, almost double the number as for the whole of 2008. ai/AFP/AP/Reuters Editor: Sonia Phalnikar",

        "story": "Inflation is back in the eurozone In May, eurozone inflation hit positive territory for the first time in six months, moving the currency bloc away from the risk of deflation. But the figure still falls way short of the European Central Bank's target. Prices were up by a slightly better than expected 0.3 percent in May, compared with the same time last year, official figures showed on Tuesday. April's reading had been flat. \"This increase was stronger than widely expected, even if inflation is hardly racing ahead,\" said Howard Archer, chief European Economist at IHS Global Insight, told the AFP new agency. The figures mark a return to inflation after five months of negative consumer prices, which had sparked fears about a prolonged bout of deflation in the single currency bloc. The numbers came a day after data showed that German consumer prices rose at their fastest pace in eight months in May. Towards the end of last year, plunging energy prices as well as the eurozone's overall stagnant economy and high unemployment had caused prices to drop. Economists fear deflation because it means shoppers tend to put off purchases in the belief they may become even cheaper, leading to ever weaker demand, slowing the economy and pushing up unemployment. May's uptick can be attributed to a buoyant service sector, higher prices for unprocessed food and a rise in crude prices. The reading is, however, still far below the European Central Bank's target of 2 percent. ng/uhe (AFP, Reuters, AP)",

        "story": "Bavarian premier pledges better relations with Prague Horst Seehofer, the premier of Bavaria, has been in Prague to meet with Czech Prime Minister Petr Necas. The visit marks the first such trip by a Bavarian leader since World War II. Horst Seehofer, premier of the German state of Bavaria, wrapped up talks with Czech Prime Minister Petr Necas on Monday by pledging future cooperation between the neighbors. Seehofer was in Prague for the first official visit by a Bavarian leader to the Czech capital since the end of World War II. He has suggested the leaders now meet regularly. \"We want to open a new chapter in our relationship, and we've taken the first step towards that\", Seehofer said, after more than an hour of conversation with the Czech prime minister. Relations between the Czech Republic and the border state of Bavaria have been strained by the expulsion of ethnic Germans from the former Czechoslovakia in 1945. Many of the expellees, known as Sudeten Germans, ended up in Bavaria. \"What we could not avoid were differing views about the past,\" Seehofer said. \"We are united in wanting to focus on the future together.\" Touchy subject Prime Minister Necas said his country had a \"huge interest\" in future cooperation, which is likely to include closer energy links and travel connections. Seehofer, head of the conservative Christian Social Union (CSU) party in Bavaria, had dinner with Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg on Sunday evening. Czech and Bavarian leaders did not discuss the controversial postwar decrees under which Sudeten Germans were deported from Czechoslovakia and had their property seized. Although Bavaria has long wanted them abolished, the decrees remain valid today, as Czech leaders fear removing them would give expellees or their heirs property claims. The Bavarian delegation included Bernd Posselt, a representative of the Sudeten German deportees, who has been critical of Prague. He did not take part in Seehofer's talks with Necas.

        "story": "'We are not xenophobic': PEGIDA A spokesperson for anti-Islamization group PEGIDA has said the organization will not give up, despite death threats against the group's founder. Police have temporarily banned the group's weekly Monday marches. One of the organizers of Dresden's weekly PEGIDA (\"Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West\") marches has argued that her group's message is simply misunderstood. Appearing on a Sunday evening episode of G\u00fcnther Jauch's talk show on German public broadcaster ARD, Kathrin Oertel argued that most people had a \"false impression\" of her organization. Oertel's appearance was the first such interview with a PEGIDA organizer, and came just hours after the cancellation of Monday's march. The protest, which would have been the latest in a series of weekly protests that began in October, was called off on Sunday due to death threats against founder Lutz Bachmann. The Dresden police have temporarily banned demonstrations in the city, including a planned counter-demonstration. The threats to Bachmann come amid warnings from foreign intelligence services that the Berlin and Dresden train stations have become possible targets for terrorist attacks. On the show, Oertel rejected accusations that PEGIDA is racist and hostile to foreigners. \"We really are not a xenophobic organization,\" she insisted, adding that rather than stir up anti-immigrant feeling, the purpose of the marches is to \"shake things up.\" \"We want to highlight the shortcomings of our government in recent years,\" she said. Despite the ban on rallies in Dresden, Oertel said PEGIDA was by no means giving up its strategy. \"We will continue to put pressure on the government,\" she told Jauch. Dialogue instead of slogans Alexander Gauland, a senior member of the euroskeptic Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, was also a guest on the show. Coming to Oertel's defense, he called the ban on demonstrating \"the beginning of Islamization,\" according to news outlet Spiegel Online. Parliamentarian Jens Spahn, of Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU), was also present, and criticized PEGIDA for using \"slogans\" instead of \"dialogue.\" Spahn said if PEGIDA wanted to be taken seriously, it must enter into dialogue with the political system. Both Spahn and Wolfgang Thierse of the liberal Social Democrats (SPD) agreed that banning political rallies was a serious infringement of the basic right to assembly. Spahn assured Oertel and the audience that PEGIDA would be allowed to demonstrate again, but in this specific case, considering the threat against Bachmann, Spahn and Theirse agreed with the decision of the authorities. es/cmk (dpa, EPD)",

        "story": "Woman who searched for Mexico's \"disappeared\" is slain  Miriam Rodriguez was known for her courage facing Mexico's drug gangs after her daughter disappeared. She was killed on Mother's Day in Mexico.  A Mexican human rights activist who tirelessly searched for her missing daughter and organized more than 600 families to look for disappeared persons was shot to death in the northern state of Tamaulipas, authorities said on Thursday. Miriam Rodriguez was shot multiple times by unknown gunmen at her home in town of San Fernando on Wednesday, which is Mother's Day in Mexico. After her daughter went missing in 2012, Rodriguez led a search that found her child's remains in an unmarked grave. She later identified the perpetrators tied to the Zetas drug cartel, nine of whom were arrested. One of the men held responsible for her daughter's death recently escaped from prison, but Tamaulipas state attorney's office said he was quickly recaptured. Still, they responded to threats against Rodriguez by providing police patrols three times a day at her house. More than 30,000 people have gone missing in drug gang-ravaged Mexico in the last decade. Citizen Community in Search of the Disappeared in Tamaulipas, the group Rodriguez founded, is one of dozens of civic organizations that have sprouted up to find disappeared persons in the absence of what they say is the state's failure to find the missing. \"Mexico has become a very dangerous place for those who have the courage to devote their lives to search for missing persons,\" Erika Guevara Rosas, Amnesty International director for the Americas, said in response to Rodriguez's murder. \"The nightmare they face not knowing the fate or whereabouts of their relatives and the dangers they face in their work, which they perform given the negligent response from the authorities, is alarming,\" she said. The governor of Tamaulipas, Francisco Garc\u00eda Cabeza de Vaca, condemned Rodriguez's murder. \"The state of Tamaulipas will not allow the death of Miriam Rodriguez to be another statistic,\" he said on Twitter. cw/rc (AP, dpa, Reuters)",

        "story": "European Court of Human Rights overrules Britain on murder jail terms A European Court has ruled that Britain violated the rights of three convicted murderers by jailing them for life with no prospect of release. Britain's Justice Secretary criticized the decision. The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg has ruled that sentences passed on three convicted British murderers constituted inhuman and degrading treatment. \"Given ... the absence of a dedicated review mechanism for whole life orders, the Court was not persuaded that, at the present time, the applicants' life sentences were compatible with Article 3,\" wrote the court. It cited the European Convention on Human Rights' provision that prohibits torture, and inhumane and degrading treatment. The convention has the power of law in all signatory countries. British conservatives are already pushing for its repeal and Tuesday's decision looks set to strengthen their hand. British Justice Secretary Chris Grayling commented: \"What the court is saying is that a judge can no longer tell the most appalling criminals that they will never be released. I think the people who wrote the original Human Rights Convention would be turning in their graves at this ruling.\" The ruling overturned a January 2012 judgment by a panel of seven judges at the European court that found the sentences of Jeremy Bamber, jailed for murdering five members of his family in 1985, serial killer Peter Moore and multiple-murderer Douglas Vinter, did not amount to inhumane or degrading treatment. The decision does not assure the petitioners any prospect of imminent release but it struck down a key British sentencing guideline. Further appeals by other British prisoners serving life terms, including some of the most notorious killers in the country's recent history, are now expected. Meanwhile, Britain announced on Tuesday it would opt out almost 100 EU measures on policing and criminal justice. For technical reasons, the move means the country first has to withdraw from all 133 such measures. However, Home Secretary Theresa May said Britain would rejoin 35 of them, including the controversial European arrest warrant scheme. jm/rc (Reuters, AP, AFP)",

        "story": "US jury convicts former CIA officer of leaking classified Iran nuclear details A United States federal court jury has found a former CIA officer guilty of leaking spy secrets to a journalist. Jeffrey Sterling was accused of leaking details of a failed operation to thwart Iran's nuclear ambitions. Following three days of deliberations, jurors on Monday convicted 47-year-old Jeffrey Sterling of all nine counts, most of which related to unauthorized disclosure of national defense information. Prosecutors had said Sterling's actions had put lives at risk as well as compromising efforts to deter Iran's contested nuclear plans. Earlier in the day the jurors had informed the judge that they could not reach a unanimous verdict, but they were urged by the judge to keep talking and a few hours later they delivered guilty verdicts. The central issue in the two-week trial was who had told James Risen, a reporter for the New York Times, about the top-secret mission. The plan involved using a CIA asset, a former Russian nuclear engineer nicknamed Merlin, to supply the Iranians with deliberately flawed plans for nuclear weapons, in the hope that Iran would spend years attempting to develop parts which stood no chance of working. The mission was outlined in Risen's 2006 book \"State of War.\" Sterling had been Merlin's case handler. Prosecutors had acknowledged a lack of direct evidence against Sterling, however said there was strong circumstantial evidence against him. They said Sterling believed he had been mistreated by his employer. Defense attorney Barry Pollack said it made more sense for a US congressional staffer at Capitol Hill to have leaked to Risen. The court case against Sterling was delayed for several years because prosecutors were trying to make Risen divulge his sources, which he refused to do. Iran has maintained its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes but the US and its Western allies fear it to be a front for producing nuclear weapons and had targeted Iran with heavy economic sanctions. Following a breakthrough in negotiations in late 2013 which led to an interim deal for limited sanctions relief in exchange for Iran curbing some aspects of its program, negotiations have been underway to reach a long-term agreement by June 30 this year. se/bw (AP, Reuters, dpa)",

        "story": "Greece steps closer to fresh bailout money International creditors working with Greece to come up with reforms necessary to secure the next batch of bailout loans say they have struck an agreement on the most important measures. The clock is ticking for Greece and the international troika of the European Union, the European Central Bank, and the International Monetary Fund to reach an agreement on austerity measures needed to secure the next loan for Greece. Without the next instalment of bailout money, Greece risks defaulting on its loans and possibly exiting the eurozone. But Wednesday's progress was a sign that, at least in the near future, Greece's reforms were still on track. Greece needs to come up with an additional 13.5 billion euros ($17.7 billion) in spending cuts on top of previous austerity measures that are putting the squeeze on Greeks suffering from high unemployment and an economy that has been in recession for five years. The exact details of the deal between Greece and the troika have yet to be determined, but the two sides have agreed on most policy issues. Sources close to the negotiations say the final remaining sticking point is labor reform. Representatives from the troika left Greece on Wednesday and are scheduled to update European leaders at a two-day EU summit that kicks off on Thursday. Greece is likely to dominate the talks even though the country isn't officially the focus of the discussion. mz/jm (Reuters, AP, AFP)",

        "story": "Mexican president calls Canada's Trudeau ahead of NAFTA talks Mexico's President Pena Nieto has asked Canada's Prime Minister Trudeau to help press Donald Trump on the importance of NAFTA to the region. Trump has promised to renegotiate or tear up the free trade agreement. Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto spoke with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Sunday as the two agreed to mount a united front after US President Donald Trump announced he would meet with the pair to renegotiate a regional trade deal. A statement from Pena Nieto's office said that Mexico would push for economic integration in North America. Earlier on Sunday, Trump announced plans to meet with Pena Nieto and Trudeau \"very soon\" to discuss the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Trump has said he wants a \"fair deal\" for the United States, and has threatened to withdraw from the treaty if a new agreement is not reached. Under the deal's stipulations, it is relatively simple for one party to withdraw from the agreement. One country simply has to notify the other signatories, thereby opening up a 180-day window for a new deal to be reached. Canadian officials have warned their US counterparts that with the two countries' economies so inextricably linked, protectionist adjustments to the deal would hurt Americans and Canadians alike. As Canada's ambassador to Washington, David MacNaughton, pointed out on Sunday, however, his country is not likely to be in the spotlight during the talks. \"I don't think Canada is the focus at all,\" MacNaughton told reporters. \"But we are part of NAFTA, and there are discussions that need to be had, and we'll be having them over the next few weeks.\" Mexican economy shudders under Trump comments The situation may be more worrying for Mexico, as Trump's threats to sanction companies that move manufacturing from the US to its southern neighbor have sent shock waves through Mexico's economy. The announcement of renewed NAFTA negotiations came ahead of high-level talks on immigration, trade and security between senior US and Mexican officials set to take place on Wednesday and Thursday. Trump will met with Pena Nieto separately on January 31. Despite his repeated threats to build a border wall between their two countries, Trump praised his Mexican counterpart on Sunday when he discussed the NAFTA talks. \"The president has been really very amazing and I think we are going to have a very good result for Mexico, for the United States, for everybody involved. It's very important.\" es/kl (AP, AFP, Reuters)",

        "story": "Belarus president dismisses PM, reshuffles government amid economic crisis Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has sacked the country's prime minister and a number of top ministers in the biggest reshuffle in years. The move comes as the former Soviet republic's economy struggles. Mikhail Myasnikovich, who served as Belarus' prime minister since December 2010, has been replaced by President Lukashenko's chief of staff, Andrei Kobyakov, the presidential press service said on Saturday, without giving reasons for the reshuffle. The president also dismissed the head of the country's central bank in what analysts say is a move to protect the country's economy. Belarus' strongman Lukashenko had warned earlier this year he would sack the administration if it failed to achieve the desired economic objectives. On Friday, the president issued another critical statement, saying the government officials might have spent too long at their posts. \"That can be fixed,\" he said. Russian sanctions An economic crisis in Russia due to Western sanctions over Ukraine and a fall in global oil prices pose a serious challenge to Belarusian economy. Although its currency is not officially pegged to the Russian ruble, the ex-Soviet republic is highly dependent on Russia, which remains its main trading partner and political ally. Last week, Lukashenko ordered the country's transactions with Russia be settled in dollars or euros in an effort to avert worst of the crisis. Its central bank also announced a \"temporary\" tax of 30 percent on all purchases of foreign currency and increased interest rates to 50 percent. The government has admitted its economy has been badly hit in the recent months as around 40 percent of its exports are linked to Russia. shs/sms (Reuters, AFP)",

        "story": "Bahrain hunger strike activist refused transfer to Denmark Bahrain has rejected a request from the Danish government to transfer a jailed activist who has been on hunger strike for almost two months. The Danish citizen has been detained for his role in an anti-regime uprising. A Danish request to transfer an anti-regime activist, currently on hunger strike in Bahrain, was rejected on Sunday, state news agency BNA reported. The handover of accused and convicted persons to foreign countries takes place under specific conditions ... This does not apply in Abdulhadi al-Khawaja's case,\" BNA quoted a Supreme Judiciary Council official as saying. Abdulhadi al-Khawaja, who is a Danish citizen, has refused food since Feb 8. He is serving a life sentence over an alleged plot to topple Bahrain's Sunni monarchy during a month-long uprising by the island nation's Shiite majority one year ago. Danish Foreign Minister Villy Soevndal issued the request to his Bahrain counterpart to transfer Khawaja to Denmark for treatment amid heightened fears over his declining health, BNA reported on Saturday. Al-Khawaja has shed some 25 percent of his body weight and was \"at risk of organ failure,\" Front Line Defenders, an Ireland-based non-governmental organization, said Tuesday after a visit to Bahrain's capital Manama. The organization warned that the 52-year-old activist could die in jail. The Bahraini authorities have confirmed that he had lost some 10 kilogram's (22 pounds), while his lawyer said that he was weak but conscious on Friday, when he visited him in hospital. Defending human rights Al-Khawaja is a former Middle East and North Africa director of Front Line Defenders and has documented human rights abuses in Bahrain for international rights groups such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. Having lived in exile in Denmark for several decades he returned to Bahrain in 2001. Last April he was arrested and sentenced to life imprisonment alongside six other opposition figures in a special security court, which was set up after Bahrain imposed martial law last March to quell political unrest. Opposition supporters have staged daily rallies in Bahrain calling for his release which have often sparked clashes with security forces. With tensions still high, former Formula One champion driver Damon Hill has demanded a rethink of the contentious Bahrain Grand Prix which is due to take place in two week's time. The premier international event was cancelled last year as a result of political unrest. ccp/pfd (AFP, AP)",

        "story": "Thailand charges 72 in human trafficking crackdown Thai prosecutors are to indict 72 people on human trafficking charges, including state officials. It comes after thousands of Rohingya Muslims were stranded at sea trying to flee Myanmar via Thailand. A spokesman for the Office of the Attorney General (OAG) said on Friday it had issued an order to charge 72 people on 16 counts, mostly over human trafficking, including more than a dozen state officials of all levels. Arrest warrants have been issued for at least 45 others, who remain at large. \"We will not let influential people rise above justice,\" Wanchai Roujanavong told reporters at a press conference in Bangkok. Among the suspects is Lieutenant General Manas Kongpan, charged with being a major smuggling kingpin. The charges include human trafficking, involvement in international crimes, taking and bringing illegal migrants and malfeasance. The court must now decide whether to take up the cases. Thailand has long been criticized for not doing more to combat the lucrative human trafficking business in the country. Until a major Thai crackdown in May, the trade had flourished, as thousands of mainly Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar were being smuggled to their preferred destination, Malaysia, via Thailand's southern provinces. During their investigation - Thailand's biggest according to police - the authorities discovered vast smuggling rings, leading traffickers to abandon boats crammed with thousands of migrants at sea, attracting widespread international attention. Thai police say they have now successfully dismantled the trafficking network through the kingdom. But rights groups are waiting for the end of the monsoon season in a few months to see if the crackdown has worked. Around 4,500 Rohingya as well as Bangladeshi migrants were stranded in Southeast Asian waters in recent months, ping-ponged between countries reluctant to accept them until finally landing ashore on Malaysian, Indonesian, Bangladeshi, Myanmar and Thai soil. As part of the crackdown, investigators also discovered 26 bodies in graves buried deep in a jungle near the border with Malaysia. Last June, the United States downgraded Thailand one of its oldest allies in Asia, to the lowest \"Tier 3\" status in its 2014 Trafficking in Persons (TIP) Report, for not meeting the minimum standards for combating the illicit trade. The status would normally trigger sanctions, but they have not been imposed. On Monday, the US will release its latest TIP report. ng/jil (Reuters, AP, AFP)",

        "story": "New police raid on Deutsche Bank HQ in Frankfurt German investigators have carried out a search on the premises of Deutsche Bank's Frankfurt headquarters. The raid comes as the bank struggles to break free of regulatory issues that led to the resignation of its CEOs. The investigators carried out their search as \"subpoenas\" in connection with \"an ongoing inquiry,\" a spokesman for the state prosecutors' office in Frankfurt said. He said the office could not say anything about the reasons for the search because \"the operational phase\" was still ongoing. A source familiar with the incident said some 30 police officers in 10 police cars had arrived at the Deutsche Bank headquarters in Germany's banking capital to take part in the search. Deutsche Bank, whose premises have been searched several times in the past, confirmed that the raid took place, saying that none of its employees had been charged with any wrongdoing. \"I can confirm there were searches today at offices of Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt at the request of prosecutors in Wiesbaden,\" a bank spokesman said. Wiesbaden is a city just to the west of Frankfurt. \"The searches were aimed at obtaining evidence in connection with an inquiry against clients in respect of certain securities transactions,\" he said. Scandals galore The financial institution has recently been facing a number of legal problems, including probes into alleged manipulation of benchmark interest rates and derivatives, tax evasion and money laundering. Last month, it was fined a record $2.5 billion (2.2 billion euros) for its involvement in manipulating the interbank lending rate Libor. On Sunday, the banks two co-CEOs, Anshu Jain and J\u00fcrgen Fitschen, said they would be stepping down amid falling shareholders' confidence. John Cryan, former chief financial officer at Swiss banking giant UBS, will replace Jain when he leaves on June 30, and then become the bank's sole chief executive when Fitschen retires in one year's time. Fitschen is currently on trial in Munich on allegations of perjury stemming from testimony regarding the dissolution of the Kirch media empire. tj/bw (dpa, Reuters)",

        "story": "Vatican charges 78-year-old ex-bank chief with \u20ac50 million embezzlement The former chief of the Vatican's bank and his 94-year-old lawyer allegedly scraped profits from property sales. Pope Francis has been cracking down on financial impropriety. The former president of the Vatican bank and his lawyer have been charged with embezzlement for the loss of more than \u20ac50 million ($62 million). Angelo Caloia, 78, was president of the Institute for Works of Religion (IOR) from 1999 to 2009. His lawyer, Gabriele Liuzzo, 94, was also charged while a third person under investigation, former IOR director general Lelio Scaletti, died several years ago. Read more: Vatican court convicts ex-hospital head over luxury housing scandal The IOR said in a statement that the pair were charged with alleged acts of embezzlement and self-laundering between 2001 and 2008, when the bank offloaded \"a considerable part of its real estate assets.\" In December 2014 the Vatican's top prosecutor, Gian Piero Milano, froze accounts worth millions of euros held by the three men. He suspected the men of misrepresenting the sale prices of 29 buildings between 2001 and 2008 and pocketing the difference, according to a Reuters news agency report. The bank has been involved in various financial scandals over the past decades, with thousands of accounts being closed last year as part of a clean up effort by Pope Francis. The trial starts on March 15. aw/jlw (Reuters, AP) DW editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism. You can sign up to receive it directly here.",

        "story": "Ex-Virginia Governor Jim Gilmore joins Republican nomination race in US election Former Virginia Governor Jim Gilmore has become the seventeenth major Republican figure to throw his hat into the ring in the race for Republican presidential nomination. He is unlikely to appear in the televised debate. The 65-year-old filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission on Wednesday to stand alongside a number of considerably higher profiles, including former Florida governor Jeb Bush, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, Senator Marco Rubio and real estate tycoon Donald Trump. Having previously headed the Gilmore Commission - which advised both President Bill Clinton and George W. Bush on ways to improve homeland security strategy, particularly against domestic terrorism involving weapons of mass destruction - Gilmore is hoping that his national security credentials will work in his favor. He was also governor of Virginia on September 11, 2001, when hijackers crashed a plane into the Pentagon, which sits in the eastern US state, across from Washington. \"I don't think we're addressing the threat to the country,\" Gilmore told the Richmond Times-Dispatch earlier in July. \"I bring to the table experience others don't have,\" he added. Gilmore's first opportunity to take to the Republican stage will be on August 6 during the party's primary debate. Broadcaster Fox News has ruled, however, that only the top 10 candidates in nationwide polls will participate in the debate. Little-known outside Virginia, it is unlikely that Gilmore will make the final cut. ksb/jil (AFP, Reuters)",

        "story": "Solar-powered plane makes next US leg of global journey The Solar Impulse 2 plane has departed from the US state of Oklahoma on an 18-hour journey to Ohio. The solar-powered plane is on a mission to circumnavigate the globe. The plane took off from Tulsa, Oklahoma, early on Saturday morning on its way to Dayton, Ohio, where the Wright Brothers developed the first powered airplane. The 18-hour flight is the 12th leg of a journey for the Swiss-made Solar Impulse 2 as it attempts to circumnavigate 35,000 kilometers (21,700 miles) around the globe without using any gasoline. After Ohio, the plane is expected to make one more stop in the United States before crossing the Atlantic to Europe, from where it will continue on to the United Arab Emirates. \"The flight is part of the attempt to achieve the first ever Round-The-World Solar Flight, the goal of which is to demonstrate how modern clean technologies can achieve the impossible,\" the project said in a statement. The plane's 17,000 solar cells power propellers and charge batteries. Its ideal speed is only 45 kmh (28 mph), but it can go twice as fast during the day, when the sun gives it a boost. At night the plane runs on a battery using power stored during the day. The plane, which is as heavy as a car and has wings wider than a Boeing 747, is being operated by two Swiss pilots, Bertrand Piccard and Andre Borschberg. They started the journey in March 2015 from the United Arab Emirates, traveled more than 27,000 kilometers and spent 351 hours in the air. Previous stops include Oman, India, Myanmar, China and Japan. In the United States, the crew stopped in Hawaii for several months to repair a battery damaged during a five-day flight from Japan.

        "story": "Contentious US-Korea missile defense system delayed China has long campaigned against the deployment of the military system and some Korean politicians say it is not worth the trouble. It is a heated political issue in a country gripped by political instability. The deployment of a controversial US missile defense system in South Korea designed to protect against North Korean aggression could be delayed, Seoul's defense ministry said on Monday. The Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system was due to be built on a golf course owned by the Lotte Group conglomerate in the Seongju region, southeast of South Korea's capital Seoul. \"The plan to go ahead with the exchange will be signed by mid-January, but there is a possibility it will be slightly delayed,\" South Korean ministry spokesman Moon Sang-gyun said. He said they were waiting on a meeting with Lotte directors to settle land use fees. South Korea and the US had said the THAAD deployment was to protect against North Korea's growing nuclear and ballistic capabilities. Heavy regional opposition But China strongly objected, saying its powerful radar could penetrate Chinese territory. This led to some South Korea opposition leaders to call for its delay or cancellation. They argued that the security benefits would be outweighed by worsened relations with China and Russia. China and Russia railed against the deployment, warning of unspecified retaliation and a sharp downturn in relations with Seoul if it went ahead. \"China believes it is a serious threat to China's security interests and for the region,\" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said last week. \"I believe that as long as our country has legitimate security concerns, it is understandable that necessary measures be taken to safeguard such interests.\" Local landowners also protested against its use saying it would destroy melon crops and make the area a target for North Korea. Effect of political crisis South Korea is currently in the midst of a political crisis after lawmakers voted to impeach incumbent President Park Geun-hye over an influence-peddling scandal. If upheld by the Constitutional Court, the motion will trigger new presidential elections. Presidential hopeful Moon Jae-in said its deployment should wait until the next administration is elected. Potential rival candidate, former United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, said on Sunday it was appropriate for THAAD to be deployed in the country. \"Since the reality is the Korean peninsula is in a quasi-war-like state, such action made by the government is appropriate,\" Ban was quoted by South Korea's Yonhap News Agency as saying. aw/rt (Reuters, AP)",

        "story": "German Chancellor Angela Merkel urges swift Brexit talks after UK vote Angela Merkel says she does not expect a major delay in Brexit talks following the unexpected result in the British election. EU officials are anxious about the UK's lack of mandate to negotiate its exit from the bloc. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she was hopeful that Britain would stick to the Brexit plan following the snap general election that saw the ruling Conservative Party lose some of its parliamentary seats. The talks about Britain's exit from the 28 member European Union are scheduled for June 19 but the election results have cast doubts about them. British Prime Minister Theresa May had hoped to win a bigger mandate in the snap vote and improve her position in negotiations with the EU on Brexit. After the Labor Party's surge in the general election, its leader Jeremy Corbyn said Prime Minister May did not have the clear mandate to carry forward Brexit talks with the EU. Merkel optimistic \"On our side we are ready to negotiate and prepared,\" Merkel said Friday in Mexico City after talks with President Enrique Pena Nieto, adding that she hoped Britain was also interested in sticking to the agreed negotiating schedule. \"I assume that Britain, from what I heard from the prime minister today, wants to stick to its negotiating plan,\" Merkel told a news conference alongside President Nieto. \"We want to negotiate quickly, we want to negotiate in the agreed timeframe,\" Merkel added. So far, May has not hinted at any deviation from the plan. - Opinion: Theresa May's devastating miscalculation - When European politicians bet big - and lost The German chancellor pointed out that regardless of Britain's imminent exit from the EU, the country will remain a good partner with the bloc. \"Britain is a member of NATO, so we have a lot of shared challenges to deal with, and that's the spirit we want to carry out these negotiations in. But obviously while also asserting the interests of the 27 member states that will make up the European Union in future,\" she underlined. shs/jm (dpa, AFP, Reuters)",

        "story": "Trump vows to undo Iran deal, NATO funding at AIPAC meeting Leading US Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has received a lukewarm response from pro-Israeli advocates. The mogul toned down his fiery rhetoric for the annual AIPAC conference. In a speech to an influential pro-Israel lobby on Monday, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump vowed to take apart the Iran nuclear deal and strengthen ties with Jerusalem. At the meeting of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), Trump also promised to push back against United Nations interference in Israeli interests. \"My number one priority is to dismantle the disastrous deal with Iran,\" said the Republican front-runner. In a change from his usual firebrand off-the-cuff speeches, Trump made the unconventional decision to read from a teleprompter at Monday's event. According to DW's Richard Walker, the real estate mogul's assertion that he had studied the Iran deal more than anyone else garnered a degree of derision from spectators, but they warmed to him when he promised to revoke the agreement. \"I have been in business a long time. I know deal making. And let me tell you, this deal is catastrophic. For America, for Israel and for the whole of the Middle East,\" Trump said. He then reaffirmed his commitment to side with Israel in peace negotiations with Palestine, promising to resist UN attempts to pressure Israel. \"The Palestinians must come to the table knowing that the bond between the United States and Israel is unbreakable,\" he said. Trump: US can't afford NATO Shortly before addressing the AIPAC event, Trump told an CNN interviewer that he would also move the US embassy to Jerusalem and cut American funding to NATO. \"The fact is I would like to see it moved, I would like to see it in Jerusalem,\" the Republican candidate said. Both Palestine and Israel consider the ancient city their capital, prompting most nations, including the US, to station their missions in the less controversial Tel Aviv. Furthering questioning long-standing Washington policy, Trump also swore to reduce spending to defense organization NATO if elected. \"We are paying disproportionately. It's too much and frankly it's a different world than it was when we originally conceived of the idea,\" he said. \"We have to reconsider.

        "story": "Rolf-Dieter Heuer, Director General of CERN Physicist Rolf-Dieter Heuer is searching for \"what holds the world together at its center\" -- as he once described his passion for research in an interview. As Director General of the European Organization for Nuclear Research CERN near Geneva, the 66-year-old has the best equipment to do just that: a 27-kilometer-long particle acclerator. With it, CERN is seeking the Higgs boson or Higgs particle, which is postulated as the last undiscovered building block of subatomic matter. On \"Talking Germany\", moderator Peter Craven explores the world of particle physics with Rolf-Dieter Heuer. Rolf-Dieter Heuer took on his post as director general at CERN in 2009, when the Swiss-based laboratory was going through a difficult phase. The Large Hadron Collider particle accelerator had broken down shortly after it going online for the first time. The financial crisis was also putting pressure on the budget at the time. Heuer, who describes himself as an incurable optimist, steered CERN successfully through its difficulties. He was born in Boll in the state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg in 1948. His gift for physics attracted notice while he was still at school. He went on to study physics in Stuttgart and got his doctorate in 1977 in Heidelberg. He worked at various institutes in Germany and taught at the University of Hamburg, concentrating on basic research in the field of physics. Although his current position at CERN is more managerial and he himself is not engaged in research there, he sees it as a high point in his career. Rolf-Dieter Heuer lives with his wife in a French town near the border to Switzerland. (First broadcast on 25.03.2013)",

        "story": "China oil drilling sparks violent protest in Vietnam Thousands of workers in southern Vietnam have staged a violent protest against China, trashing property and setting buildings on fire. A dispute over islands in the South China Sea prompted the rampage. On Wednesday, buildings at an industrial park in southern Vietnam showed signs of looting, some standing partially destroyed as the result of a mass protest. Hours earlier, thousands of anti-China demonstrators had rampaged the site. They targeted properties in the Singapore-run park believed to be owned by China companies. Authorities detained some 500 protesters linked to the unrest, according to news agency AFP. \"Extremists\" had aggravated the protests, which began peacefully on Tuesday evening, the deputy head of the province's people's committee, Tran Van Nam, said. At least 15 buildings were set on fire. Anti-China protesters then trashed a number of others. The Chinese government later expressed concern about the incident and had requested that Hanoi take the necessary steps to put the crimes to a stop. Officials from Taiwan also responded to the violent protest, summoning the Vietnamese ambassador, according to news agency DPA. Some of their buildings came under attack by demonstrators who were believed to have mistaken them for Chinese companies. Tuesday's demonstration against Beijing was not the first in Vietnam. Late last week, hundreds of protesters gathered before the Chinese Embassy in Hanoi, expressing their infuriation at the situation. A territorial dispute over the Paracel Islands - known as Hoang Sa in Vietnam and Xisha in China - in the South China Sea sparked the protests. In recent weeks, an oil-drilling venture by China has angered Vietnam. Hanoi claims the drilling is illegal. Beijing has refused to halt operations. Last week, there were reports of clashes between Vietnamese and Chinese vessels in the areas. According to Hanoi, the disputed waters belong to Vietnam's exclusive economic zone as defined by the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. However, Beijing has controlled the islands since seizing them in 1974. kms/mkg (AP, AFP)",

        "story": "Haribo boss Hans Riegel dies aged 90 HAns, RIegel, BOnn: now you know how Haribo got its name. The German candy giant was founded by the Riegel family and was synonymous with Hans Riegel since 1946. The long term leader has died aged 90. A spokesman for Haribo said that the business' chief executive, Hans Riegel, died on Tuesday. Riegel had undergone brain surgery to remove a benign tumor last year. Riegel and his younger brother, Paul, rebuilt their father's company together after the Second World War. Founder Johann Riegel was known as Hans, and had named his company after the first letters in Hans, Riegel, and the business's home city, Bonn. The business grew to be world-renowned for its wide array of candy and sugary treats, not least its Gummib\u00e4rchen, or gummy bears. Under the Riegel brothers' leadership, the company went global \u2013 even exporting its memorable slogan effectively into the English language. \"Kids and grown-ups love it so, the happy world of Haribo\" is an exceedingly loose but rhythmically pleasing translation of the original \"Haribo macht Kinder froh, und Erwachsene ebenso.\" With a keen sense for promotion and marketing, Riegel secured domestic celebrities like extravagant game show host Thomas Gottschalk for prolonged television advertising campaigns. Riegel could be found at the company headquarters, Hans-Riegel-Strasse 1, on most days even into his old age. Haribo employs around 2,000 people and logged turnover of just under 620 million euros ($835 million) in 2011. Haribo's deceased patriarch was awarded The Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany, first class, in 1994 for his social engagement and promotion of sports. Austria also honored Riegel with the golden order of merit for services rendered to the republic of Austria. msh/rg (AFP, dpa)",

        "story": "Germany's young female soccer stars lift World Cup at home Germany has won the U-20 Women's World Cup on home soil after beating Nigeria 2-0 in the final. For star-player Alexandra Popp there was the double glory of being recognized as both top scorer and best player. The German women's Under-21 side lifted the World Cup on home soil after beating Nigeria 2-0 in the final on Sunday. Tournament top scorer Alexandra Popp netted the opening goal at Bielefeld, where the match took place, with teammate Kim Kulig sealing the win in injury time. \"We deserve to be World Champions,\" said team coach Maren Meinert. \"Everything that we dreamed about has come true.\" Indeed, the game opened in fairytale style for the Germans in front of a crowd of 24,633. Just eight minutes had been played when, after a cross Bianca Schmidt, Popp held off two Nigeria defenders to shoot past Nigeria keeper Alaba Jonathan for the first goal. The goal was Popp's tenth of the tournament. The 19-year-old from Duisburg finished as top scorer on 10 goals - hitting the net in all six of Germany's tournament wins. Fighting Falconets Nigeria's young \"Falconets\", the first African women's team to reach the final of any FIFA tournament, tried hard to get back into the game with Germany keeper Almuth Schult tested more than once. The game lost pace in the second half and, although both teams had their chances, Germany looked the more likely to score. The team sealed a victory in the 92nd minute, courtesy of 19-year-old Kulig's header. For Popp, there was the double honor of winning the tournament Golden Boot for scoring the most goals, as well as the best player award for her consistency. \"It was the best day of my football career so far,\" said Popp. In the earlier third place play-off, South Korea defeated Colombia one-nil to take third place. Almost 400,000 fans attended the tournament's 32 games, with Germany set to host the next Women's World Cup in 2011. Author: Richard Connor (SID/dpa) Editor: Nigel Tandy",

        "story": "South Sudan peace negotiators 'met this morning' South Sudan's government and rebels have both claimed that they have finally started peace talks. The talks, held in Ethiopia, are aimed at brokering a ceasefire to end the violence that has rocked the fledgling nation. A series of false starts initially delayed talks, with separate negotiations between intermediaries required and the release of several political prisoners held by Salva Kiir's government a sticking point. But after both sides finally agreed to negotiation regulations on Monday, they claimed that talks finally began the next day. The negotiations have been brokered by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), an eight-nation bloc in Eastern Africa including South Sudan. \"This morning at nine we met,\" South Sudan's Information Minister Michael Makuei told AFP, adding that the topics raised were an end to hostilities and \"the question of detainees.\" Mabior Garang, one of opposition leader Riek Machar's delegation, confirmed to Reuters that talks had begun. Makuei also said, however, that some members of his team had returned to the South Sudanese capital of Juba to consult with the government and that there would be \"no direct negotiations until they come back today.\" Fighting began in the world's most recently formed country on December 15 when President Kiir accused troops loyal to his then-deputy Riek Machar of trying to stage a coup to overthrow him. While Kiir's government remains in power, the ensuing fighting - much of it sectarian between members of rival tribes - has led to more than 1,000 deaths, according to the United Nations. An estimated 200,000 others have fled their homes. Kiir is an ethnic Dinka, while Machar is Nuer - although both leaders claim the conflict is primarily political. Sudan's role increases Sudan, from which South Sudan seceded in 2011 after years of war, has played an increasingly prominent role in a bid to bring peace back to the world's newest county. The still uneasy neighbors remain tied together by their shared oil industry, leading to a visit to Juba by Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir. \"We have come to see what we can do to stop this war knowing all too well that armed conflict would never resolve a problem and also knowing that any problem no matter how complicated can be solved at the negotiation table,\" Bashir said on Monday. ph/msh (AP, AFP, Reuters)",

        "story": "German utilities demand compensation for nuclear exit German energy suppliers are demanding billions of euros in compensation for losses incurred by the phase-out of nuclear power, according to the daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ). The country's biggest utility, E.ON, alone wants at least 8 billion euros ($10 billion) in damages, the paper reported, a figure that has since been confirmed by a company spokesman in Dusseldorf. Altogether, the companies are seeking 15 billion euros ($18.7 billion) in compensation, the FAZ said. The Federal Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe will examine the compensation claims in the coming weeks. Its decision is not expected until late 2013, after Germany's next federal parliamentary election. Lengthy judicial appraisal It will first consult with both houses of the German parliament as well as 63 other organizations, including Greenpeace and the Federation of German Industry (BDI). The constitutional court must then decide whether Germany's exit from nuclear energy violated the constitution before civil courts can rule on possible damages. Both E.ON and its next biggest rival, RWE, have already filed complaints with the constitutional court about Germany's energy turnaround, citing a sharp fall in their profits. The large-scale shutdown of nuclear power plants is to be completed by 2022, with renewables such as power from wind turbines filing the gap in supply. E.ON has said the complaint was not about Germany's phase-out of nuclear power as such - a move that is widely supported by Germany's population - but about the lack of compensation for companies affected by the decision to abandon nuclear energy. Last year, Germany's center-right coalition stalled over a previously legislated phase-out of nuclear power, but went ahead after Japan's reactor catastrophe in Fukushima.

        "story": "Brussels Approves Financial Rescue Plans by Sweden, Portugal The European Commission on Thursday approved packages by Sweden and Portugal to protect financial institutions from the global credit crunch. In both cases, Europe's top state aid watchdog said that the plans respected its guidelines for helping the financial sector cope with the worst crisis in generations without distorting competition. Sweden's plan involves the state providing up to 1,500 billion Swedish kronor (153.8 billion euros, $201 billion) in debt guarantees to banks and other lenders. Portugal's plan envisages similar state guarantees worth 20 billion euros ($26 billion). Plans must follow strict guidelines But while Sweden's was cleared within just three days of it being notified to the commission, the Portuguese plan required negotiations with officials in Brussels over a two-week period. \"The Swedish measures were well-designed and needed little alteration to take full account of the state aid rules' requirements that such schemes are non-discriminatory and minimize potential distortions of competition,\" said Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes. The commission has issued clear guidelines on what governments can and cannot do to protect their countries' financial institutions. Rescue plans have to be limited in time and scope and they should not discriminate against foreign banks operating in the country. They should also be followed up by structural adjustment measures for the financial sector as a whole, while state money should not be used by beneficiaries to attract new business. The commission has already cleared similar rescue plans by Britain, Denmark, Germany and Ireland and is still considering those of, among others, France and Spain.",

        "story": "Bolshoi Theater replaces director Anatoly Iksanov The head of Russia\u2019s Bolshoi Theater has been replaced after a series of scandals including an acid attack against its artistic director. The attack uncovered bitter infighting within the institution. Russian Culture Minister Vladimir Medinsky announced at a press conference Tuesday that Anatoly Iksanov has been replaced as the Bolshoi's director, dismissing the suggestion that Iksanov had been fired. Iksanov, who had held the position for 13 years, sat beside the minister during the announcement. Vladimir Urin, the general director of the Stanislavsky Musical Theater, is to take his place. \"He (Urin) will be able to unite the troupe and continue the development of the best theater in the country and one of the best in the world,\" Medinsky told reporters. \"A difficult situation had developed around the theater and the troupe, and everything pointed to the need for renewal at the theater.\" Speaking to reporters after the announcement, Urin said: \u201cI very much hope that the majority of people working in his theatre - talented, remarkable people - will be my allies,\" Urin said. \"Only together can we solve the problems that, like in any theatre, exist today in the Bolshoi Theater.\" The theater has been in turmoil since January when a masked man threw acid in the face of Sergei Filin, the Bolshoi's artistic director. Last month the Bolshoi said that despite 18 operations, the attack has left Filin blind in one eye and with only about 10 percent vision in the other. A top Bolshoi dancer, Pavel Dmitrichenko, later confessed to hiring two accomplices to attack Filin but said he had not expected acid to be thrown in his face. Theater in-fighting has plagued the Bolshoi Ballet throughout much of the company's history, which spans over 200 years. hc/pfd (Reuters, AFP)",

And what about those people who live prosperous lives - and those who have consciously turned their backs on material wealth? The average German hoards nearly 10,000 things in his or her home - an unimaginable number. We have never possessed so much and bought so much as we do today. But does that make us happy? Scriptwriter J\u00e1nos Kereszti wants to find out and his quest for answers brings him into contact both with people who enjoy the consumer society \u2013 and with those who consciously reject it. He meets a rich businessman's wife from the Allg\u00e4u, drops in on dropouts in the Uckermark region, visits lottery millionaires and a talks to a female student in Frankfurt who dreams of making it in high finance. He also interviews economics professor Niko Paech, who says you have to have enough time to enjoy your possessions: A music lover, for example, won\u2019t be ten times happier buying a hundred CDs a week instead of ten because he just won\u2019t have time to listen to them all. He also asks celebrities such as actor Peter Lohmeyer and top model Sara Nuru what their personal angle on prosperity is. What do these people dream of? How much property makes them happy? His film is a philosophical road movie painting a picture of the material desires and consumer dreams of Germany\u2019s rich and poor.

        "story": "Adidas buys Runtastic in race for fitness apps While the sporting goods industry's major players invest more in digital offerings like fitness apps, Germany's Adidas has been slow on the uptake. But it has now bought Runtastic in a bid to catch up. German sportsgear manufacturer Adidas announced Wednesday it had bought the Runtastic fitness app from German media conglomerate Axel Springer for 220 million euros ($239 million). The announcement came a day before Adidas is expected to announce quarterly figures. The acquisition is in keeping with an industry-wide trend of increased investment into digital fitness tracking - where Adidas has been falling behind. Rival Nike, which has been taking market share away from Adidas, has proven to be more in touch with industry trends. The US firm teamed up with tech giant Apple on the Nike+ running programs for the iPod and iPhone and launched the FuelBand calorie tracker in 2012. Nike isn't the only one outrunning Adidas. Baltimore-based Under Armour overtook Adidas last year as the second-biggest sportswear maker in the US. This year, it bought diet and exercise app MyFitnessPal for 437 million euros and social fitness network Endomondo for 78 million euros. But it took until as late as last year for Adidas to launch its own miCoach fitness device. Now the German company\u2019s new buy has 20 apps covering variety of endurance, health and fitness activities in 18 languages. \u201cDigital technologies are providing new capabilities and insights to help athletes of all levels take control of their sporting destiny \u2013 whether improving their performance, sharing their experiences, or creating their own great social moments of sport,\u201d said Adidas CEO Herbert Hainer in a statement. Runtastic was founded in 2009 and has around 70 million registered users and is available in 18 languages. jd/uhe (dpa, Reuters)",

        "story": "Breivik boastful in Norway massacre trial Anders Behring Breivik has defended his massacre of 77 people in and around Oslo last year, admitting he would 'do it again.' The right-wing extremist returns to the witness stand on Wednesday on day three of his trial. Norwegian extremist Anders Behring Breivik returned to the witness stand on Wednesday a day after declaring he would repeat the killings of 77 people if he had the chance. Breivik showed no remorse for the July massacre on Tuesday as he took the stand for the first time. \"I have carried out the most sophisticated and spectacular political attacks committed in Europe since the Second World War,\" Breivik told the court, reading from a prepared statement. Detailing his anti-Islam, anti-multicultural ideology, he claimed to have acted out of \"goodness, not evil\" to prevent a wider civil war in Europe, insisting \"I would have done it again.\" \"The attacks on July 22 were preventive attacks, and I can therefore not acknowledge criminal guilt,\" Breivik said as the almost hour-long statement came to an end. Judge dismissed Breivik's testimony was delayed on Tuesday after one of the five judges in the trial was dismissed over revelations that he had posted a comment on Facebook saying Breivik deserved the death penalty. \"The death penalty is the only fair outcome in this case!!!!\" citizen judge Thomas Indreboe wrote a day after the July 22 attacks. After a 30-minute recess to reach the decision, Indreboe was replaced by backup lay judge Elisabeth Wisloeff. Breivik, 33, pleaded not guilty on Monday to setting off a car bomb at government headquarters in Oslo before embarking on a shooting spree at a youth summer camp organized by the ruling Labor Party. He claims to have been acting in self-defense to protect Norway from Muslims by attacking the left-leaning political party he blamed for the country's immigration policies. The trial is expected to last up to 10 weeks, with the next five days set aside for Breivik's testimony. ccp/acb (AFP, Reuters, dpa, AP)",

        "story": "Opinion: All Eyes on Germany's President Not from the political elite himself, German President Horst K\u00f6hler faces the politically charged decision of whether or not to dissolve parliament. DW's Wolter von Tiesenhausen looks at K\u00f6hler's first year in office. When he was elected to office last year K\u00f6hler promised to use his position to work on the problems facing Germany and not to let anyone influence his decisions as the country's head of state. It's a promise he's kept by speaking the truth -- even when many may not want to hear it. In the last 12 months, K\u00f6hler, who headed up the International Monetary Fund before returning to Germany last year, has not steered clear of controversy. In fact he's rubbed salt into many of Germany's open wounds by criticizing the German trait of not risking or changing anything and happily taking advantage of social services they do not need. President decides on new elections Most recently, he promised not to be influenced by German Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der's wish for early elections. Now that the Bundestag, Germany's lower house of parliament, has followed Schr\u00f6der's wish of a negative vote of confidence, it will be up to President K\u00f6hler to decide whether to dissolve the parliament. It would go against the many efforts K\u00f6hler has made for change in Germany not to approve the request from all of the country's major political parties and refusing to open the path to new elections a year ahead of time. On the other hand, he is also self-confident and independent enough to push through his own position if he thinks it's the right thing to do -- meaning the election guessing game's next round will now begin. The business-friendly president? Elected by Germany's conservative opposition, union leaders see K\u00f6hler to be too business-friendly but do not take into account the scathing remarks he has had for acquisitive businesses that have often shown a lack of corporate responsibility. If K\u00f6hler has been unable to remain neutral when it comes to Berlin's political wrangling, then it certainly hasn't hurt the public's view of him. That doesn't come as much of a surprise as his job affords him a high profile and limited authority: He's still near the top of public popularity polls, a position envied by just about every other German politician. Even with his limited powers, Horst K\u00f6hler has shown himself to be more than just a yes man who puts his stamp on everything that gets thrown his way. He has remained an influential figure with trips around the globe and continues to work to push Germany forward on the world stage -- work he will most likely continue regardless of who sits in the chancellor's seat this fall.",

        "story": "NATO Troops Killed in Roadside Afghan Blast Five NATO-led troops, three Afghan civilians, two Afghan police officers and five militants were killed in a series of blasts and clashes in Afghanistan. A sixth NATO soldier died in a traffic accident, officials said. In the latest incident, four NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) soldiers were killed in a roadside bomb blast in eastern region of the country, the alliance said in a statement on Sunday, March 15. \"On behalf of ISAF, I offer our sincere condolences to the families and friends of our fallen soldiers,\" Brigadier-General Richard Blanchette, an ISAF spokesperson said in a statement. \"These dedicated professionals have risked their lives for a safe and stable Afghanistan,\" he said. The statement did not disclose the nationalities of the soldiers, nor say where exactly in eastern region the incident took place. Zabiullah Mujahid, a Taliban spokesman said that their forces attacked a US military tank in Kot district of eastern Nangarhar province on Sunday afternoon. It was not immediately clear if the Taliban and NATO statement were referring to the same incident. Meanwhile, a French soldier was killed in a Taliban attack in an area east of Kabul city on Saturday, French Defense Ministry and NATO military in Kabul said. The sixth NATO fatality was a German soldier, who was killed in a traffic accident in northern Afghanistan, the German Defense Ministry said. A British soldier was also killed in an insurgent attack in southern province of Helmand on Saturday, bringing the total number of NATO fatalities to seven in the past two days. Meanwhile, a suicide bomber detonated an explosives-packed vehicle near a convoy of foreign forces in the Afghan capital Kabul on Sunday afternoon, killing two civilians and wounding 14, including several children, Zemarai Bashary, spokesman for the Interior Ministry said. In the south of the country, a roadside bomb targeting Kandahar city's mayor on Sunday killed one bystander and wounded six more civilians, Abdul Khaliq, a senior police official in the province, said. In a separate incident in the same province, US-led coalition forces said they killed five suspected Taliban insurgents and detained four more in an operation in Maiwand district of the province on Sunday morning. The Afghan forces bear the brunt of Taliban attacks in Afghanistan. More than 2,300 police forces were killed in the past two years. Seven years from the ouster of their regime, Taliban militants continue to grow stronger and extend their writ to wider swathes of the country.",

        "story": "Prize for Achievement in African Leadership goes unclaimed, again The Prize for Achievement in African Leadership again has no winner this year, the Mo Ibrahim Foundation has announced. The multi-million dollar prize is for heads of state who have left office in the last three years. The Mo Ibrahim Foundation announced on Thursday that the seven-member prize committee had failed to find a winner for the 2015 award, after no one met the criteria. \"When we launched the prize 10 years ago, we deliberately set a very high bar,\" said chairman of the foundation, Mo Ibrahim, a telecoms entrepreneur. \"We want the prize to shine a spotlight on outstanding leadership to provide role models right across society, as well as supporting laureates to continue to serve the continent by sharing their wisdom and experience.\" Candidates for the prize worth $5 million (4.4 million euros) are former African executive heads of state or government who have left office in the previous three years. The prize has been awarded four times since it was established in 2006: Mozambique's Joaquim Alberto Chissano, Botswana's Festus Gontebanye Mogae, Cape Verde's Pedro De Verona Rodrigues Pires and Namibia's Hifikepunye Pohamba. South Africa's Nelson Mandela was awarded an honorary prize in 2007. The winner receives $5 million over 10 years and then $200,000 a year for life, and can apply for another $200,000 a year for good causes they support. The five criteria for the prize for former leaders include democratic election, serving of a mandated term and the demonstration of exceptional leadership. With offices in London and Senegal, the Mo Ibrahim Foundation is an African Foundation set up \"to put governance at the centre of any conversation on African development. It is our belief that governance and leadership lie at the heart of any tangible and shared improvement in the quality of life of African citizens.\" Some of the African leaders not meeting the criteria are Paul Biya who has been prime minister or president of Cameroon for 40 years, Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, president of Equatorial Guinea for 36 years, Jose Eduardo dos Santos who has been leading Angola as president since 1979 and 92-year-old President Robert Mugabe, who has led Zimbabwe since 1980. jm/sms (Reuters)",

        "story": "Turkey signals Incirlik Air Base access, if Germany \"behaves\" well Access demanded by German parliamentarians to the Incirlik NATO airbase could be restored, says Turkey's foreign minister. Mevl\u00fct Cavusoglu has warned through that any approval will depend on how Berlin \"behaves.\" Cavusoglu's conciliatory signal via the German newspaper \"Die Welt\" Wednesday echoed Chancellor Angela Merkel's claim early this week that she expected \"good news\" in the coming days. Cavusoglu's remark preceded his visit due Wednesday to the Council of Europe in Strasbourg where the 47-nation European body is examining President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's large clampdown on officials and civilians since a failed coup in July. Ankara banned in June access to Incirlik by members of Germany's parliament, which has ultimate say over German troop deployments, in anger at the Bundestag's declaration that 1915 massacres of Armenians by Ottoman Turkish forces amounted to \"genocide.\" Germany budgets investment On Tuesday, the magazine \"Der Spiegel\" said Berlin was prepared to invest in new German facilities at the busy air base in southeastern Turkey. Cavusoglu told \"Die Welt\" Wednesday that if Germany \"behaves as it's doing now we will consider it,\" - implying restoration of parliamentarian access. \"If Germany, however, tries to treat Turkey badly then that will not be the case,\" he said, adding that his country refused to be regarded as a \"second class country.\" The impasse was eased last Friday when the German government said the Bundestag parliament's almost unanimous Armenia resolution was not binding. Merkel subsequently emerged from weekend talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, saying she was hoped the ban would soon be lifted. Based at Ercirlik alongside crews from other nations are some 240 German soldiers and Tornado reconnaissance aircraft involved the international campaign against the jihadist \"Islamic State\" (IS) militia which holds parts of Syria and Iraq. Cavusoglu in Strasbourg In Strasbourg Wednesday, Cavusoglu is due to meet foreign ministers of other Council of Europe nations. NATO said Tuesday its Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg will visit Turkey on Thursday and Friday. It will be his first since the 15 July coup attempt in which more than 270 people were killed. ipj/jil (Reuters, AFD)",

        "story": "Mkhitaryan's farewell letter to Dortmund fans meets with mixed reaction After his move to Manchester United was confirmed by the Premier League giants, Henrikh Mkhitaryan penned an open letter to Borussia Dortmund fans. But the Armenian's farewell note met with mixed reactions. Mkhitaryan, the reigning DW Bundesliga Player of the Season, said in the letter that he feels \u201cprivileged\u201d to have played for the Ruhr area club. \"I will never forget the moments we shared together,\" said Mkhitaryan in a post on his official Facebook page. He also thanked his Dortmund teammates and the BVB fans for all the support he's been given over the years. Some Dortmund fans, however, are less than thrilled by the playmaker's move. Many BVB supporters cite Mkhitaryan's wage demands from the German club as the reason for their displeasure. According to reports, Dortmund had offered the attacker a salary of around 5 million euros a year, which would have made him one of the club's top earners but he rejected it and asked for a transfer in order to land a more lucrative deal elsewhere. His reported deal with Manchester United will see him earning a yearly wage of 10 million euros, double the offer reportedly made by Dortmund. However, plenty of of Twitter users sent Mkhitaryan messages of support and best wishes, while also expressing their sadness at his departure from the Signal Iduna Park. Some fans have drawn comparisons between the Armenian and another former BVB man Mario G\u00f6tze, who signed for Bayern Munich after a 13-year spell with Dortmund. Other Dortmund fans have criticized his failure to take a penalty in the DFB Pokal final against Bayern Munich. Finally, this fan also made a cheeky remark about the fact Mkhitaryan's new club won't play Champions League football this term. Mkhitaryan is the third high-profile player to leave Borussia Dortmund this transfer window, after the departures of Mats Hummels and Ilkay G\u00fcndogan. Dortmund's CEO Joachim Watzke was recently quoted saying that the attacker will end up staying at Dortmund, only to later confirm his move to the Premier League club.",

        "story": "Hecking confident he can lead Gladbach out of danger zone M\u00f6nchengladbach have unveiled their new coach as they prepare to head to their winter training camp. They also appear to be close to signing a defender as they look to put distance between themselves and the drop zone. Dieter Hecking (pictured above, right), who was actually named as the successor to the sacked Andre Schubert after Gladbach's last game of 2016, looked confident as he appeared at Wednesday's press conference alongside sporting director Max Eberl (above left). \"Yes, I know how to be successful. Yes, I know how to deal with young players. Yes, I have previously led teams out of such regions (of the standings),\" Hecking said, referring to the fact that having taken just 16 point from their first 16 matches, the Foals are currently in 14th spot in the Bundesliga standings. However, the 52-year-old Hecking, who began his playing career at the club more than 30 years ago, also said his goals for this season would be modest. \"I am a realist. We are a long way from saying that we intend to finishing in third, fourth or fifth place,\" he said. For his part, Eberl said he was convinced that Hecking was the right man for the job because of his successful track record and the fact that he had proved that he has a knack for working with young players. \"He is a good fit for Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach,\" Eberl said. Although Hecking said that he was convinced that the Foals were already a strong team in terms of personnel, it looks like he will be getting some help for the back line. Eberl confirmed that they were close to signing central defender Thimotee Kolodziejczak from Sevilla. While the two appeared at the press conference, the 25-year-old Kolodziejczak was going through his physical - and is expected to be part of the roster that fly off on Friday for their winter training camp in Marbella, Spain. M\u00f6nchengladbach are Hecking's fifth assignment in the Bundesliga, after previously having coached Alemannia Aachen, Hannover, Nuremberg and Wolfsburg. He was sacked by Wolfsburg in mid-Octoberafter that club too got off to a disappointing start to the season.

        "story": "German lawmakers agree on inheritance tax compromise A parliamentary mediation committee has clinched a long-awaited deal on a required reform of Germany's inheritance tax system. The agreement ended a bitter political dispute that lasted almost two years. The governing parties of Germany's grand coalition government on Thursday agreed to crack down on tax breaks for people inheriting companies. A parliamentary mediation committee representing both houses said heirs should in future still be able to get a 100-percent tax break, if they kept the firm going and preserved the previous employment level. But the committee made it clear that exemptions for businesses worth more than 90 million euros ($100 million) would be done away with, while preferential treatment for those worth more than 26 million euros would be reduced tangibly. The compromise deal is likely to be passed by the Bundestag lower house on September 29 and comes after the country's supreme court rules the previous inheritance tax regulations breached the principle of equal treatment. Not everyone is amused In December 2014, the Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe demanded tighter restrictions for small and medium-sized firms to qualify for generous tax breaks. Germany's DIHK Chambers of Commerce welcomed the compromise, saying it would give family-owned companies more security as they made investment and hiring decisions. It warned, though, that the tax burden for heirs of many bigger firms would rise significantly. With some of the stipulations in the deal leaving room for interpretation, the head of the Ifo economic think tank in Munich, Clemens Fuest, criticized the agreement, describing it as an \"employment program for tax consultants.\" hg/uhe (Reuters, dpa)",

        "story": "Moshammer Killer Gets Life Sentence A Munich court has sentenced Herish Ali Abdullah, a 26-year-old Iraqi, to life in prison for murdering fashion designer Rudolph Moshammer in January. The Munich court convicted Abdullah to murder and robbery resulting in death to a life sentence 10 months after the colorful fashion designer was murdered in his villa in Munich. \"You killed in an insidious manner, out of greed and to make robbery possible,\" Manfred G\u00f6tzl, the leading judge in the case, said to the defendant. Abdullah had taken an unspecified amount of money from Moshammer after the murder, at least one 200-euro bill. Abdullah admitted on the second day of his trial that he killed Moshammer after the designer refused to pay for sex. Moshammer had picked up Abdullah on the evening of Jan.13 near the Munich train station and taken him back to his villa, offering the younger man 2,000 euros ($2,360) to go to bed with him. The Iraqi, who is living in Germany as a refugee, said after the refusal to pay, he wrapped an electrical cord around Moshammer's neck and \"pulled it tight.\" After the designer fell to the ground, Abdullah said he pulled the cord again. Abdullah was arrested two days later after police found his DNA on the cord. Severity of crime The court ruled that the severity of the man's guilt called for Abdullah to serve at least 15 years in prison, with no possibility of early release. The sentence corresponds to the motion put forward by the district attorney, who had asked for the life sentence. The motion accused Abdullah of strangling Moshammer in a particularly insidious manner, saying that the young man had had the intent to rob the designer from the moment that Moshammer picked him up in his Rolls Royce. The defendant's attorneys, on the other hand, had asked that their client be convicted on a charge of manslaughter and had called for a sentence of under ten years. German Eccentric With the death of the 64-year-old Moshammer, Germany lost the man who was once described as the country's \"only genuine eccentric.\" He was instantly recognizable to most Germans with his jet-black bouffant, waxed moustache and Yorkshire terrier Daisy who was always in his arms, or in his lap. Moshammer counted among his clients Arnold Schwarzenegger, now governor of California, tenor Jose Carrera and the Las Vegas-based entertainers Siegfried and Roy. But he was also well-known outside of high-society circles. For his funeral procession, more than 10,000 people lined the streets of Munich.",

They hope to extract DNA from the skeleton and determine who he was. Archaeologists discovered a 2,000-year-old skeleton in a shipwreck off the coast of the Greek island of Antikythera. If they are able to extract DNA from the remains, they can get an accurate genetic profile of the man who was on the ship, including hair and eye color and ancestral origin. It is very rare to find a skeleton in the sea, as human remains are usually eaten by fish or swept away over time. It is especially rare to find a well-preserved skeleton, including a partial skull, two arm bones, several ribs and two femurs. \"It doesn't look like bones that are 2,000 years old,\" said Hannes Schroeder, a DNA analysis expert from the Denmark Museum of Natural History. \"Archaeologists study the human past through the objects our ancestors created,\" said co-director of the excavation, Brendan Foley, a marine archaeologist with Massachusetts-based Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. \"With the Antikythera shipwreck, we can now connect directly with this person who sailed and died aboard the Antikythera ship,\" Foley said. The Institution is working on the excavation with the Greek culture ministry. The Antikythera shipwreck was first discovered by in 1900 and is believed to be the first wrecked ship ever investigated by archaeologists. The first major find in the ship was the \"Antikythera Mechanism,\" an item from 2nd century BC and is occasionally referred to as the world's oldest computer. It modeled the motions of the sun, moon and planets and is composed of many cogs and gears. The ship also contained marble statues, tableware, and thousands of other artifacts. There were other skeletons found in the ship, but they were discovered before DNA testing was available. kbd/jm (AFP, AP)",

The rallies are being staged by anti-Islamist, extreme leftist and Carnival groups, among others. Sunday's demonstrations center around a protest planned by the so-called Hooligans Against Salafists (HoGeSa) group, an anti-Islam organization that last year caused riots in the city at a similar demonstration. The Cologne chapter of \"anti-Islamization\" movement PEGIDA, which has its base in the eastern city of Dresden, is also expected to stage a rally. At the same time, a number of counter-protesters opposing the anti-Islam, anti-immigration stance of such groups have also gathered in the inner city. They include radical leftist \"autonomous\" demonstrators carrying banners with the slogan: \"Germany, keep your mouth shut!\" Other counter-demonstrators come from the city's vibrant Carnival scene. DW's Milan Gagnon is reporting from Cologne. Some 3,500 police have been deployed to try to keep the peace in Cologne, with around 23,000 people from the competing sides expected to take to the streets. Several water cannons are also on hand, and a helicopter is surveilling the city from above. Police tried to have the HoGeSa demonstration banned in the days leading up to the demonstration, citing last year's violence on October 26 in which at least 44 police were injured. But a court on Wednesday ruled against prohibiting the rally, stipulating only that it had to take place at a fixed location rather than include a march through the streets. Police did, however, manage to have the HoGeSa demonstration moved from last year's location at the main railway station to the other side of the river in the Deutz district. tj/cmk (AFP, dpa)",
