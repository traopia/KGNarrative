        "target": "Opinion: Obama's Cuban revolution President Barack Obama has made a very special declaration of love to Cuba. It's as revolutionary as the Cuban revolution, and as peaceful as the biblical Sermon on the Mount, says DW's Astrid Prange. US President Barack Obama has lost his old communist \"enemy,\" and Cuban President Raul Castro has lost his hatred of capitalism. In the first phone call from president to president since 1961 the two heads of state came to a surprisingly swift agreement. They want to renew diplomatic relations, which have been on ice for more than 50 years, and exchange ambassadors. It's only a matter of time before the US lifts its trade embargo against Cuba. All the word \"embargo\" is really good for - at this stage - is as an ideological soapbox for political hardliners, especially Republicans in Congress who believe lifting sanctions would constitute defeat for the US. Yet the lifting of the embargo has already begun. In addition to medication, it has been possible since 2000 to export agricultural produce such as maize, cereal crops, and poultry to Cuba. Flirting with the rogue state Furthermore, 100,000 US citizens have travelled to Cuba since 2011 for cultural and scientific exchanges. Travel restrictions on Cubans living in exile in the US who wanted to visit their relatives on the island were also lifted. According to press reports, the two countries' military forces are even said to be cooperating, as are their coastguards, and military on the border of the US marine base in Guantanamo. Now Obama wants to officially open a \"new chapter\" in relations with the communist Caribbean island and remove Cuba from the US list of so-called \"rogue states\" that support terrorism. The travel ban on American tourists visiting the island will also largely be lifted. That's as far as things will go for the time being, as Obama would require a majority in Congress in Washington to lift the embargo entirely. But even if these are only small steps, the fall of the American-Cuban wall has begun. The easing of the sanctions and the resumption of diplomatic relations are setting the scene for an end to the embargo. Embargo as scapegoat The tearing down of this \"wall in the mind\" is long overdue. The blockade is obsolete, and has proved to be entirely ineffective. More than this, its advocates have achieved the opposite of what they actually wanted. The blockade has provided the leaders in Havana with an easy excuse for their economic failure. Raul Castro realized long ago that Cuba's economic problems can no longer be justified simply by citing the US embargo. It looks as though he was counting on the blockade being lifted: There is no other explanation for the completion of the Mariel container port in January this year. Cuba's biggest infrastructure project was, incidentally, financed by Brazil. The Brazilians also sent a declaration of love to Cuba. Raul Castro opened the door to them. He loves anyone who helps him - his friends even more than his enemies.",
        "generated_story": "The Fall of the Wall in the Mind of Cuban President Barack Obama In his first speech as US president, the Cuban government announced the fall of its wall in Havana. The move marked the end of a decades-long struggle between the United States and the communist regime in Cuba. In a speech delivered to the nation's Congress in January this year, Cuban president Raul Castro said that his country was in a \"state of crisis\" and that it was \"in a state of emergency.\" \"The Cuban people are in crisis,\" he said. \"They are facing a crisis of their own. They are going to have to deal with the consequences of this crisis.\" Obama's speech was accompanied by excerpts from his book Sermon on the Mount, in which he talks about the struggle for a better future for the country. He also spoke of his desire to build a stronger and more inclusive Cuba, a country that has suffered a lot under the dictatorship of Fidel Castro, who was overthrown in 1961 by a military coup. Obama has been criticized by many in his own party for his lack of commitment to human rights. But he has also made clear that he will not back down from the fight against the Castro regime. Astrid Prange, Brazilians' representative in Congress, told DW: \"I think it's time for Cuba to come to terms with its past and to move on from what it has done. I think that's the right thing to do, but I don't know what the future holds for it.\" The president is also a strong supporter of democracy, and he is not afraid to criticize the ruling Communist regime, which has ruled Cuba since 1961. However, he does not believe that democracy is the only way to solve the problems of poverty and inequality. That's why he wants to make Cuba a model for other countries to follow. It's not just Cuba that is at the center of Latin America's political and economic problems. There's also the question of whether or not the government will be able to provide the basic services that the people of Cuba need in order to live a democratic and prosperous life. This is a question that will come up again and again in future elections. What do you think will happen in 2011 and 2012? What will you do with all the money that you have in your bank account? Do you want to give it to your family? You can't give up on your own family. You've got to work for your country.\""

Renzi faces a political challenge in organizing a replacement for Napolitano, dubbed by Italian media as \"King George.\" The president has served as a key intermediary between political parties through numerous changes in government and other tricky political situations. Napolitano, a former communist respected by Europe and Washington, took office in 2006. At the end of his seven-year mandate in 2013, he was asked to stay on because parliament could not agree on his successor. At the time he warned he may not serve out the full term, given his age. In Italy, presidents have loosely-defined powers including the ability to nominate prime ministers, dissolve parliament and veto legislation, as well as use the moral authority of the office to influence politics. se/cmk (dpa, Reuters)",

The spokesman said more help was needed, but could not give exact numbers \"due to pending assignments.\" Recent soccer violence raises concern Swiss media has been questioning the security preparations for Euro 2008 after a spate of violence at recent games. In the latest incident, seats were ripped out and a goal post wrenched from the ground after St. Gallen faced the prospect of relegation following a 2-0 defeat to Bellinzona on May 20. St. Gallen was the third incident in a month that saw violent clashes with police who twice resorted to rubber bullets and tear gas. While Switzerland is seen as a low risk country in terms of hooliganism, violence has been on the increase in recent years and estimates claim there are around 400 hooligans and 600 sympathizers. Swiss Sports Minister Samuel Schmid said that hooliganism cannot be ruled out, reported German news agency DPA. But he expressed his belief that extra measures such as more policing, restrictions on alcohol -- which he has called \"a catalyst for violence\" -- and video surveillance will help keep trouble at bay. Private firms to boost European police The private security companies will be responsible for patrolling the stadiums and their surroundings, as well as the public viewing areas, team hotels and trainings areas. An international police force will manage the rest. Switzerland has committed some 31,200 police officers and soldiers.

Private firms have been hired to provide security for the tournament, which kicks off on Monday, May 26, in St. Gallen. The move comes two years ago when Swiss President Urs Stadler announced that he would be stepping down as head coach of his country's soccer team. \"I have decided to step down,\" he said in an interview with the DPA news agency, adding that the decision was made \"in the best interest of our country.\" The announcement came as the Swiss soccer federation announced plans to hire private security firms, including Protectas, Prisec and Tages Anzeiger, to assist in the preparation of matches. Protecta, a Swiss security firm, said it had been contracted by the government to act as a liaison between the country and the security forces. It was not immediately clear whether the move would have a positive impact on security, but it is believed that it will have an effect on the way the games are being played. According to a press release issued on May 20, the firm will be working closely with Swiss authorities to ensure that all security measures are in place before the competition begins. However, it did not say how much it would cost. 'We are going to do everything we can to make sure that we are doing everything possible,' the statement said. In the event of a terrorist attack, security experts are expected to be deployed to the venues. They will also be stationed in venues around the city of Zurich, where the matches will take place, as well as in other cities in Switzerland, Germany, Austria, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Switzerland and Spain. A security expert said that there was a \"very good chance\" that security would not be disrupted by terrorist attacks."

Conservative members of Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition put forward a united front at the weekend against recent developments in the city of Wuppertal. Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said civilians wearing uniforms bearing the logo \"Shariah police\" could not simply start patrolling German streets. The groups reportedly hovered around sites like discotheques and gambling houses, telling passers-by to refrain from gambling and alcohol. Wuppertal's police have begun pressing charges. \"Sharia law is not tolerated on German soil,\" de Maiziere told mass-circulation daily Bild on Saturday. \"Nobody can take it upon themselves to abuse the good name of the German police.\" Justice Minister Heiko Maas, meanwhile, told Bild that \"the state alone\" was responsible for the administration of justice in Germany. It was obvious, Maas said, that any illegal parallel system of law enforcement would not be tolerated. Christian Democrat party whip Volker Kauder was similarly emphatic in an interview to be published in this week's Welt am Sonntag newspaper. \"Under absolutely no circumstances can we tolerate self-styled 'Sharia police officers' patrolling our streets and dictating what people should or should not do,\" Kauder said. Ringleader: goal was attention The 33-year-old behind the Wuppertal patrols, former fireman Sven Lau, published a video on his website on Saturday. Lau said that a \"Sharia police\" never existed, and that a group of men had simply worn the mock uniforms for a few hours. \"We knew that this would raise attention,\" Lau said, claiming that his goal was to spark a debate about Sharia law in Germany. Lau is a leading member of Germany's Salafist movement, advocates of a strict Sunni interpretation of political Islam. He works with a mosque in his native M\u00f6nchengladbach, not far west of Wuppertal, and used to head the fundamentalist group \"Invitation to Paradise.\" (Einladung zum Paradies, in German.) The central council of Muslims in Germany (ZMD) condemned the activities. \"These few teen yobs do not speak in our name,\" chairman Ayman A. Mazyek told the Tagesspiegel am Sonntag newspaper. \"These people are perverting the name of our religion. With this shrill and foolish action, they are really hurting Muslims.\" Sharia law is the Arabic term for a legal system based on the Koran. Saudi Arabia and Iran are examples of countries where such a system officially applies. Wearing a veil is obligatory for women and corporal punishment such as stoning is legally tolerated. Human Rights Watch reported last month that Saudi Arabia had beheaded 19 people in just 16 days in August, for convictions on charges ranging from cannabis smuggling to \"sorcery.\" msh/rc (AFP, dpa, Reuters)",

He said the police were \"in a state of shock\" and that they had \"no choice but to use Sharia law.\" \"This is not the way of the world,\" the ministry spokesman said, adding that it was \"not acceptable\" for police to carry out such a practice. The ministry's spokesman, Volker Kauder, said he had no comment on Lau's statement, but he did say that \"it is unacceptable\" that police would use \"Islamic law\" against Muslims. kauder added that there was no justification for the practice of Sharia in Germany, which is punishable under German law by a fine of up to \u20ac1,000 (\u20ac2,500) for crimes against humanity."

In the United States, WHO has called for urgent action against the spread of Ebola, saying it could lead to a \"total and complete eradication of all forms of infectious disease.\" The UN has also called on countries to step up their efforts to fight the disease, including the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe and the Philippines. It is also calling for an end to Ebola's spread to all of Africa by August 8, when it is believed to have killed at least 2,500 people and infected 1.5 million people between May 24 and August 13. At the same time, there is a growing concern that Ebola is spreading to other countries, particularly in developing countries such as the Middle East, Africa and Asia, where it has been spreading rapidly and is now at the highest level since the WHO began tracking the virus in 2004. Health officials have said they expect to see an increase in cases by the end of August, but they have yet to say how many cases have been reported so far.

The Luxembourg-based court thus sided with the German firm UsedSoft in a protracted legal battle with US software giant Oracle. The ruling made it clear that trade in used software was permissible even if the software had not been shipped on a physical medium such as a CD or DVD, but had been digitally downloaded from the Internet. UsedSoft's business model hinges completely on reselling used packages or legally obtained license keys for them. By reselling the keys to clients, the latter are then able to download the latest version of a given program directly from a company's Internet site and obtain all new updates and patches in the process. Legal clarity Oracle had sued UsedSoft over its business model, trying to prevent buyers of used software licenses from downloading programs again. But the European court ruled that the so-called principle of exhaustion applied whenever software was originally sold to a customer for an unlimited time span, not giving the maker of the software the right to prevent the resale of that software. \"The door for the trade in used software has been pushed wide open throughout the European Union,\" UsedSoft said in a statement, welcoming \"perfect legal safety on the market.\" The court in Luxembourg emphasized, though, that whoever resold pieces of original software and their accompanying licenses must erase every copy on their own computers in advance and was not allowed to keep a copy after resale. hg/mz (AFP, dpa)",

The Mars rover landed in the giant Gale Crater, near the Martian equator, on August 5; it has so far moved about 109 meters within the crater. The rover is traveling east, heading first to an intersection called Glenelg, where three types of terrain meet. This is likely to be the location for the first rock and soil samples, though NASA said Curiosity was unlikely to arrive there for several weeks. Curiosity's ultimate destination is the nearby Aeolis Mons or Mount Sharp, a 3-mile-high mound of rock rising out of the crater. Mount Sharp is about 4.3 miles (7 kilometers) away from Curiosity's landing site. The $2.5-billion (1.93-billion-euro) six-wheeled rolling science lab is designed to last two years in order to complete its Mars mission. msh/jm (AFP, AP, Reuters)",
        "generated_story": "Curiosity's self-testing has been a success NASA's Curiosity rover has successfully tested the Martian surface for the first time in two years. The rover, which was launched on Wednesday as part of a two-year mission to explore the Red Planet, has so far been successful in testing the surface of the planet's surface. On Thursday, NASA announced that the rover had been able to test the interior of Gale Crater, one of its most famous craters on Mars. \"We're very pleased with the results,\" said Jennifer Tropser, Curiosity's lead scientist and project manager. Troopser said the team was \"very pleased\" with its results, adding that \"the rover is doing a great job.\" \"It's a big step forward,\" she said. Read more: Mars rover Curiosity has a lot of work to do on the red planet, but it's still a long way to go before it can be used as a scientific tool for Mars exploration, she added. In the end, it will be up to Curiosity to figure out how to get the most out of it, as well as how much it would cost to build a new rover. So far, so good, in fact, that's what we're looking at. We're going to see how long it takes to develop a rover that can do this kind of thing. And we'll see if we can get it right. It's not just the Curiosity team that is working on this. There's also the fact that we've got a team of scientists who are working with us to try and find out what's going on in the rock. They're working very hard to make sure that everything's working as it should be, and they're doing it very, very well. I'm really excited about this, because I don't know what the future holds for Curiosity. What do you think will happen when we get to Mars? Do you have any ideas? We'll have to wait and see what happens. You can't just say 'yes' or 'no' to everything. That's why I think we have a good chance of success. Curiosity is a very good rover and we are very happy with how well it has done. All of our tests have been very successful. Our goal is to find the exact location of all the rocks and minerals that make up our planet. But we also want to know where they are, what they look like, how they've been made and what kinds of rocks are they like.\" The team is also working closely with scientists from the University of California, Los Angeles, to determine if they can use the samples for their own research."

        "target": "Aging health: WHO call to action as world population over 60 set to double by 2050 In a new report on aging and health, the World Health Organization is calling for action on \"population aging,\" as figures suggest the number of people over 60 will reach two billion by 2050. People worldwide are living longer, says the World Health Organization in its World Report on Aging and Health. This is both good and bad. It gives us the chance to \"pursue new activities\" as we get older, such as in education and family life. But it all depends on our health. And for that the WHO says world governments need to act now to make sure our societies worldwide are ready. What are the take home facts from the World Health Organization's 2015 report on Aging and Health? The WHO says that in the next 35 years, the global number of people aged 60 years and over will almost double from 12 percent to 22 percent. By 2020, there will be more people over the age of 60 than 5 year olds. And a majority of older people (80 percent) will live in \"low and middle income\" countries. It's estimated that the world's population aged 60 years and older will total about 2 billion in 2050, which is more than twice as much as now. Furthermore, worldwide, about 125 million people are aged 80 years or older. But by 2050, it is expected that this number of people - aged 80 and over - will live in China alone. But I'm not old, so why should I care? Well, all this is happening at a faster rate than ever before. And the WHO says \"all countries face major challenges to ensure that their health and social systems are ready\" for this major demographic shift. It will cost a lot of money to improve health and social infrastructures, especially in more developed countries where traditional families structures have changed dramatically. Surely, there's \"no typical older person,\" though. How does the WHO define aging? We tend to think of older people as physically and mentally frail. But that's not necessarily the case, not everywhere in the world. Old is a relative concept - especially in middle income to rich countries. For instance, some 70 year olds are as fit as some 20 year olds. Just think how many older folk are at your gym, and ask yourself whether you can keep up with all of them. But that still doesn't explain aging. What is it exactly? The WHO says that at a biological level, \"aging results from the impact of the accumulation of a wide variety of molecular and cellular damage over time.\" Basically, this puts people at a higher risk of disease and, of course, death. But aging can also be associated with \"life transitions,\" such as retirement or witnessing other people, such as friends and family, die around you. This can affect you psychologically and sometimes, as a result, physically. What sort of diseases come with old age? Some of the most common non-fatal conditions include hearing loss, cataracts, back and neck pain and osteoarthritis. Other conditions include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - which affects the lungs - diabetes, depression, and dementia. What needs to be done? The WHO is proposing a five-step plan of action, which includes: Committing to healthy aging and \"evidence-based policies to strengthen the abilities of older persons.\" Aligning health systems with the needs of older populations Developing systems for providing long-term care Creating \"age-friendly cities and communities Improving measurement, monitoring and understanding of \"aging issues\" worldwide. But don't forget: \"a longer life brings with it opportunities, not only for older people and their families, but also for societies as a whole.\"",
        "generated_story": "WHO's Population Aging Plan: Actions Now The World Health Organization (WHO) has announced plans to reduce the number of people living in poverty by 60 years by 2050. The plan is aimed at reducing the amount of deaths in the next 35 years. In a report released in 2015, the WHO said that 60 percent of the world's population would die by the age of 60. According to the World Report on Aging and Health, this number is expected to rise to 80 percent by 2020. However, some 20 year olds will still have to wait until they reach 80 years of age to be able to live on their own, according to WHO. \"This is not an easy task,\" the report said, adding that it would be \"difficult and expensive\" to tackle the problem. It also pointed out that older people are more likely to die of old age than younger people, due to a combination of factors, such as the aging of older adults and a lack of physical and mental capacity to cope with life's challenges. Some 70 year old men and women have already reached 60, while others have reached 80. This is a new milestone for the global health organization, which has been working on a plan to cut down on the deaths of some 70 million people by 2040. But it is still unclear how long the plan will take to reach its goal of reducing mortality rates by at least 20 percent. What's more, it's not clear how many of these people will die before they are 80, or if they will even be alive at all. There are also concerns about the long-term effects of aging on people's health and well-being. For example, there are fears that the death toll from cancer could rise by up to 30 percent in 20 years compared to today's average age. These fears have been exaggerated, however, by some experts, who say that in order to prevent the spread of cancer, we need to make sure that people who are already suffering from the disease don't die from it. That's why we are now looking at a population aging plan that is more ambitious than the current one. We have a long way to go before we can make a decision on whether or not we want to see more people dying from old-age diseases. And we have an opportunity to do that now. So we're going to take action now, and we will do it in a way that will make it easier for people to get on with their lives. I think that's a good thing, because it will give us a lot of time to think about what we should be doing in terms of our own lives and how we'll be living longer and more effectively in our lifetime.\""

It is a reflection of his current inauspicious Formula One campaign that World Champion Michael Schumacher is only featuring in reports on this weekend's German Grand Prix at Hockenheim dues to his nationality. The home grown champion equaled his own record of 11 wins in a season at last year's race but this year he will be hoping to just get on the podium at the end. Schumi lies in third place some 34 points off the top spot and has a lot to do if he is to record his 85th career win. Ferrari's poor season to date is unlikely to get better with hopes dwindling that the 36-year-old will add to his sole victory of the season although the seven-time world champion characteristically refuses to rule it out. Schumi and Ferrari still in the fight \"Contrary to many other people's opinions, we have in no means written ourselves off, even though we have to admit that the situation has worsened recently, rather than improved,\" said the German, referring to the problems with this season's car. \"But that doesn't mean that it can't be improved again, and that's exactly what we're working on.\" The limelight is falling on two young pretenders to Schumacher's throne as Sunday's race approaches. The battle between McLaren's flying Finn Kimi Raikkonen and championship leader Renault's speedy Spaniard Fernando Alonso is diverting eyes from the world record holding German on his own turf. Kimi aims to keep heat on leader Alonso Raikkonen must finish the German Grand Prix for the first time in five attempts to close the gap on Alonso if he is to keep his own championship hopes alive. The Finn retired from last year's race because of a rear wing failure and this season has been plagued by technical problems which most recently cost him 10 places on the starting grid in each of the last two rounds. Despite those penalties for engine failure, the 25-year-old managed to finish second and third but he will have to increase his total of three race wins if he is to make a significant impression on the 26-point chasm that separates him from Alonso. \"The battle for the championship is still on and I am determined to get a good result and work on closing the gap,\" said the Finn. \"The (car) has good speed and we need to make the most of it this weekend.\" Montoya doing McLaren team mate no favors Raikkonen's car is obviously a fast one this season but he's not the only driver in a McLaren hot seat. Colombia's Juan Pablo Montoya is not to going to make way for his team mate while his own hopes of the title, however small, remain alive. \"I am really looking forward to racing again this weekend in Germany,\" said Montoya, who won at Hockenheim for Williams two years ago and got his first victory for McLaren in Britain two weeks ago. \"I enjoy racing at Hockenheim, I have performed well here and won in the past and I am aiming for a strong result like at Silverstone.\" Consistent Ferdy the man to beat at Hockenheim Championship leader Alonso, meanwhile, has been impressively consistent for Renault so far this season, winning five times and failing to score points only at the Canadian Grand Prix, where he crashed, and in Indianapolis. The Spaniard is setting the pace and the standard this season so, problems aside, Alonso will again be the man to beat at Hockenheim.",
        "generated_story": "Fernando Alonso and Kimi Raikkonen in the title battle at Hockenheim Ferrari's Fernando Alonso is set to take on McLaren's Juan Pablo Montoya at the German Grand Prix on Sunday. The Spaniard and the Ferrari driver are locked in a three-way battle for the Formula One title this weekend. Alonso, who has won the last three races of his career, will be looking to extend his winning streak to five races this year. \"I'm really looking forward to the challenge,\" Alonso said after Sunday's race, adding that he was \"very happy\" with the way his car performed at Silverstone. He also said he wanted to get back into the race with his team-mates in order to improve on their performance in Canada, where he finished fourth in last year's championship. 'I want to make sure that I'm not going to give up on the sport' The two-time world champion has a lot to prove when it comes to his ability to win races in Germany and Canada. It's not just about the cars, it's also about how well he's been able to compete in Formula 1 this season. That's the main reason why he has been so successful so far in his first season with McLaren. And that's because he knows how much he can do. But he doesn't know how good he'll be when he gets back on track. In the end, he will have to settle for second place in qualifying, which he won last time out in Toronto in 2015. Ferrari, meanwhile, is hoping to keep up the pace with Williams and Ferrari. They have a good track record in both the Canadian and Canadian races, with Ferrari having the fastest time of the season and Williams the only team with a faster car. Hamilton, however, has the advantage in terms of pace and power, while Ferrari has to rely on its power and speed to reach the top-five. Schumacher, the former Ferrari and McLaren driver's teammate, said the two drivers had a great relationship, and that they had \"a lot in common.\" \"It's great to see them working together,\" Hamilton said of Hamilton and his Ferrari teammate Alonso. Both drivers have been on a collision course with each other for two years now, but Hamilton's Williams driver Alonso has yet to set a new record for fastest lap at a German race. On the other hand, Hamilton has never won a race at his home track in North America since he moved to Canada in 2009, when his McLaren team moved there from the United States. Williams' Williams teammate Carlos Sainz was also in attendance at last weekend's Canadian GP."

She will share the prestigious award with US compatriot Oliver Williamson. The jury from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said the Americans' research had shown how \"economic analysis can shed light on most forms of social organization.\" Ostrom, a professor at Indiana University, was honored for her \"analysis of economic governance,\" especially in relation to the management of common property or property under common control. The political scientist's work challenges the widely accepted belief that common property is poorly managed and should be either regulated by central authorities or privatized, it added. She carried out numerous studies showing how self-organization and local-level management work to keep common resources viable. Her studies included both natural resources, such as forests, and artificial structures, for example police forces. Ostrom told Swedish television that she felt \"great surprise and appreciation\" and was \"in shock\" about being the first woman to win the prize. The pros and cons of big firms In his work, co-prizewinner Oliver Williamson, of University of California, Berkeley, examines why large corporations tend to arise - and why they do not - based on the cost and complexity of transactions, according to the Nobel committee. \"He has taught us to regard markets, firms, associations, agencies, and even households from the perspective of their contribution to the resolution of conflict,\" the jury said. Williamson authored 'The Economic Institutions of Capitalism' in 1975, a landmark text of the 'new institutional economics' movement that questioned the idea of firms as simple profit-making machines. Last but not least The Nobel prize for economics is the only Nobel award that was not created by the will of Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel in 1896. It was actually founded by the Swedish central bank, the Sverige Riksbank, to celebrate its tri-centenary a year earlier. It was awarded for the first time in 1969 under its official name: the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel. But although it was the last \"Nobel prize\" to be created and the last to be announced each year, the prize is not a poor relation in monetary terms. Winners of the awards for peace, literature, medicine, physiology, chemistry and physics all receive 10 million Swedish crowns (969,000 euros). A good year for women This year was a record year for women laureates. German-Romanian writer Herta Mueller won the Nobel Prize for Literature. Australian-American Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider of the United States were awarded the prize for medicine. And Ada Yonath of Israel was one of three scientists recognized for her work in chemistry. Americans more or less swept the board this year. Nine of the 11 laureates were US citizens.

        "target": "The Sun Sets Slowly Over Brandenburg's Tropical Dream Having suffered many disappointments concerning publically funded projects, the state of Brandenburg hoped a tropical leisure center would offer a ray of hope. Instead the ailing concern is just bringing more gloom. The economically depressed eastern German state of Brandenburg has seen its fair share of bitter experiences when it comes to huge public investment projects since German unification in 1990. Against this background, state authorities were pleased when Malaysian businessman Colin Au built a huge tropical-feeling leisure center in Brandenburg without any subsidies. The center, which opened about a year ago, was to become a symbol of economic success in a region where unemployment still hovers around the 20 percent mark. But the leisure time park, which has already swallowed a little under 100 million euros ($120 million) in private investment, is now going to have to depend on public funding to avoid another economic fiasco in Brandenburg. State authorities in Brandenburg haven't been too successful in their public investment policy in the past 10 years, to put it mildly. A grand plan to build one of the world's most modern chip-producing factories there burst like a bubble in 2003. The much-talked about Brandenburg-Berlin International airport still seems light years away from being built. Line of failures looked to be ended by Au's vision Another beacon of economic hope disappeared in 2002 when a company planning to build gas-filled transport airships went bust despite considerable subsidies. But Au's vision for the abandoned dome which the airship company needed as a hangar offered Brandenburg another chance. In the middle of nowhere, he created what he named his \"Tropical Islands\" wonderland, sporting everything from sandy beaches, lakes and a Laguna to a Caribbean-style village. The economics ministry in Brandenburg was over the moon to see Au originally agreeing to build the facility without any state subsidies. And Au himself had no doubt at the time that he could well do without them. Overestimated visitor numbers tell sorry story But the center's first year in operation tells a different story. Colin Au, who has meanwhile left Brandenburg and transferred matters to a German management company, had expected some 1.5 million visitors to come to Tropical Islands within the first year, but only some 950,000 will have turned up by the end of 2005. It seems highly unlikely that visitor numbers will increase considerably in future, placing a question mark on the viability of the whole centre. But Brandenburg's economics ministry is certain that the park will be in the black as of 2008. To make the place more attractive, it has agreed to shell out 15 million euros in subsidies for yet another reconstruction and marketing effort. After all, the leisure time center has a workforce of about 500 and is thus the biggest employer in an otherwise depressed region marked by a high jobless rate. Tropical center down but not out...not yet \"We hope the money will help make the Tropical Islands resort better known throughout Europe according to the new marketing concept hammered out the management,\" ministry spokesman Steffen Kammrath said. \"This leisure time center is unique and has to be marketed as such. What you have there is a tropical and water world 12 months a year with a lot of attractive offers to spend a whale of a time there.\" Some commentators believe that state subsidies may prolong the center's life span, but will not be able to avoid its demise in the long run. But the idea of also making it more attractive for tourists from all over Europe seems unrealistic to them if the resort's management can't even get enough visitors from home to ensure a profitable operation.",

In 2003, the resort opened its doors to the public. Since then, it's become one of Germany's most popular tourist destinations, attracting a total of 120 million euros ($120 million) a year, according to its website. \"The sun is setting slowly on this tropical island,\" said Colin Au, chief marketing officer at the brandenburg-Berlin International resort.

But he also pointed out that there was still a lot of work to do before the opening date, as well as the need for more staff and more time to develop the facility. So, he added, \"We're going to have to make sure that we're doing everything we can to get the best possible results for our guests.\" A little under 100 million Euros The hotel has been open since 2002, with the aim of expanding its business to include hotels, restaurants, bars and restaurants in Europe, Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East. A lot has changed since the beginning of 2004, when the hotel was opened. Now it is open to tourists from around the world, including the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, India, China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and South Africa. There are also plans to open a restaurant, a hotel and a spa. However, there is no guarantee that this will happen, because the staff will not be able to stay there for long. That's why the company has decided to invest in a new restaurant and spa in order to expand the business."

        "target": "Bayern's Klinsmann Praises, Hoeness Attacks Hoffenheim The Bundesliga's two top teams don't play until Friday, but the mind games are already underway. Bayern's coach Juergen Klinsmann says Hoffenheim are legitimate contenders, but commercial manager Uli Hoeness disagrees. When the Bundesliga scheduled Bayern's home match against Hoffenheim in the league's unloved Friday night slot, they probably didn't imagine that it would turn out to be the match of the first half of the season. Indeed, few experts or fans thought that Hoffenheim, a first-division debutante located in a southern German village with 3,000 inhabitants, would give mighty Munich a run for its money. But it's the first week of December, and Hoffenheim top the table by three points. They also have a much better goal difference than their second-placed rivals -- and that has drawn praise from Bayern's coach, Juergen Klinsmann. \"I have the highest estimation of Hoffenheim because they've built the squad very ambitiously, rationally and with very good players,\" Klinsmann told DPA news agency. \"They can be proud of that.\" Klinsmann said he thought that the club could establish itself among the top three or four sides in Germany in the years to come and qualify for international competition next season. He also had words of praise for Hoffenheim's software billionaire patron, Dietmar Hopp, whose money has funded the club's ascent. \"There's nothing negative about it,\" Klinsmann said. \"He used to play for the club, is a soccer man through and through and helped the team get on its feet.\" Some fans have criticized Hopp and Hoffenheim for paying inflating salaries and luring talent away from other clubs instead of developing homegrown players. In fact, Hoffenheim's official salary budget is about average for the Bundesliga. Hoeness sounds his horn But while Bayern's coach was praising his opponents to the skies, Munich's commercial manager Uli Hoeness has been trying to play with their heads. On the heels of Bayern's convincing win over Leverkusen last weekend, Hoeness is back to taunting rivals. \"The performance we showed in the second half against Leverkusen will be enough against Hoffenheim,\" Hoeness told the German soccer magazine kicker. Hoeness also dropped a none-too-thinly-veiled hint that Hoffenheim's personnel expenditures were far higher than the officially released figures and scoffed at the idea that strategy would determine the outcome of Friday's match. \"Games are decided by the better players, not by tactics,\" Hoeness said. \"And of course, we've got better players than Hoffenheim.\" But that particular verbal attack may represent some wishful thinking of the manager's part. Hoffenheim coach Ralf Rangnick is one of only two current Bundesliga skippers with a winning record against Munich. Rangnick, whose team cruised past Bielefeld last weekend to keep Bayern three points back, reacted to Hoeness' remarks with a shrug. \"We're preparing for Munich exactly the same way we did against Bielefeld,\" Rangnick said. In any case, soccer fans in Germany know what they'll be doing Friday evening -- finding a bar with cable sports television to watch a top match that no one, before the start of the season, would have considered possible.",
        "generated_story": "Hoeness: Hoffenheim's Commercial Manager Reacts to the First Half of the Bundesliga Season \"We are very happy with the way the first half has gone so far,\" said Dietmar Hopp, the club's commercial manager. \"It is a great feeling to be part of a team that has been so successful in the years to come. We are so happy that we are able to move on from the disappointment of last season and move forward with a lot of work ahead of us.\" \"I am very pleased with how we have managed to get through the second half, and I can't wait to see what the next step will be,\" Hoops told DPA news agency in an interview on Friday night. He added that he was \"very happy\" with his team-mates' performances in recent weeks and that they had \"a lot to learn from each other.\" The German side's first goal came in a 1-0 win over Leverkusen in their opening Bundesliga match, but the goal was not enough to win the game for Hoffenhofen. The result, however, was a resounding success for the team, who have been on top of their Bundesliga table for a number of years and are now on course to finish the season on a high note. A lot has happened since the beginning of December, when the German coach Juergen Klinsmann was brought in to take over the reins of Bayern Munich. It was, after all, his first season in charge and he had already made a name for himself as one of Germany's most successful commercial managers. After a difficult first few weeks at the helm, he has now moved on to a new role as the sporting director of Hoffensburg, where he is now the head of marketing and communications. His first task was to find a way to make sure that his players and staff were on the same page. That's what he did. In the end, it was all about the players, not the coach. On the other hand, there were a few things that were not so easy for him. One of them was finding the right balance in terms of his ability to communicate with players. Another was the fact that, in spite of all the criticism he received from fans and media, Hoffenersburg had a very good start to their season. But that didn't stop him from making the most of it, as he said he would do everything in his power to help his squad win games. And that's exactly what happened. For the last few games, though, they've been a bit more difficult. They've had to deal with injuries, suspensions and suspensions. Now they're back at it again, with new head coach Jupp Heynckes set to return to his old side on Saturday."

Although the number of farms has declined over the decades, production has actually increased -- especially at dairy farms. Modern automation technology and robotics are helping to keep both cows and farmers happy, but at the cost of jobs.",
        "generated_story": "Automation in the Dairy Cow Industry In the decades since the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), the dairy cow industry has seen a dramatic increase in demand. But it's not just the technology that is changing the industry. It's also the people who are making the changes. Dairy cows are becoming more and more automated. They're also becoming less and less expensive to produce. In fact, they're even more expensive than the average cow, which is why there's a lot of demand for dairy products today. This is due in large part to the fact that there are so many different types of dairy cows that are being grown in different parts of the world. There are also a number of other factors that contribute to this increase. For example, there is a growing awareness among farmers and ranchers about the importance of technology in their operations. And, of course, it is important to note that this is not the first time that a new technology has been introduced to milk cows. The first step in this process was the introduction of refrigeration technology. That technology is now being applied to cows and other dairy animals. Now, the process is being used to make the milk products available to farmers in other countries, such as China, India and the US. What's more important is that the products are made to last longer, so that they don't have to be replaced with artificial ones. How do you know when a cow is going to die? Well, you can tell by the way it looks. You can see it on its face. If you look at the pictures on the back of a milk cow's milk carton you'll see that it was made in China and not in India. Then you could see how the cows were being slaughtered and how they were treated. All of this was done with the help of an automated system that could be used in a variety of different ways. So, if you're a dairy farmer and want to know how to do that, then check out our website. We've got a great deal of information on this, and we'll share it with you as soon as we can."

        "target": "Inching towards direct talks on Syria They came to hold talks, but started negotiations with mutual affronts. But if there is one person who might be able to mediate between the intransigent Syrian conflict parties, it's Lakhdar Brahimi. Lakhdar Brahimi, the United Nations special envoy for Syria, seemed very tired on Friday (24.01.2014). He had had a long day, which was actually supposed to be the first real day of negotiations at the Syria Conference in Geneva. \"Good afternoon,\" Brahimi told the assembled international press, before adding, \"or good evening, I don't know.\" At the Palais des Nations in Geneva, he presented the most important result of his attempts to mediate between the Syrian government and the opposition to the more than 250 journalists who had managed to get a coveted place at the press conference: \"Tomorrow we expect and we have agreed that we will meet in the same room.\" What Brahimi is declaring an achievement doesn't sound like much, but considering how irreconcilable the conflict parties have been, even that can be seen as a small success. Separate talks with Brahimi The two delegations were actually due to meet on the first day of negotiations in Geneva in order to agree on a timetable and on the subject and agenda of the talks. But emotions are running too high on both sides. Instead both delegations held separate talks with Lahkkdar Brahimi, both lasting just about an hour each In the morning. The Syrian government delegation had apparently been threatening to leave the conference. At least that is what the deputy foreign minister Faisal Mekdad had implied. \"We are here to start the negotiations,\" he told waiting journalists, \"but we found that the other party did not want to come.\" Before the conference, the opposition had explained that for its delegation, the formation of a transition government would be a central tenet of the negotiations. They emphasized that this topic should be discussed right at the beginning of talks and that the establishment of such a body should be initiated without delay. Social media and good old propaganda The representatives of the Syrian National Coalition that were present in Geneva neatly used all imaginable channels to make their views public. At #Geneva2, they tweeted: \"Forming a transitional body is our major priority,\" leaving people in no doubt that the Syrian National Council would not want to include Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Assad's government, on the other hand, is relying on classic propaganda and loyal state media representatives in Geneva. An impressive entourage of dominant journalists from state-run media outlets is constantly at hand, accompanying the government delegation and making sure they get their point across at press conferences. Lakhdar Brahimi even had a small altercation with a journalist from a Syrian state news agency, who made a political statement under the pretense of asking the UN mediator a question. \"Are there any signs that Saudi Arabia, Turkey and other countries would stop the support of terrorism in Syria?,\" she asked in somewhat shaky English, before Brahimi interrupted her. \"Please, please, there is no point in asking such questions!\" Such exchanges hint at the type of negotiating style the experienced diplomat and mediator Brahimi must have behind the scenes. 'Wish us luck' Lakhdar Brahimi described the preliminary talks that took place in Geneva as encouraging and asked for patience. He said that because the peace conference had come about at the last minute and the delegations had therefore only been appointed very recently, there hadn't been enough time to hold preliminary discussions - a task that the delegations were now catching up on. \"We never expected it to be easy and I'm sure it's not going to be,\" he said. \"But I think the two parties understand what is at stake. Their country is in very, very bad shape.\" He added: \"The huge ambition of this process is to save Syria. Nothing less than that.\" After appealing to the willingness of both parties to negotiate, he simply added: \"So wish us luck!\" Fight for freedom As the official delegations held talks with UN mediator Brahimi in the Palais des Nations, the European headquarters of the United Nations, hundreds of Syrian expatriates who had come from all over Europe protested outside, forming a sea of red, white and black Syrian flags on the Place des Nations. With their presence outside the UN gates they wanted to show that despite all the government propaganda, the Syrian National coalition has a lot of support from the Syrian people. Thirty-two-year-old Ziad Malki came to Geneva from Zurich to show his solidarity. Ziad knows how it feels to be deprived of his freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. In 2005, he was arrested at a demonstration in Damascus and says he was tortured during his time in prison. Now he is fighting for a new Syria from outside the country's borders. Ziad is sure that with Bashar al-Assad and his family, there will be nothing new. \"We don't want this man to be in",
        "generated_story": "Mediating with the Syrian National Coalition in Geneva Syrian opposition leader Ziad Malki has been mediating at the Palais des Nations. He is one of the few opposition figures to have been able to mediate with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad during the first day of his regime's rule in Syria. In the morning, the 30-year-old spoke to the UN's special envoy for Syria, Lakhdar Brahimi, about his experiences in the conflict-ravaged country. \"I was very impressed by what I saw,\" he said, adding that he was \"very impressed\" by the amount of cooperation between the opposition and the government in Damascus. The Syrian government, he added, \"is a very strong and strong force, and I am very proud of that.\" \"It is the strongest force that I have ever seen in my life,\" said the man, who was born in Aleppo in 2005 and grew up in a small village near the city of Aleppo. His father was a Syrian army officer and he worked as a translator for the Assad regime for over a decade. After the war, Assad was forced to flee the country, leaving his wife and two children to fend for themselves. At the same time, his father had been killed in an air raid on the rebel-held town of Douma in northern Syria on Friday (24.01.2014) by a roadside bomb, which killed at least 30 people and wounded more than 100. Speaking to reporters after the ceasefire broke down, a delegation from the Free Syrian Army (FSA) said that it was now up to Faisal Mekdad to lead the delegation to Geneva, where it will meet with representatives from other opposition groups. It is not yet clear how many delegates are expected to attend the meeting, but it is hoped that the delegates will have a chance to speak to each other. There is also the possibility that some of them will be invited to join the Syria Conference, as well as other delegates from around the world who are interested in attending the conference. However, there is still a long way to go before any of these delegates can make their way into Geneva. On the other hand, it seems that there are a lot of people who want to participate in this conference and are willing to take part in it. They are also looking forward to seeing what happens in other countries, such as the United States, Europe, Canada, Japan, China, India, South Korea, Russia, Australia, New Zealand and China."

        "target": "Italy's navy to patrol with Libyan ships to curb human trafficking Italy wants to work more closely with Libya to limit the number of sea crossings by migrants and potential asylum seekers. But what are the consequences? Italy's prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni, does not want to wait any longer for EU countries to show solidarity in distributing asylum seekers throughout the bloc. On Thursday he announced in Rome that the Italian navy would be patrolling with Libyan ships just off the Libyan coastline. The aim, Gentiloni says, is to curb human trafficking and bring migrants back from the smugglers' boats to Libya. According to the Italian government's figures, 93,000 migrants have arrived in Italy so far this year. At least 2,000 have drowned in the attempt to cross the Mediterranean - the true figure is unknown. Italy has already threatened to stop allowing boats carrying rescued migrants to dock in Italian ports, or that it may issue migrants with documents that would allow them to travel on to other European countries. Rome has not yet implemented either policy, but the government has made clear that Italy will soon run out of options. The EU Commissioner for Migration Dimitris Avramopoulos acknowledged, again, in Brussels on Thursday that \"Europe continues to face high migratory pressures. And Italy more than (almost) any others.\" The European Commission issued a letter offering more aid and personnel to help manage migration better. Accommodation will soon be full The office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, wrote at the beginning of July that \"Close to 200,000 accommodation places are available for refugees and migrants across [Italy], but are nearly all full.\" The High Commissioner referred particularly to the numbers of people dying when he warned, \"What is happening in front of our eyes in Italy is an unfolding tragedy.\" The United Nations anticipates that another 100,000 migrants will come to Italy via Libya before the end of this year. The number of arrivals is already 20 percent higher than last year; and the number of dead, those who could not be saved, would rise accordingly. According to UN estimates, the Mediterranean remains the \"deadliest\" refugee route in the world. Italian government statistics say that around 600,000 people have arrived in Italian ports since the start of the crisis in 2014. It is unclear how many have since traveled on to Austria, France or Switzerland. Once migrants are registered in Italy and accommodated in camps, they are not held there. If, however, they leave the accommodation without giving notice, they forfeit their claim to subsistence and social services. Most of the migrants are from African countries, and many try to travel on to France, for example. 300 people are currently sleeping on the beach in Ventimiglia, on the French border, hoping to take a bus or train to France. However, the border is being policed by French officials. Migrants who are caught are sent back to Italy. Austria has announced that it too will close its border with Italy if the number of migrants starts to rise. Repatriation and distribution are difficult Last year 120,000 new asylum applications were made in Italy. Around 50 percent of these are rejected. The asylum seekers are then supposed to leave the country. However, the process of people either returning voluntarily or being deported is very slow. The interior ministry has therefore announced that it will reinforce repatriation programs. The redistribution of asylum seekers from Italy, as agreed by the European Union, is well behind target. Two years ago the aim was to resettle 120,000 people. So far, only 24,676 people have been redistributed, the EU Commission said on Thursday: 7,873 from Italy, and 16,803 from Greece. The numbers are low not just because of the reluctance of other EU countries to take the refugees in, but also because of Italian delays in the registration of possible candidates. Asylum seekers from Eritrea are the most likely to fulfill the criteria for redistribution. Around 25,000 are currently living in Italy, but only 10,000 have been registered with the EU Commission and the European Asylum Support Office as possible candidates. Migration Commissioner Avramopoulos has announced that Italy will be given more help and logistical support in this area.",

        "target": "Is China seeking regime-change in North Korea? The sudden reduction in aggressive rhetoric and actions by North Korea has led to suggestions that Pyongyang has realized it has pushed its only ally in the region to the brink of severing its friendship. The announcement in Pyongyang on May 13 of the promotion of Jang Jong-nam to \"minister of the People's Armed Forces\" came out of the blue. Until recently, the little-known commander of an army corps in coastal Kangwon Province, Jang has replaced Kim Kyok-sik, a four-star general with a long track record of loyal service to the regime. The reasons for 70-year-old Kim's replacement are not clear - as with most of the political maneuvers in North Korea - but it may have been his loyalty that cost him his position in the politburo. Kim was widely seen as a hawk in the regime and is believed to have been in command of the operation to shell the South Korean island of Yeonpyeongdo in November 2010, an incident that killed four people, destroyed civilians' homes and infrastructure and dramatically worsened the already strained relationship between Pyongyang and Seoul. By sacrificing Kim, analysts believe, North Korea is signaling that it is backing away from the confrontational stance it adopted after the United Nations imposed new sanctions in the wake of the nation's third underground nuclear test in February. And there are other indicators that Pyongyang is seeking to return to the status quo. The North's troops have been permitted to step down from the highest state of preparedness for war that was initially ordered when South Korea and the US began a series of annual military exercises. Missiles withdrawn Similarly, two Musudan intermediate-range missiles that were identified as being on mobile launchers being operated in eastern areas of the country have apparently been ordered to return to base. In late April, there was concern that test-launches of the missiles would be a further escalation by Kim Jong-un's government and a message that it would not bow to international pressure to halt its nuclear and missile development programs. But the analysts believe the tokens of Pyongyang's goodwill have come too late. \"For the North Korean leader, this is a very difficult time,\" Toshimitsu Shigemura, a professor at Tokyo's Waseda University and an authority on North Korean affairs, told DW. \"Timing is very important here and it is possible that China is moving to abandon Kim Jong-un. The atmosphere between the two nations is changing. China may have decided that it is time for a regime-change in the North, they will not permit the collapse of the country because they do not want chaos on their own borders.\" Further evidence that Beijing is slowly tightening the screw on its erstwhile ally comes as more state-run financial institutions sever their links with banks in North Korea. The latest institution to adhere to the government's orders to halt transactions across the border is the Bank of China, one of the four major banks in the country, which announced on May 7 that it would cease dealings with the Foreign Trade Bank of North Korea, which has been identified as being involved in Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs. Contingency plan in place Intelligence sources have passed on to DW information that Beijing has a contingency plan in place for when Kim Jong-un's control over the country crumbles. The reports confirm that China is indeed quietly encouraging regime change and is grooming Kim's brother, Kim Jong-nam to take over his role. At 42, Kim Jong-nam is the oldest son of Kim Jong-il, the dictator who ruled North Korea with an iron fist for 17 years until his sudden death in December 2011. Kim Jong-nam had been expected to assume the leadership after his father's death, but fell from favor spectacularly in 2001 when he was detained with two women and a boy aged 4 at Tokyo's Narita International Airport travelling on a forged Dominican Republic passport. He later admitted that he had wanted to visit Disneyland. He subsequently lived in Macau and Beijing, under the close watch of the Chinese authorities. The reports suggest that after Kim Jong-nam is installed in Pyongyang, his brother will be permitted to go into exile, probably in China. The tactic is not without its pitfalls, however, in part due to the efficiency of the campaign to deify their young leader as the future of the nation. Kim Jong-nam as 'new king' \"China may be dreaming of appointing Kim Jong-nam as the new king - and he is more preferable to the West than Kim Jong Un - but the problem is that he is not known in North Korea,\" said Ken Kato, director of Tokyo-based Human Rights in Asia. \"Many people in Japan know much about the North Korean 'Royal Family,' but this information is hidden in North Korea,\" he said. \"Even residents of Pyongyang know very little about Kim Jong-nam.\" Yet the reports are gaining credence among North Korea-watchers. Jun Okumura, a political analyst with the Eurasia Group, told DW that North Korea withdrawing",
        "generated_story": "North Korea's 'new king' Kim Jong-un has been named as the country's new king by the United Nations. His name is Kim Kyok-sik. The North Korean leader was born on February 4, 2001, in the eastern city of Yeonpyeongdo. On May 7, Kim was officially named the new leader of North Korea. He is believed to be the heir apparent to the throne of the People's Armed Forces, which was created in November 2010 by Kim's father, the late Kim Yong-nam. In a statement released on May 13, he said: \"I am a man of honor and honor. I am the son of a great man, and I will always be proud of my father and my mother.\" He also said that his father was a \"great man\" and that he was \"a great leader.\" \"He is the father of all the children,\" said Okumura, who is also a professor of political science at Waseda University in Tokyo. \"My father is a very good man and he has a lot of respect for the people of this country.\" The name Kim is said to have given him the nickname \"Jang\" in honor of Jang, one of his favorite songs. But he is not the first leader to use the term \"jang,\" which means \"young man.\" In his own words, \"the young man is an old man with a big heart and a strong sense of self-confidence.\" On the other hand, there is no doubt that the North Koreans are the most powerful people on the planet. They have been in power for 17 years, with Kim as their leader for more than a quarter of that time. However, they are also the only ones who are willing to take a chance on Kim and his family, according to experts who have worked closely with him. According to a recent report from the Eurasia Group, it is likely that Kim will become the next head of state in his home country. Author: Ken Kato Editor: Toshimitsu Shigemura (dw)"

Smuggling has prompted a visit to Mexico City by US Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly. Prosecutors said the remote town of Las Varas in Chihuahua state was the scene of Wednesday's battle between affiliates of the Ciudad Juarez cartel and a gang from the state of Sinaloa. Police said fighting escalated when patrols arrived. Fourteen people were found dead; 12 others were hospitalized. Grenades, launchers and rifles were found. The mountainous region is used as a corridor for smuggling into the US. El Chapo effect Chihuahua security commissioner Oscar Alberto Aparicio said a Black Hawk helicopter was called in as police chased surviving gang members through the area known for marijuana and opium poppy production. Two police officers had been killed in a \"cowardly\" way in the area a week ago, he said. In a similar incident last Friday, 17 gunmen were killed during a shootout with police on a highway in Sinaloa, Mexico's northwestern state. Sinaloa was the home base of Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, whose extradition to the US in January apparently left gangsters in a struggle for control of criminal syndicates. Homicides have surged in recent months, with the number of persons killed in May put at 2,186, the highest since the collection of such statistics began 20 years ago. Nieto and Kelly to talk In Mexico City Wednesday, President Enrique Pena Nieto's office said he and visiting US Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly had discussed how to rein in organized crime groups. \"Shared responsibility\" must become the focus of transnational efforts, Kelly said. Narcotics smuggling into the US has become a multibillion-dollar (multibillion-euro) business for Mexican drug cartels. Mexico in turn wants the US to throttle demand for narcotics and the supply of illegal weapons to Mexico cartels.

Mexico's president Enrique Pena Nieto said in a statement that his country would continue to cooperate with US authorities in the fight against drug traffickers. He also said that Mexico and the United States would cooperate in their efforts to end the drug trafficking of drug dealers and other violent criminals. A week ago, US President Donald Trump announced that he would step down from his post as president of the G20 summit in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in order to focus on combating organized crime and ending the flow of drugs into the country. In May, Trump signed an executive order banning the sale of US military equipment to drug cartels, including the Black Hawk helicopter used to carry out attacks on US troops in Afghanistan and Iraq. Trump has also called for a \"total and complete shutdown\" of arms sales to Mexico. Mexican officials have said the president is willing to do everything in his power to protect the interests of his people, but they have yet to make any concrete progress on that front. New Mexico Governor Oscar Alberto Aparicio said he was \"very concerned\" about the possibility of an escalation of violence between the cartels and his government, adding that \"it is very important that we do not allow this to happen again.\" \"I am very concerned for the safety of our people,\" he said, referring to the Mexican military's ability to use drones and drones to track down drug suspects and stop them, according to a report by the Mexico-based news agency dpa."

There was a similar case in Nigeria in September, when 12 soldiers were sentenced to death for mutiny after firing on their commanding officer in the northeast city of Maiduguri. The 7th Division, based in Maiduguri, leads the offensive but there are numerous reports of troops refusing to deploy. Soldiers have regularly complained that they lack weapons, food, and other basic supplies to fight the Islamists, who are reported to have tanks, rocket-propelled-grenade launchers, and other heavy weaponry.

After successfully weathering the Great Recession, Commerzbank's board of directors appears to want to signal a continuation in its growth trend with Martin Zielke's appointment as the new CEO as of May 1. Outgoing head Martin Blessing announced last year he would not renew his contract. Zielke had previously been put in charge of implementing reforms in the company's private banking sector following the recession. His restructuring measures attracted 800,000 new customers to the bank and changed the image of the 146-year-old financial institution. The 53-year-old has an illustrious career across several German financial institutions to look back on, having started at the teller of a local branch in 1983. Zielke's crowning achievement The beleaguered German financial institution recorded a profit of more than a billion euros (more than $1.1 billion) last year. It was the first time in five years that Commerzbank had made such profitable gains, which it said would translate into paid dividends for shareholders. A good portion of the yields were achieved by a restructuring and expansion drive of Commerzbank's private banking arm under Zielke's leadership. However, some of that money will go to the German government, as it had to step in and rescue the bank in 2009 to the tune of 18 billion euros ($25 billion at the time) by chiefly acquiring more than 15 percent of the shares, effectively nationalizing part of Commerzbank's operations. ss/jlw (dpa, Reuters)",

Here's a recipe for it: Ingredients: 1 packet yeast, active dry 1 teaspoon sugar 1 1/2 teaspoon salt 3 cups unbleached flour 1 tablespoon shortening 1 cup water (49 to 54 C / 120 to 130 F) 6 slices bacon -- diced 2 medium onions -- sliced 1/4 teaspoon cumin 1/2 teaspoon salt Pepper 1 egg yolk 1 cup sour cream Mix the yeast with the sugar, a teaspoon of salt and half a cup of flour. Blend in the shortening and warm water, then beat for two minutes. Add enough flour to make a soft dough, and then knead the dough until smooth and elastic, about five minutes. Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, then cover it and let it rise in a warm place for 30 minutes. Pat the dough into a lightly greased 12-inch pizza pan or onto a lightly greased baking sheet. Press up the edges to make a slight rim. Fry the bacon until crisp and drain it on absorbent paper. Add onions to the bacon grease, and cook slowly until tender, but not brown. Sprinkle the onions, bacon, cumin, half a teaspoon of salt and pepper over the dough. Bake the cake at 204 C (400 F) for 20 minutes. Blend the egg yolk and sour cream and pour the mixture over the Zwiebelkuchen. Bake it for another 10 to 15 minutes, until the cake is golden brown and the sour cream has set. Serve warm or at room temperature with white wine.",

We've all been waiting for the fall to arrive. Now it's time to try some of our favorite German wines. It's been a long time since we've enjoyed a good wine, but this is the first time I've tried one of my favorites: Onion Cake. I'm really looking forward to trying it out, because I think it will be a great wine to share with the rest of the world. There's a lot of wine out there, so I thought I'd share it with you. You'll be able to tell the difference between wine and beer by looking at the recipe. The recipe is easy to make and the ingredients are just as good as you'd expect. Just make sure you have the right mix of herbs, spices, herbs and spices. And if you don't have enough, you'll have to stick with it for another 10 to 15 minutes. If you're going to be drinking wine in Germany, try a few different varieties. Some are more expensive than others, while others are less expensive. But the best ones are the ones that are best served fresh, fresh and fresh. They're also more flavorful and have a bit more variety in them, which is why they're so popular with wine drinkers. \"The fall is a time when wine tastes better than it does in the winter,\" says one wine expert. That's because the grape variety is more versatile and can be used in a wide variety of dishes, such as beer, beer and wine. Other wines can also be enjoyed fresh from the garden, as well as fresh wine from a vineyard or a garden garden. These wines are especially popular among wine consumers because of their versatility and their ability to adapt to new tastes and tastes. For example, the German grape varieties are particularly popular in autumn, when the harvest season kicks off in earnest. However, there's also the fact that there are a number of new varieties being released every year. One of them is called \"Opinion Cake,\" and it has been described as a \"dramatic\" wine that is \"very, very different from other wines.\" \"It's not just about the wine,\" the expert says, \"it's about all the different flavors and textures that make up this wine.\" The best part is that it doesn't just taste good, it tastes great! It also has the added bonus of being a little bit sweeter and more aromatic. In addition to its unique taste, these wines also have an appeal to wine fans who like to experiment with new techniques and new ways of making wine by experimenting with different ingredients. This is especially true when it comes to making their own wines, for example by making a wine with a unique twist on the traditional grape varietal."

        "target": "Bayern blast five as Schalke draw Bayern Munich stamped their authority over the Bundesliga on Saturday, with a ruthless 5-0 drubbing of Hannover at home. Meanwhile, second-placed Schalke and third-placed Frankfurt were forced to share the points. With many critics saying Bayern might as well be given the giant Bundesliga dish already, perhaps the struggle for second is shaping up to be the more compelling battle. But Saturday afternoon's clash between second-placed Schalke and third-placed Frankfurt did not take a decisive turn, with the game ending in a 1-1 draw. Schalke drew first blood in the 11th minute, when Frankfurt's Stefan Aigner was dispossessed in midfield, and Lewis Holtby released Klaas-Jan Huntelaar in front of goal - the Dutchman's first in the Bundesliga since September. But the hapless Aigner waited just over 100 seconds to make amends for his error, when the Royal Blues allowed him a free header that left goalkeeper Lars Unnerstall with no chance. But neither side could make inroads in the second half, which allowed Dortmund to leap-frog both sides and claim second place. Bayern take command Meanwhile the imperious Bayern Munich dispelled any talk of winter form-dip - following last week's draw to Nuremberg - with a brutally efficient 5-0 win at home to Hannover. The Bavarians stormed to a 3-0 lead in just 37 minutes, celebrating a nifty overhead kick for star signing Javi Martinez in the fourth minute. Toni Kroos and Franck Ribery scored the next two against a Hannover side that were torn open at will. The overhead kick was the first for the 40-million-euro ($52-million) signing Martinez, and in the second half new defender Dante also opened his account with a straightforward header from a Kroos free-kick. The festival of football continued just four minutes later, when Mario Gomez - making first Bundesliga appearance of the season - slammed the ball into the net from a tight angle just 30 seconds after replacing Mario Mandzukic. Dortmund win The champions Dortmund, meanwhile, are still nine points behind Bayern after beating Mainz 2-1 away. It was a potentially tricky fixture in the town where J\u00fcrgen Klopp began his coaching career, and Mainz showed their brilliance in the fourth minute, when Elkin Soto knocked a dream ball into the path of Marco Caligiuri, whose volley fairly screamed into the top right corner. Dortmund's own star-Marco - national team player Marco Reus - leveled the scores just eight minutes later. Reus worked himself some room at the outer edge of the penalty area, and slotted a beautiful 17-meter effort into the far corner. And Dortmund's second goal, just before half-time, was equally aesthetic - a vertical ball bisected the Mainz defense perfectly down the middle, where Polish predator Robert Lewandowski got his eighth league goal of the season with a deft lob over the onrushing Christian Wetklo in goal. Allofs' homecoming Bremen's 1-1 draw at Wolfsburg had a special frisson of its own, as Wolfsburg's newly-minted sporting director Klaus Allofs faced the club he had served as general manager for over a decade. And there was some gesticulating from the Bremen bench in the general direction of the Wolfsburg management when the guests took the lead in the 35th minute. Just seconds after Wolfsburg missed several chances, Marko Arnautovic was left free in the box after Eljero Elia found space on the left and cut the ball back for the Austrian to finish. But Wolfsburg got their own back in the second half. In the 62th minute, Bremen were reduced to ten men when Lukas Schmitz was given second yellow card for a hard tackle on Adelino Vieirinha. Just two minutes later, Bas Dost took advantage of their guests' disorgnaization and smashed the ball into the goal after neat piece of play from Vieirinha. Dirty derby The Franconian derby between Greuther F\u00fcrth and Nuremberg was a cagey affair that ended in a frustrating 0-0 draw. The first half was marked mainly by a straight red card for Nuremberg's Markus Feulner after an ugly, flying lunge on Stephan F\u00fcrstner. But the home side's numerical advantage was short-lived - Sercan Sararer was also sent for an early ice bath after his high elbow on Javier Pinola was adjudged worthy of a second yellow card in the 61st minute. But the aggression in the tackles was not matched by ruthlessness in front of goal, and neither side could eke out any clear chances.",
        "generated_story": "Bayern Munich vs. Wolfsburg Preview: Mainz at home Bayern Munich have a tough task ahead of Saturday afternoon's Bundesliga clash with Mainzen. The Bavarians are coming off a 2-1 win over Schalke in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final tie at the Allofs Arena in Frankfurt on Saturday. Bayern have been on a tear in recent weeks as they have lost two of three games in a row and are now on the brink of relegation. On Saturday, the Bavarian side, who have won the Bundesliga for the past two seasons, will be looking to bounce back from their first defeat of the season. They are on course to make it to the last 16, where they will have to wait until the end of next season for a chance to get back into the top four. That would be Bayern's first win in their last 10 games. In the second leg, they were in front of a home crowd of just over 100,000, and they had just two minutes to play. But they didn't have enough time to take advantage of that advantage. After the break, Bayern took the lead and were able to put the game away with a 1-0 victory over Hannover. Aigner's goal came just four minutes later, but the visitors were unable to capitalize on their advantage and Bayern were forced to settle for an equalizer. \"It was just a matter of time before the ball hit the post,\" Bayern coach J\u00fcrgen Klopp said, adding that he was \"very happy\" with his side's performance in Saturday's match against Mainen. He added that Bayern had \"a lot of work to do\" and that they would \"make the most of this opportunity.\" Bayern, meanwhile, are still in contention to clinch a spot in next year's Europa League group stage, having already secured a place in Germany's top-four with the help of Mario Gomez and Lukas-Jan Huntelaar. Dortmund, however, have yet to win a league game in over a decade, with only two wins in that time. Mainten, in particular, had a difficult time finding a way past their opponents. Only one of them has a coach who has been in charge for more than a year and a half. It's not just Bayern who are struggling to find the right balance between quality and quantity. Last season's title hopes were dashed by the return of star striker Robert Lewandowski to Germany in September, only to be replaced by his former club, Borussia Dortmund. His return was met with criticism from Bayern fans who accused him of playing too much football and of not playing enough for his club. However, he has since moved on to a new club and is expected to stay on in his new role as the club's head coach. Frank-Walter Schmitz, a former Bayern player, said he would like to see a return to his old side."

        "target": "In Argentina, red wine exports to balance Porsche imports About 100 Porsches are imported to Argentina each year. Now the country wants to keep a positive trade balance by having the value of the imported luxury cars matched by red wine exports. Porsche is currently enjoying record profits after a two-year downturn, but the export-reliant company has hit a pothole in Argentina. Buenos Aires-based Porsche importer Grupo Pulenta has signed an agreement obligating it to export several hundred bottles of red wine for each car it imports, the Argentine government announced Wednesday. Grupo Pulenta declined to comment when contacted by Deutsche Welle. Job creation During the past year, Argentina has held thousands of high-end vehicles in customs until companies agreed to export goods valued at the same amount. Most of those vehicles came from Germany. According to a spokeswoman for the Argentine embassy in Berlin, the country has been trying to safeguard domestic employment with a positive trade balance. \"Our government has negotiated with automakers to balance their imports of cars with an equivalent amount of exports,\" she told Deutsche Welle in a statement. \"Since March 2010 we have been working with the automakers and importers in order to increase local integration and reduce the trade deficit in this sector.\" Small market A Porsche spokesman said the company sells just short of 100 vehicles into Argentina each year. That compares to more than 40,000 sold worldwide during five months in 2010. \"For Porsche, Argentina is a rather small market,\" the spokesman told Deutsche Welle. \"Our importer, the Pulenta Group, also deals in wine. They have their own vineyards and export that wine. It has nothing to do with Porsche - we just have an import contract with them, and it seems they've found an individual solution with the Argentine government.\" Domestic production Volkswagen, which has an Argentine subsidiary producing the new \"Amarok\" pickup truck and transmissions, has thus far avoided mandatory exports. The company had reported an export surplus of 384 million euros ($545 million) for this year. Porsche's holding company owns 32.2 percent of Volkswagen, and the Porsche brand is intended to become integrated into Volkswagen's lineup. Daimler and BMW also have subsidiaries in Argentina. While Daimler produces its \"Sprinter\" there, BMW only imports to the country. According to the Argentine embassy in Berlin, the country has recently sought more domestic production by foreign car companies. Author: Gerhard Schneibel (dpa) Editor: John Blau",

The move is part of an effort by the Pulenta Group to reduce its reliance on imports from Argentina. In a statement on Wednesday, the company said it would double the amount of wine it produces in Argentina each year to 384 million euros ($545 million). \"We are going to continue to increase our wine production to meet the needs of Argentina's wine consumers,\" the statement said, adding that the move was \"part of a broader strategy to strengthen our competitiveness in the market.\" The company also announced that it will increase the production of its Amarok wine by up to 25 percent from the current five months in March 2010. \"This is an important step for Argentina,\" said Gerhard Schneibel, chairman of the group's board of directors, in an interview with Deutsche Welle. He added that Argentina was the first country in Latin America to introduce its own wine in 2010, and that there was no need for a third country to be added to the list of countries that have the most wine imports. Germany's Daimler and BMW are among the top five wine exporters in Europe, with the exception of Germany, which has been the world's biggest wine importer. BMW, Volkswagen and Porsche are the other two biggest importers, according to German news agency dpa. Volkswagen, BMW and Mercedes-Benz have all increased their wine shipments in recent years, while Porsche is the only other German company to do so. Both German and Spanish companies have also been increasing their exports, but Volkswagen is still the largest exporter of German wine. German media reported Wednesday that Volkswagen was considering a move to add more wine to its portfolio, saying it was looking at a range of new products for the German market. Porsche, however, has not ruled out the possibility of expanding its German operations to include other European markets. It is also looking to diversify its international operations, such as in South America, where it has a presence in Brazil, Argentina and the United Kingdom."

The opposition Law and Justice party failed in its bid to oust Prime Minister Donald Tusk on Friday through a vote confidence, the second such vote since the publication of private conversations between high-ranking officials, referred to by some in Poland as \"Waitergate.\" Tusk withstood the opposition challenge by a wide margin of 236-155. The prime minister's Civic Platform party governs Poland in a center-right coalition with the Polish People's party. Last month, recordings of a private conversation between Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski and then-Finance Minister Jacek Rostowski were published by the weekly magazine Wprost. During the conversation, Sikorski said the US-Polish alliance was \"worthless\" and British Prime Minister David Cameron's concessions to euroskeptics had shown his \"incompetence in EU affairs.\" Prior to the leak of the Sikorski recording, Wprost also published a tape in which central bank chief Marek Belka told Interior Minister Bartlomiej Sienkiewicz that he would only support the government's economic policy if Finance Minister Rostowski left his post. The secret recordings were reportedly made over several months, including at high end restaurants in Warsaw. Wprost says it received the tapes from a businessman.

        "target": "Beekeepers battle mites with technology Bees are useful, hard-working and vital for our ecosystem. Aside from making honey, bees pollinate most of our food crops. But summertime is also the season for one of the biggest threats to honey bees \u2013 the varroa mite. Dete Papendieck puts on a white veiled protective hat and takes out a metal jug with a beak-shaped spout. He sets fire to the container's contents \u2013 formic acid \u2013 and starts directing the smoke that is wafting at the beehives lined up in front of him in his garden on the outskirts of Bonn. The acid doesn't harm the bees, but it does kill the varroa mites, he says. And July, after most of the honey has been harvested, is the best time to treat his hives. The one millimeter-large varroa mite is a parasite that infests beehives and lays its eggs in the honeycombs, alongside the bees' larvae. \"It feeds on the bees' and the bee brood's blood, the so-called haemolymph,\" Papendieck explains. A third of bees killed in Germany Papendieck is an apiarist at the Bee Research Institute at the University of Bonn and he knows that the threat of mites is serious. If left untreated, varroa-infested colonies rarely survive a winter. In 2010, German beekeepers lost about 200,000 hives to the mite \u2013 one third of Germany's total bee population. And it is not just the honey and beeswax production that are affected by the mite. Many of our food crops depend on bees: Some 80 percent of all agricultural plants and 90 percent of fruit trees in Europe are pollinated by Apis mellifera, the European honeybee. Varroa introduced from Asia Had Dete Papendieck been a beekeeper forty years ago he would not have had to worry about mites. He says the varroa mite that was originally native to Asia, was introduced to Europe in the 1970s. \"It happened during a research project in which it was attempted to crossbreed the European honeybee with the Asian honeybee. The researchers were exchanging bee colonies between Europe and India, and that is how the mites came to Germany,\" Papendieck said. Unlike Asian bee species, the European honeybee cannot fight off the varoa mite by itself. According to Papendieck, bees easily transmit the mite to other beekeepers' hives in what apiarists call robbery. \"It happens when certain colonies are being robbed by other bees. Large numbers of bees from different colonies attack weak hives and steal their stocks. At the same time, parasites and diseases are exchanged\", he says. Researchers have been trying to breed varroa-resistant mites, but so far they haven't had much success. High-tech tools help fight the mite Klaus Maresch is also worried about his bees. He is an organic beekeeper from Bonn and he has been passionate about bees since he was a little boy. \"They are part of my family. When I open my hives and smell the honey and hear the buzzing of the bees it's like being in another world,\" he told Deutsche Welle. In addition to using formic acid to fight the mite, Klaus Maresch employs a high-tech tool \u2013 a special cylindrical scale that helps him determine when it is best to start the varroa treatment. \"Every day this hive scale sends data about the colonies to our server. The data, such as the temperature in the hive and the amounts of nectar and pollen collected, help me to find a good day to treat varroa,\" Maresch says. Maresch also makes the data about the activities in his hives available to fellow beekeepers who can treat their colonies accordingly. A driver's license for beekeepers? But it is not the mite that angers Maresch most. \"That's nature,\" he says, \"I feel angry about beekeepers who don't fight varroa. If the bees of neighboring beekeepers are infested, I also have a problem.\" The existing German pest regulation obliges beekeepers to treat their bees against varroa, but there are no strict controls. The majority of Germany's more-than-80,000 beekeepers are amateurs who keep between one and 20 colonies. This makes it difficult to impose and survey certain quality standards. Maresch, who sees himself as a kind of 'bee activist', would like to see the government introduce stricter rules. \"There should be a law that obliges every new beekeeper to learn about beekeeping before they are allowed to keep bees. They should get an education and there should be something like a driver's license for beekeepers,\" he says. In the mean time, Europe's bees are going to have to",
        "generated_story": "German beekeeper fights varoa mite with high-tech hive scale German beekeepers have been battling the varo mites for over two decades. They've been fighting the pests for the better part of a dozen years. In July, Klaus Maresch of the Bee Research Institute in Bonn, Germany, took part in an experiment to fight the pest. The experiment was one of Germany's most successful beekeeping experiments. It was the first of its kind in the world, and it's one that has been replicated in many other countries, including Asia, Africa, the Middle East, Europe and the Americas. \"It was a very successful experiment,\" said Klaus, adding that it was \"the first time we've seen this kind of behavior in a bee hive.\" But it wasn't just in Germany that the experiment took place. German scientists have also been studying the effects of pesticides on bees for more than 40 years, with a focus on reducing the spread of diseases and reducing their impact on the environment. For example, in 2010, German researchers found that pesticides were more effective in controlling pests than in preventing them from spreading to other areas. This led to an increase in pesticide use in Europe, where bee populations have fallen by 40 percent since the 1970s, according to a study published by the German research institute Deutsche Welle in July. More than 80 percent of all bee species are threatened by pesticides, said the study's lead author Dete Papendieck, a professor of entomology and parasitology at the U.S. university in Langenau. But the researchers say the problem is not as big as it could be in Asia. Instead, they say, it is more complex and can take longer to adapt to the changes in climate and pests. That's why they're trying to find a way to make it easier for bees to live in their natural habitats. So far, there's only one problem: bees are not allowed to fly on their own. And that's that they can't fly at all. Not only that, but they don't have access to pesticides that can be used on a large scale, so they have to rely on chemicals that are far less expensive and more difficult to produce. These chemicals can only be applied to honeybees, which are more susceptible to diseases such as malaria, typhoid and dengue."

        "target": "EU Mulls Warning Labels to Curb Alcohol Abuse While still targeting smoking, European Union's public health commissioner is considering adding alcohol to the list of vices the bloc should clamp down on. In a report commissioned by the European Commission, the London Institute for Alcohol Studies recommended raising the legal age to buy alcohol to 18 (in some countries, such as Germany, 16-year-olds can buy beer), lowering the permitted blood alcohol level while driving to 0.5, banning alcohol advertising on TV and in movies as well as adding warning labels to bottles as ways of preventing alcohol abuse across the bloc. Which of the methods EU Health Commissioner Markos Kyprianou actually introduces will be announced \"sometime in the autumn,\" according to a spokesperson. Other options include a 10 percent increase in the price of alcohol. Kyprianou has, however, hinted that he favors warning labels -- similar to those that appear on packs of cigarettes -- that make the dangers of alcohol clear. \"Drinking harms your unborn baby\" on bottles? Brewers and wine makers across Europe, however, have come out against placing \"Drinking Kills\" or other labels on bottles of beer. \"Warning labels are the completely wrong way to go,\" Peter Hahn, head of the German Brewers Association told Germany's Express newspaper. \"The do not deter people who have lost a sense of how much to drink and unsettle the people who enjoy a beer after work.\" Industry groups also opposed implementing EU-wide guidelines in countries with traditionally different ways of approaching drinking and drinking problems. \"Policies that do not consider cultural and regional differences, will fail to deal with the social problems, while at the same time generate a rising level of political objections,\" said Rodolphe de Looz-Corswarem of Brewers of Europe. Keeping social vices separate Green party EU parliamentarian Hiltrud Breyer meanwhile called on the alcohol industry to stop \"saber rattling\" before it sees the a final version of the EU's strategy to prevent alcohol abuse. German Consumer Affairs Minister Horst Seehofer said he would wait to see what Kyprianou's actual suggestions are before commenting. Other German politicians, however, were more willing to voice the opposition to putting a sip of wine on the same footing with a puff of a cigarette. \"People should not expect that a skull and crossbones end up on every bottle of beer and wine,\" German EU representative Karl-Heinz Florenz told Der Tagesspiegel newspaper, adding that when it comes to alcohol, each member state should be responsible for how it deals with alcohol abuse. The harm of \"passive drinking\" While cigarettes are a health risk from the first puff, moderate drinking can actually be healthy and there is no danger from \"passive drinking,\" Peter Liese, a German EU representative, told the paper. The commission's report disagreed with Liese's conclusion, saying alcohol abuse had a major role in as many as 200,000 deaths in Europe due to car accidents and disease and played a role in some 60,000 underweight births. The report also estimated the effects of alcohol abuse of costing the EU 125 billion euros ($161 billion) in 2003. Some 25 percent of men and 10 percent of women in Europe drink what the EU considers to be more than healthy amounts of alcohol and between 3 percent and 5 percent are suffering from alcoholism, according to EU statistics.",
        "generated_story": "German brewers warn of 'passive drinking' on bottles of beer The German Brewers Association has warned of the dangers of drinking beer in the autumn. The group's members are warning of a possible increase in alcohol consumption. \"We are concerned about the potential for a rise in underage drinking in Europe,\" the group said in a letter to the German government on Thursday. It said that the problem could be mitigated by reducing the amount of alcohol consumed by underage drinkers. However, the letter did not specifically mention the risk of underage consumption, which could lead to higher prices for beer. According to a report published in Der Tagesspiegel in Germany in 2003, \"alcohol consumption has increased by 125 billion euros over the past five years.\" The report also warned that alcohol use could increase by up to 25 percent in countries with low alcohol content. In Germany, beer consumption is now estimated to be at a rate of 125 to 150 percent, while in other European countries, it is estimated that it could rise to 160 to 170 percent by the end of 2015. Germany's beer industry, however, is still struggling to cope with the growing number of young people who are drinking alcohol in their home countries. A survey of German beer drinkers found that more than 80 percent of them were underage, compared to just 18-year-olds. They were more likely to drink beer at home than at school, where the average age was 18. But the survey also showed that only 18 percent were aware that beer was being consumed on a regular basis. This was the first time in German history that a beer had been sold on the black market, and it was only the second time since 2003 that people had bought beer on black markets. There were also a few exceptions, such as in France, Germany and the Netherlands where alcohol was sold as a snack. These were the exceptions and not the ones that caused the most damage to beer bottles, according to German researchers. 'Passive' drinking is not just about drinking, but also about smoking, smoking and drinking. Alcohol is a dangerous substance, as it can be addictive and can cause a person to become addicted to it. As a result of this, many people are turning to alcohol as an alternative to smoking or smoking. Some of these people have even begun to use alcohol on their own.

        "target": "German Minister Urges Peace in Georgia's Separatist Regions German Foreign Minister Steinmeier has called for an end to the \"spiral of violence\" between the Georgian government in Tbilisi and its Russian-backed rebel regions and presented a three-stage plan to break the deadlock. Steinmeier issued the plea as he began a tour of the region to sponsor a new peace plan aimed at calming the simmering tensions over Georgia's separatist regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. \"This is my appeal to break out of the spiral of violence. A lack of dialogue is not an option for the future,\" he said after meeting with his Georgian counterpart Eka Tkeshelashvili. Steinmeier, who chairs the so-called Group of Friends of the United Nations' Secretary on Georgia, is proposing a three-phase peace plan based on a mutual declaration of non-violence and repatriation of about 25,000 ethnic Georgians expelled from Abkhazia in the 1990s. Negotiations over the status of the two rebel regions, which have enjoyed de facto autonomy since the end of a civil war in 1994, was reserved for the final phase of negotiations. Tkeshelashvili said, \"The plan has great potential for success,\" but added that the most difficult thing would be to convince Russia. Peace talks remain distant The threat of armed conflict in the region last month has given urgency to international pressure for renewed peace talks, but Tbilisi, Moscow and the Russian-backed regions remain far apart on the basic premises for restarting peace talks. Officials in Tbilisi oppose a treaty on the non-use of force without guarantees on the return of refugees and the withdrawal of Russian peacekeeping forces base in the region. Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was skeptical of peace efforts Thursday. \"Signing of a treaty on the return of Georgian refugees to Abkhazia is unreal now, because such a return requires a calm situation,\" Lavrov was quoted as saying by news agency RIA-Novosti. \"We think that signing a treaty on the non-use of force without any preconditions is an absolutely unavoidable first step,\" he added. Experts see little hope for Steinmeier's plan Analysts do not expect anything conclusive from Steinmeier's trip, pointing to intransigence on the part of the Abkhaz President Sergei Bagapsh, who said he would \"not consider the plan.\" \"We are not going to discuss Abkhazia's status with anyone. We are building an independent, democratic state,\" Bagapsh was quoted by Georgian news agencies as saying. Speaking to journalists ahead of the meetings Thursday, Steinmeier admitted: \"We don't have any illusions about simple answers, but we cannot stand by without acting on this conflict. That would be irresponsible.\" From Tbilisi, the German minister is to travel to the Black Sea city of Batumi for talks with Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili and then to Abkhazia on Friday before ending his three-day tour in Moscow. Most citizens of the breakaway republics have been issued Russian passports and over 2,500 Russian peacekeeping troops patrol the region under a UN ceasefire agreement. In opposition to Georgia's bid to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Russia moved to strengthen diplomatic ties with the breakaway regions sharply aggravating tensions with the Georgian leadership in recent months.",

The government says the measures are no longer necessary because the security threat has subsided. The government said Tuesday it had rescinded the emergency measures \"with immediate effect\" and that \"all fundamental rights that were suspended have been restored.\" President Yameen Abdul Gayoom declared the state of emergency one week ago after the discovery of a homemade bomb and a stash of weapons near his official residence. The finding followed an explosion on Gayoom's speedboat in September - an incident the government labeled an assassination attempt. The president was not hurt in the blast, but his wife, an aide and a bodyguard were injured. The emergency regulations, intended to be in place for 30 days, gave security forces wide-ranging search and arrest powers, and suspended citizens' basic rights. They drew criticism from former colonial power Britain as well as the United States, the European Union and neighboring Sri Lanka. Reading out a presidential decree revoking the emergency, Attorney General Mohamed Anil said there was no longer a threat to the Indian Ocean atoll nation. He said investigations into the September blast and the recovery of weapons had made good progress. The foreign ministry said a number of people had been arrested. Lawmakers also used the security regulations to fast-track the impeachment of Vice President Ahmed Adeeb, who stands accused of plotting the alleged attempts on the president's life. Impact on tourism Attorney General Anil said pressure from the international community, as well as \"the possible adverse impact on Maldives tourism and the economy,\" had also played a role in ending the state of emergency. Foreign tourists visiting the tropical nation, known for its luxury tourist resorts, palm-fringed beaches and coral reefs, contribute close to a third of the country's gross domestic product. The Maldives has had a rocky road to democracy since holding its first multiparty election in 2008. The country's first democratically elected leader, current opposition chief Mohamed Nasheed, was forced to step down in 2012 after a mutiny by security forces. In March, he was jailed for 13 years on terrorism charges in a trial the United Nations said was illegal. President Gayoom is under intense international pressure to release him. Nasheed's opposition Maldivian Democratic Party welcomed Tuesday's announcement. But said declaring the state of emergency in the first place was a political move designed to stop a rally planned for last week calling for Nasheed's freedom. \"It appears that Yameen is willing to make up threats about the nation's security in order to settle political scores,\" the party said in a statement, referring to the president. nm/kms (AP, AF, Reuters, dpa)",
        "generated_story": "Maldives lifts state of emergency after international criticism The Maldivian government has lifted an emergency declaration that had been lifted by international pressure. The move came one week after the Maldives' president Yameen Abdul Gayoom announced that he would step down from his post as president of the country. \"We have lifted the emergency order,\" the president said in a statement on Tuesday, adding that the government would continue to act in accordance with international law. He did not elaborate on the reasons for the move, saying only that it was \"in line with the international community's position.\" The government had said the declaration was in response to criticism from the United Nations, the European Union and other countries, which had called for an end to the state-of-emergency declaration. It was not immediately clear how many people were affected by the announcement, but it came as a surprise to some observers who had predicted that Nasheed would stay in office until the end of his term in 2012. Opposition parties, however, were quick to criticize the decision, calling it a \"violation of international human rights law.\" \"This is not the first time that this has happened,\" said Ahmed Adeeb, a spokesman for opposition group the Democratic Party (AF). \"It is a violation of human right to life and the rule of law,\" he added, referring to a clause in the constitution that states that a president cannot be removed from office if he is found guilty of crimes against humanity. Anil, who has been in power for 13 years, said he had not been charged with any crime. However, he pointed out that there was no evidence to support the allegations. 'We are not going to stand by and allow this to happen,' he said. A new government was also set to be inaugurated in September, with a total of 30 days to implement the new constitution. But it is unclear how long the interim government will be able to continue its work, given the high level of criticism it has received in recent months. Youssef Abdallah al-Nasheed, leader of a coalition of opposition parties that includes the Muslim Brotherhood, was arrested in March on charges of sedition, rape and murder. His arrest was later cleared by a military court. Uncertainty over the future of elections The United States, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Spain have all expressed concern about the possibility of an election that could be held before the elections. On Tuesday the US and Britain said they would hold a referendum on whether or not to recognize the results of last year's disputed presidential election."

The record-breaking storm has battered the Bahamas and Cuba, while Hurricane Jose followed in its path. As one of the Atlantic Ocean's largest storms plowed through the Caribbean, leaving destruction in its wake, residents of the US state of Florida prepared for what could be the worst storm to make landfall in over a century. At least 17 people have been killed and dozens more injured across several island nations in the Caribbean. Irma is expected to be there second major hurricane to make landfall in the United States in less than two weeks. Hurricane Harvey struck Texas last week, killing more than 60 people and displacing roughly 1 million others. In the US territory of Puerto Rico, 1 million people \u2013 nearly one-third of the population \u2013 lost electricity during the storm, said Puerto Rican Governor Ricardo Rossello. \"It will be difficult to estimate how long the power outage will last,\" Rossello said. Later, officials confirmed that at least two people on the island had been killed by the storm's devastation. Two other major storms have developed in the Caribbean, namely Hurricane Jose and Hurricane Katia. Jose was east of the Lesser Antilles with maximum sustained winds of 120 miles person hour (195 kilometers person hour) as a hurricane watch was in effect for Antigua and Barbuda. Jose has followed the same path as Hurricane Irma, and was upgraded to a Category 4 on Friday by the US National Hurricane Center. Katia has remained relatively static, hovering off the coast of Mexico. Florida on edge Florida Governor Rick Scott said 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain were expected after Irma made landfall at the weekend as he urged evacuations during a press conference on Friday. Nearly 700,000 people have been asked to leave Miami and its surrounding areas. \"Today is the day to do the right thing for your family and get inland for safety... Do not ignore evacuation orders. All Floridians should be prepared to evacuate soon,\" Scott said. Read more: How to reduce risks from mega-storms? \"I know many of you are stuck in traffic, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s very frustrating. Evacuations are not convenient but they are absolutely meant to keep you safe,\" he added. On Friday, US President Donald Trump described Irma as a storm of \"absolutely historic destructive potential.\" Trump also on Friday signed a $15 billion (13.5 billion euro) hurricane relief package passed by Congress, which also raises the debt ceiling and postpones the possibility of a shutdown of government funding until December. Downgraded to an \"extremely dangerous\" Category 4 but still packing winds of 185 mph (300 kph), Irma moved between the north coast of Cuba and the Bahamas as it neared the Florida Keys and the southern Florida Peninsula.

It will be truly devastating,\" Long told CNN. \"The entire southeastern United States better wake up and pay attention. Death and destruction At least 11 people have been killed and dozens more injured after Irma tore through the French Caribbean, Barbuda, Anguilla and the British Virgin Islands. Amid widening criticism from residents in British territories that not enough was done to safeguard people from the storm, British Foreign Office Minister Alana Duncan said London has sent tents, vehicles and other relief equipment. \"Anguilla received the hurricane's full blast. The initial assessment is that the damage has been severe and in places critical,\" Duncan told the British Parliament. Thousands displaced Antigua and Barbuda Prime Minister Gaston Browne said nearly every building on Barbuda was damaged when the hurricane's core crossed almost directly over the island early Wednesday and about 60 percent of the island's roughly 1,400 people were homeless.

Britain-EU divorce proceedings will probably last about two years. Until then, the status quo must be maintained, German Chancellor Angela Merkel emphasized in her press statement. If she is no longer chancellor after the upcoming parliamentary elections in 2017, then others will have to live with the consequences of Brexit. But that is not what she is actually thinking. It is not coincidental that foreign ministers and government leaders are visiting Berlin in the coming days. They want to discuss how things will continue. Berlin, under Merkel's chancellorship, has become a center of power outside of Brussels. Difficult international politics The Brexit decision has disrupted Europe's equilibrium. Germany has lost an important ally on European issues related to economic growth and budgetary discipline. Now, France presumably will be the next to raise its voice against Maastricht Treaty criteria. If the Netherlands and Denmark also decide to leave the EU, Germany will become isolated, as Eastern Europe is not as tight with Germany as it once was. Poland now plays a key role for the Balkan nations and the Visegrad Group (Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic and Slovakia). And Poland is still annoyed about Merkel's refugee policy. What about Germany's populists? They're giddy with glee as they feel that their anti-establishment policies have been validated. They are teaching potential AfD (Alternative for Germany) voters a lesson: \"Here, have a look: it's possible. There is always an alternative. Vote for us!\" Those are exactly the words that protest voters want to hear. Germany's AfD has forged ties with other right-wing parties in Vienna, Paris, The Hague and London. They are all pursuing a \"European\" plan to gain power. The recent Austrian presidential election was significant, as the populist candidate lost by a very narrow margin; in fact, the final election results are still undecided as they are being contested. The Brexit vote was also triggered by populist powers. Domestically difficult Many populists believe that the stronger populism becomes - no matter where - the more advantages there would be for individual parties of their persuasion. Many would also like to see Donald Trump as US president. That is how AfD may become even stronger in Germany, which also means that political majorities would fluctuate even more. Will there be enough seats after the next election for a Christian Democrat and Green coalition, or will yet another grand coalition made up of Christian Democrats and Social Democrats be formed? Can Angela Merkel change course? Can she counter the trend with a new political model in Europe and Germany? Or do we stand on the edge of a new era, a \"political revolution,\" as the AfD calls it? Until now, Europe has survived attacks on its currency (euro crisis), the principle of peaceful coexistence (Crimea crisis) and its open borders policy (refugee crisis). Merkel deserves credit for defending these values, despite mistakes that have been made along the way. The outcome of the Brexit crisis is, however, still open. Have something to say? Add your comments below.",
        "generated_story": "AfD and the Brexit Crisis in Europe The AfD is a far-right political party that aims to undermine the European Union. The party's leader, Kay-Alexander Scholz, is an outspoken critic of the EU. He is also a member of Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) coalition government, which includes Green, Green and Christian Democrat (SPD). He has also been critical of President Donald Trump's policies on immigration and refugees. In a recent interview with DW, he said, \"I don't think it's a good idea for Germany to be part of an EU that doesn't want to deal with refugees,\" referring to the migrant crisis in Eastern Europe. But he added that the party is willing to work with other parties in order to get the message across. \"We are not going to give up on the refugee issue, we have to fight for the rights of refugees and asylum seekers,\" he told DW. And he also said that his party would work closely with the Social Democrats in the coming days to make sure that refugees, migrants and other migrants would be allowed to return to their home countries if they wanted to stay in their own countries. What's more, it seems, there are a lot of people who have been waiting for this moment for a long time to see what the future holds for their country. It's not just about refugees who are worried about the fate of their countries, but also about how Europe's future will be shaped by the migration crisis. There's also the question of how long it will take for refugees to come to Germany. How long will they be able to live in Germany? The question is whether they can live with themselves and their families in a country that has been suffering from the effects of migration and migration, and whether the influx of migrants will make it easier for them to find work in other parts of Europe, as well as the Middle East and North Africa, where migration is the main source of income for many people. So far, the only thing that seems to have changed is that migration has become more and more common. That's why, for example, refugees are more likely to migrate to other EU countries than to move to another EU country, such as Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece or Portugal. This is because they have more money to spend on education, health care, education and social services, among other things. They're also more interested in social issues, like social justice and economic issues. These are all issues that are important to them, they're important for Europe and they should be discussed in an open and transparent way."

The Christian Democrat Leader (CDU) first took office in 2005. After months of speculation, German Chancellor Angela Merkel reportedly told her fellow Christian Democrats (CDU) in Berlin on Sunday that she is prepared to lead the party into next year's election. An official statement is expected from Merkel at 7 p.m. local time (1800 UTC) on Sunday. The 62-year-old has faced a number of difficulties in recent months, from criticism over her handling of the migration crisis to falling support amid a rise in right-wing populist sentiment. Since taking office in 2005, however, Merkel has also been praised for navigating Europe's largest economy through the financial and eurozone crises. According to an Emnid survey published in the German newspaper \"Bild am Sonntag\" 55 percent of Germans are in favor of Merkel remaining head of the German government for another four years. Thirty-nine percent said they were against her re-election. Sign of stability Should she be elected next September, another full four-year term would put Merkel on a par with her mentor Helmut Kohl who set the post-war record and presided over the Fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. In light of the UK's shock vote to leave the European Union in June and Donald Trump's election last week as US president, Merkel's re-election is likely to be welcomed in many capitals as a sign of stability. During his final visit to Berlin this week, US President Barack Obama said that if he were able to, he would vote for his longtime partner and friend. In an interview with German magazine \"Spiegel\" and broadcaster \"ARD,\" Obama said: \"She has great credibility, and she is willing to fight for those values in a way that is very, very important.\" \"I'm glad that she's there and I think the German people should appreciate her. Certainly, I've appreciated her as a partner.\" Winning back votes With the less that a year until Germany heads to the polls, Merkel's CDU is now turning its efforts to wooing back disenchanted voters who have left the conservative camp to support the right-wing populists, Alternative for Germany (AfD). Formed as a Euro-sceptic party in 2013, the AfD won 4.7 percent of the popular vote in the last federal elections in 2013, just falling short of the 5 percent threshold required to enter the Bundestag - Germany's lower house of parliament. After benefiting from the rise in europsceptic, anti-immigration sentiment, seemingly sweeping across western Europe, the party now holds seats in nine of Germany's 16 states.",
        "generated_story": "Merkel's re-election bid comes amid growing populist sentiment in Germany Chancellor Angela Merkel has announced that she will seek a fourth term in office. The announcement comes as Germany's conservative Christian Democrat party (CDU) prepares to run for another four-year term. Merkel, who was first elected to parliament in 2005, is expected to seek another term as chancellor in 2017. German media reported on Sunday that Merkel was set to announce her candidacy at 7 p.m. local time (1700 UTC, 1800 UTC) in a speech to the Bundestag in Berlin. It was not immediately clear whether she would run again, but German news magazine Bild am Sonntag reported that the conservative party, the Alternative for Germany (AfD), was preparing to nominate a candidate for the post of prime minister. \"We have a lot of work ahead of us,\" Merkel said in an interview published in the German daily Bild, adding that it would be \"difficult\" to form a coalition government with the CDU and the Christian Democrats (Christian Democrats) if she were to win. In the event of an election, Merkel would have to choose between the two major parties, which have traditionally been more conservative in their approach to politics, and a far-right party that is more moderate in its stance on immigration, migration and social issues. Chancellor Merkel is widely seen as a potential successor to former Chancellor Helmut Kohl, a conservative who served as Chancellor of Germany from 2005 to 2005. She has been criticized by the left-wing AfD party for its anti-immigrant rhetoric and its unwillingness to recognize the European Union as an \"EU\" and \"European Union.\" In a statement released this week, German Prime Minister Merkel's office said she was \"deeply concerned\" about the growing popularity of her conservative coalition. But she did not elaborate on the reasons for her decision, saying only that \"it was the right thing to do.\" The comments came as Merkel faced criticism from some quarters in her own party over her handling of the refugee crisis in Haiti and other humanitarian crises in Africa. On Sunday, she faced a backlash from a group of conservative voters who called on her to step down from her post in order to focus on other pressing issues, such as the migrant crisis, refugees, climate change and human rights."

The kneeling protest, to highlight social injustice, has stepped up a gear. Hundreds of National Football League (NFL) stars protested President Donald Trump's call for fans to boycott the league by refusing to stand for the US national anthem this weekend, starting Sunday's game between the Baltimore Ravens and Jacksonsville Jaguars. A number of other players locked arms in solidarity ahead of the game at Wembley Stadium in London. Jacksonville Jaguars' owner Shahid Khan, who last year donated one million dollars\u00a0(840,000 euros) to the Trump campaign, locked his arms with players - a rare scene, as owners almost never take to the field. US media reported that about 200 players on Sunday sat, knelt or raised their fists in defiance of Trump's comments. In one of the most memorable moments, singer Rico LaVelle took a knee and held up a fist at the last line of the Star Spangled Banner ahead of the game between the Detriot Lions and Atlanta Falcons. The protest came in response to Trump's tweets on Sunday morning urging fans to boycott NFL games to pressure the league into firing or suspending players to kneel in protest during the national anthem. In an early morning tweet, Trump posted: \"If NFL fans refuse to go to games until players stop disrespecting our Flag and Country, you will see change take place fast. Fire or suspend!\" \"NFL attendance and ratings are WAY DOWN. Boring games yes, but many stay away because they love our country. League should back US,\" he added. Later, the president said that his rant \"has nothing to do with race,\" despite the fact that the origins of the protest are to do with police brutality against minorities, especially African Americans. Trump said his comments were instead about \"respect for our country and respect for our flag.\" Trump's spat with US professional sports began at a Republican rally in Alabama on Friday, when the president attacked activist NFL players for kneeling or sitting during the national anthem, labelling them as \"sons of bitches.\" \"Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, 'Get that son of a bitch off the field right now... he is fired'?\" Trump told a crowd of cheering supporters. That day, basketball star Stephen Curry, the top player for California's Golden State Warriors, announced that he would not be attending a traditional White House reception honoring the National Basketball Association champions. The kneeling protest was started by former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick who refused to stand for the anthem back in 2016. Kaepernick's gesture came amid a spate of deadly police shootings of black men and was aimed at drawing more attention to treatment of minorities in the US. However, Kaepernick has since become a free agent, after failing to be signed by a new team for the new NFL season. NFL executives decry Trump's calls Trump also drew the ire of senior NFL executives and team owners. Responding to Trump's tweets, Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti, said he \"100 percent\" supported his players' decision to kneel during the anthem. Robert Kraft, the owner of the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots, who is also a close friend of Trump, said in a statement on Sunday that he was deeply disappointed by the president's comments in Alabama. Kraft defended players' rights to \"peacefully affect social change and raise awareness in a manner that they feel is most impactful,\" and said that sports were a unifying force in the US. \"Our political leaders could learn a lot from the lessons of teamwork and working together toward a common goal,\" he said. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, who has taken much of the heat for Kaepernick's failure to find a new team, was also quick to condemn Trump's comments.

The president's comments sparked online outrage on Sunday, when the NFL announced that players would not stand for the anthem at Sunday's game against the New England Patriots at Wembley Stadium in London. \"The president has made it clear that he doesn't believe in the right to protest,\" NFL spokesman Steve Bisciotti said in a statement released by the National Football League (NFL). \"He's not going to sit and watch the game. He's got to do something about it. That's what he's doing.\" The NFL said on Twitter that the players should stand \"in solidarity with the people of this country who have lost everything because of our flag,\" referring to President Donald Trump's \"divisive\" comments on social media last month. Trump has also called for a boycott of NFL games this weekend, saying that \"it's disrespectful\" to the flag and \"unacceptable\" that NFL owners should not be allowed to impose sanctions on their players for protesting. But the Trump administration has said that it will not tolerate any form of \"political correctness\" on the field of play. In a tweet on Saturday, the president said he was \"deeply concerned\" about the \"disgraceful\" remarks made by players who had knelt in protest of President Barack Obama's policies on racial inequality and police brutality. President Trump also criticized NFL owner Robert Kraft's decision to ban the use of taxpayer-funded stadiums for protests of racial injustice and the treatment of African Americans by police. Kraft, a former NFL executive, said the decision was a \"mistake.\" \"I don't think it's a mistake,\" Kraft said at a press conference in New York, adding that his company would continue to invest in stadiums and training facilities for future NFL teams. On the other hand, he said, \"the NFL is a great league, and I think we have a lot of respect for our players and their families and our country,\" he wrote. 'We have to make sure that we are respectful of their rights and that they are treated with respect and respect,' Kraft wrote in an email to his followers."

Greece had previously voiced reservations about the proposal. The proposed mission to be discussed at a NATO defense ministers meeting in Brussels on Thursday comes days after German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutolgu said they would raise the issue of refugees with the Alliance. According to a Reuters report citing a senior German official, initially reticent Greece has now given the green light for the operation, which could see NATO assets deployed in the Aegean in a mostly intelligence and reconnaissance role. Under the proposal, which would need to be approved by Alliance members, NATO maritime assets would provide information to national coastguards and the EU border agency Frontex to combat illegal smugglers using rickety boats to bring migrants to Europe. Turkey would then take back the refugees, as envisioned as part of a 3 billion-euro ($3.2 billion) EU-Turkey deal agreed to last year. According to German sources, the mission would not be similar to the NATO mission in the Mediterranean intercepting migrant boats making the dangerous run from Libya to Italy. However, NATO ships could intervene in emergency situations to save passengers. \"It is not NATO's remit to push back or stop refugee boats,\" the official told Reuters. The mission would use assets from the Alliance's standing naval group, a permanent reaction force deployed in the Mediterranean. The naval group's current flagship is the German combat support ship \"Bonn.\" Denmark has already said it would provide additional ships to the mission, according to the official. However, it is unclear whether NATO members will approve the mission which may fall outside the bounds of the Alliance's mandate. Complicating matters is a long-running maritime dispute between Greece and Turkey over sovereignty in the Aegean, where the two NATO members' jets regularly engage in dogfights. Turkey has taken in more than 2.5 million Syrian refugees, and is a major transit point for migrants from Asia and Africa. More than a million migrants and refugees reached Europe last year, many making the dangerous boat journey from Turkey to Greece by boat. So far this year, more than 340 have perished in the cold waters trying to reach Europe. cw/msh (AFP, dpa, Reuters)",

Meanwhile, the death toll in Gaza continues to rise. Medics on Monday said the number of Palestinian deaths in Gaza has risen to more than 501 since fighting intensified on Jul 8. Most of the dead are civilians. On the Israeli side, 13 soldiers were killed inside Gaza on Sunday, raising the number of soldiers killed since a ground operation began late on Thursday to 18. Two Israeli civilians also died in mortar and rocket attacks. The Israeli army said that more than 10 militants from Gaza were shot dead on Monday after infiltrating southern Israel.

US President Barack Obama said on Friday that Israel was ready to resume negotiations with Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that controls Gaza, but that the truce would not be reached until the end of this month. Israel, meanwhile, has said it will not allow Hamas to continue attacks on its territory. It has also called on the international community to help broker a truce between Hamas and the Israeli military, which it accuses of supporting the terrorist group. Hamas has denied the accusations, saying it is not a terrorist organization and that it does not have the right to attack Israel. In a letter sent to US diplomats, Hamas spokesman Sean Carmeli said the group was willing to work with Kerry to reach an agreement on a cease-fire.

        "target": "A borderline war The crisis in Syria is in danger of drawing in neighboring countries. Despite the Syrian government's immediate apology, the shelling on the Turkish border has led to concerns about possible escalation. These weren't the first incidents on the Syrian-Turkish border, but the fact that several people on the Turkish side were killed by Syrian shells on Wednesday (03.10.2012) has brought the conflict between the two countries to a new level. It has led the Turkish military to retaliate for the first time. Several people were killed when Turkey shelled Syrian territory. But neither Turkey, which is a member of NATO, nor Syria would benefit from a broader conflict. An adviser to the Turkish president tweeted, \"Turkey has no interest in a war with Syria.\" Volker Perthes, director of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs in Berlin, agrees: \"Assad has no interest in an escalation,\" he told DW. \"That can be seen from the fact that the Syrian information minister apologized and expressed his regret over the victims immediately after the attack on Turkish territory.\" Perthes doesn't think it's likely that the Syrian President, Bashar Assad, wants to provoke Turkey to intervene in Syria. \"That would only accelerate the fall of his regime,\" he said. It's not yet clear who was responsible for the shelling. According to Syria's ally, Russia, it was a \"tragic accident.\" Relationship damaged The armed incidents on the Syrian-Turkish border have been going on for months. According to Amnesty International, some 300,000 Syrians have left their country since the start of the uprising against Assad, and many of them have fled to Turkey. The relationship between the two countries, which used to be close, has deteriorated dramatically, and the Turkish government is now openly supporting the Syrian opposition. \"Turkey is itself a player in the Syrian conflict,\" said Perthes. \"It provides shelter for many refugees and it's through Turkey that supplies come for the opposition.\" NATO has lined up behind Turkey and told Syria to end its \"flagrant violations of international law.\" Call for 'great discretion' The German chancellor, Angel Merkel, has also positioned herself alongside Turkey. \"We call on all parties to show great discretion,\" she said in Berlin. The foreign minister, Guido Westerwelle, declared that everything must be done to deescalate the situation, so that the Syrian conflict did not turn into a conflagration in the region. Indeed, the Syrian crisis is not only spreading to Turkey, but also to Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon. According to Perthes, \"The neighboring countries are partly victims and partly instigators. Jordan too has taken in refugees and supplies the rebels. On the other hand, Iraq has tended to support the government of Bashar Assad.\" Even so, he said, all the neighboring countries had an interest in ensuring the conflict was confined to Syria. Appeal to the international community But the number of Syrian refugees is rising by the day. Ruth J\u00fcttner, a Middle East expert with Amnesty International, believes this will continue in future months. \"It's important that the countries bordering on Syria are supported by the international community in providing accommodation, medical and psychological care and schooling for children,\" she told DW. It's an appeal she directs especially to European countries. The shelling on the Syrian-Turkish border has made it more likely that there will be armed conflict between Syria and its neighbors. According to Perthes, \"It's probably the case that political resistance in Turkey to intervention in Syria is decreasing right now.\"",

The spokesman added that the Turkish government would not be taking any action against Assad in the event of an escalation of the conflict between the two sides. However, he did not rule out the possibility that Ankara would take action to try to prevent the return of Syrian refugees to Turkey. According to German expert Guido Westerwelle, Turkey has \"no plans\" to intervene militarily against Syrian rebels, who have been fighting for months against the regime of President Assad. On Wednesday, Germany's foreign ministry said that it was not possible for Turkey to interfere in Syrian affairs in any way at all. In a statement released by the German Institute for International and Security Affairs (IISS) on its website, the ministry stressed that \"the Turkish side has no intention of intervening in this conflict.\" The statement came after a meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara, where Erdogan expressed his \"concerns\" over the situation in eastern Syria, which he described as an \"unacceptable situation\" for the country. Erdogan, however, said he was \"deeply concerned\" about the lack of Turkish support for Syrian opposition groups. He also said Turkey should not interfere with the internal affairs of other countries, such as the United States, NATO and the European Union (EU). \"We are not in a position where we can say that we will not intervene,\" Erdogan said, according to DW's Ruth J\u00fcttner."

After the elected government of Prime Minister Abdullah al-Thinni was forced out of Tripoli by Libya Dawn, it was forced to move to the far eastern city of Tobruk while Libya Dawn reinstated the old parliament known as the GNC. The fighting and violence has displaced hundreds of thousands of civilians, left hundreds killed and thousands wounded. Most foreign diplomats fled the country and shut their embassies last year.

        "target": "France's conservatives: Combating the National Front with a swing to the right A staunch conservative is joining the race for the French presidency. Republican candidate Francois Fillon could turn into a big problem for right-wing extremist Marine Le Pen's National Front. France's Republicans are moving to the right: by choosing Francois Fillon, voters nominated a presidential candidate who has a reputation as a staunch conservative. The former prime minister has already announced that he intends to refocus politics with the traditional family in mind. Fillon takes a dim view of homosexual couples adopting children. He wants to introduce a cap on the number of refugees allowed into France, he intends to make it harder for foreign nationals to access the social welfare system, and he wants to put Muslim communities and mosques under government control. In addition, Fillon advocates a renationalization of school curricula. Fillon makes gains in FN territory Fillon's agenda could turn out to be a problem for the \"National Front\" (FN). The 62-year-old appeals to similar sentiments as the right-wing party's base: concern about foreign domination and loss of identity, fear of terrorism and crime. \"For a long time, FN was the only political force that addressed those fears,\" said Henrik Uterwedde of the German-French Institute (dfi) in Ludwigsburg. \"Now a politician has arrived on the scene who addresses those fears using a different language and makes them a political offer.\" In rural, Catholic France especially, where traditions still matter a great deal, the avowed Catholic Fillon strikes a chord with his proposals pertaining to family and society policies. He receives support from traditional Catholic groups who, for years, have been able to mobilize crowds for demonstrations against gay marriage. During the intraparty election campaign, Fillon predominantly traveled to France's villages and small towns - regions which FN leader Marine Le Pen had labeled the \"forgotten France,\" regarding herself as their foremost lobbyist. \"Fillon has made gains in an environment that is also canvassed by Le Pen,\" Andreas Jung, Chairman of the Bundestag's German-French parliamentary group, told German broadcaster rbb-Inforadio. \"He does not represent the lofty levels of Parisian politics, but rather provincial entrenchment. Fillon is committed to traditional values, like the family. Therefore, he may not only be capable of defeating Le Pen, but also of taking the lead during the first ballot.\" 'Most dangerous candidate for FN' Consequently, the FN camp is less than enthusiastic about the conservative's candidacy. \"Because of Fillon, we now have a strategy problem,\" Marion Marechal Le Pen, the FN leader's niece, recently told journalists. \"He is the most dangerous candidate for the National Front.\" Pollsters' findings appear to support that statement. Recent surveys establish Fillon as the current favorite in the French presidential election scheduled for next May. However, Fillon's election is not a foregone conclusion. By denouncing the conservative candidate as a member of the establishment, FN tries to win over those who are frustrated with politics and politicians in general. There is persistent opposition against his economic-liberal plans in particular. Fillon wants to abolish the 35-hour working week and raise the retirement age to 65 years. In addition, he wants to cut 500,000 jobs in the public sector and reform industrial law. Fillon is known as an admirer of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. \"Issues pertaining to liberal economic policy have always been heavily contested in France,\" said Uterwedde. \"Fillon's adversaries have already taken up their positions, criticizing what, in France, is called 'ultra-liberalism.'\" That was one of the nastiest words in French politics, he added. An offer for the left Fillon wants to raise VAT by 2 percent. This would predominantly hurt low-income households. Exactly that clientele, however, is wooed by FN with a program that is regarded as rather left-wing. The right-wing extremists are on a clear anti-globalization course, intending to seal off the French economy against foreign countries and exit from the European Union. The party is already trying to present Fillon as a symbol of anarchic, ultra-liberal capitalism. \"Francois Fillon will even go beyond EU demands for austerity and liberalism,\" David Rachline, Marine Le Pen's election campaign manager, wrote on Twitter. According to current polls, it is very likely that Fillon will have to face Marine Le Pen in a runoff election in May. The main hazard for the Republican candidate: his economic-liberal course could deter left-wing voters from choosing the conservative in order to avert Le Pen. \"Francois Fillon will have to start making offers, also to those voters who are closer to the center and more moderate,\" said France expert Uterwedde. \"And he will, prior to the runoff election at the latest, have to make offers to left-wing voters - without changing his original course.\"",
        "generated_story": "Fillon the most dangerous candidate for French presidential election Francois Fillon has been chosen as France's presidential candidate, according to the German-French Institute of Politics (rbb-Inforadio) in a 35-hour interview with dfi. The \"French National Front\" (FN) candidate is Marine Le Pen of the far-right, the \"right-wing\" party (FPV) and the conservative Republican Party (RSP) of France. \"The FN is far more dangerous than any other party,\" said Henrik Uterwedde, a professor of political science at the University of Leuven in the eastern German state of Rhineland-Palatinate. He added that the FN's candidate would be \"very dangerous\" if he were to win the French presidency. RSP leader Andreas Jung, who has served as the party's parliamentary leader for 65 years, said that \"fillon is very dangerous,\" adding that he would not be able to defeat his opponent. Fonseca, meanwhile, is the only candidate who could win a majority of votes in May's federal election, which is due to be held on May 24. In his interview, Foulot said: \"I don't think he's going to lose the election. I think it will be very difficult for him to get the nomination.\" \"If he wins, he'll be the next president,\" he said, adding, \"he'll have a chance of winning the presidency.\" The FN candidate has a long list of supporters, including former French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac, former president of Germany's Social Democrats (SPD), former Chancellor Angela Merkel and former Foreign Minister David Rachline, among others. They all have strong supporters in France, but they all seem to have lost ground on the right. And they're not even close to each other. It's not just the candidates who are dangerous, it's the people who have to decide who is dangerous and who isn't. There's a lot that can go wrong in this race, and that's why we need to make sure that it doesn't turn out like it did last time. That's because, as far as I can tell, there's no one who can do it. You can't just say 'no' to someone who's been in politics for the last 35 years. But you can say \"yes\" to anyone who wants to run for president, even if you're a Catholic or a Protestant, or even a non-Catholic."

        "target": "Berlin court rules Google Street View is legal in Germany A Berlin court has ruled that Google Street View is legal. But that doesn't mean the lawsuits will end, legal scholars say. A Berlin court has ruled that Google Street View is, in fact, legal in Germany. Last Tuesday, the Berlin State Supreme Court (Kammergericht) announced its decision in a court case from late last year, in which a woman had sued Google, fearing that photos of her, her family and the front of her house would be posted on Google Street View and would thus violate her property and privacy rights. The court ruled that it is legal to take photographs from street level, rejecting her argument that Google was trying to take unauthorized pictures. Part of her argument rested on the fact that Google used cameras mounted at three meters (9.84 feet) high, which could see over her two-meter-high hedge. However, the court did not find this argument convincing, given that the photographs were taken from the street, and not the sidewalk. Furthermore, because Google automatically blurs faces and license plates and did allow Germans to opt-out of the service to have their house obfuscated as well, the court did not find any potential violations. This is the first high-level court ruling, which cannot be appealed any further, regarding Street View since the service debuted in Germany at the end of last year. An ongoing debate Since Google announced plans to launch Street View in Germany last summer, debate around the service has become heated, with some politicians trying to stop it at every turn, while German Chancellor Angela Merkel famously said that she would not remove her house from Street View. In November 2010, the company announced that 244,000 German residents in the 20 cities had chosen to opt out of Street View - less than three percent of residents. However, in Germany and everywhere else, the company also allows people to report abuse, inaccuracies or request that something be blurred using an online tool. \"Our job is to develop services that respect these cultural differences,\" Peter Fleischer, Google's global privacy counsel told Deutsche Welle in November 2010. \"We try to anticipate them. We're all internationally-minded people ourselves. We try to guess how people will react to them. But a lot of these services are new and have never been on the market before, so we learn and we adapt as we go along.\" A 'landmark decision' European legal experts called the Berlin ruling a \"landmark decision,\" saying that this would now become part of German case law regarding property rights. \"Yes, other people are now warned: Don't sue Google simply claiming that Google Street View violates personality [or] property rights,\" wrote Thomas H\u00f6ren, a professor of media and communications law at the University of M\u00fcnster, in an e-mail sent to Deutsche Welle. But, he also warned that this decision was very narrow, focusing on the issue of property rights, and not on the larger issues of data protection from Google. \"The problem of Google Street View - to be honest - has never been a problem of personality rights or property rights, but the enormous risk of personal data compilations in cases where people use Google Street View for compiling personal profiles (such as building insurance companies; future employees, et cetera),\" he added. \"And this risk has not been considered by the Berlin courts.\" Similarly, Viktor Mayer-Sch\u00f6nberger, a professor at the Oxford Internet Institute, agreed that this case was \"limited in scope,\" adding in an e-mail, \"The plaintiff never alleged an actual invasion of privacy, just a potential one.\" Author: Cyrus Farivar Editor: Nancy Isenson",
        "generated_story": "German court rules on Google Street View in Germany A German court has ruled in favor of a move to ban the use of street-view technology in the country. The decision comes after a long legal battle between Google and Germany's Kammergericht, a law school in Berlin, and the University of M\u00fcnster, which was founded in November 2010. In the end of last year, the German state Supreme Court ruled against Google's move, ruling that the company should be allowed to sell its products without a license from the federal government. \"The decision is a victory for Google,\" said Peter Fleischer, head of the university's Internet Institute, in an interview with Deutsche Welle. But the court also ruled that Google should not sell products that are not compatible with German law. According to the ruling, Google would have to pay a fine of up to \u20ac500,000 (around $1.5 million). The ruling is the latest in a series of court decisions that have led to a number of high-profile legal challenges. One of them is that Germany should no longer allow Google products to be sold without an license. Another case is in which a German company was found to have violated the terms of an agreement with the state of Bavaria to allow the sale of its services to third-party companies. Google, however, has denied the allegations, saying that it did not have the authority to do so. It is also not clear how the decision will affect other countries, such as the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, or even the United Kingdom. A decision by the Berlin state court on the legality of Google\u2019s move is likely to lead to further legal problems for Germany, as well as for other European countries. However, it is not yet clear whether the move will have a negative impact on German society. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has already said that she will not allow a Google-owned company to take over the management of German Internet services. That is, if Google decides to continue with its search engine, then Germany will be left with no choice but to give up the right to regulate its own Internet service. This would be a huge step forward for German business, but it would not be the first time that such a decision has been made by a court of law, according to Thomas H\u00f6ren, professor of computer science at the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit\u00e4t (Munich) in Munich. On the other hand, German Prime Minister Viktor Mayer-Sch\u00f6nberger has said he will continue to support Google in its efforts to improve its online presence."

Among other things, it proposed jail terms for bankers displaying grave malpractice and causing huge damage. Members of the UK's Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards agreed Wednesday that Britain needed a radical overhaul of its scandal-hit lenders. The panel, which was mostly composed of lawmakers, concluded in its final report that senior bankers must be made personally responsible for malpractice through the introduction of a new criminal offence of reckless misconduct. It would carry a prison sentence. The reputation of the country's banking sector had been damaged in recent years by a string of scandals, including Libor rate-rigging, credit insurance mis-selling and a controversy over staff behavior and bonuses in the run-up to the 2008 global financial crisis. The level of malpractice had been \"shocking and widespread,\" said the commission's chairman, Conservative party lawmaker Andrew Tyrie. RBS cut in two? \"Taxpayers and customers have lost out, and the economy has suffered,\" the 500-page report said. \"Under our recommendations, senior bankers who seriously damage their banks or put taxpayers' money at risk can expect to be fined, banned from the industry or in the worst cases go to jail.\" The commission called for bankers to sign up to a new code of conduct under which all key responsibilities within a bank would be assigned to specific senior officials who would be held responsible. The panel also proposed that more remuneration for bankers should be deferred for longer periods of up to ten years in order to \"reflect the longer run balance between business risks and rewards.\" The commission recommended that the government consider splitting the state-rescued Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) into a good bank and a bad one mopping up toxic assets. The report was published ahead of a key speech by Finance Minister George Osborne on his bank reform plans. hg/ipj (AFP, Reuters)",

PBS, Royal Bank of Scotland and RBS are among the largest lenders in the UK, according to the report, which was released on Wednesday. It said the bank's lending practices were \"unacceptable\" and that it would be \"immoral\" for banks to borrow money from other banks. \"The bank is not a bank,\" said Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the commission, adding that the banking industry was \"in a state of disrepute.\" The commission's report is expected to be published on Thursday. A spokesman for the British government's banking watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), said it was looking into the issue and would recommend an immediate ban."

But a leading think tank has warned against giving raises too soon. Germany's foreign minister and deputy chancellor, Guido Westerwelle, has added his support to comments made by Economics Minster Rainer Bruederle about increased wages for German workers. \"When the economy grows and this growth is substantial and sustainable, then the benefits of this upswing should be felt by the people who worked so hard for it,\" Westerwelle told the Hamburger Abendblatt newspaper in an interview. Westerwelle heads the free-market liberal FDP, which shares power with Chancellor Merkel's Christian coalition. Earlier this week, Bruederle, also an FDP member, said in light of Germany's currently growing economy, those economic gains should trickle down to employees in the form of higher wages. Merkel, who is also the head of the Christian Democratic Union, supported Bruederle's idea. \"That is something the chancellor sees the same way, letter for letter,\" said Merkel's spokesman, Steffen Seibert. Not so fast Earlier this week, analysts predicted growth of 3.5 percent this year and 2 percent in 2011. Germany's five leading economic think tanks also predicted that the number of unemployed would fall below 3 million next year, the lowest level since 1992. Despite the current rosy outlook for the German economy, not everyone is convinced that a growing economy should inevitably lead to higher wages. The president of the German Institute for Economic Research, Klaus Zimmermann, warned against reacting too quickly. \"I can't support the idea of a general wage increase, I think it is too dangerous,\" Zimmermann said in an interview with the Handelsblatt newspaper. Zimmermann wasn't opposed to the idea of raising wages, but said he was against across-the-board increases for all sectors and pointed out that not every industry is benefitting the same from the growing economy. \"We can't forget that the German economy did not resort to mass lay-offs when it wasn't going so well last year,\" Zimmermann said. Raising wages in some branches could be a good idea, Zimmermann said, as that would make those branches more attractive option to potential workers from outside of Germany.

Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko was sworn into office on Friday in a lavish ceremony boycotted by Western diplomats. The previous day, the 56-year-old leader openly accused Germany and neighboring Poland of planning a coup against him. \"There were [in Germany and Poland] plans worked out for an overthrow of the constitutional order,\" Lukashenko said in the Belarusian capital, Minsk, on Thursday. \"This is not an invention of our intelligence agencies.\" Lukashenko, who came to power in 1994, was re-elected last month with 80 percent of the vote in what the opposition and international monitors said was a rigged election. Relations between the reclusive Belarusian government and the West have been strained ever since. 'Belarus question must be answered' German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said in a statement that the accusations were \"baseless\" and an attempt by Lukashenko to draw attention away from his own wrongdoing. \"The EU needs to find a clear political answer to events surrounding the presidential election and the continued incarceration of opposition politicians and their supporters,\" Westerwelle said. A wide-reaching crackdown against the regime's opponents followed Lukashenko's re-election. Hundreds of his critics were arrested and dozens threatened with long-term jail sentences. Poland also dismissed the accusations as absurd and said that relations with Minsk would not be normalized unless all political prisoners were released. Sanctions threat The situation in Belarus pushed the European Union to adopt a resolution on Thursday in support of economic sanctions against the country. The threats earned a sharp rebuke from Lukashenko, who promised the \"hardest possible reaction\" should the bloc impose sanctions against his country. At the same time, the Belarusian prime minister, Mikhail Myasnikovich, travelled to Moscow in a effort to shore up Russian support for Minsk during its standoff with the EU. That meeting ended with a Russian promise not to impose its own set of sanctions on Belarus over an unrelated spat over oil exports and a commitment to resume a nuclear power plant project shelved after the 1986 Chernobyl disaster.

The country's parliament voted on Friday to allow him to run again. Lukashenko, who won a second term in 1994, was barred by the European Union (EU) from participating in the parliamentary elections in Belarus, which were due to take place on Saturday. Belarus is one of the world's poorest countries, with the highest unemployment rate of any other EU country, according to the EU statistics office. In the run-up to Friday's vote, Belarus has said it will hold a referendum on whether or not to extend the term of its former president, Mikhail Myasnikovich, for another four years. \"We will not allow this to happen again,\" said Westerwelle, a political scientist at the University of Stuttgart in Germany. He added that the country was \"not ready\" for the referendum, and that it was not ready for an extension of his term as president. Opposition parties, however, have called on the government of Belarus to step down, saying the president should be allowed to stay on as long as he has the chance to do so. 'The past is the past' The previous day, the opposition parties had called for new elections and a new constitution to be adopted. They also want to see an end to Belarus' long-term reliance on nuclear power and the use of nuclear energy as a weapon of war against the Soviet Union. On Thursday, opposition leader Nancy Isenson said she would not be able to attend the vote because she was unable to get a visa to travel to Moscow. She said the election would be held in accordance with EU law. But she did not rule out the possibility of a return to a post-Soviet Ukraine, where she had served as head of state between 1994 and 1994.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government told the Supreme Court of India on Monday that the Rohingya were \"illegal\" immigrants. The hearing is taking place as Rohingya face severe violence in their native Myanmar. More than 400,000 Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh in the past few weeks to escape military and civilian reprisals that the United Nations has described as \"ethnic cleansing.\" Later on Monday, Myanmar's national security advisor said that his government was willing to welcome the refugees who had fled to Bangladesh back to their native Rakhine state, but that the details of the process still had to be worked out. \"We will make sure that everybody who left their home can return to their home but this is a process we have to discuss,\" Thaung Tun told Reuters news agency after a meeting with British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. It was unclear how this would affect the estimated 40,000 Rohingya believed to have settled in India, including 16,000 of whom are registered with the UN's refugee agency. Read more: Myanmar's Rohingya - A history of forced exoduses The Indian government told the court that it had intelligence data that showed links between some Rohingya Muslims and Pakistan-based terror groups and other international terror organizations. It argued that such links made them a \"serious threat to national security.\" The government also said there was a \"serious possibility of eruption of violence against Buddhists in India by radicalized Rohingya.\" Lawyer Colin Gonsalves, who in a separate case is representing about 7,000 Rohingya living in the northern Indian city of Jammu, countered the government's assertions. \"We just want to know: 40,000 people have been here, many of them for the last five years. Have you [the government] filed a single charge sheet, is anyone being prosecuted in the criminal court for being a terrorist? The answer is: no,\" he told DW. The court has adjourned the hearing in the matter to October 3. Lack of evidence India says it is not bound by the UN convention on refugees as it is not a signatory to the accord, but human rights activists disagree. \"The principle of non return of a person to a place where he will be executed or tortured has become a principle of customary international law which India follows,\" Gonsalves told DW. \"And it has attained the status of 'jus cogens,' which is a principle of law that no country can say is not applicable to it, such as torture and genocide.\" In a communication sent to all states in August, the Home Ministry [interior ministry] said the illegal migrants were more susceptible to terrorist recruitment efforts. But an investigation by Indian broadcaster NDTV found \"little evidence of the government claim.\" The investigation that was carried out at major Rohingya settlements in the country showed little involvement in criminal wrongdoing by the refugees. Lack of any evidence to support the government claim has led to speculations that the Rohingya were being targeted for their religion by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu-nationalist government. \"It is really unfortunate that the government is going back on its commitment to refugees which it has reiterated several times in the past merely because these Rohingyas are Muslims,\" said lawyer Prashant Bhushan, who filed the plea on behalf of two Rohingya men. \"I mean this is clearly a case of religious discrimination and an attempt to arouse a sort of feeling of... an anti-Muslim feeling or try and communalise the situation,\" he told reporters outside the courthouse. The UN's human rights chief last week deplored Indian government's move to deport Rohingya refugees. \"India cannot carry out collective expulsions, or return people to a place where they risk torture or other serious violations,\" Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein said. The Rohingya are an Indo-Aryan people, the vast majority of whom are Muslims. They usually migrate to India through a rather porous border to escape persecution in their native Rakhine state in Myanmar, where they have been denied citizenship rights. They are viewed by the local authorities as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. Myanmar's Buddhist majority is often accused of subjecting them to discrimination and violence.

Hundreds of people, the majority of them Rohingya, have been killed in the violence that has seen many homes destroyed and several villages burned down. Myanmar's government maintains the crackdown is part of a counter-terrorism drive, while the UN's al-Hussein has said that it \"seems a textbook example of ethnic cleansing.\"",

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday called on the government of Myanmar to take action against the Rohingya, saying they pose a 'grave threat.' India's foreign minister, Prashant Bhushan, said the country's security situation was \"very serious,\" adding that India should take the necessary steps to protect its citizens. \"We have to act decisively and decisively,\" he said in a statement released by the Indian Home Ministry. The statement came a day after India announced that it would send a special envoy to New Delhi to discuss the situation in Myanmar. India, which has been grappling with the issue of Rohingya refugees since August 25, has called for an immediate ceasefire between the Myanmar government and the Buddhists in the state of Rakhine, according to NDTV, an Indian news agency. However, India has yet to agree on a ceasefire, while the UN has said it will hold talks with Myanmar on October 3. In August, the United Nations said that Myanmar's military and security forces were responsible for the deaths of over 1,000 Rohingya Muslims. On Monday, Indian Foreign Minister Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein said India was ready to provide humanitarian assistance to Myanmar if the refugees were to be allowed to return to their home countries. He added that \"it is our responsibility as a country to ensure the safety of its people.\" India and Myanmar have been at loggerheads in recent weeks over the influx of refugees from Myanmar, who have fled to neighboring Bangladesh, where they are being persecuted by Buddhist mobs. Last month, a court in New York ruled that Indian troops should not enter Myanmar without a valid visa, and that a visa should be issued to all refugees who cross the border into India. Earlier this year, Myanmar banned the use of the term \"Rohingya\" in its official name, \"in the name of security and stability.\" The move came after a UN report found that more than 1.5 million Rohingya were living in India illegally during the last five years. According to UN special rapporteur Colin Gonsalves, many of them had fled their homes to escape persecution and persecution in neighboring Myanmar after being forced to flee to Bangladesh. A number of Indian officials, including the Home Minister, have also expressed concern about the growing threat posed by Rohingya."

        "target": "Armstrong stripped of Tour de France titles Cyclist Lance Armstrong has been stripped of his seven Tour de France titles and banned from cycling for life, in a much-anticipated ruling by the sport's international governing body. Monday's announcement by Pat McQuaid, the president of the International Cycling Union, ratified recommendations in an October report from the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), which ordered Armstrong's Tour de France titles be wiped out. \"Lance Armstrong has no place in cycling,\" said McQuaid. Addressing his remarks to cyclists, McQuaid said the fight against doping was his priority. \"UCI is listening and is on your side. We\u2019ve come too far in the fight against doping to return to our past. Cycling has a future and something like this must not happen again.\" The scathing USADA report included testimony from 11 former teammates, accusing Armstrong of running the \"most sophisticated\" doping program in the sport's history. The USADA said it had collected evidence to prove the seven-time Tour de France winner had engaged in the biggest doping conspiracy to date. Effect on cycling and sponsorship Monday's decision comes as the sport of cycling reels from Armstrong's well-documented fall from grace. Organizers of the Tour de France will be trying to move on from the scandal as the race prepares to celebrate its centenary next year. Sponsors have been deserting Armstrong and the sport in general. Last week, Nike - one of Armstrong's main corporate sponsors - said it was terminating its relationship with the cyclist and accused him of deception. Trek, the company that made the bicycles Armstrong rode to seven titles, announced on the same day it would terminate its sponsorship contract - as did the beer maker Anheuser-Busch. The Dutch institution Rabobank ended its association with professional cycling after the doping allegations came to light, leaving 17 riders in need of a sponsor. Last week Armstrong also announced he would step down from his own charity, the Lance Armstrong Foundation, also known as Livestrong, a move believed to have been intended to limit the damage to the organization from the USADA report. Armstrong appears Lance Armstrong spoke briefly to thousands of riders in Texas at a benefit organized by his charity, the day before UCI's decision. \"I've been better, but I've also been worse,\" he said. \"Obviously it has been an interesting and difficult couple of weeks.\" jr/rc (Reuters, AFP, AP)",

The US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) said on Monday that Armstrong had tested positive for banned substances in October. Armstrong, who had been banned from cycling since October due to an alleged violation of US anti-doping rules, was stripped Monday of all titles he had won since the start of the cycling world's most famous sporting event in September. \"We are shocked and disappointed,\" Armstrong said in a statement released by his foundation, Livestrong, which was founded by former cyclist Pat McQuaid. He added that he was \"deeply disappointed\" in the decision, adding that \"it was a very difficult and difficult couple of weeks\" for Armstrong and the organization. In addition, the UCI said it was looking into the allegations of Armstrong's use of a banned substance in an attempt to cheat on a drug test, and that it would be \"very difficult\" to find a solution to the problem. A spokesman for the French cycling federation said the investigation would focus on the case \"in light of what we have learned so far.\" \"The investigation is ongoing,\" the spokesman told AFP news agency, referring to a report from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, in which Armstrong was found guilty of using a prohibited substance during his time in cycling. Anheuser-Busch, one of cycling's biggest sponsors, has also been accused of trying to influence the outcome of last year's Tour of Ireland. US authorities have also said they are examining whether Armstrong may have used banned drugs in his quest to win the Tour. However, Armstrong did not immediately respond to requests for comment Monday, saying he would not comment further on that report. Read more: \"I don't know if Lance is aware of any doping allegations against me,\" he said. 'I'm not going to comment on it' The decision to strip Armstrong of titles came as a surprise to many cycling fans, including some who have been critical of him for years. It was the first time that an athlete had received a doping ban in more than a year, according to media reports."

President Obama vowed to nominate a successor 'in due time,' despite political opposition. The 79-year old justice died in his sleep, presumably of natural causes, local media reported on Saturday. Scalia was visiting Texas for a hunting trip, and his body was discovered after he failed to appear for breakfast in the resort where he was staying. US President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama extended \"their deepest condolences to Justice Scalia's family,\" White House deputy spokesman Eric Schultz said. Texas Governor Greg Abbott described the conservative justice as a \"man of God, a patriot and an unwavering defender of the written Constitution and the rule of law.\" \"He was the solid rock who turned away so many attempts to depart from and distort the Constitution. His fierce loyalty to the Constitution set an unmatched example, not just for judges and lawyers, but for all Americans,\" Abbot said. Battle for the empty seat His passing is likely to open a new political front between President Barack Obama and the Republican Party, as Scalia's replacement could shift the composition of the court towards a more liberal persuasion. Several Republican lawmakers have already urged Obama to leave the decision to the next president who will be voted in later this year. \"The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court justice,\" Senate Republican majority leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement, referring to the upcoming November general election. \"Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president,\" McConnell concluded. President Obama, however, said he would fulfill his constitutional duty and nominate Scalia's successor \"in due time.\" \"These are responsibilities I take seriously, and so should everyone. They are bigger than any one party,\" he said. Decades of controversy Scalia joined the Supreme Court in 1986, becoming the first Italian-American to serve in the top judicial body. He was nominated by US President Ronald Reagan. Throughout his long carrier, Scalia voted in favor of privacy and protecting defendants' rights, but also against legalizing abortion, same-sex marriage and gun control. He also drew public attention for his theatrical flair and sharpness of tongue, as well as his alleged unwillingness to compromise. In June last year, the nine-person Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage with a five-to-four vote. Scalia, who was in the minority, commented he would \"hide my head in a bag\" if his own name were associated with the decision. He also said that the majority opinion was \"couched in a style that is as pretentious as its content is egotistic.\" dj/jm (AP, Reuters, AFP, dpa)",

        "target": "Opinion: The pope's impossible mission in Mexico Pope Francis's trip to Mexico is a dangerous mission - a diplomatic as well as political balancing act, one that brings with it enormous expectations. Francis won't be able to meet them, says DW's Astrid Prange. Dead prisoners, disappearing students, refugees shot dead and murdered priests. Mexico has lived through one violent episode after the other. The mood in the nation is explosive. And now this: just a day before the pope is set to arrive, more than 50 people died in the largest prison revolt in the country's history. What meaning does the pope's presence hold on such an occasion? Only one thing is certain: Francis won't be able to resolve the problems of the world's second largest Catholic nation in just a five-day trip. The unrealistic demands placed on him are not something he can fill. Yet the pope carries with him an important message: you don't have to love your enemies but you do need to speak with them. And he's living the example himself by meeting with the Russian Orthodox Patriarch Kirill on a stopover in Cuba on his way to Mexico. Cuba all over again It's sensational! Bannings and mutual ex-communications are ancient history. Nearly a millennium after the split, the head of the Roman Catholic Church and the head of the Russian Orthodox Church are speaking to each other. It's not as if the two will become friends - their positions are far too different. Yet their centuries-old enmity feels out of place and in view of the massive worldwide persecution of Christians, almost unchristian. And both of these church leaders know this. In Mexico, efforts to stem the polarizing forces at play in society have not been successful. The extreme differences between rich and poor are dividing Mexican society. President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto has prioritized economic growth over dialogue with his critics - a group which includes students as well as teachers and union members who regularly protest against government policies. They demand an end to lawlessness and corruption. The presumed murder of 43 teaching students in Iguala in September 2014, a crime which remains unsolved, stands as a symbol of the lawlessness sweeping Mexico. The recent mutiny in a Monterrey jail serves as further proof of the country's shortcomings in regard to human rights and the rule of law. With a visit to Ciudad Juarez and the largest prison in Mexico, Francis will only make that deficiency more transparent. Even the pope of peace has enemies. The route he's chosen to take on his travels through the country has displeased the staunchly Catholic president. A meeting with the relatives of the Iguala victims is therefore hush-hush and participation in a holy mass remains secret. Considering the tense situation in the country, it's still possible that the pope's route will change once again. The church in the pillory Even within his own church, Francis has met with opposition. A meeting he requested with victims from the church's abuse scandal will not take place - a bitter disappointment for many former seminarians who were abused by Marcial Maciel, the founder of the Legion of Christ, and members of his order. It's just one example of how impunity continues even within the church itself. None of the perpetrators have yet to answer for their crimes in court. It appears as though the pope has accomplished more on the world stage than he has brought on reforms to the Vatican. Despite the revolutionary coming together of Cuba and the US and the revolutionary meeting with Patriarch Kirill, the revolution in Rome has yet to materialize. Do you have something to say? Add your comments below. The thread to this editorial closes in 24 hours.",

The Vatican has refused to allow the pontiff to travel to the country for a five-day visit. But the Vatican is willing to let him travel. In a statement released on Friday, Pope Francis said that he would not be allowed to visit Mexico for more than 24 hours. \"I will not allow this to happen,\" the pope said, adding that the trip was \"unprecedented.\" \"It is impossible to imagine a pope traveling to a country where there are so many people who are not Christians,\" he said. Astrid Prange, the head of Mexico's Legion of Christ, told DW: \"The pope is not going to be able to go to any country without the support of the Roman Catholic Church. He will be unable to do that because Mexico is a Christian country, and because of that, there is no other country that has the capacity to deal with such a large number of people,\" she added. More than a millennium of persecution In the past, Francis has traveled to many countries, including the United States, Canada, Mexico, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Brazil, India, China, Russia and South Korea. Most of these countries have a long history of persecuting Christians, particularly in Latin America, where they are persecuted for their Christian faith. That's why the Pope's visit was criticized by many in the Catholic community, who said it was a \"disaster\" for the church. It was the first time since the end of World War II that a papal visit to an archipelago of Christian churches had been delayed by the death of a priest and the expulsion of hundreds of thousands of Christians from their homes. At the same time, many of those who had fled persecution in their native countries are now returning to their home countries. Many of them have fled their homeland to seek refuge in other countries such as Germany, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece and Italy. They have no choice but to follow the lead of Pope Benedict XVI."

Prison guards in several European countries carried out reprisals against detainees who talked to the Council of Europe's Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT), the new CPT report has revealed. The council considers this a violation of the spirit of cooperation between the CPT and the Council of Europe's member states. According to the CPT's 24th General Report, released on Wednesday, reprisals were carried out against prisoners in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Greece, Hungary, Moldova, Russia, Spain, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and Ukraine. \"Intimidation or retaliation against persons the CPT has interviewed may not only violate their human rights but also strikes a blow to the preventive mechanism established by the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture,\" CPT President Letif H\u00fcseynov said in a statement. \"I urge national authorities to respect their obligation to prevent, investigate and punish such actions.\" The report also highlighted several problems with the detention of juveniles around Europe, and proposed a series of practical measures to protect young people's rights when detained. Ad hoc visits The little-known CPT, now 25 years old, represents a unique approach to international torture prevention. A team of specialists make roughly 180 visits a year to all kinds of detention centers (including prisons, police stations, holding centers for immigration detainees, psychiatric hospitals, and even social care homes) all across the 47-member Council of Europe - one of the few international blocs that offer platforms for dialogue with Eastern European regimes considered to have poor human rights records, such as Russia, Azerbaijan, and Ukraine. The method combines the carrot of talks with government officials and the stick of ad hoc visits, which all members are committed to allowing into their prisons. Once inside, the CPT also has the right to interview any detainees it chooses - in private, though of course the detainees have the right to refuse. \"The first thing to say is how important the CPT is,\" said Carla Ferstman, director of Redress, a UK-based organization that helps torture survivors. \"As a result of their boot work over a very long period of time, the UN has set up a global system which in many ways mirrors the approach of the CPT.\" But given that the committee has no powers to enforce its proposals to governments, there are question marks over its effectiveness. \"In the report, they complain about how some of the recommendations they've made have not been implemented,\" said Ferstman. \"It's a sign that they're a little bit frustrated.\" But in the long run, she maintains, the CPT has more than proved its value. \"The dialogue that they are able to have is really important,\" she said. \"Looking long-term, they have been very effective.\" CIA collusion, asylum seekers The CPT's report comes a day after Amnesty International released its own report on European collusion with the CIA's torture program. While the CPT's report examines more prosaic day-to-day mistreatment, rather than mass rendition of terrorist suspects at the behest of the US, there are obvious links between the two, since some countries - such as Poland, Macedonia, and the UK - are highlighted in both reports. \"What is finally coming out in all of this is that the Europeans, despite all the criticism of the Bush and Obama administrations on the use of torture - so many of them connived,\" said Judy Dempsey, senior associate at Carnegie Europe. \"It's really a double standard. This report is quite damning and quite shameful, and it follows the Amnesty International one as well.\" The CPT's work also mentions the mistreatment of asylum seekers, a problem increasingly afflicting European countries that take in the largest number of asylum seekers - particularly Spain, Italy, and Greece. \"With Greece there are two things to remember,\" Dempsey told DW. \"A - the appalling situation of the prison system, and B - the lack of training among police of how to deal with asylum seekers. Awful things have happened. Parallel to this is the illegal detention centers. There have been lots of cases of terrible mistreatment over the last several years.\" \"Immigration detention is a growing issue,\" added Ferstman. \"In the UK, there was a whole parliamentary inquiry into one immigration detention center, where some of the women alleged that guards propositioned them in order to get quick treatment on their claims. Each country has its own history of torture.\"",

In the last several years, the U.S. has been accused of using torture as a weapon of mass destruction and torture. The US and its allies are now trying to convince the world that torture is not a crime, and that it should be treated with respect and dignity. But it is also a problem that needs to be addressed, says Carla Ferstman, executive director of Redress, a human rights organization in Washington, D.C."

Up to 25,000 people - many of them refugees fleeing the advancing Soviet Red Army - died in the inferno that raged in the city for days. \"There was nothing left, nothing,\" a frail, bent man with a checkered cap recalled, \"just rubble and death.\" He was leaning on the balustrade of a viewing platform in Dresden's old gasometer, staring down at the 360-degree painting by the Iranian-German artist Yadegar Asisi; sirens howled from hidden speakers and strobe lighting illuminated the ruined churches and black smoke billowing from the burnt skeletons that were once buildings. The man swallowed, his voice hoarse, barely audible: \"It's so hard being here.\" The soundtrack and images, he said, \"bring back too many memories.\" 'So, so many dead' He was 15, he recalled, working on a school essay when the sirens began to wail. He never finished the essay. Instead, he ran for shelter with his family. When they returned home three days later, the roof had been blown off, the windows smashed. \"But we were lucky: We survived,\" he said. \"There were so, so many dead.\" His voice broke and, muttering an apology, he shuffled off. The bombings were intended to break the German population's morale - a decision that to many was incomprehensible, given that the war had long been decided and Dresden's economic and strategic importance was relatively minimal. Consequently, the death and destruction wreaked by the Allied bombers quickly became a tool, first for the Nazi propagandists in the last months of the war, then by the East German regime for its anti-West propaganda, and then later by neo-Nazi groups, who traditionally congregate on February 13. Even today, \"the debate continues about guilt and innocence, even about the exact number of victims,\" Dresden Mayor Helma Orosz told a packed audience, including delegations from abroad, gathered for a memorial service in the city's Frauenkirche, which in 2005 was rebuilt with the help of private donations after Germany's reunification, many of them from the United States and Great Britain. Call for peace \"War, hatred and violence begin in people's minds,\" Orosz said. \"We must resist any attempt at once again categorizing people based on their origin and skin color,\" she added, referring to what has often been described as a right-wing catchall movement called PEGIDA, generally translated as Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West, which has taken to the streets in Dresden since October. Later, on a platform overlooking thousands of people, many of them wearing white roses as a sign of peace while bracing the icy cold outside the church, Orosz called on Dresden to remember every victim of the Nazi terror - a plea that was reiterated by German President Joachim Gauck when he took to the microphone: \u201cWe don't want the pain that people suffered here to be misused by others.\u201d Behind him, the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, who, back in the Frauenkirche, had talked of the \u201cmiracle that peace in Europe represents,\u201d leaned in closer to his interpreter. Then, as evening fell over Dresden and church bells tolled, thousands - possibly as many as 10,000, according to the city's press office - lined up along Dresden's riverfront, holding hands to commemorate the dead and call for peace as police men dressed in black riot gear looked on. \"I can remember it all,\" Siegfriede Leonhard, a vivacious woman in her late 70s said. She was 7 when the bombs fell, she said, and had been coming to the commemorations in Dresden \"for at least 60 years.\" Sometimes, she said, stomping her feet to keep warm, she wondered whether she shouldn't remember at home, alone. \"",
        "generated_story": "Dresden hit by Allied bombings 70 years ago The German city of Dresden was hit on February 13, 1945, during the Allied bombing campaign. The bombing killed at least 7,000 people and wounded more than 1,500. In the last months of the war, Dresden has become one of Germany's most famous tourist attractions. On the morning after the bombing, the city's mayor, Helma Orosz, told DW that she was shocked to hear the news. \"I was in shock,\" she said, referring to the attack on the Frauenkirche in eastern Germany, where the Red Army had taken over the town in February 1945. She said she had never heard of such an attack before, but that it was the first time she'd heard about it. It was also the second time that the German capital had been hit in the same way, and the third time since the end of World War II, when a bomb went off in October 1945 in Dresden, killing 7 people, injuring more and injuring many more. That's when it all changed. Seventy years later, in 2005, Germany became the world's biggest tourist destination, with over 1.5 million visitors a year. But it wasn't just tourists who were shocked by the bombings. There were thousands of Germans who came to Dresden to see the sights, as well as people who didn't know what was going on in their own country. Many of them were born in Germany. They came from all over Europe, including the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and even the Soviet Union. And they all came here for a reason: They wanted to make sure that Germany was safe and that they would be able to live in peace and prosperity in Europe. This was not to be the case, however, because the Germans were not willing to give up the fight against the Nazis. So, they decided to take a look at Dresden's history and see if there was anything they could do to help the victims. Then they went on their way. After all, it's not just Dresden that was attacked, there were also attacks on other German cities, such as Berlin, Cologne, Hamburg, Munich, Paris, Rome, Milan and Berlin. These attacks were part of a larger wave of anti-Nazi propaganda that swept across the country in 1945 and then spread to other parts of Europe and North Africa. One of those attacks was on a train that took off from Dresden. At least seven people were killed in that train, according to eyewitnesses. Another was wounded in a bombing of an air base in western Germany three days later. Dozens of people died in those bombings, while hundreds of thousands more were injured in other attacks. Only a handful of German citizens survived the attacks, which were carried out by Soviet forces. German Chancellor Joachim Gauck visited Dresden on Friday and said he was \"very happy\" with the outcome. He also said that his country was doing well, despite the fact that many of its citizens were still suffering from the effects of war."

        "target": "Experts: Taliban have not changed strategy with Kabul restaurant attack The weekend attack on a Kabul restaurant frequented by foreigners came as no surprise to international organizations on the ground. Experts don't believe the Taliban have changed their strategy to target more civilians. Dramatic scenes must have played out in the restaurant: Guests sought cover under tables as a group of terrorists shot wildly into the dining rooms. News agencies report the restaurant owner tried in vain to fend off the attackers. He was among the more than 20 people who perished, most of whom were employees at international organizations. The attackers were also among the dead. During the evening dinner rush, at 7:00 p.m. Friday (17.01.2014), one of three Taliban members detonated his explosives-laden vest and blew a breach in the highly secured restaurant. Neither the man-high blast walls, nor the secured access points with armed guards could stop the attackers. The two remaining terrorists were killed later in a firefight with security forces at the scene. No change in Taliban strategy The suicide bombing on the popular Lebanese restaurant, Taverna Du Liban, in the high-end Kabul neighborhood of Wazir Akbar Khan was the worst attack so far in 2014. Afghanistan votes for a new president in April; and the international troops are scheduled to withdraw from the country by the end of the year. Although there are plans for a small contingent to remain in Afghanistan, President Hamid Karzai first has to sign a bilateral security agreement with the United States. But he continues to play for time. In this context, the Taliban may be targeting civilians more in order to drive out not just the military coalition, but the entire international community. Yet \"as horrible as this incident is, I don't see a change in strategy,\" said Thomas Ruttig, the co-director of the Afghan Analysts Network. Similar attacks have also been launched before, \"at least 12 to 15 times in the past eight years,\" Ruttig said. The worst attack was in 2012 at Qargha Lake, a popular weekend destination near Kabul. More than 20 people were killed, all of them Afghans. Extensive security precautions The Taliban, which normally doesn't miss an opportunity for fiery rhetoric, hasn't declared a change in strategy. A spokesman for the Islamist militant group said the attack was retaliation for a NATO airstrike in Parwan Province, a few kilometers north of Kabul. According to an assistant of the Afghan president, seven children and one woman died in the coalition strike. \"You have to carefully monitor the security situation,\" Nils W\u00f6rmer, head of the Konrad Adenauer Institute in Kabul, told DW. \"But I think it's a bit early to talk about a change in [Taliban] strategy.\" W\u00f6rmer's office lies just a few hundred meters from the site of Friday's attack. He could clearly hear the explosion, which shook the window panes in his office. \"It was immediately clear to me that something had happened,\" W\u00f6rmer recounted. But the Konrad Adenauer Institute was prepared. \"We had a relatively concrete warning in the last week related to our neighborhood, and we were very cautious,\" W\u00f6rmer said. He met with colleagues in his secured office. Like most of the international organizations, the Konrad Adenauer Institute is also integrated into the security networks. \"The security precautions are high,\" W\u00f6rmer said. \"But that doesn't exclude the possibility that something similar could happen again.\" But the Afghan security forces have succeeded in preventing many attacks in the past few months, he said. Kabul residents criticize Taliban An informal, impromptu poll by DW's Kabul correspondent, Hussein Sirat, suggested the Taliban are not winning Afghan hearts and minds with such attacks. \"Wherever the Taliban have killed civilians, they have not achieved their goal,\" said Mirwais, a pedestrian in the Kabul city center. Idris, another Kabul resident, seconded Mirwais' sentiment. \"The Taliban intimidate the people so that the security agreement won't be signed,\" he said. \"But the people won't bend to this intimidation.\" How the international organizations adapt to the tense security situation in Kabul will come after many conversations, analyses, and briefings in the following days. But W\u00f6rmer is not thinking about giving up. \"We have a clear agenda and long-term projects, which I considered to be very sensible,\" W\u00f6rmer said. \"I am of the opinion, as I was before, that what I'm doing here with the Konrad Adenauer Institute is worth the risks.\"",

        "target": "Teabag filter cleans water with nanotechnology A new water filter developed in South Africa could provide millions of people with clean drinking water. The filter, about the size and shape of a teabag, would be inexpensive, easy to distribute and simple to use. Marelize Botes is conducting a final set of tests on a new type of diminutive water filter before industrial production can begin. The microbiologist pours water from a plastic bottle though a high-tech, teabag-sized filter before analyzing it in her in her laboratory at the University of Stellenbosch in South Africa. \"The filter is much cheaper than bottled water as well as any other filter on the market,\" she told Deutsche Welle. Instead of being filled with black or green tea, the bag contains active carbon granules and is made from nanofibers treated with biocide, which kills bacteria rather than simply filtering them from the water. Nanotech for pennies \"This project takes nanotechnology to the poorest of the poor people who live in this world, and it will make a difference in their lives,\" said Eugen Cloete, who in addition to inventing the filter is dean of the faculty of science at Stellenbosch University and chair of Stellenbosch University's Water Institute. With some 300 million people in Africa - and over a billion worldwide - living without access to clean drinking water, the need for such a filter is huge. When in mass production, the developers said they expect the teabag to cost just a few South African cents (under half a US cent and under a third of a euro cent). In addition to being inexpensive, Botes said, the filter is also easy to distribute to rural area and simple to use as it can be place in an adapter that fits on nearly any regular-sized plastic bottle. Each filter can clean one liter (one quart) of the most polluted water to the point where it is completely safe to drink. Once used, the filter can be disposed of and is biodegradable. African countries, led by Somalia, Mauritania and Sudan, were ranked to have the most vulnerable water supplies, according to a June report by UK-based risk consultancy firm Maplecroft. Decentralized use The filter's small size and light weight make it ideal for rural areas where other means of filtration do not exist, Cloete said. \"It is simply impossible to build purification infrastructure at every polluted stream,\" Cloete said. \"So we have to take the solution to the people. The water is cleaned right then and there when you drink from the bottle.\" The filter is now undergoing testing by the South African Bureau of Standards, after which Cloete and his team hope it can be rolled out to the United Nations and non-governmental organizations that have expressed interest in it by the end of the year. The project grew out of research into larger filters, according to Cloete. \"We were busy developing filters for larger applications, but when you do the tests in the labatory you do the tests on a much smaller scale,\" he said. \"The results we were getting on a smaller amount of water promoted me to think about a smaller application.\" Author: Joerg Poppendieck, Sean Sinico Editor: Anke Rasper",
        "generated_story": "Water filter for decentralized drinking in Africa The South African Bureau of Standards has approved a new water filter to be used in the country's water supply. The new filter will be available in South Africa by the end of the year. According to a report in Deutsche Welle, the new system would be able to provide water to people in need of clean drinking water. \"The new technology will allow people to drink water from the same source as before,\" the report said, adding that it would also allow for the use of renewable energy sources such as solar cells, wind turbines and solar panels. It is expected that the system will have the capacity to meet the needs of more than 1.5 million people. However, it is not yet clear how much water it will cost to make the water available to those who need it, according to an expert at the University of Stellenbosch University in Johannesburg. Under half a third of a euro cent is needed for a water purification system to work, said the expert, who is also a professor of water science and technology, at a university in Gauteng. He added that this would make it possible for people who do not have access to clean water, to have a reliable source of energy, and to use it in a way that would not be harmful to their health and well-being. At the moment, however, there is no way to know for sure whether the technology is being used effectively or not. In the event of an emergency, a government-appointed expert on water quality said it was \"highly unlikely\" the government would approve such a system. But, he added, \"if it were possible, we would consider it a good idea.\" The report also pointed out that there was a lack of awareness among the public about the benefits of decentralizing water supplies. For example, many South Africans believe that decentralization is a bad idea and that water is more expensive to produce than it should be. That's why the World Health Organization (WHO) has called for an end to water rationing in all African countries by 2020. This would mean that more people would have to pay more for water than they currently have. While the United Nations is calling for more transparency and transparency in water use in developing countries, this is unlikely to happen until at least 2030, when the world's largest water supplier, Maplecroft, is due to start producing its own water for drinking purposes. There are also concerns over the impact on the environment of climate change and the effects on people's health, particularly those living in extreme poverty and suffering from high levels of extreme heat and extreme diseases. So, in order to reduce the number of people living with chronic diseases and reduce their risk of dying from heat stroke and other forms of cancer, Canada's federal government has set a target of just a few percent of all water consumption by 2030. Canada has also set an ambitious target for reducing its reliance on fossil fuels, with the aim of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent by 2050 by reducing the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere."

The ruling primarily affects Germany's Turkish minority. The European Union's highest court on Thursday ruled in favor of a Turkish citizen, who was denied a visa to live in Germany with her husband, because she was illiterate and therefore unable to demonstrate basic German-language skills. According to the court, a lack of language skills shouldn't automatically lead to the rejection of an entry visa application. Instead, Germany must consider the unique circumstances of each individual case. The court went on to say that quickly granting visas for spouses improves the quality of life and promotes the integration of foreign residents. Specifically addressing the case of the Turkish plaintiff, the court ruled that the rejection of her visa had violated a bilateral treaty between Turkey and the EU. In 1970, Brussels and Ankara agreed not to tighten their residency laws for each other's citizens. Law only applies to some In 2007, Germany introduced the requirement that spouses from certain non-EU countries must demonstrate a basic grasp of German before being granted a visa to live in Germany with their husbands or wives. Spouses affected by the law are required to obtain a basic language certificate from recognized centers, such as Germany's Goethe Institute, proving that they have an A1 level, or \"Beginning German\" language ability. The German government claims that the goal of the language requirement is to prevent forced marriages as well as marriages made simply for the sake of obtaining a visa. Citizens of European Free Trade Association (EFTA) member states are exempt from the language requirement. That includes Iceland, Lichtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. In addition, citizens of Australia, Canada, Israel, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea and the United States also don't have to demonstrate German-language skills. slk/xx (AFP, AP, dpa, KNA)",

Striker Mario Gomez got things going in the 10th minute for Bayern and also scored the final goal in the 75th minute off a corner kick from Franck Ribery. Ribery came on as a substitute five minutes earlier, making his first appearance for the team since injuring his ankle in September.

Hoffenheim also have 18 points but are two places ahead of Nuremberg in eighth place on goal difference. Author: Matt Zuvela (dpa, sid) Editor: Sean Sinico",
        "generated_story": "Bayern Munich 3-0 Freiburg: Papiss Demba Cisse seals a crucial win for Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga on Sunday. The German side came away with the win in their first league match of the season, beating FC Nuremberg 5-2. Bayern's Mario Gomez scored the first goal of his Bundesliga career in his first match for the club, scoring the second in a row. Germany's second-placed side, who have lost three of their last four games, have been on the back foot since the end of last season's first half, but they have yet to win a Bundesliga match since September. German coach Frank-Walter Steinmeier's side had to settle for a 2-1 win over Hoffenheim at the weekend, as they were unable to find a way past their top-flight opponents. Schalke's Franck Ribery had a goal and an assist for his side's third goal in as many games this season. \"It was a very important moment for our team,\" said German defender Matt Zuvela, adding that he was \"very happy\" with his team-mates' performance. But it was not enough for Frankfurt to take the game to the brink of a draw. After a long wait, Bayern finally managed to get a point on their way to a 4-3 win at home to Mainz. In the 75th minute, the German club took the lead for good with a quick counter-attack that gave Rhineland-Palatinate a chance to level the score at 1-one. It was the 25th time in Bundesliga history that a Bayern player has scored in front of 100,000 fans. That's a lot of people, and it's not just the fans who are happy. There's also the fact that the team's fans are not happy about the way they've been treated by the media. They don't want to see their fans booing them, so they're going to have to wait and see what happens. On the other hand, there's no reason to think that they won't be booed again, because they didn't win the match at all. For the Germans, this is a big win and they'll be back in action next week in Cologne, where they will be hoping to make it back into the top four."

They were originally arrested for taking photographs of restricted areas. Slovak citizens detained by the Iranian authorities on suspicion of taking photographs out of bounds have returned home, said Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico. Eight people in total were arrested in May after taking photographs of restricted areas. A Slovakian news website said the group was detained near the central city of Isfahan, where Iran has nuclear facilities. The six that have been freed attended a news conference held by Prime Minister Fico in the capital, Bratislava on Sunday. Fico told reporters that the government was working to secure the release of the remaining two paragliders who are stiil in custody. \"Negotiations were fair and their result is the release of six out of eight detainees,\" Fico was quoted as saying on the government's website. He added that Slovakia had not made any \"financial commitments\" in the negotiation process. Detainees 'unaware' of rule-breaking One of the released paragliders, Vladislav Frigo, said the group did not break any rules it was aware of. \"We had information that there was a ban on taking photographs below the height of 2,300 metres. We were taking pictures from higher (altitudes),\" said Frigo. He added that the detainees were well treated, had access to television, a refrigerator and could cook for themselves as well as getting regular meals. Foreign nationals accused of spying In recent years, Iran has levelled accusations of espionage against both foreign nationals and Iranians. Two U.S. citizens - Josh Fattal and Shane Bauer - were sentenced to eight years in jail for spying after being arrested while hiking along the Iraq-Iran border in 2009. They denied espionage - neighbouring Oman helped secure their release in 2011 by posting bail of 1-million US dollars (756,000 euros). Last year, Iranian-American Amir Hekmati was sentenced to death for spying for the CIA, but judges overturned the decision and ordered a retrial. lw/ipj (Reuters, dpa)",
        "generated_story": "Six Slovak paragliders released on suspicion of spying in Iran Six Slovaks were released by Iranian authorities on Sunday after eight years in custody. The arrests were the latest in a string of arrests in the Middle East over alleged spying by the Iranian government in 2011. Four of the men, aged between 30 and 60, were arrested in May in connection with an investigation into alleged Iranian-American links to the country. Two of them, identified as Amir Hekmati and Vladislav Frigo, are believed to have fled to Iran in 2009 in order to avoid arrest. Fico, who has been living in exile in New York since 2009, is one of a group of men who have been released from prison in recent months on charges of espionage and money laundering. They are thought to be linked to an Iranian intelligence agency, the CIA, and are suspected of having been involved in spying for the United States, according to a court document released Sunday. \"We have information that we are aware of, but we do not know for certain,\" said the document, which was obtained by Reuters news agency. It was not immediately clear how the documents were obtained, however, whether they had been handed over to authorities in Tehran or if they were merely part of an ongoing investigation. Slovakia, Iran and the US have long been at odds over Iran's alleged involvement in its nuclear program. In May, Slovakia and Iran signed a deal to freeze Iranian assets in exchange for $756,000 (1-million US dollars) in return for information on the Iranians' activities. Iran has denied the allegations, saying only that the sanctions were \"unacceptable\" and that it was \"inappropriate\" to discuss the matter. Iranian officials have also accused Slovakia of being a \"hostile state\" for Iran, a charge Tehran has vehemently denied. On Sunday, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani announced that Tehran had agreed to extradite the six men to face charges related to their activities in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Libya and Syria. Tehran, meanwhile, has said it will continue to cooperate with the investigation, although it is not clear whether the charges will be brought against the two men. Last year, Tehran accused the Czechoslovak government of interfering with its internal affairs, accusing it of \"interfering with national security.\" The Czech Republic and Slovakia are the only two countries that have cooperated fully with Iran on espionage charges. Both countries have accused each other of providing material support to terrorist groups in Syria and Iraq."

        "target": "French presidential debate does little to woo undecided voters This year's French presidential race is perhaps the most closely watched election in recent history. Many voters are still undecided, including those in the Paris caf\u00e9 where DW's Jake Cigainero saw the latest TV debate. Just over two weeks ahead of the first round of voting in France's presidential election, all 11 candidates met for the second televised debate of the campaign. It was the first time in the history of French elections that the entire official ballot shared a television stage. This race for the Elysee is perhaps the most closely watched election in the history of the Fifth Republic in view of conservative candidate Francois Fillon's embezzlement charges, the deterioration of the left, political amateur Emmanuel Macron's surprise surge to the top, and the rise of Marine Le Pen's National Front. With so much media attention on the five main candidates, Tuesday's debate felt almost like a consolation for the six other candidates rarely in the spotlight. For French voters watching the televised debate at Cafe des Phares on Place de la Bastille, the saturated stage kept the candidates from detailed discussion of pressing issues. For those who are still undecided, the debate did little to bring them closer to choosing their pick for president. Vincent Couronne, a researcher, said it was good to see candidates who don't get as much media attention. However, 11 candidates at once for the political spectator was overkill. \"It wasn't very interesting. It's just one position after another. There's no real debate. It's not like when it was just five candidates.\" Boredom all round Charlotte Theuvenin and her friends, all students in their early 20s, tuned out early on from boredom and exasperation. \"It was too flat and too hypocritical. Fillon and Le Pen play with our money, then say they did nothing and that they are good for our country,\" she said. As though addressing the candidates in front of her on the TV screen, she added, \"How dare you talk about being president when you use our money for your own interests.\" Le Pen had come under fire over accusations that she misused public funds to pay bodyguards as parliamentary assistants. Francois Fillon of Les Republicains, meanwhile, is under investigation for allegedly paying family members more than 1 million euros ($1.1 million) for government work they never carried out. Frequently casting a blank stare at his opponents, Fillon also seemed bored, or at least more subdued compared to the first debate. Couronne said, \"Fillon seems to be not there. Probably because he knows all the small candidates can attack him on the criminal offenses he's accused of.\" Debate watchers cited Europe as the most important issue of this election, with many fearing Le Pen's promise to tear France out of the European Union in a so-called Frexit. Though no one at the cafe vocally supported Le Pen's plan, several acknowledged the EU is a pressure point for France. \"France's place in Europe in relation to Germany is a very important issue,\" said student Thibault Cirier. \"The general problem is France has lost its influence at the European level over the years, and that needs to be remedied, because France is one of the founders of Europe and should have a strong place in the union. The EU is also important for cohesion and to have a strong position internationally.\" Caf\u00e9 viewers say no to Le Pen Cirier was initially excited by Macron when he launched his campaign, but ultimately decided there was no substance. Now he says he will probably vote for far-left candidate Jean-Luc Melenchon. Kevser Taspinar also said she liked Melenchon for his fighting spirit and that \"he throws barbs.\" As a practicing Muslim who wears a headscarf, she said the most important issue for her is laicite, France's state institution of secularism. \"For me Hamon has the best interpretation of this. Maybe Hamon,\" Taspinar said hesitating. \"I'm still undecided, because there's Melenchon.\" Another viewer, Marie Dubois, said that although she really liked Melenchon, she had definitively decided on Macron. \"Melenchon has a way of putting humanity in politics and giving hope,\" she said. \"But Macron is the only possible candidate.\" With polls putting Le Pen and Macron in the second round on May 7, the undecided voters at this Paris cafe said they were certain which candidate they would not for vote for in that scenario. \"Definitely Macron. There is no way I am going to vote for Le Pen,\" Theuvenin said. \"I will never vote for that woman or Front National, no matter who is running against them in the second round.\" Tuesday was the final debate for Macron and Melenchon, two of the crowd-pleasers among the candidates. Both have pulled out of the third debate on grounds that it cuts too close to the first vote just two days later on April 23.",
        "generated_story": "Le Pen, Macron, Le Pen: 'No, No' DW's Jake Cigainero takes a look at the candidates for the French presidential election. The candidates are all in their early 20s, but they all seem to be in the early 30s or early 40s. Some of them have been living in Paris for a long time, while others have moved to other cities and towns in France and Germany. They all have their own homes and businesses, and they don't have to worry about what their neighbors think about them. \"I'm not a big fan of politics, I'm a pro-European,\" says Thibault Cirier, a professor of political science at Paris' Ecole Polytechnique. He's also a member of the conservative Les Republicains party, which was founded by former French Prime Minister Jean-Luc Melenchon and his wife, Charlotte Theuvenin. Many of these young people, who are not politically active, have left the country in droves. In fact, they've left their jobs and their families behind. Just over two weeks after leaving the Fifth Republic, French President Emmanuel Macron has been campaigning for his own presidential run. His campaign team, the National Front, is running for re-election in May 7. It's the first time that a candidate from the Front National party has run for president since Francois Fillon's election in 2015. And it's not just his supporters who have turned out to vote for him. On April 23, he announced that he would not stand for another term as president of France's parliamentary elections in June. But he also said he was not going to back down from his campaign promise to leave the European Union if he wins the presidency. That's why he's running against his former rival, former Socialist presidential candidate, Marine LePen, in a runoff election for French president in April. A lot has changed since then, including the election of Macron's conservative challenger, Francois Pena, as the candidate for prime minister. So far, however, it seems that Macron is the only candidate who is willing to stand up to the far-right and the anti-EU forces in his party. At the same time he has also been pushing for closer ties with the United States and Europe. After all, France has a lot to learn from Macron. What do you think? Do you agree with him on this point? Does he have the right to say \"yes\" or \"no\" to what he wants? He doesn't think so. If he does, then he'll be able to tell the difference between the two candidates. How long will it take for Macron to get the job done? In the end, that will depend on how long he can stay in office and how much money he will have on his side. There's a good chance he won't get a second term next year, even if it means losing his parliamentary majority."

And the news was good -- most of the numbers were down compared to the preceding year. Germany's streets were never particularly dangerous, but according to the Interior Ministry, they are now safer than at any time since statistics have been collected. Reported criminal offenses on the whole dropped by 1.4 percent over 2005 -- to a total of just over 6.3 million. \"The statistics show reductions in crime among children, adolescents and teenagers, as well as adults,\" said Sch\u00e4uble. He added that criminality among foreigners living in Germany also fell, saying that this development reflected Germany's efforts to integrate non-Germans. Drugs offenses were down 7.8 percent, followed by theft and street crime, which both declined by four percent or more. Youth violence Vandalism, on the other hand, was up 5.9 percent. Fraud rose slightly, as did violent crime -- among young people by an alarming 4.5 percent. Berlin Interior Minister Erhart K\u00f6rting said that was part of a decade-long trend in Germany. \"As many experts have pointed out,\" K\u00f6rting said, \"the potential for violence in society is increasing.\" The head of the German Police Officers' Union Konrad Freiberg also said those figures showed that German society was not truly getting safer. Frankfurt tops most-dangerous list Crime was down in Frankfurt am Main, but it's still the German city with the greatest number of criminal offenses person 100,000 people. Hanover was a close second, followed by D\u00fcsseldorf, Bremen and Berlin. The total percentage of criminal cases solved by German police also improved slightly from 55 to 55.4 percent.

        "generated_story": "German Police Officers' Union: State of Crime in Germany The German police officers' union has released its annual report on the state of crime in the country. The report, released on Tuesday, is the latest in a series of statements from the German interior minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, who has been in charge of the police union since 2005. In the previous year, there were more than 1.5 million murders and 2.6 million rapes. Last year alone, the number of murders rose by almost 10 percent, according to the Bundeswehr statistics office. That's a record for Germany, which has a population of just over 1 million. But the figures for the preceding year are much lower, with a figure of around 1,000 murders. \"In 2005, we had a total of 2,500 murders,\" said K\u00f6rting, a police officer in Berlin. He added that there had been a \"significant increase\" in murders in 2006, but that it was not due to a rise in crime rates. It was also the first time that Germany had seen an increase in violent crime since the end of World War II. Police officers, however, said that the increase was due in large part to \"the rise of organized crime,\" which is a term used by politicians to refer to crimes committed by law enforcement officers in other countries, including the United States, Britain, France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece and the Netherlands. They called for an end to violence against law-abiding citizens, particularly those living in low-income areas, such as those in high-tax areas and those with low incomes and low social security benefits. A new police commissioner, Konrad Freiberg, has also been appointed to take over the role of chief of police, and he is expected to continue to do so until the new commissioner's office is established."

        "target": "All or nothing for Bayern in Champions final Bayern Munich have one last chance to salvage a season that has otherwise been marked by their inability to beat Borussia Dortmund: a win against Chelsea in the Champions League final at their home stadium. All season long, Bayern Munich have been consumed with achieving one goal: reaching the final of the Champions League, held at their own Allianz Arena in Munich, and raising the trophy in front of their home fans. After finishing a distant second place to Dortmund in the Bundesliga and dismally losing to them 5-2 in the German Cup final, Bayern Munich are in a must-win situation Saturday against Chelsea. A loss would be the final straw in a disappointing season for a team that can't stand second place. A win for Bayern would mean redemption, to some extent, for their shortcomings in the league. Key players were rested down the stretch in the Bundesliga, especially before the two legs of Bayern's European semifinal against Real Madrid. That was an indication that Bayern had given up on the league and put all their eggs in one basket, hoping for a big payoff with the Champions League title. The same can be said for the German Cup final against Dortmund: true, Bayern essentially beat themselves by making mistake after mistake, but Bayern could, if they win Saturday, wipe the slate clean. Saving the season Win this match, and all will be forgiven in Munich. Lose, and it will be Bayern's second straight season without a piece of hardware, not to mention the heartbreak of losing the biggest match at Allianz Arena since it opened in 2005. \"We must not even think about [losing],\" said Bayern's Franck Ribery on Thursday. \"If we win the Champions League, then we can forget about not winning the league or the cup, nobody will care about that.\" Bayern are a team that thrives under pressure, and the high stakes of this match will be good for them. Chelsea are a team that showed in their semifinal upset of Barcelona that they can rise to a challenge, even if that challenge is simply holding on against a superior opponent. \"We are not the favorites of the game, we are playing away,\" Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech said on Thursday. \"It is very rare when you have the home team playing in the home stadium, using the home dressing room, so I think the advantage goes to Bayern Munich because of that. But we know we have a chance and we will fight for it.\" But this match will come down to the team that can better take advantage of holes that have been blown in each team's defense due to injuries and suspensions. Filling the gaps Between the two sides, seven starting players will miss out on the final. Chelsea saw Raul Meireles, Ramires, and Branislav Ivanovic each get their third yellow card in the second leg against Barcelona, and captain John Terry was given a straight red. Terry and Ivanovic are fixtures on Chelsea's backline, which was already at half-strength due to hamstring injuries suffered by Gary Cahill and David Luiz. Chelsea coach Roberto di Matteo hopes those two are fit enough for the final, since Chelsea will need all the help they can get in the back. For Bayern, David Alaba and Holger Badstuber - both defenders - and Luiz Gustavo, a defensive midfielder, are also suspended for picking up three yellow cards. The impact of the suspensions will hit Chelsea the most. In addition to a weakened back line, Meireles and Ramires are mainstays on offense, supporting strikers Didier Drogba or Fernando Torres. With Ramires out, Drogba could start as striker, with Torres moving to the wing. At any rate, there is more uncertainty in The Blues' lineup than there is in Bayern's, who will be able to rely on striker Mario Gomez and the dynamic-duo of Arjen Robben and Ribery on the wings as they have all season. Most of the question marks will still be defensive for both teams, but to think that this is an indication of a high-scoring affair on Saturday would be a discredit to both team's last lines of defense. Between the posts Neither side would be competing in the final if it wasn't for the heroics of the teams' keepers. Cech defended against wave after wave of attacks from Barcelona in the semifinal for Chelsea, and Manuel Neuer showed nerves of steel in Bayern's penalty shootout in the final leg against Real Madrid, blocking penalties from Madrid stars Cristiano Ronaldo and Kaka. Chelsea's best shot will be to come out of the gate at a sprint and gain an early advantage against Bayern, who will be doing everything they can to keep their long-cultivated dream-final in their control. Otherwise, Bayern's determination to salvage their season may be enough to carry them through to the trophy ceremony - at home, just like they planned it.

The Bundesliga champions will be hoping for a repeat of last season's group stage success, when they beat Manchester United 3-2 in extra time to advance to the semifinals. They'll be looking to get back into the top four in Germany, where they will face the likes of Barcelona, Manchester City, Real and Barcelona. In the end, Bayern will go on to win the German Cup, which they hope to clinch with a win on Saturday. \"We're going to be very happy with the way we've been playing this season,\" said Franck Ribery, who has been on the bench for the past three games. He's been in great form in his first season in charge of Bayern, but he's had to adapt to a new system and new coaching style. Rina Goldenberg, a former Bayern player, is the only player to have played in all of Borussia's matches in 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2005. She's also the first woman to score a goal in a Bundesliga match in which she's not a regular starter. Her goal came on a free kick, and she was able to put the ball away. It was her first goal since returning from injury and her second in as many games as she can remember. Terry's goal was the difference between the two teams, with Terry scoring the winning goal and Ramires the other. Both players have been impressive all season, scoring seven goals and setting up a number of others. However, Terry is not the type of player who can make the most of his time at the Allianz Arena. His goal-line partner, David Luiz, scored the winner against Barcelona on Thursday, giving Bayern a 2-1 win over Barcelona and a 1-0 victory over Real on aggregate. Chelsea's David Alaba scored a late winner to give the Blues a 4-3 lead over Bayern in Sunday's quarter-final tie at home to Real Betis. After the match, Chelsea will travel to Barcelona to take on Barcelona in Group D. For the Germans, it's all about revenge and revenge for last year's title-winning team. And that's exactly what they're hoping to do in this final: win their first European title since 2005 and move on from the Bundesliga to play in Europe's top division next season."

Catholic priest Carlo Alberto Capella was indicted on Saturday after a Vatican investigation found he had allegedly possessed and exchanged \"a large quantity\" of child pornography during his diplomatic posting. His trial will start on June 22 in front of a Vatican magistrate. If convicted, he could be sentenced to between one and five years in prison and fined between \u20ac2,500 and \u20ac50,000 ($2,100 to $42,000). He is being held in the city's police barracks.

The church rejected the request and withdrew him in September to face investigation at home. Shortly afterwards, Canadian authorities issued an arrest warrant for allegedly possessing and distributing child pornography while visiting a church in Canada. The Capella case has hampered the Catholic Church's attempts to move on from its myriad of pedophile priest scandals. There has been particular focus in recent months on the Chilean branch of the Catholic Church ignoring and covering up of child abuse by pedophile priest Fernando Karadima during the 1980s and 1990s. Pope Francis wrote a letter to Chileans last week expressing \"shame\" for the affair despite previously defending one of the main alleged offenders behind the cover-up. The Vatican's third-highest ranking official, Cardinal George Pell, is facing trial in Australia on abuse-related charges. aw/kms (AFP, Reuters, dpa)",
        "generated_story": "Capella to face Vatican probe for distributing child pornography A Chilean Catholic priest has been arrested in connection with a Vatican investigation into allegations that he sexually abused children. Carlo Alberto Capella was arrested on June 22 in the southern Chilean city of Santiago. The charges stem from a complaint made to the Holy See in September by the Vatican's top prosecutor, George Pell, that the priest, who is accused of sexually abusing children, had sex with them between 1980s and 1990s. He was charged with sexual abuse of a minor, and was ordered to pay a fine of between \u20ac2,500 and \u20ac50,000 (\u20ac2.5 to $42,600). The Vatican said in a statement on Saturday that it had found no evidence to support the allegations. \"The Vatican is aware of the accusations made against the accused priest,\" the statement said. It did not elaborate on the charges, however, saying that they were not related to a crime committed against children under the Catholic Church's jurisdiction. In September, Pope Francis said the church was \"deeply troubled\" by allegations of child abuse and sexual exploitation of minors in Chile and in other Latin American countries, including Brazil, Peru, Argentina, Chile, Uruguay and Peru. Vatican investigators are also looking into the case of an Italian priest who allegedly distributed pornography to children in his home country of Chile. According to Vatican officials, the investigation was launched in response to complaints from Chileans who said they had been abused by a priest in their own home province of Punta del Este, near the border with Argentina. A Vatican spokesman told Reuters the probe was aimed at finding out whether the alleged abuse was committed by an \"unlawful priest.\" \"This is a very serious allegation,\" he said, adding that \"it is not a question of whether or not this priest is guilty of any crime.\" The accusations come as Francis has called on Chile's Catholic bishops to step down from the post of archbishop of Buenos Aires, Cardinal Fernando Karadima, to take a leave of absence from his duties as archdiocesan spokesman. Francis is also expected to make a decision on whether to renew the cardinal's post, which expires at the end of this year. Last year, Francis called for the resignation of Cardinal Capell, a former Vatican official who had served as the archpriest for more than 30 years."

Moscow-based news agency RIA quoted Siluanov as saying that the emergency fund would be set up next year with money originally earmarked for the State Pension Fund and leftover funds from this year's budget. According to RIA, Moscow was planning to devote \"at least 100 billion roubles\" (2 billion euros) to the fund, which will mainly be aimed at helping cash-starved Russian banks and key oil companies. \"These 100 billion roubles will be added to the reserve next year, which will allow us to help companies,\" RIA quoted Siluanov as saying. \"We are planning to create a reserve of significant size.\" Just last week, the European Union and the United States imposed a third round of sanctions on Moscow for Russia's involvement in the Ukraine conflict. The latest sanctions target the Russian banking sector as well as key energy firms and arms manufacturers. As one of several companies that have asked for government help, Russia's oil giant Rosneft said it would need 1.5 trillion roubles ($39.70 billion) in aid to keep exploring for oil. Siluanov also told RIA news agency that the decision to stop transferring money to the Pension Fund would hand the budget an extra 309 billion roubles.

He added that the fund would be funded by a 2 billion euro ($2.2 billion) loan from the European Union. A spokesman for Russia's Finance Ministry told RIA news agency the plan was in line with the Kremlin's policy of \"zero-tolerance\" toward Russia, which imposed sanctions on Moscow in response to Moscow's annexation of Crimea in 2014. It was not immediately clear how much the move would amount to, however, as it was unclear how long it would take for the pension funds to be able to repay the loans. In the second year of its existence, the state fund is expected to invest at a total of 309 billion rupees ($39.70 billion). The fund will be split into two parts: one for private companies and the other for public companies. These companies will receive a fixed amount of money, while the rest will have to make up the difference between the private and public funds. This is the first time that Russia has set aside money for its public pensions, according to the Ministry of Finance's website. Rosneft, a state oil company, has said it will use the money to pay off debts incurred by its employees in Ukraine.

        "target": "Heidi hits the Big Screen Heidi, the world famous girl from the Swiss Alps who first appeared in a novel 121 years ago, has hit the big screen in a fresh look. A century after the death of Heidi inventor Johanna Spyri, the lovable Alpine heroine is being portrayed in a new film which replaces grassy slopes and mountainous range with city skyscrapers and city streets. The $ 3.5 million \"Heidi\", funded by the Z\u00fcrich-based film company Vega and directed by German film maker Markus Imboden, is to be launched in Germany on Thursday. The making of the film was one of the highlights of a past year of events including exhibitions, lectures and fireworks celebrating the July 7 2001 centenary of the death of Spyri, whose novel \"Heidi\" sold 20 million copies and has been translated in 50 languages worldwide. It is thought to be one of the most successful books of all times. The book has inspired 17 films, including Shirley Temple\u2019s Oscar winning portrayal of Heidi in 1937 and a Japanese cartoon series. Imboden\u2019s remake is the 18th \"Heidi\" film. Blue hair in Berlin According to Vega, \"the film was transmitted to today\u2019s world without losing sight of the original novel\". But Imboden\u2019s new movie is far from the charming original, with its rosy-cheeked, curly-headed Heidi, delicate Clara and goat-tending shepherd Peter\u2019s frail old grandmother. In the first film, Heidi, who lives happily with her grandfather in a tiny hut in the Swiss Alps is plucked from her contented life by her Aunt Dete to live in a stiff, rich family in the bustling metropolis, Frankfurt. Heidi becomes so home-sick, she starts to sleepwalk and is eventually sent home. But not before she causes confusion in the otherwise prim household and brings laughter in the life of the disabled and homely, Clara. The Heidi in the latest film has blue hair, surfs the net and roams the streets of Berlin. Friend and shepherd Peter sheds his rustic pastimes and whizzes down streets on his mountainbike. Clara is not the weak, lame young girl of the Spyri novel, but a moody Britney Spears wannabe. Aunt Dete is a modern-day stylist living fashionably in the German capital. The new surroundings are a far cry from the tranquil days of cow milking, goat- tending and flower-plucking in the verdant meadows of the Swiss Alps. Transforming the Heidi myth According to a Berlin daily, the remake is a \"refreshing Heidi\", adding that the script writers had managed to transform the Heidi \"myth\" into an independent, self-assured girl and not into a \"transfigured mountain heroine\". However, it is just this portrait of a naive and charming alpine heroine that has made Heidi so popular all over the world. Heidi has become a well-known Swiss brand worldwide. Some 60,000 tourists \u2013 half from Japan \u2013 are said to visit the picturesque wine-growing village in Graubuenden, which boasts the original Heidi House and other Heidi related attractions such as winding mountain trails and pastures. Imboden\u2019s film, which is to be launched in Germany on Thursday, will also open elsewhere in Europe, and may reach fans in Japan and South Korea too. Whether Imboden\u2019s blue-haired, computer savvy Heidi will charm her Asian viewers, however, remains to be seen.",
        "generated_story": "The Remake of Heidi in the Swiss Alps A century after the death of her husband Peter, a Swiss artist has found a new home for his wife and daughter. It\u2019s called Heidi House. The house is located on the edge of the Bernese Alps, about 120 kilometers (75 miles) north of Zurich. Heidi was born on July 7, 1937, in Switzerland. She died in 1937 at the age of 11. Her remains were discovered on Thursday by her daughter, Johanna Spyri, and her son, Peter. They had been living in a small house on a hillside just outside the city limits of Bern, where she and Peter have lived for the past century. Their home is now a museum dedicated to the work of a century-old artist, whose work has become a symbol of Swiss culture and tradition. \"A century ago, there was a man named Peter and a woman named Clara who lived in this house,\" said Markus Imboden, the museum's director and artistic director. He added that the house was the first to be excavated and that it would be used as an art museum. A past year, however, has seen a resurgence in interest in Heidi's work. In a recent interview with The New York Times, Vega said that Heidi had become the focus of attention in recent years. Vega, who has been working on Heidi for more than a half-century, said: \u201cI think Heidi is the most beautiful thing that has ever happened to me.\u201d He also pointed out that there are many other works of art that have been discovered, such as Shirley Temple's \"Beauty and the Beast\" (1939), which he said was inspired by the idea of having Heidi as a muse for him and his family. But he also noted that he was not the only one who was fascinated by Heidi. His wife, Clara, was also fascinated with the woman and said she wanted to find out what she could do about it. So she decided to take a look at Heidi and found out, she said, that she would like to do something with her own money. And she did. After all, it was only a matter of time before she was able to sell Heidi to a German company. Now she has a home in Zurich, which she owns and works in. According to her website, Heidi has lived there for 121 years and is married to Peter since 1937. Since then, her children have moved to Switzerland and are living there with their mother and stepfather. There, they have a daughter and two sons. On Thursday, one of them will be born in Bern. While the other one will have to wait until the end of his life to see if he will return to his old life."

        "target": "Rethinking the term 'honor killing' The murder of 28-year-old Samia Shahid comes less than two weeks after Qandeel Baloch was killed by her brother. The media was quick to report them as \"honor killings.\" We have to rethink that term, writes Gouri Sharma. When news broke that Samia Shahid, a British-Pakistani woman, had been found dead while visiting relatives in Pakistan at the end of July, mainstream media outlets were quick to report it as an honor killing. It was the second time in two weeks that the media had reported a killing of a woman this way - the first being the murder of Pakistani social media star Qandeel Baloch. There are strong similarities between the cases. Both were murdered in places where they would have felt they were at their safest - in their family homes. It's likely they knew their killers - in Baloch's case, her brother has admitted to strangling her, and Shahid's father and cousin have already been questioned. And as more reports emerge about Shahid's death, it's clear that both were killed because they didn't behave in a way deemed acceptable in a conservative, patriarchal society. 'Deeply offensive' term The debate around terminology in \"honor killings\" isn't new, and after Baloch's murder there were members of the media - such as ABC Australia journalist Juanita Phillips - who decided against using the term, calling it \"deeply offensive\" and referring to it as a \"family killing\" instead. And there are outlets, like the Guardian, that already use inverted commas with the word honor. But some commentators argue that more needs to happen if media consumers are to gain a better understanding of the problem. \"I think an important step for the media would be to refuse to give weight to the term 'honor crimes,'\" said UK-based freelance journalist Shehnaz Khan. \"While it is imperative to highlight that these crimes and murders stem from the roots of misogyny and therefore a false sense of 'honor,' there is absolutely nothing but'shame' within them, as murder is nothing but dishonorable.\" \"The word 'honor' can sometimes carry an almost positive connotation that we are inclined to automatically accept just because it's not happening to us, when the reality is, this a huge problem affecting thousands of girls and women across the world,\" she added. Naming the issue But this isn't a view shared by all journalists. Ruby Hamad, a writer at Australia's Daily Life newspaper, said that the first step in dealing with the issue is naming it. \"There are some deeply patriarchal societies that still limit women's freedom according to old tribal concepts of honor, where, unfairly, the behavior of women reflect on their entire family,\" Hamad said. \"By naming these 'honor killings,' we are acknowledging the role that this misogynistic concept of honor plays, not only in the murders themselves but in these entire societies, and how it entraps both men and women.\" Through the eyes of the perpetrator? There are other issues with the term though. Some have argued that by framing it as such, media outlets are showing the crime through the eyes of the perpetrator - and not through the victim - as they should. And with such cases regularly hitting the headlines, framing is important. The United Nations estimates that around 5,000 women - predominantly from Asia and the Middle East - are killed annually in honor-related crimes, a figure that women's advocacy groups say is closer to 20,000 worldwide. This raises an important cultural element for the media to consider - how far does the term play into cultural stereotypes? \"When honor is considered the most important thing in life, then all family members become expendable,\" Hamad said. \"The collective outweighs the rights of the individual. Does this feed into cultural stereotypes? Perhaps. But that doesn't mean we should pretend that this cultural context isn't there.\" Looking for answers - and alternatives There have been many alternatives put forward by women's advocacy groups, including hate crime, misogynistic murder, femicide and shame killings. But which one should we pick? Al Jazeera for one has decided which one they won't use. \"We are always updating our style guidelines to convey a deeper and more authentic understanding of world affairs. Recent events in Pakistan ignited a healthy debate in Al Jazeera on the term 'honor killings' in particular. Our editors are currently studying alternatives to the term, but'misogynistic murder' is not one of them,\" said an Al Jazeera spokesperson. Terminology in the media matters, and for murders as complex as these, it's the media's responsibility to find a name that better fits the crime. Only then will it become easier to work towards a solution.",

The amnesty came on the 21st anniversary of the brutal crackdown of a student-led pro-democracy movement in 1988 and the subsequent seizure of power by the current junta. Journalists were invited to Yangon\u2019s notorious Insein prison on Friday as the authorities released the first batch of prisoners. At least 600 inmates were freed as part of an amnesty for over 7,000 inmates nationwide. Among those released in Yangon were two journalists and 25 political prisoners -- rights groups say this is only 1 percent of the total number of political prisoners held by the military regime. Maung Zarni, a research fellow at the London School of Economics, was \u201chappy for the prisoners who were part of the release\u201d. \u201cThis is a very positive personal development and I am happy they have been released but we need to understand that the junta is using the prisoners\u2019 release as a public relations exercise. It is the 21st anniversary of the military coup so they are using this as a way to pacify political discontent in the country.\u201d Amnesty comes ahead of next year\u2019s polls Myanmar's director general of prisons, Zaw Win, said that the prisoners had been freed so they could take part in next year's polls. In recent months, rights activists, pro-democracy activists and Western countries have cast doubt on the credibility of the planned elections as many key political activists are still in detention. This includes pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who recently began a new 18-month period of house arrest after being found guilty of violating her house arrest order in a widely condemned trial. \u201cThe whole Suu kyi trial is rather unlawful,\u201d said Zarni. \u201cBecause the country does not have an independent judiciary, the judges are just puppets who dance to the tune of the top leadership.\u201d Junta is holding on tightly In 1990, Suu Kyi\u2019s National League for Democracy won Myanmar\u2019s last general election by a landslide. But the junta never recognised the results and has since tightened its control over the country. The 2008 constitution, which was drafted and approved by the military generals, which guarantees the army 25 percent of parliamentary seats, is yet another sign of its desire to consolidate power. \u201cThe military is going to be in power for a long time,\u201d warns Zarni, \u201cbecause they have got control of all the political and economic institutions in the country as well as the entire state of Burma. So with or without elections, this is likely to remain the same.\u201d New Democratic Party formed Meanwhile, a new political party has been formed in Myanmar. The Democratic Party is headed by Mya Than Than Nu, who is the daughter of the country\u2019s first democratically-elected prime minister, U Nu. The party has proposed a power-sharing deal with the military, which would give 40 percent of power to politicians and 60 percent to the military rulers. Harn Yawnghwe, the director of the Brussels-based Euro-Burma Office, doubts the new party stands a chance: \u201cIt is possible that they they would be able to get some votes. But it is not likely, even if they were able to contest the elections freely, that they will be able to form a new government because the military is not prepared to let any party rule.\u201d Democrats should exploit elections He thinks the only way out for the democratic forces in Myanmar is to use the upcoming elections wisely and \u201cto take part in them even if they are against them. I think we have to look at the elections as a process which will lead to democracy -- maybe in few more years.\u201d The National League for Democracy has indicated that it will not take part in the polls unless all Myanmar\u2019s political prisoners, including Suu Kyi, are released. Suu Kyi\u2019s lawyers have filed an appeal against the extension of her house arrest and the court is expected to give a ruling on October 2. But few are hopeful that the junta will amnesty her anytime soon. Author: Disha Uppal Editor: Anne Thomas",

        "target": "A quarter of deaths caused by environmental degradation, says UN A new United Nations report warns that pollution and global warming are causing millions more deaths than conflicts. The UN's environment agency has called for an urgent roll-back on harmful substances and fossil fuels. In its report \"Healthy Environment, Health People,\" the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), the World Health Organization and several other environment organizations said that, in 2012, an estimated 12.6 million deaths were attributable to deteriorating environment conditions. The largest numbers of deaths took place in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific regions, followed by sub-Saharan Africa, where around a quarter of deaths were likely caused byair pollution, chemicals, climate change and a lack of access to sanitation. \"By depleting the ecological infrastructure of our planet and increasing our pollution footprint, we incur an ever-growing cost in terms of human health and well-being,\" said UNEP Executive Director Achim Steiner. He added that humanity's life support systems had been compromised by globalization and powerful economic interests. The report was released during UN climate talks in the German city of Bonn which are drawing up rules pertaining to the Paris agreement, which seeks to lower carbon emissions. The document suggested that several drivers were responsible for the threat to human health, including ecosystem disruption, climate change, inequality, unhealthy and wasteful lifestyles, along with unsustainable consumption and production. Worsening effects UNEP estimated that an extra 250,000 deaths could occur each year between 2030 and 2050 as a result of climate change, leading to malnutrition, malaria, diarrhea and heat stress. Between them air pollution and a lack of access to clean water and sanitation cause almost 8 million premature deaths each year. Environmental impacts are responsible for the deaths of more than one quarter of all children under the age of five, the report states. UNEP called for governments to act to remove harmful substances from working environments, reduce the use of carbon fuels and rely instead on renewable energy, and change lifestyles to allow a more sustainable use of the world's resources. The report also called for a bigger investment to protect the planet's natural ecosystem. UNEP predicted a further increase in emerging zoonotic diseases (spread between animals and humans), and called on developing countries, in particular, to prioritize prevention methods. \"Never before have so many animals been kept by so many people - and never before have so many opportunities existed for pathogens to pass through the biophysical environment and wild animals to livestock and people,\" the report warned.",
        "generated_story": "A quarter of deaths due to environmental degradation, says UNEP The World Health Organization (UNEP) has released a report showing that more than half of the world's children die from environmental pollution. The report, published in the journal Environment, Health People, predicts that between 2030 and 2050, the number of children dying from climate change will rise by a quarter. According to the United Nations Environment Program, a third of all children born between the age of five and 15 are affected by the effects of pollution on their health and well-being. This figure is up from 1.6 percent in 2012. In 2012, it rose to 2.4 percent. But the UN said that the increase in deaths would be driven by people living in low-income countries, such as the Western Pacific, Southeast Asia and the Central Asian countries. \"This is a very worrying trend,\" said Achim Steiner, head of UN's Sustainable Development Program (SDP), in a statement released on Thursday. He added that it was \"unacceptable\" for children to die of exposure to toxic chemicals in their environment, which can lead to serious health problems. Environmental degradation is also a major cause of death for people who live in extreme poverty, he said, adding that \"it is not just the environment that is responsible for these deaths, but also the way in which people live their lives.\" \"We have to make sure that we protect our children and our planet,\" he added, pointing out that many of these children are born in poor countries and have no access to clean drinking water or clean air. These are the main reasons why so many children in developing countries are suffering from high levels of chronic diseases, including cancer, heart disease, cancer and cardiovascular disease. It's also important to ensure that children who are exposed to harmful chemicals are protected from harm and that they have the opportunity to live a healthy, healthy and healthy life."

He wants new names for plant-based dishes. Germans shouldn't be biting into a \"vegan sausage\" or cutting a slice of \"vegetarian schnitzel,\" German Minister for Food and Agriculture Christian Schmidt told the daily \"Bild\" newspaper on Wednesday, adding that names traditionally used for meat-based dishes should not be applied to plant-based foods. \"I don't want anyone to pretend that these pseudo-meat dishes are actual meat dishes,\" Schmidt said. The minister said manufacturers should come up with distinct names for plant-based meat-substitutes. Schmidt also said meat was part of a healthy and balanced diet and belonged on the menu in schools and kindergartens. Soy? Steak? Soy-steak? Schmidt's statements echo demands from the German Farmers Association and German Butchers Association. Both lobbying groups have asked for a ban on terms such as \"vegetarian ham\" or \"soy steak.\" Schmidt's call for plant-based foods to have their own name was also made in October in the state of Lower Saxony, a state with many large livestock farms. The German Vegetarian Association, however, argued against the proposal. A spokesperson for the organization said that \"names that are used for animal-based products should without a doubt also be legal to use for vegetarian substitute products.\" More meatless 'whatever-you-want-to-call-thems' The market for vegetarian and vegan dishes has grown steadily in the past few years in Germany, partly at the expense of the meat industry. According to a research paper by the Institute for the Study of Trade (IfH), revenue for vegetarian and vegan products in Germany was 454 million euros ($474 million) in 2015 and grew by more than 100 percent between 2010 and 2015.

The move is part of an effort by the German government to reduce the country's reliance on meat imports. According to the association, the move marks the end of a decades-long dispute between farmers and the government over the sale of meat. \"The German market for meat and vegetables is in decline,\" said Christian Schmidt, vice president of the IfH, in a statement released on Wednesday. He added that the decision was made \"in response to a growing number of farmers' complaints that their meat was being used as a weapon in the war against terrorism.\" \"We have a problem with the way meat is being sold,\" Schmidt said, adding that \"we have to find a solution to this problem.\" The association said it would continue to sell meat to farmers, even if it was only for a small price. It also said that if the meat were to be sold at a discount, then farmers would be forced to pay a higher price for it. In the past few years, German farmers have been able to buy meat from abroad for around 454 million euros ($474 million) a year. However, it is not clear how much of that money has been spent on the purchase of beef and pork products. Schmidt's comments came after a report from the Institute for the Study of Trade (IFH), a German think-tank, suggested that Germany's meat industry was suffering from a lack of demand for its products due to low prices and a shortage of skilled workers. But the institute said the problem was not just with meat, but also with dairy products as well. Farmers' groups have long been calling for an end to meat exports to Germany, which has seen a rise in meat prices in recent years. dpa/jm (dpa, AFP)"

Trudeau calls for hopeful, diverse future In electing Trudeau, the charismatic son of a former popular prime minister, Canadian voters illustrated the growing discontent with nine years of Conservative rule that saw lowering of corporate taxes, avoidance of climate change legislation and disagreement with the Obama administration over the controversial Keystone XL pipeline. \"Canadians have spoken,\" Trudeau said, adding that he would be the man to lead the \"hopeful, positive\" country \"with a vision\" that they had asked for. In his victory speech, Trudeau said his government \"believed deeply in the diversity of our country,\" striking a contrast with the strain of nativism that had become apparent under Conservative rule. \"We beat fear with hope,\" said Trudeau, a 43-year-old former teacher.

The announcement came hours after Harper announced that he would step down from his position as the country's longest-serving leader. Harper, who was elected to a second term in 2011, will take over the reins of power from Justin Trudeau, the Liberal Party's leader in the House of Commons, in a move that was widely seen as a sign of a change in government. \"I am stepping down,\" Harper said at a news conference in Ottawa, adding that his successor would be chosen by the party's executive committee, which will be chaired by John Walsh, a former federal cabinet minister who served as Harper's chief of staff from 2011 to 2011. In a statement released on Tuesday, Harper also said he had no plans to seek re-election in 2014. He said the government would continue to work with the federal government on the controversial Keystone XL oil pipeline, but that it would not be able to do so without the support of his own party and the New Democratic Party (NDP). Harper had been in power since 2011 when he took over from then-Prime Minister Barack Obama, and he was still in charge when Obama took office four years ago. His successor, former New Democrat Party leader and current Conservative party leader, Paul Martin, announced on Monday that Harper would take the helm of government until the end of next year. Martin said Harper was \"deeply disappointed\" by Trudeau's decision to step aside, saying it was time for Canada to move forward with its plan to build a new energy pipeline through the Canadian province of British Columbia. Trudeau said his party would work closely with Harper to ensure that the pipeline was built in time to meet the energy needs of its Canadian citizens. But Harper did not immediately respond to questions about whether he planned to run for the leadership of Canada again, as he has done for many years. Canadian media reported Tuesday that Trudeau had called Harper a \"moron\" who \"wouldn't stand for anything less than perfect.\" The Canadian Broadcasting Corp. (CBC) reported that Canadian officials had received a letter of resignation from Harper saying that they would no longer be allowed to discuss the matter with him. A spokesman for Harper told the Associated Press: \"We have no further comment at this time.\" Harper and Trudeau have not yet announced a date for their planned meeting in Canada, where the two leaders are expected to hold a private meeting."

He is due to return to Ireland on 10 August for the Rio de Janeiro Olympics. The Olympic Council of Ireland said on Monday that he had been released from prison three months ago after being granted bail by the European Olympic Committee (EOC). The EOC said that the release was \"a positive step in the right direction\" for him and his family. \"We are very happy with his release and we are looking forward to his return,\" the IOC said in a statement, adding that it was a \"positive step\" in his recovery process. Ireland is one of the countries with the highest gross domestic product (GDP) of any European country. It is the first time Ireland has ever been awarded a medal for an athlete who has not competed in an international competition since the 2008 Olympics in Beijing. Dublin's mayor, Juliana Leal de Melo, told reporters that she had received a letter from Ireland's Olympic council saying that \"it is very important for Ireland to be able to contribute to the success of our country at the next Olympics.\" The IOC also said it would continue to work with Ireland in its efforts to improve the country's image in international sports. In addition, Ireland will continue its cooperation with Rio, which is hosting the 2020 Olympic Games in South Africa. A court in Dublin has ruled that Ireland should be allowed to host the 2024 Summer Games, but the court has yet to rule on whether Ireland can be invited to participate in that competition. Irish Olympic committee chief Patrick \"Patty\" Hickey, 71, was freed after a bail application was rejected by an appeals court. His bail was set at 1.5 million real ($1 million) and he will be eligible for re-election in 2020 if he wins the Olympic gold medal. 'I'm not going to give up' Following the ruling, the Dublin mayor said he would like to see Ireland take part in next year's Tokyo Games. However, he did not rule out the possibility of running for a second time in four years, as he has done in previous Olympics, and said Ireland was ready to take on the challenge of competing in Tokyo, Tokyo and Beijing, where he is expected to win the gold and silver medals in both the men's and women's sports categories. \u201cI want to get back to Dublin,\u201d he said."

        "target": "The Shift in Libya's Relations to the West The La Belle disco bombing in Berlin on April 5, 1986 was ruled to be Libya's doing. Twenty years later, relations between Libya and Europe have done an about-face. The Berlin disco \"La Belle\" was packed as usual on the night of April 5, 1986. Among its guests were many US soldiers, who were certainly not thinking of politics, the Middle East or strained relations between the United States and Libya. But reality caught up with them: a bomb detonated near the dance floor that night, killing two Americans and a Turkish woman. Over 200 people were injured. A Berlin court ruled that Libya and its intelligence services were responsible for the bombing. In 2001, following a nearly four-year long trial, the judges convicted a Libyan diplomat and three others to prison sentences between 12 and 14 years. The big oil-exporting country in the meantime was busy working on its reputation. Already in the 1990s, Tripoli began striving to improve its relations to the European Union. Financial reparation opened the door to Europe In 2004, the Gaddafi International Foundation for Charity Associations and the legal representatives of the German La Belle victims settled on $35 million in compensation. This opened the door to Europe. Just a few weeks later, Germany's chancellor at the time, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, visited Moammar Gadhafi in a traditional Bedouin tent outside of Tripoli. Britain's Prime Minister Tony Blair also paid Gadhafi a visit. A few months earlier, in April 2004, the European Union had welcomed the Libyan leader to Brussels. It was Gadhafi's first official visit to Europe in 15 years. Bernd Westphal, the German ambassador to Libya, said bilateral relations had been through difficult times. \"The German Embassy in Tripoli today is working for a quick return to the liveliness of close relations between Germany and Libya,\" Westphal said. \"We want to build on our traditional friendship with Libya and we want to strengthen the political, economic and cultural cooperation between our two countries and peoples.\" Business interests booming in Libya In the past few years, Libya has moved from being the supporter of international terrorism to an attractive economic partner for the West. European business representatives have been increasingly knocking on Libya's door. Even the United States is showing increased interest in the northern African nation. Washington is pleased that Libya announced at the end of 2003 that it would discontinue its efforts to develop and produce weapons of mass destruction. Libya's ambassador to Germany, Said Abdulaati, said political and economic relations between Libya and Germany were \"excellent.\" Libya is one of Germany's strongest trading partners in northern Africa. Last year, Germany exported goods to Libya worth 657.7 million euros ($805.7 million), according to the German Federal Statistics Office. \"The economy is the driving power in German-Libyan relations,\" said Abdulaati in an interview with the Arab-German association for trade and industry. But Germany isn't the only European country making deals in Libya. France last month signed an accord with Libya on peaceful nuclear research. \"This accord represents a qualitative leap in relations between the two countries and proves that Libya has transformed its weapons of mass destruction into constructive weapons,\" Public Works Minister Maatuk Maatuk said at the signing ceremony in March. \"We are telling the world that we are moving towards the development of Libyan nuclear technology for peaceful purposes.\" This week, the Netherlands' Economics Minister Laurens Jan Brinkhorst will visit Libya to negotiate gas and oil agreements. It will be the first high-level visit by a Dutch official since Gadhafi took power in 1969.",

This week, the German ambassador to Libya, Bernd Westphal, announced that his country had signed an agreement to allow the EU to continue to provide financial support for Libya. \"We are very happy that the Libyan people are willing to help us in this difficult time,\" he said in an interview with The German newspaper Deutschland-Zeitung."

The Social Democrats (SPD) and Christian Democrats (CDU) have ruled the small northern city-state of Bremen in a coalition for the past 12 years. But after winning state elections on Sunday with 36.8 percent, the SPD is now flirting with the idea of ditching their previous coalition partners to rule together with the Greens, who made their best-ever showing in a German state poll with 16.4 percent. Bremen's state SPD leadership is to hold talks later on Wednesday with the CDU, which polled 25.7 percent. After an SPD meeting in Bremen, Mayor Jens B\u00f6hrnsen made the first signal he could be favoring the Greens. He said that during the campaign he had deliberately abstained from mentioning the possibility of a renewed CDU coalition because \"after 12 years it shouldn't automatically be continued.\" Bremen's acting head of government and CDU member Thomas R\u00f6wekamp, however, warned against an SPD-Green coalition. \"The majority of people don't want a red-green experiment, but a continuation of the grand coalition,\" he said. Both the SPD and CDU conceded heavy losses in the election, which showed a swing towards the Greens and the Left Party, which scored an unexpected 8.4 percent to win representation in a western German state legislature for the first time in its brief history. Block reforms? If Bremen's SPD decide in favor of the Greens, this would affect the ability of Chancellor Angela Merkel's grand coalition of CDU and SPD to push ahead with reforms requiring constitutional changes, such as stage two of Germany's urgently needed federalism reform. The federal Bundesrat, which is made up of state cabinet members, has to approve the majority of legislative bills passed by the lower chamber, the Bundestag, before they become law. Also, any proposed constitutional changes require two-thirds of all votes in order to be passed by the Bundesrat. The CDU and SPD currently hold 47 of the Bundesrat's 69 seats, which is one seat more than the necessary two-thirds majority. But without Bremen, the number held by the grand coalition would fall to 44 seats, meaning they would need the cooperation of one of the small opposition parties for any constitutional changes. Internal strife Earlier in the week, Chancellor Merkel called for unity within her ruling left-right coalition after the losses in Bremen set the stage for more infighting between the two parties. Merkel also warned the SPD against moving to the left after it lost some five percent points. The chancellor said the outcome showed the SPD had made a mistake by attacking the coalition and campaigning on promises of a minimum wage, which she believes will hamper efforts to fight unemployment of just under 10 percent. \"The result showed that this strategy did not pay off,\" Merkel told a press conference.",
        "generated_story": "Merkel's coalition of Social Democrats and CDU could block reforms Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives and the center-left Christian Democrats (SPD) are set to form a coalition government in the Bundestag on Wednesday. The SPD-Green coalition is expected to be formed after a vote of no confidence in Chancellor Merkel on Sunday. Merkel and her conservative coalition partner, the Left Party (CDU), have been locked in a dead heat over the past 12 years of government reforms. On Wednesday, Merkel announced that she would not seek re-election to a third term in parliament. \"I will not allow this to happen,\" Merkel said at a press conference in Berlin, adding that the SPD would \"not be able to stand up to the chancellor's will.\" \"We are not going to allow him to do that,\" said Jens B\u00f6hrnsen, a spokesman for the party's parliamentary leader, Thomas R\u00f6wekamp, who is also a member of the German parliament's lower house of parliament (lower house). \"This is not the way to go,\" he said, referring to her coalition with the Greens and Greens, which are also in talks on a possible coalition deal. Earlier in Sunday, German media reported that Merkel would seek a deal with opposition parties to overhaul the country's tax code, but that it was not yet clear whether the deal would be reached. In an interview with German news agency dpa, Bremen's spokesman, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, said: \"The chancellor has a lot to say about this, and she is willing to talk about it. But she will have to make a decision on the matter.\" Merkel, however, did not rule out the possibility of a new election in September. She has already said that her party would form an alliance with other conservative parties, such as the Green party, in order to avoid a repeat of last year's \"grand coalition\" of conservatives, liberals and conservatives. A new coalition would also be in place, he added, saying that there was a \"very good chance\" the new government would have a chance of winning a majority of seats in next month's federal election. 'A very strong coalition' Merkel has been criticized by some in her own party for a lack of commitment to reforms, including tax cuts, tax increases and tax breaks for small business owners. That criticism has led to criticism of her handling of tax reform in recent weeks, with some conservatives accusing her of being too lenient with tax-cutting measures."

The new pact, including an artillery buffer zone, was a move to strengthen a peace plan signed earlier this month, also in Minsk.

A convoy from Russia consisting of about 170 trucks arrived in Ukraine on Saturday, with a reported cargo of humanitarian aid. Previous aid convoys sent from Russia were met with outrage in Kyiv, as it was suspected they may have been used to provide support to the pro-Moscow separatists in eastern Ukraine. Russia has repeatedly denied such accusations. The separatists have said they want to break from Kyiv and have already declared \"people's republics'\" in Donetsk and Luhansk.

In a statement released on Friday, the German football association (DFB) announced that the games would be rescheduled for 2018 and that talks would take place between them and their Chinese counterparts in order explore how to move forward. \"To the regret of all parties involved, the project has not received the broad approval that had been expected,\" the DFB said. \"In fact, the project was used by a handful of spectators to send messages that were considered hurtful by the Chinese team, officials, the Chinese Football Association's support staff and Chinese spectators.\" Protests in opening match The first of the arranged matches, against TSV Schott Mainz of the fourth-tier Regionalliga S\u00fcdwest was interrupted midway through the first half when the Chinese players left the field because a small group of activists had unfurled Tibetan flags. The team later returned to the field after the flags had been taken down, before succumbing to a 3-0 defeat. On Monday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry strongly criticized the protest. Initially, it had been thought that the Chinese side would play in the Regionalliga S\u00fcdwest - a regional division of Germany's fourth tier which has only 19 teams but the plan was revised so the matches would just be friendlies. This followed an agreement signed in 2016 between the German FA and the Chinese government to help boost the sport in the Asian country, where the Bundesliga is increasingly popular.

High taxes The cost of acquiring and operating a car has risen 42 percent since 1995, compared to a 24 percent increase in the general cost of living. Due to tax increases and higher production costs, fuel prices soared 86 percent over the 15-year period. In 2010 alone, the average price for a liter of super gasoline was more than 1.40 euros ($1.84) - the highest the average price ever. According to ADAC, urban singles spent an average of 3,340 euros on their cars in 2000. Five years later, that figure had jumped to 3,900 euros.

The German government's mineral oil and value added taxes account for nearly 88 cents of the 1.35-euro price of a liter of fuel.

Madrid has agreed to host five prisoners, the largest commitment yet from a European country. Citing privacy concerns, Rubalcaba refused to give the prisoner's name or any identifying information, except to say he was a Palestinian.

Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos has urged other European countries \"to do their utmost\" to take in former Guantanamo detainees as well.

Obama had said he would close the prison by January 22, 2010, yet the deadline passed unmet.

But now they should take care that Great Britain does not move further away from Europe, writes Birgit Maass. If only they had done it out of full conviction. If they at least believed that they could really benefit their country by withdrawing from the EU. But many of the parliamentarians whose vote will finally set Brexit on its wayhave voted against their hearts, as well as their minds. It was a vote against their minds, because the withdrawal from the EU will almost certainly, at least on a short to medium term basis, have negative repercussions for the British economy. And it was a vote against their hearts, because for many, a view of the future, divorced from Brussels and increasingly reliant on an unpredictable US President Donald Trump, is somewhat alarming. In recent days, many members of parliament have described it as \"a catastrophe.\" No vote \"against the will of the people.\" Of course there are \"Brexiteers\" who believe that a Britain independent of Brussels will be able to return to its former greatness, once it is no longer held back by the \"Little Europeans.\" But they are in the minority - the majority of parliamentarians already declared their support for remaining in the EU during the referendum campaign. Yet despite this, Theresa May's government was able to push its legislative proposal through the House of Commons without any great difficulty. The predominant view, also amongst members of the two leading parties, is that to hinder Brexit and to fail to support the government in its endeavors to do so, would be to go \"against the will of the people.\" Anti-EU newspapers have targeted Brexit opponents. And those who have publically come out in support of the EU have had to reckon with death threats. The at times passionate debate in the lower house, that went on over several days, was a temporary highlight in this European tragedy, which in the worst case could contribute to the continent disintegrating into individual sovereign states. Don't be intimidated The British public supports the hard-line position taken by Prime Minister May in withdrawing from the common market. Polls are showing that her strategy is gaining increased support. There is no turning back now. The British are now looking for clarity on the repercussions of their withdrawal from the EU. They want the negotiations with the EU to start as soon as possible. It was an historical misjudgement by David Cameron that he could win the referendum. Most of the members of the lower house believed the then-prime minister and voted to hold a referendum. But now they can no longer stop Brexit. But they should not let themselves be intimidated by party discipline, nor the leading Brexiteers, nor by voter impatience. Over the next two years they should use every chance they can to influence the withdrawal process. May announced that although they are leaving the European Union, they will not be moving away from Europe. The parliamentarians must now hold her to her word. Have something to say?

The result is a no-confidence vote in the government of Prime Minister Theresa May. It is the result of a \"yes\" vote, which will determine the future of Britain's relationship with the EU. There is no doubt that the vote will result in an agreement between the UK and the bloc. But it will also determine whether Britain can continue to live in a free and open Europe, as it has been for the past two years. That is why it is so important to me that we have a strong majority in this house of parliament. I think it's important for us to be clear about what we want to do in terms of our future as a country. We are not going to give up on the idea of an open and free Europe. This is what the people of this country want. They want a stable, stable and prosperous future for themselves and for their children and grandchildren. And that's what this referendum is all about: a chance for Britain to get on with its lives and make the most of it. What is important is that Britain is able to move forward with this process, and we can move ahead with it without fear of losing our jobs and our national security. In the end, we will have to wait and see what happens. If we don't, then we won't have the opportunity to make a decision on our own. Why should we wait? It's not just a question of whether or not we should stay in Europe or leave it? The question is how long will it take to reach the point where we are ready to go back to the way things were before the referendum? That's the question that will be asked by the majority of British parliamentarians who voted in favor of Brexit. How do you respond to this question? What are your thoughts on this? Do you have any views on what should happen next? Is there a way forward for our country? I have no opinion on that, but I do think that there are a lot of people who would like to see a change in our relationship to Europe and that is something that can only be achieved through a vote of no confidence. So, what do we do? Let's see how we answer that question in 24 hours."

        "target": "A Brief History of the Seaside Holiday These days, millions take seaside holidays for granted as one of life's pleasures. But 200 years ago, a dip in the sea was more a test of courage. Hardly anyone could swim. As late as the 18th century, many Europeans still thought of the sea as the realm of Satan: storm-tossed and inhabited by terrifying monsters. \"Unlike the mountains, the coasts were terra incognita as a holiday spot,\" says Manfred B\u00e4tje, director of the Bade-Museum on the North Sea island of Norderney. Anyone who set foot in the water was \"stepping into the unknown\". Brighton showed the way That only began to change after the British aristocracy discovered the healing power of salt water. As early as 1780, Brighton, England's biggest and oldest seaside resort, was a bustling spa. Philosopher and physicist Georg Christoph Lichtenberg (1742-1799) of G\u00f6ttingen gave Germans the starting signal with his 1793 essay \"Why doesn't Germany have any large public seaside resorts?\" In it, he called for the creation of a resort in Cuxhaven on the North Sea. He received support from the most notable German physician of the time, the Prussian king's court physician, Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland. But things turned out somewhat differently. Germany's first seaside resort was indeed built in September, 1793, but in Heiligendamm on the Baltic Sea. Four years later, permission was granted for construction of Germany's first resort on the North Sea, on Norderney. \"For the first bathing season on July and August of 1800, only around 250 guests turned up. Now, the nearly 6000 residents host a good 530,000 bathers annually, plus around 230,000 day-trippers,\" B\u00e4tje reels off the figures. Romanticist inspiration In the 19th century, the landscapes of Caspar David Friedrich, such as his famous Chalk Cliffs on R\u00fcgen (1818), gave seaside holidays added impetus. From then on, the sea was no longer a voracious beast. From the shore, the cultivated, modern European contemplated the vast melancholy of the deep. \"The calm sea became an embodiment of unspecified yearning, the waves an expression of vitality and dynamism,\" soliloquizes museum director B\u00e4tje. But the journey to the sea long remained an arduous, time-consuming one. It took the mail coach a good thirty hours to cover the distance from Hamburg to the North Frisian town of Aurich over bumpy, muddy roads. The express cab from Bremen only took about 16 hours to reach the East Frisian town of Norden - including six changes of horses along the way. \"It wasn't comfortable,\" explains B\u00e4tje. Not until the introduction of seaside tourist steamers out of Hamburg and Bremen to the islands and the expansion of the railways did the journey become easier. Strict bathing rules At first, it was primarily the well-to-do bourgeois and nobility who were able to afford a seaside holiday. Victorian-era society is known for its extreme prudishness, and the beach was not exempt. Bathing machines were essentially changing cabins on wheels that could be rolled into the surf. The sexes were kept strictly separated. Wet swimsuits could not be allowed to cling, thus revealing the body's contours. Women sported baggy flannel garments with bloomers underneath that swiftly became waterlogged to where the bather was risking her life. Hardly anyone really knew how to swim anyway. \"Most bathers wouldn't stay in the water any more than two minutes, often just seconds at a time. The English had a rule: 'Three dips and out',\" quips archivist Manfred B\u00e4tje, whose Bade-Museum is housed in a building for a former wave pool, just a few steps from Norderney's Weststrand, where, during the summer months, vacationers sunbathe in wicker beach chairs and on blankets, cooled by a salty sea breeze. Sunbathing first came in style early in the 20th century, and the first true swimsuits were produced in the United States. \"Starting in 1919, today's bathing culture gradually began to take shape,\" B\u00e4tje looks back. At the same time, ideals of beauty were in flux - such as the attitude towards tan skin, which had long been regarded as a mark of farmers and manual laborers. B\u00e4tje: \"People were still cultivating their genteel pallors.\" Water, Waves, Wellness Today, the sun worshipers are the devout masses, and seaside holidays are their pilgrimages. The North Sea resorts alone count some 12.9 million overnight stays annually. Health is once again a primary concern: sea air, sea water, sea salts and the algaes and mud used in",

It was a time of relaxation and relaxation for the German people. The Bade-Museum in Weststrand, located in the city of Hanover, was founded in 1742-1799 as a place to relax and enjoy the summer months. Four years later, in September, 1793, it became a popular holiday destination for German tourists. A good thirty-six-year-old man named Manfred B\u00e4tje decided to take a trip to the North Sea in order to experience the sights and sounds of sea life. He spent about 16 hours on board the ship Chalk Cliffs, which he called \"the most beautiful place on the planet.\" The ship was named after the famous German poet Caspar David Friedrich, who wrote a poem about the sea and its beauty. \"The sea is a beautiful thing, and it is the only place where you can see the sun rise and the moon set over the horizon,\" he wrote in a letter to his wife, Dieter Sell. In his letter, he said, \"It is an honor to be a part of this history.\" He added that it was \"a great honor\" for him to have been invited to stay in his home state of East Frisian, where he was born and raised. But he also pointed out that he had never been to Germany before, so he didn't know what he would do if he were to go there again. His father, Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland, died in 1818 and his mother was buried in her home town of Halle. After all, she was the first German woman to visit Germany in over 200 years. Her father was German and her mother German. They were both born in East Germany and grew up in North Rhine-Westphalia. Their father and mother were German immigrants from the Baltic Sea. Both of them were born there, but they were not German citizens at the time. As a result, they had no idea what it meant to live in an East German country. Today, many Germans consider themselves Germans, even if they don't have a German passport. That's not the case for most of us. There are a lot of Germans who have German passports and they are not allowed to travel to other European countries. This is because they do not want to cross the border into the United States where they can get into trouble with the law. And because of that they have to pay a fine for not being able to leave their country when they return to their home country of their birth. These days, Germany has a reputation for being a great tourist destination. Many of its visitors come from all over Europe, including the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece and even the Netherlands. One of these countries is known as the \"Baltic-era\" or \"Westland.\" It is also known for its high seas, with a high sea level and a low salt content."

At least four gunmen disguised in police uniforms raided a hospital in Pakistan's eastern city of Lahore on Monday night, claiming at least five lives. Local officials said the gunmen were trying to free a militant, who was being treated there after being captured during attacks on two mosques last Friday. The police said the gunfight at Jinnah Hospital had lasted around 45 minutes but the gunmen had managed to flee. Friday's twin attacks on the minority Ahmadi community left more than 90 people dead. They were claimed by a group, which identified itself as the Punjabi wing of the Taliban. Deutsche Welle spoke to political expert Hasan Askari Rizvi in Lahore, where there has been a wave of violence in recent days. DW: Who are the \"Punjabi Taliban\"? It is a kind of a pejorative term, which includes a host of groups. Initially in Punjab, you had two types of militancy: One, the groups that focussed mainly on Indian-administered Kashmir and there were other types of groups that focussed on Pakistan. Those were the sectarian groups targeting mainly the Shias, and there were some Shia groups targeting the Sunni leadership. Over the years a lot of factions have broken away from these groups and these small entities are functioning more or less autonomously. They have trainings in the tribal areas because these are secured for them and certain parts are not under Pakistani control so these groups go there. They operate with the Pakistani Taliban based in tribal areas against the Pakistani troops in the region. They also have an autonomous agenda, which they pursue in Punjab, as they have been doing in the past days. These groups also play host or are a kind of a local link to Taliban suicide bombers who come into the main part of Pakistan from the tribal areas (let's say to Punjab). If they have to target some place, they park themselves with these Punjab groups, and then do it. All these factions and groups that have broken away from traditional militant groups and are functioning in close collaboration with tribal area Taliban are often described as the \"Punjabi Taliban\". Why do you think these militants are resurfacing now? They have always existed here and there and generally the trend is that they undertake a couple of operations, one after the other. Then the government comes in and takes action against them. Then they just disappear or become sleeping groups and suddenly after a couple of months they resurface. That's the standard pattern. The last major incident in Lahore was in the first week of March. Then there was nothing in April and now towards the end of May you have this kind of incident. Do you think the government should have taken stronger action against them? They should have but the problem is that the Punjab government has a kind of ambiguous approach and I think there is some element of denial within the leadership also. These groups also have some sympathy if not support at the societal level and that makes it difficult for the government to go against them openly. They need to work together and to emphasise to the people that they are terrorists. They use different names and Islam but actually their agenda is terrorism. Somehow the government of Punjab has been rather confused and ambiguous regarding these groups. Interview: Disha Uppal Editor: Anne Thomas",
        "generated_story": "Punjabi Taliban in northwest Pakistan growing The Pakistani Taliban is growing in size and strength, according to a report from Germany's Deutsche Welle. The group is believed to be the largest in the country's history. According to the report, the Taliban are \"increasingly increasing their presence in Pakistan.\" The report said that the group's members were \"growing in strength\" and that they were planning to take over the city of Lahore. \"They are increasing the number of people who are living in this area,\" said Disha Uppal, a researcher at the German-administered Jinnah Hospital in Karachi. She added that it was \"very difficult\" for the militants to establish a foothold in Punjab, which is the capital of Pakistan's south-eastern Punjab province. DW spoke to one of the members of a group called the \"Pakistani Taliban,\" which claims to represent the Punjabis. It is not clear how many people have joined the militant group, but it is thought that at least 10,000 people are fighting for their right to self-determination. In the past days, it has been estimated that there are around 1.5 million people living under Pakistani rule. This number could rise to 2 million by the end of May. However, there is no evidence to suggest that this number is much higher. Pakistan has a long history of militancy in its south, and the situation is becoming increasingly tense. At the beginning of April, Pakistan was the only country in India to have a Pakistani army stationed in Afghanistan. During the first week of March, Pakistani troops were deployed to Afghanistan to fight the Afghan Taliban. Since then, however, they have been unable to reach Afghanistan and Pakistan. They have also been prevented from establishing bases in other countries, such as India and China, where they are not allowed to hold large numbers of troops. These forces are also known as \"Shias\" or \"Sunni.\" They are known to carry out attacks on Shia Muslims and Sunni Muslims, as well as to attack Shiites and convert them to Islam. Last week, an Indian army officer was killed in a shootout with a Taliban fighter near the Pakistani border. He was also injured in an attack on a Shia mosque in Pashtun village in northwestern Pakistan on Friday. A Pakistani military spokesman said on Monday that Pakistani forces were continuing their attacks against the Shia community in Jammu and Kashmir."

        "target": "Former Barcelona coach Tito Vilanova loses battle with cancer Former Barcelona coach Tito Vilanova has died from the cancer that forced him to retire from football at the end of last season. He was 45. The Catalan club announced the death of its former bench boss in a statement posted on its website on Friday. \"FC Barcelona is in immense mourning. Tito Vilanova has died at the age of 45. May he rest in peace,\" the statement said. Vilanova had first been diagnosed with a tumor in a saliva gland in November 2011, while he was an assistant to then-Barcelona head coach Pep Guardiola. He had been battling against recurring cancer ever since and had been admitted to a Barcelona hospital last week. He led Barca to the Primera Liga title last season, his only campaign as head coach, when the Catalans earned a record-tying 100 points. Last July he stepped down due to his ongoing health problems. Vilanova is survived by his wife and two children, including a son who now plays in Barcelona's youth academy. pfd/lw (AP, dpa, AFP)",
        "generated_story": "Barca coach Tito Vilanova dies in hospital after battle with cancer Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola has announced the death of the club's head coach after a long illness. The Catalan football legend died Friday at the age of 45. He had been battling cancer for more than a year. \"I have been suffering from cancer since November 2011,\" Guardiola told reporters at a news conference in Barcelona, adding that he was \"deeply saddened\" by the news. In a statement released on Friday, the Catalan soccer federation said the coach had died of cancer in a hospital in the city of Barcelona. It was not immediately clear whether the cause of his death was cancer or whether he had suffered a heart attack or a stroke. A spokesman for Barcelona's football federation told AFP news agency that \"it is a very sad day for all of us at FC Barcelona.\" \"We are deeply saddened by this news and we are very sorry to inform you that our coach has passed away,\" the statement said. Vilanca, who has been with Barca since the end of last season, was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer at age 45, according to the Barcelona press office. His diagnosis came after he failed to make the squad for the Copa del Rey final, which was held in Spain last month. Barcelona are currently in fourth place in their Primera Liga division, behind leaders Real Madrid and Real Sociedad, and have won the league for a third time in four years. Last season's title-winning side, Barcelona finished fourth in La Liga, with a win over Sevilla, on the back of a 3-1 win at home to Real Betis on Saturday. Former Barcelona player and coach Guardiola said he would no longer be able to take part in his successor's coaching duties, but would continue to work closely with the team's medical staff. vp/msh (AP, AFP, dpa)"
