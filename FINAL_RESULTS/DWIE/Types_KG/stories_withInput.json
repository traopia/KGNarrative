        "target": "Opinion: Obama's Cuban revolution President Barack Obama has made a very special declaration of love to Cuba. It's as revolutionary as the Cuban revolution, and as peaceful as the biblical Sermon on the Mount, says DW's Astrid Prange. US President Barack Obama has lost his old communist \"enemy,\" and Cuban President Raul Castro has lost his hatred of capitalism. In the first phone call from president to president since 1961 the two heads of state came to a surprisingly swift agreement. They want to renew diplomatic relations, which have been on ice for more than 50 years, and exchange ambassadors. It's only a matter of time before the US lifts its trade embargo against Cuba. All the word \"embargo\" is really good for - at this stage - is as an ideological soapbox for political hardliners, especially Republicans in Congress who believe lifting sanctions would constitute defeat for the US. Yet the lifting of the embargo has already begun. In addition to medication, it has been possible since 2000 to export agricultural produce such as maize, cereal crops, and poultry to Cuba. Flirting with the rogue state Furthermore, 100,000 US citizens have travelled to Cuba since 2011 for cultural and scientific exchanges. Travel restrictions on Cubans living in exile in the US who wanted to visit their relatives on the island were also lifted. According to press reports, the two countries' military forces are even said to be cooperating, as are their coastguards, and military on the border of the US marine base in Guantanamo. Now Obama wants to officially open a \"new chapter\" in relations with the communist Caribbean island and remove Cuba from the US list of so-called \"rogue states\" that support terrorism. The travel ban on American tourists visiting the island will also largely be lifted. That's as far as things will go for the time being, as Obama would require a majority in Congress in Washington to lift the embargo entirely. But even if these are only small steps, the fall of the American-Cuban wall has begun. The easing of the sanctions and the resumption of diplomatic relations are setting the scene for an end to the embargo. Embargo as scapegoat The tearing down of this \"wall in the mind\" is long overdue. The blockade is obsolete, and has proved to be entirely ineffective. More than this, its advocates have achieved the opposite of what they actually wanted. The blockade has provided the leaders in Havana with an easy excuse for their economic failure. Raul Castro realized long ago that Cuba's economic problems can no longer be justified simply by citing the US embargo. It looks as though he was counting on the blockade being lifted: There is no other explanation for the completion of the Mariel container port in January this year. Cuba's biggest infrastructure project was, incidentally, financed by Brazil. The Brazilians also sent a declaration of love to Cuba. Raul Castro opened the door to them. He loves anyone who helps him - his friends even more than his enemies.",
        "generated_story": "Cuba: The Fall of the Wall in the Mind of President Barack Obama The fall of Cuba's government has been marked by a series of changes. The US Congress has voted to close the US military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in 2011. In a statement released by the Cuban government, President Raul Castro said that the move was made \"in accordance with the will of our people.\" The move marked the end of a decades-long war between the communist regime and the United States, and it marked a turning point for the country's political and economic development. \"We are in a very difficult time right now,\" said President Obama, referring to his first year in office, which ended on January 1, 2011, with a vote of no confidence in Congress and a new president, who is expected to be inaugurated in two weeks' time. Obama's first term as president came to an end in January, when he was forced to step down from his post as head of state in favor of his wife, Mariel. Since then, however, he has made a number of controversial decisions, including the closure of Guantanamo, the largest US prison for women in Latin America, as well as the removal of US troops from the island of Hispaniola. He has also called on Congress to pass a bill that would ban the use of military force in Cuba. That bill would have allowed the military to use force against women and girls, but it would also have prohibited the sale of weapons of mass destruction, such as chemical weapons, to the armed forces. This would be the first time in US history that a US president had been removed from office by Congress. It is also the last time that an American president has taken the helm of government in his home country. And it is not just the former president who has changed the course of history. There are also changes that have taken place in other countries, notably Brazil, Brazil and Brazil. For example, there is the possibility that Cuba will be able to take back control of its nuclear weapons program. But that doesn't necessarily mean that it will stay in power forever. What does that mean for Cuba? The Cuban people have a lot to say about the future of their country and what they want to do with it. They don't just want it to stay the same as it was before the revolution. Many of them want a better future for themselves and their families. So, they are going to have to wait and see what happens. I think that's a good thing, because it means that they will have more time to think about what's going on in their own country before they decide whether or not to move forward with that plan. If they do, then they'll have the opportunity to make a decision about how to proceed with their lives. We will see how that plays out."

The 89-year-old did not say when exactly his resignation would take effect. Calling the move a personal decision, President Giorgio Napolitano made his announcement during an end-of-year speech on Wednesday. \"I'm about to step down, to resign as the constitution expressly allows,\" he said, adding. \"I've reached an age that brings with it growing limitations and difficulties for me to do my institutional duties, which are complex and very demanding.\" Though he did not say when his resignation would take effect, a potential date is January 13 when Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi is due to give up the country's rotating six-month presidency of the Council of the European Union. Renzi faces a political challenge in organizing a replacement for Napolitano, dubbed by Italian media as \"King George.\" The president has served as a key intermediary between political parties through numerous changes in government and other tricky political situations. Napolitano, a former communist respected by Europe and Washington, took office in 2006. At the end of his seven-year mandate in 2013, he was asked to stay on because parliament could not agree on his successor. At the time he warned he may not serve out the full term, given his age. In Italy, presidents have loosely-defined powers including the ability to nominate prime ministers, dissolve parliament and veto legislation, as well as use the moral authority of the office to influence politics. se/cmk (dpa, Reuters)",

Last year, the Italian government announced that it would no longer be able to nominate candidates for the post of president. It said the move was in response to a series of corruption scandals that had rocked the country over the past two years. se/cmk (dpa, Reuters)"

The spokesman said more help was needed, but could not give exact numbers \"due to pending assignments.\" Recent soccer violence raises concern Swiss media has been questioning the security preparations for Euro 2008 after a spate of violence at recent games. In the latest incident, seats were ripped out and a goal post wrenched from the ground after St. Gallen faced the prospect of relegation following a 2-0 defeat to Bellinzona on May 20. St. Gallen was the third incident in a month that saw violent clashes with police who twice resorted to rubber bullets and tear gas. While Switzerland is seen as a low risk country in terms of hooliganism, violence has been on the increase in recent years and estimates claim there are around 400 hooligans and 600 sympathizers. Swiss Sports Minister Samuel Schmid said that hooliganism cannot be ruled out, reported German news agency DPA. But he expressed his belief that extra measures such as more policing, restrictions on alcohol -- which he has called \"a catalyst for violence\" -- and video surveillance will help keep trouble at bay. Private firms to boost European police The private security companies will be responsible for patrolling the stadiums and their surroundings, as well as the public viewing areas, team hotels and trainings areas. An international police force will manage the rest. Switzerland has committed some 31,200 police officers and soldiers. Another 1,700 police will be sent from Germany, which will have the authority to make arrests.

Conservative members of Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition put forward a united front at the weekend against recent developments in the city of Wuppertal. Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said civilians wearing uniforms bearing the logo \"Shariah police\" could not simply start patrolling German streets. The groups reportedly hovered around sites like discotheques and gambling houses, telling passers-by to refrain from gambling and alcohol. Wuppertal's police have begun pressing charges. \"Sharia law is not tolerated on German soil,\" de Maiziere told mass-circulation daily Bild on Saturday. \"Nobody can take it upon themselves to abuse the good name of the German police.\" Justice Minister Heiko Maas, meanwhile, told Bild that \"the state alone\" was responsible for the administration of justice in Germany. It was obvious, Maas said, that any illegal parallel system of law enforcement would not be tolerated. Christian Democrat party whip Volker Kauder was similarly emphatic in an interview to be published in this week's Welt am Sonntag newspaper. \"Under absolutely no circumstances can we tolerate self-styled 'Sharia police officers' patrolling our streets and dictating what people should or should not do,\" Kauder said. Ringleader: goal was attention The 33-year-old behind the Wuppertal patrols, former fireman Sven Lau, published a video on his website on Saturday. Lau said that a \"Sharia police\" never existed, and that a group of men had simply worn the mock uniforms for a few hours. \"We knew that this would raise attention,\" Lau said, claiming that his goal was to spark a debate about Sharia law in Germany. Lau is a leading member of Germany's Salafist movement, advocates of a strict Sunni interpretation of political Islam. He works with a mosque in his native M\u00f6nchengladbach, not far west of Wuppertal, and used to head the fundamentalist group \"Invitation to Paradise.\" (Einladung zum Paradies, in German.) The central council of Muslims in Germany (ZMD) condemned the activities. \"These few teen yobs do not speak in our name,\" chairman Ayman A. Mazyek told the Tagesspiegel am Sonntag newspaper. \"These people are perverting the name of our religion. With this shrill and foolish action, they are really hurting Muslims.\" Sharia law is the Arabic term for a legal system based on the Koran.

In a statement released Saturday, the interior ministry's chairman, Volker Kauder, said that \"we will continue to work closely with Islamic police, but we are not going to allow them to take advantage of this situation.\" He added that it would be \"very difficult\" for the government to make a decision on whether or not to introduce stricter anti-Islamic laws. The government is also working on a plan to increase the number of police officers who can be deployed in Muslim-majority areas. msh/rc (Reuters, AFP)"

Its warning follows a WHO admission that the epidemic requires \"extraordinary measures.\" The head of Medicins Sans Frontieres (MSF), Joanne Liu -- fresh from a visit to western Africa -- said in Geneva on Friday that more experts were needed in the hard-hit region. \"It is deteriorating faster, and moving faster, than we can respond to,\" Liu told reporters. \"Like in a war time, we have a total collapse of infrastructure,\" she added. Lui said the world community needed to get the \"upper hand\" over the next six months. While the viral spread had been slowed in Guinea, concerns focused especially on Liberia. \"If we don't stabilize Liberia, we will never stabilize the region,\" Lui said. She was critical of the WHO for delaying its public health emergency warning until August 8. \"We need people with a hands-on operational mindset,\" to combat the outbreak, Liu told the Geneva news briefing. WHO - 'vastly underestimated' On Thursday, the World Health Organization (WHO) said the scale of the epidemic had been \"vastly underestimated\" and that \"extraordinary measures\" were needed to contain the contagious virus. The UN health agency said the death toll had climbed to 1,069 in four afflicted countries, spanning Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia and more recently Nigeria. Sierra Leone's chief medical officer Brima Kargbo disclosed on Thursday that at least 32 of the nation's nurses and doctors had died from the Ebola virus while performing their duties between May 24 and August 13. Local staff suffered stigma, despite saving lives, Kargbo said. \"We still have to break the chain of transmission to separate the infected from the uninfected.\" Youth Olympics also affected The mounting alarm coincided with an announcement Friday from the International Olympics Committee that three athletes from Ebola-hit countries had been barred from competing in pool events and combat sports at the Youth Olympics opening in China on Saturday. ipj/tj (AfP, Reuters)",

The WHO has warned that the outbreak of Ebola in West Africa, which has killed more than 1,000 people, could spread to the rest of Africa and spread as fast as it has in the past two weeks. In a statement released Friday, the WHO said the Ebola outbreak had killed at least 2,500 people in Sierra Leone, Liberia, Nigeria and Nigeria since the beginning of this year. It also said that there was a \"significant increase\" in cases of people who have died from Ebola, including children, as well as those who are still suffering from severe health problems such as high fever, high blood pressure, diarrhea and vomiting. WHO warns of'serious consequences' Ebola can spread rapidly and is spreading rapidly, according to a WHO report released on Thursday, adding that it could take up to three to four weeks for the disease to fully be eradicated. According to WHO, it is estimated that around 1.5 million people have been infected with the deadly virus since May 24, when it was first discovered in a remote region of Nigeria. At the same time, there is a growing concern about the spread of deadly Ebola virus in other countries, particularly in Nigeria, where the epidemic has been spreading since mid-May. International Olympic Committee (IOC) Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said last week that he was \"very concerned\" about Ebola's spread in Africa. He called on the international community to take action to tackle the crisis. ipj/tj (AfP, Reuters)"

The Luxembourg-based court thus sided with the German firm UsedSoft in a protracted legal battle with US software giant Oracle. The ruling made it clear that trade in used software was permissible even if the software had not been shipped on a physical medium such as a CD or DVD, but had been digitally downloaded from the Internet. UsedSoft's business model hinges completely on reselling used packages or legally obtained license keys for them. By reselling the keys to clients, the latter are then able to download the latest version of a given program directly from a company's Internet site and obtain all new updates and patches in the process. Legal clarity Oracle had sued UsedSoft over its business model, trying to prevent buyers of used software licenses from downloading programs again. But the European court ruled that the so-called principle of exhaustion applied whenever software was originally sold to a customer for an unlimited time span, not giving the maker of the software the right to prevent the resale of that software. \"The door for the trade in used software has been pushed wide open throughout the European Union,\" UsedSoft said in a statement, welcoming \"perfect legal safety on the market.\" The court in Luxembourg emphasized, though, that whoever resold pieces of original software and their accompanying licenses must erase every copy on their own computers in advance and was not allowed to keep a copy after resale. hg/mz (AFP, dpa)",

NASA's Mars rover, \"Curiosity,\" will wrap up a lengthy self-testing phase on Thursday, freeing it up to continue exploring the surface of the Red Planet. Mission manager Jennifer Tropser told reporters in a conference call on Wednesday evening that the plan, once the final checks were completed, was to \"drive, drive, drive\" until Curiosity discovers a rock suitable for analysis. She added that the instrument checks have delivered positive results. \"Through every phase of the check-out, Curiosity has performed almost flawlessly,\" Tropser said. \"The success so far of these activities has been outstanding.\" Many of the tests have concerned Curiosity's robotic arm. The 2.1-meter (7-feet) appendage will be used to pick out and sample rocks and soil. NASA is investigating whether Mars can sustain life, or whether it could in the past. The tests were designed to identify any damage sustained during its interplanetary flight and also to ensure that the arm still functioned properly on Mars, with its different temperatures and gravity. The Mars rover landed in the giant Gale Crater, near the Martian equator, on August 5; it has so far moved about 109 meters within the crater. The rover is traveling east, heading first to an intersection called Glenelg, where three types of terrain meet. This is likely to be the location for the first rock and soil samples, though NASA said Curiosity was unlikely to arrive there for several weeks. Curiosity's ultimate destination is the nearby Aeolis Mons or Mount Sharp, a 3-mile-high mound of rock rising out of the crater. Mount Sharp is about 4.3 miles (7 kilometers) away from Curiosity's landing site.

        "target": "Aging health: WHO call to action as world population over 60 set to double by 2050 In a new report on aging and health, the World Health Organization is calling for action on \"population aging,\" as figures suggest the number of people over 60 will reach two billion by 2050. People worldwide are living longer, says the World Health Organization in its World Report on Aging and Health. This is both good and bad. It gives us the chance to \"pursue new activities\" as we get older, such as in education and family life. But it all depends on our health. And for that the WHO says world governments need to act now to make sure our societies worldwide are ready. What are the take home facts from the World Health Organization's 2015 report on Aging and Health? The WHO says that in the next 35 years, the global number of people aged 60 years and over will almost double from 12 percent to 22 percent. By 2020, there will be more people over the age of 60 than 5 year olds. And a majority of older people (80 percent) will live in \"low and middle income\" countries. It's estimated that the world's population aged 60 years and older will total about 2 billion in 2050, which is more than twice as much as now. Furthermore, worldwide, about 125 million people are aged 80 years or older. But by 2050, it is expected that this number of people - aged 80 and over - will live in China alone. But I'm not old, so why should I care? Well, all this is happening at a faster rate than ever before. And the WHO says \"all countries face major challenges to ensure that their health and social systems are ready\" for this major demographic shift. It will cost a lot of money to improve health and social infrastructures, especially in more developed countries where traditional families structures have changed dramatically. Surely, there's \"no typical older person,\" though. How does the WHO define aging? We tend to think of older people as physically and mentally frail. But that's not necessarily the case, not everywhere in the world. Old is a relative concept - especially in middle income to rich countries. For instance, some 70 year olds are as fit as some 20 year olds. Just think how many older folk are at your gym, and ask yourself whether you can keep up with all of them. But that still doesn't explain aging. What is it exactly? The WHO says that at a biological level, \"aging results from the impact of the accumulation of a wide variety of molecular and cellular damage over time.\" Basically, this puts people at a higher risk of disease and, of course, death. But aging can also be associated with \"life transitions,\" such as retirement or witnessing other people, such as friends and family, die around you. This can affect you psychologically and sometimes, as a result, physically. What sort of diseases come with old age? Some of the most common non-fatal conditions include hearing loss, cataracts, back and neck pain and osteoarthritis. Other conditions include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - which affects the lungs - diabetes, depression, and dementia. What needs to be done? The WHO is proposing a five-step plan of action, which includes: Committing to healthy aging and \"evidence-based policies to strengthen the abilities of older persons.\" Aligning health systems with the needs of older populations Developing systems for providing long-term care Creating \"age-friendly cities and communities Improving measurement, monitoring and understanding of \"aging issues\" worldwide. But don't forget: \"a longer life brings with it opportunities, not only for older people and their families, but also for societies as a whole.\"",
        "generated_story": "WHO's Population Aging Plan: Actions Now The World Health Organization (WHO) has released a new report on the world's population aging and health. The report, published in the latest edition of the World Report on Aging and Health (WDRH), aims to reduce the number of people aged 65 and older in developing countries by 1.5 million by 2050. According to the WHO, this will be the first time that the average age of a person aged 70 to 80 years has been reduced by more than one-third. This is in line with WHO's goal of reducing the amount of deaths from old age by one to two percent by 2020. In order to achieve this goal, WHO has set a target of 2.4 million people living on less than five percent of their income in 2015. However, the report predicts that this number will rise to 3.6 million in 2050, up from 2 million today. It is also expected to rise by 5 percent from today's current level of 5.2 million. \"The world is going to have a lot more people than ever before,\" said WHO Director-General Margaret Chan in an interview with the New York Times."

It is a reflection of his current inauspicious Formula One campaign that World Champion Michael Schumacher is only featuring in reports on this weekend's German Grand Prix at Hockenheim dues to his nationality. The home grown champion equaled his own record of 11 wins in a season at last year's race but this year he will be hoping to just get on the podium at the end. Schumi lies in third place some 34 points off the top spot and has a lot to do if he is to record his 85th career win. Ferrari's poor season to date is unlikely to get better with hopes dwindling that the 36-year-old will add to his sole victory of the season although the seven-time world champion characteristically refuses to rule it out. Schumi and Ferrari still in the fight \"Contrary to many other people's opinions, we have in no means written ourselves off, even though we have to admit that the situation has worsened recently, rather than improved,\" said the German, referring to the problems with this season's car. \"But that doesn't mean that it can't be improved again, and that's exactly what we're working on.\" The limelight is falling on two young pretenders to Schumacher's throne as Sunday's race approaches. The battle between McLaren's flying Finn Kimi Raikkonen and championship leader Renault's speedy Spaniard Fernando Alonso is diverting eyes from the world record holding German on his own turf. Kimi aims to keep heat on leader Alonso Raikkonen must finish the German Grand Prix for the first time in five attempts to close the gap on Alonso if he is to keep his own championship hopes alive. The Finn retired from last year's race because of a rear wing failure and this season has been plagued by technical problems which most recently cost him 10 places on the starting grid in each of the last two rounds. Despite those penalties for engine failure, the 25-year-old managed to finish second and third but he will have to increase his total of three race wins if he is to make a significant impression on the 26-point chasm that separates him from Alonso. \"The battle for the championship is still on and I am determined to get a good result and work on closing the gap,\" said the Finn. \"The (car) has good speed and we need to make the most of it this weekend.\" Montoya doing McLaren team mate no favors Raikkonen's car is obviously a fast one this season but he's not the only driver in a McLaren hot seat. Colombia's Juan Pablo Montoya is not to going to make way for his team mate while his own hopes of the title, however small, remain alive. \"I am really looking forward to racing again this weekend in Germany,\" said Montoya, who won at Hockenheim for Williams two years ago and got his first victory for McLaren in Britain two weeks ago. \"I enjoy racing at Hockenheim, I have performed well here and won in the past and I am aiming for a strong result like at Silverstone.\" Consistent Ferdy the man to beat at Hockenheim Championship leader Alonso, meanwhile, has been impressively consistent for Renault so far this season, winning five times and failing to score points only at the Canadian Grand Prix, where he crashed, and in Indianapolis. The Spaniard is setting the pace and the standard this season so, problems aside, Alonso will again be the man to beat at Hockenheim.",

The two drivers are locked in a three-way battle to win the championship. Ferrari's Michael Schumacher and McLaren's Juan Pablo Montoya are the favorites to take the title, with the Spaniard looking to extend his lead in the constructors' championship with a victory in Britain on Sunday. \"It's a great feeling to be in Germany,\" said Alonso, who has won the last three races of his career, including last year's Indianapolis 500, and the 2015 British GP, where he finished second to Hamilton's Sebastian Vettel in pole position. Both drivers will be looking for their first victory of the season in their respective countries, but it's not clear if they'll be able to keep up with each other in terms of speed and pace. Hamilton, meanwhile, is the clear favorite in his home country, although he has yet to make it to the final round of qualifying and will have to wait until the end of next weekend's German GP to claim his first title since 2006. Alonso has already claimed the world title with his McLaren, while the Finn has claimed it for his Mercedes, Ferrari, McLaren and Ferrari. He is also the only driver to have won a World Championship title and has also claimed a world championship in three other races. In his last two races, Hamilton has been the most successful driver of all time, finishing fourth in both the Formula 1 and F1 series. But he is still only the fourth driver in history to reach the top 10 in all three of those categories - and that's only because he's the youngest driver on the grid. That's something that has never been done before in any other sport. It's been a long time since the sport has had a driver who can compete with one another. Last year, he was the fastest driver for McLaren at Silverstone. Now, the Japanese driver has a chance to become the first driver ever to achieve that feat. His team-mates have been on a collision course with Ferrari for most of last season's season - but that doesn't mean they're going to give up on him. They've also been rivals in recent years, as well as in 2014 and 2015, when they were both world champions. And this time around, it seems like they have a clear path to victory."

        "target": "US duo shares Nobel Prize for Economics US researcher Elinor Ostrom is the first woman to win the Nobel prize for economics since it was created in 1968. She will share the prestigious award with US compatriot Oliver Williamson. The jury from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said the Americans' research had shown how \"economic analysis can shed light on most forms of social organization.\" Ostrom, a professor at Indiana University, was honored for her \"analysis of economic governance,\" especially in relation to the management of common property or property under common control. The political scientist's work challenges the widely accepted belief that common property is poorly managed and should be either regulated by central authorities or privatized, it added. She carried out numerous studies showing how self-organization and local-level management work to keep common resources viable. Her studies included both natural resources, such as forests, and artificial structures, for example police forces. Ostrom told Swedish television that she felt \"great surprise and appreciation\" and was \"in shock\" about being the first woman to win the prize. The pros and cons of big firms In his work, co-prizewinner Oliver Williamson, of University of California, Berkeley, examines why large corporations tend to arise - and why they do not - based on the cost and complexity of transactions, according to the Nobel committee. \"He has taught us to regard markets, firms, associations, agencies, and even households from the perspective of their contribution to the resolution of conflict,\" the jury said. Williamson authored 'The Economic Institutions of Capitalism' in 1975, a landmark text of the 'new institutional economics' movement that questioned the idea of firms as simple profit-making machines. Last but not least The Nobel prize for economics is the only Nobel award that was not created by the will of Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel in 1896. It was actually founded by the Swedish central bank, the Sverige Riksbank, to celebrate its tri-centenary a year earlier. It was awarded for the first time in 1969 under its official name: the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel. But although it was the last \"Nobel prize\" to be created and the last to be announced each year, the prize is not a poor relation in monetary terms. Winners of the awards for peace, literature, medicine, physiology, chemistry and physics all receive 10 million Swedish crowns (969,000 euros). A good year for women This year was a record year for women laureates. German-Romanian writer Herta Mueller won the Nobel Prize for Literature. Australian-American Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider of the United States were awarded the prize for medicine. And Ada Yonath of Israel was one of three scientists recognized for her work in chemistry. Americans more or less swept the board this year. Nine of the 11 laureates were US citizens. The most prominent of those was US President Barack Obama, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for his \"extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples.\" jg/AFP/dpa/Reuters Editor: Sam Edmonds",

        "target": "The Sun Sets Slowly Over Brandenburg's Tropical Dream Having suffered many disappointments concerning publically funded projects, the state of Brandenburg hoped a tropical leisure center would offer a ray of hope. Instead the ailing concern is just bringing more gloom. The economically depressed eastern German state of Brandenburg has seen its fair share of bitter experiences when it comes to huge public investment projects since German unification in 1990. Against this background, state authorities were pleased when Malaysian businessman Colin Au built a huge tropical-feeling leisure center in Brandenburg without any subsidies. The center, which opened about a year ago, was to become a symbol of economic success in a region where unemployment still hovers around the 20 percent mark. But the leisure time park, which has already swallowed a little under 100 million euros ($120 million) in private investment, is now going to have to depend on public funding to avoid another economic fiasco in Brandenburg. State authorities in Brandenburg haven't been too successful in their public investment policy in the past 10 years, to put it mildly. A grand plan to build one of the world's most modern chip-producing factories there burst like a bubble in 2003. The much-talked about Brandenburg-Berlin International airport still seems light years away from being built. Line of failures looked to be ended by Au's vision Another beacon of economic hope disappeared in 2002 when a company planning to build gas-filled transport airships went bust despite considerable subsidies. But Au's vision for the abandoned dome which the airship company needed as a hangar offered Brandenburg another chance. In the middle of nowhere, he created what he named his \"Tropical Islands\" wonderland, sporting everything from sandy beaches, lakes and a Laguna to a Caribbean-style village. The economics ministry in Brandenburg was over the moon to see Au originally agreeing to build the facility without any state subsidies. And Au himself had no doubt at the time that he could well do without them. Overestimated visitor numbers tell sorry story But the center's first year in operation tells a different story. Colin Au, who has meanwhile left Brandenburg and transferred matters to a German management company, had expected some 1.5 million visitors to come to Tropical Islands within the first year, but only some 950,000 will have turned up by the end of 2005. It seems highly unlikely that visitor numbers will increase considerably in future, placing a question mark on the viability of the whole centre. But Brandenburg's economics ministry is certain that the park will be in the black as of 2008. To make the place more attractive, it has agreed to shell out 15 million euros in subsidies for yet another reconstruction and marketing effort. After all, the leisure time center has a workforce of about 500 and is thus the biggest employer in an otherwise depressed region marked by a high jobless rate. Tropical center down but not out...not yet \"We hope the money will help make the Tropical Islands resort better known throughout Europe according to the new marketing concept hammered out the management,\" ministry spokesman Steffen Kammrath said. \"This leisure time center is unique and has to be marketed as such. What you have there is a tropical and water world 12 months a year with a lot of attractive offers to spend a whale of a time there.\" Some commentators believe that state subsidies may prolong the center's life span, but will not be able to avoid its demise in the long run. But the idea of also making it more attractive for tourists from all over Europe seems unrealistic to them if the resort's management can't even get enough visitors from home to ensure a profitable operation.",
        "generated_story": "The Sun Sets Slowly Over Brandenburg's Tropical Islands Resort The sun sets slowly over the tropical islands of the German resort of Tropical Island. It's the first time that the sun has set in Germany since the 1990s. The tropical island resort is located in the southern German state of \"Tropical Islands\" and is home to more than 100,000 people, according to a spokesman for the resort's owner, Colin Au. \"The sun is setting slowly,\" said Steffen Kammrath, referring to the country's largest resort, which opened its doors to tourists in 2003. In 2003, it was announced that it would be opening a new resort on the island. Since then, there have been a number of developments, including the construction of a hotel, a restaurant and a sports complex. But the main attraction is the beach, where guests can stay for a night or two, as well as the hotel's restaurants and bars. There is also a spa and spa, but it's not open for business, and the staff are not allowed to use the facilities. They have to be paid for by the government, who is responsible for all the hotels and restaurants that are open to visitors. That's a lot of money to spend on a resort in a small German town, so it makes sense to invest in something that's more environmentally friendly, like a tropical resort. However, that doesn't necessarily mean it will be able to compete with the likes of Laguna, the Caribbean or even the US. So, what do you make of this? What does it mean for you? Well, I think it means that you're going to have a better chance of winning the lottery than if you had to go to jail. You can't win a lottery, right? You don't get to win lottery tickets, you can only win one lottery ticket and you get a discount on your ticket. And, of course, all of that money goes to your hotel and restaurant. What's even more interesting is that there's also the fact that this resort has been open since 1990, with a total of 100 million euros ($120 million) invested in it. This is a very different story from the one that happened in 2005, when the city of Berlin decided to open its own resort at the end of 2005."

        "target": "Bayern's Klinsmann Praises, Hoeness Attacks Hoffenheim The Bundesliga's two top teams don't play until Friday, but the mind games are already underway. Bayern's coach Juergen Klinsmann says Hoffenheim are legitimate contenders, but commercial manager Uli Hoeness disagrees. When the Bundesliga scheduled Bayern's home match against Hoffenheim in the league's unloved Friday night slot, they probably didn't imagine that it would turn out to be the match of the first half of the season. Indeed, few experts or fans thought that Hoffenheim, a first-division debutante located in a southern German village with 3,000 inhabitants, would give mighty Munich a run for its money. But it's the first week of December, and Hoffenheim top the table by three points. They also have a much better goal difference than their second-placed rivals -- and that has drawn praise from Bayern's coach, Juergen Klinsmann. \"I have the highest estimation of Hoffenheim because they've built the squad very ambitiously, rationally and with very good players,\" Klinsmann told DPA news agency. \"They can be proud of that.\" Klinsmann said he thought that the club could establish itself among the top three or four sides in Germany in the years to come and qualify for international competition next season. He also had words of praise for Hoffenheim's software billionaire patron, Dietmar Hopp, whose money has funded the club's ascent. \"There's nothing negative about it,\" Klinsmann said. \"He used to play for the club, is a soccer man through and through and helped the team get on its feet.\" Some fans have criticized Hopp and Hoffenheim for paying inflating salaries and luring talent away from other clubs instead of developing homegrown players. In fact, Hoffenheim's official salary budget is about average for the Bundesliga. Hoeness sounds his horn But while Bayern's coach was praising his opponents to the skies, Munich's commercial manager Uli Hoeness has been trying to play with their heads. On the heels of Bayern's convincing win over Leverkusen last weekend, Hoeness is back to taunting rivals. \"The performance we showed in the second half against Leverkusen will be enough against Hoffenheim,\" Hoeness told the German soccer magazine kicker. Hoeness also dropped a none-too-thinly-veiled hint that Hoffenheim's personnel expenditures were far higher than the officially released figures and scoffed at the idea that strategy would determine the outcome of Friday's match. \"Games are decided by the better players, not by tactics,\" Hoeness said. \"And of course, we've got better players than Hoffenheim.\" But that particular verbal attack may represent some wishful thinking of the manager's part. Hoffenheim coach Ralf Rangnick is one of only two current Bundesliga skippers with a winning record against Munich. Rangnick, whose team cruised past Bielefeld last weekend to keep Bayern three points back, reacted to Hoeness' remarks with a shrug. \"We're preparing for Munich exactly the same way we did against Bielefeld,\" Rangnick said. In any case, soccer fans in Germany know what they'll be doing Friday evening -- finding a bar with cable sports television to watch a top match that no one, before the start of the season, would have considered possible.",
        "generated_story": "Hoffenheim's Commercial Manager Reacts to the First Half of the Bundesliga Season The Bundesliga's first half has been a rollercoaster ride for Bayern Munich's commercial manager, Ralf Rangnick. The club is on the cusp of its first full season in the top flight since the end of last season. On Friday night, the club announced that it had signed a new chief commercial officer, Uli Hoeness, to take over the role of commercial and marketing manager for the second half. \"We are very happy with the progress we have made so far in this season,\" said the sporting director, adding that he was \"very pleased with our progress.\" \"It was a great start to our season and we are looking forward to continuing to build on it,\" he said after the match against Leverkusen at the Allianz Arena in Munich on Friday evening. Hoffenerheim are on course for their first Bundesliga win since December, and they have a good chance of qualifying for next season's Champions League next year. But they will have to wait and see how they fare against the likes of Bayern and Bielefeld, who have been on a tear in recent weeks. They have two games remaining in their Bundesliga schedule and will be looking to get back on track in December when they travel to Cologne to face the Wolfsburg side in a match that could be billed as a \"must-win\" match for both sides. A positive result for Hoffenhheim is the fact that they are back in contention for a spot in Germany's top division, with a goal difference of 1-0. However, it is still a long way off from being a top-four club. Rengnick, however, is confident that his side can make it back into the mix. He said that, \"I think we can do better than we did last year,\" and added that \"we will continue to work hard to make sure that we get the best out of our players.\" The former Bayern man is also optimistic about the future of his club, saying that there is \"a lot of work to be done\" in order to improve the squad's chances of reaching the next level. In a statement released by Bayern's official website, Bundesliga.com, he added: \"The club has a lot to learn from the last few years and I'm very optimistic that this year we will make the most of it. We are going to keep working hard and get better and better at our job.\" Rangingnick also expressed his confidence in his team's ability to win games and improve on their recent form, which has seen them win a number of games in all competitions."

        "target": "Inching towards direct talks on Syria They came to hold talks, but started negotiations with mutual affronts. But if there is one person who might be able to mediate between the intransigent Syrian conflict parties, it's Lakhdar Brahimi. Lakhdar Brahimi, the United Nations special envoy for Syria, seemed very tired on Friday (24.01.2014). He had had a long day, which was actually supposed to be the first real day of negotiations at the Syria Conference in Geneva. \"Good afternoon,\" Brahimi told the assembled international press, before adding, \"or good evening, I don't know.\" At the Palais des Nations in Geneva, he presented the most important result of his attempts to mediate between the Syrian government and the opposition to the more than 250 journalists who had managed to get a coveted place at the press conference: \"Tomorrow we expect and we have agreed that we will meet in the same room.\" What Brahimi is declaring an achievement doesn't sound like much, but considering how irreconcilable the conflict parties have been, even that can be seen as a small success. Separate talks with Brahimi The two delegations were actually due to meet on the first day of negotiations in Geneva in order to agree on a timetable and on the subject and agenda of the talks. But emotions are running too high on both sides. Instead both delegations held separate talks with Lahkkdar Brahimi, both lasting just about an hour each In the morning. The Syrian government delegation had apparently been threatening to leave the conference. At least that is what the deputy foreign minister Faisal Mekdad had implied. \"We are here to start the negotiations,\" he told waiting journalists, \"but we found that the other party did not want to come.\" Before the conference, the opposition had explained that for its delegation, the formation of a transition government would be a central tenet of the negotiations. They emphasized that this topic should be discussed right at the beginning of talks and that the establishment of such a body should be initiated without delay. Social media and good old propaganda The representatives of the Syrian National Coalition that were present in Geneva neatly used all imaginable channels to make their views public. At #Geneva2, they tweeted: \"Forming a transitional body is our major priority,\" leaving people in no doubt that the Syrian National Council would not want to include Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Assad's government, on the other hand, is relying on classic propaganda and loyal state media representatives in Geneva. An impressive entourage of dominant journalists from state-run media outlets is constantly at hand, accompanying the government delegation and making sure they get their point across at press conferences. Lakhdar Brahimi even had a small altercation with a journalist from a Syrian state news agency, who made a political statement under the pretense of asking the UN mediator a question. \"Are there any signs that Saudi Arabia, Turkey and other countries would stop the support of terrorism in Syria?,\" she asked in somewhat shaky English, before Brahimi interrupted her. \"Please, please, there is no point in asking such questions!\" Such exchanges hint at the type of negotiating style the experienced diplomat and mediator Brahimi must have behind the scenes. 'Wish us luck' Lakhdar Brahimi described the preliminary talks that took place in Geneva as encouraging and asked for patience. He said that because the peace conference had come about at the last minute and the delegations had therefore only been appointed very recently, there hadn't been enough time to hold preliminary discussions - a task that the delegations were now catching up on. \"We never expected it to be easy and I'm sure it's not going to be,\" he said. \"But I think the two parties understand what is at stake. Their country is in very, very bad shape.\" He added: \"The huge ambition of this process is to save Syria. Nothing less than that.\" After appealing to the willingness of both parties to negotiate, he simply added: \"So wish us luck!\" Fight for freedom As the official delegations held talks with UN mediator Brahimi in the Palais des Nations, the European headquarters of the United Nations, hundreds of Syrian expatriates who had come from all over Europe protested outside, forming a sea of red, white and black Syrian flags on the Place des Nations. With their presence outside the UN gates they wanted to show that despite all the government propaganda, the Syrian National coalition has a lot of support from the Syrian people. Thirty-two-year-old Ziad Malki came to Geneva from Zurich to show his solidarity. Ziad knows how it feels to be deprived of his freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. In 2005, he was arrested at a demonstration in Damascus and says he was tortured during his time in prison. Now he is fighting for a new Syria from outside the country's borders. Ziad is sure that with Bashar al-Assad and his family, there will be nothing new. \"We don't want this man to be in",
        "generated_story": "UN mediator talks with Syrian National Coalition in Geneva The United Nations envoy for Syria, Lahkkdar Brahimi, has met with representatives of the Syrian opposition, the opposition and the government. The two have been in contact since 24.01.2014, when Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces seized control of a rebel-held area in the western Syrian city of Aleppo. On Friday, Syrian deputy foreign minister Faisal Mekdad, who has been meeting with delegates from around the world, said he was \"encouraged by the fact that the situation in Syria is improving.\" The Syrian government, which controls around 80 percent of Syria's territory, says it is seeking a peaceful resolution to the conflict. \"We are in a position where we are able to work together,\" he said in an interview with the Reuters news agency, adding that he would like to see a ceasefire in place between the regime and opposition. He added that \"we will continue our efforts to ensure that there is a political solution to this conflict, and that we have the support of our partners and partners in this process.\" \"It is important for us to keep our eyes on the ground and to make sure that what we're doing is the right thing for our country,\" said the envoy, Ziad Malki, a member of Turkey's delegation to Geneva. 'We have a lot of work ahead of us' The UN envoy said on Friday that it was working closely with Damascus and its allies to reach an agreement on a cessation of hostilities. It is also working with Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Turkey to try and reach a deal to end the fighting, he added. In the end, it will be up to Damascus to decide whether to allow the ceasefire to continue or whether the truce should be extended to other areas, including the country's eastern Aleppo province, where the rebels seized power in 2005 and 2006. A ceasefire has also been agreed, but it has yet to be agreed on how long it would take for Assad's regime to return to power, according to a spokesman for the UN's Geneva office. Speaking on condition of anonymity, UN chief Ban Ki-moon said his office would continue to monitor the negotiations."

        "target": "Italy's navy to patrol with Libyan ships to curb human trafficking Italy wants to work more closely with Libya to limit the number of sea crossings by migrants and potential asylum seekers. But what are the consequences? Italy's prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni, does not want to wait any longer for EU countries to show solidarity in distributing asylum seekers throughout the bloc. On Thursday he announced in Rome that the Italian navy would be patrolling with Libyan ships just off the Libyan coastline. The aim, Gentiloni says, is to curb human trafficking and bring migrants back from the smugglers' boats to Libya. According to the Italian government's figures, 93,000 migrants have arrived in Italy so far this year. At least 2,000 have drowned in the attempt to cross the Mediterranean - the true figure is unknown. Italy has already threatened to stop allowing boats carrying rescued migrants to dock in Italian ports, or that it may issue migrants with documents that would allow them to travel on to other European countries. Rome has not yet implemented either policy, but the government has made clear that Italy will soon run out of options. The EU Commissioner for Migration Dimitris Avramopoulos acknowledged, again, in Brussels on Thursday that \"Europe continues to face high migratory pressures. And Italy more than (almost) any others.\" The European Commission issued a letter offering more aid and personnel to help manage migration better. Accommodation will soon be full The office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, wrote at the beginning of July that \"Close to 200,000 accommodation places are available for refugees and migrants across [Italy], but are nearly all full.\" The High Commissioner referred particularly to the numbers of people dying when he warned, \"What is happening in front of our eyes in Italy is an unfolding tragedy.\" The United Nations anticipates that another 100,000 migrants will come to Italy via Libya before the end of this year. The number of arrivals is already 20 percent higher than last year; and the number of dead, those who could not be saved, would rise accordingly. According to UN estimates, the Mediterranean remains the \"deadliest\" refugee route in the world. Italian government statistics say that around 600,000 people have arrived in Italian ports since the start of the crisis in 2014. It is unclear how many have since traveled on to Austria, France or Switzerland. Once migrants are registered in Italy and accommodated in camps, they are not held there. If, however, they leave the accommodation without giving notice, they forfeit their claim to subsistence and social services. Most of the migrants are from African countries, and many try to travel on to France, for example. 300 people are currently sleeping on the beach in Ventimiglia, on the French border, hoping to take a bus or train to France. However, the border is being policed by French officials. Migrants who are caught are sent back to Italy. Austria has announced that it too will close its border with Italy if the number of migrants starts to rise. Repatriation and distribution are difficult Last year 120,000 new asylum applications were made in Italy. Around 50 percent of these are rejected. The asylum seekers are then supposed to leave the country. However, the process of people either returning voluntarily or being deported is very slow. The interior ministry has therefore announced that it will reinforce repatriation programs. The redistribution of asylum seekers from Italy, as agreed by the European Union, is well behind target. Two years ago the aim was to resettle 120,000 people. So far, only 24,676 people have been redistributed, the EU Commission said on Thursday: 7,873 from Italy, and 16,803 from Greece. The numbers are low not just because of the reluctance of other EU countries to take the refugees in, but also because of Italian delays in the registration of possible candidates. Asylum seekers from Eritrea are the most likely to fulfill the criteria for redistribution. Around 25,000 are currently living in Italy, but only 10,000 have been registered with the EU Commission and the European Asylum Support Office as possible candidates. Migration Commissioner Avramopoulos has announced that Italy will be given more help and logistical support in this area.",

Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni warned on Thursday that the country was facing a \"serious humanitarian crisis.\" The Italian prime minister, Matteo Salvini, has called on the EU to help Italy cope with the influx of migrants from Libya and other African countries. \"The situation in Italy is a serious humanitarian disaster,\" said Commissioner for Migration Dimitris Avramsopoulos in a speech in Ventimiglia, the capital of Italy's north-eastern region, where the migrant crisis has reached its highest level since the end of the civil war in Libya in 2014. Italy, which is the world's second-largest migrant market after Greece, is among the countries most affected by the crisis, according to a statement from the European Commission. The Commission said it was \"deeply concerned\" about the situation and urged the Italian government to take action to ensure that migrants are not sent back to their countries of origin. A spokesman for the commission said the Commission was working with Italian authorities to find a solution to the migration crisis."

        "target": "Is China seeking regime-change in North Korea? The sudden reduction in aggressive rhetoric and actions by North Korea has led to suggestions that Pyongyang has realized it has pushed its only ally in the region to the brink of severing its friendship. The announcement in Pyongyang on May 13 of the promotion of Jang Jong-nam to \"minister of the People's Armed Forces\" came out of the blue. Until recently, the little-known commander of an army corps in coastal Kangwon Province, Jang has replaced Kim Kyok-sik, a four-star general with a long track record of loyal service to the regime. The reasons for 70-year-old Kim's replacement are not clear - as with most of the political maneuvers in North Korea - but it may have been his loyalty that cost him his position in the politburo. Kim was widely seen as a hawk in the regime and is believed to have been in command of the operation to shell the South Korean island of Yeonpyeongdo in November 2010, an incident that killed four people, destroyed civilians' homes and infrastructure and dramatically worsened the already strained relationship between Pyongyang and Seoul. By sacrificing Kim, analysts believe, North Korea is signaling that it is backing away from the confrontational stance it adopted after the United Nations imposed new sanctions in the wake of the nation's third underground nuclear test in February. And there are other indicators that Pyongyang is seeking to return to the status quo. The North's troops have been permitted to step down from the highest state of preparedness for war that was initially ordered when South Korea and the US began a series of annual military exercises. Missiles withdrawn Similarly, two Musudan intermediate-range missiles that were identified as being on mobile launchers being operated in eastern areas of the country have apparently been ordered to return to base. In late April, there was concern that test-launches of the missiles would be a further escalation by Kim Jong-un's government and a message that it would not bow to international pressure to halt its nuclear and missile development programs. But the analysts believe the tokens of Pyongyang's goodwill have come too late. \"For the North Korean leader, this is a very difficult time,\" Toshimitsu Shigemura, a professor at Tokyo's Waseda University and an authority on North Korean affairs, told DW. \"Timing is very important here and it is possible that China is moving to abandon Kim Jong-un. The atmosphere between the two nations is changing. China may have decided that it is time for a regime-change in the North, they will not permit the collapse of the country because they do not want chaos on their own borders.\" Further evidence that Beijing is slowly tightening the screw on its erstwhile ally comes as more state-run financial institutions sever their links with banks in North Korea. The latest institution to adhere to the government's orders to halt transactions across the border is the Bank of China, one of the four major banks in the country, which announced on May 7 that it would cease dealings with the Foreign Trade Bank of North Korea, which has been identified as being involved in Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs. Contingency plan in place Intelligence sources have passed on to DW information that Beijing has a contingency plan in place for when Kim Jong-un's control over the country crumbles. The reports confirm that China is indeed quietly encouraging regime change and is grooming Kim's brother, Kim Jong-nam to take over his role. At 42, Kim Jong-nam is the oldest son of Kim Jong-il, the dictator who ruled North Korea with an iron fist for 17 years until his sudden death in December 2011. Kim Jong-nam had been expected to assume the leadership after his father's death, but fell from favor spectacularly in 2001 when he was detained with two women and a boy aged 4 at Tokyo's Narita International Airport travelling on a forged Dominican Republic passport. He later admitted that he had wanted to visit Disneyland. He subsequently lived in Macau and Beijing, under the close watch of the Chinese authorities. The reports suggest that after Kim Jong-nam is installed in Pyongyang, his brother will be permitted to go into exile, probably in China. The tactic is not without its pitfalls, however, in part due to the efficiency of the campaign to deify their young leader as the future of the nation. Kim Jong-nam as 'new king' \"China may be dreaming of appointing Kim Jong-nam as the new king - and he is more preferable to the West than Kim Jong Un - but the problem is that he is not known in North Korea,\" said Ken Kato, director of Tokyo-based Human Rights in Asia. \"Many people in Japan know much about the North Korean 'Royal Family,' but this information is hidden in North Korea,\" he said. \"Even residents of Pyongyang know very little about Kim Jong-nam.\" Yet the reports are gaining credence among North Korea-watchers. Jun Okumura, a political analyst with the Eurasia Group, told DW that North Korea withdrawing",
        "generated_story": "North Korea's 'new king' Jang Jong-nam is the new leader of North Korea. The North Korean leader is known as \"the new king\" and has been in power since the end of the Korean War in December 2011. He is also the country's most powerful leader. In his first official address to the nation, Kim Jong Un said that he was \"very proud\" of his country. \"I am very proud of my country,\" he said. But he added that \"it is very important to me that the people of this country have the right to know what is going on in their own country.\" \"We are not going to give up on them,\" Kim said, referring to his father and brother-in-law, who were both born and raised in the North. Kim was born on May 7, 1961, in Pyongyang's Kangwon Province, which is now the capital city of South Korea, and his mother, his grandmother and grandmother were born there. His father was also a prominent figure in South Korean politics for many years, including as a political leader and as an advisor to Kim's father. During his time in office, he also served as the head of state's foreign trade bank, the Foreign Trade Bank (FTRB), and was responsible for setting up the Bank of China and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MBF). In the past, North Koreans have used the bank as their main source of foreign currency, but in recent years they have become increasingly reliant on the foreign exchange market. This has led to a rise in tensions between the two countries. On the other hand, tensions have also risen between Pyongyang and Beijing, where the US and China have imposed sanctions on Pyongyang over its nuclear and missile programs. Last year, Pyongyang announced that it would no longer allow nuclear weapons to be used in its war against the West. It also announced plans to ban the sale of nuclear-capable ballistic missiles to countries such as Japan, China, Russia, South Africa and Taiwan. A recent report by Human Rights in Asia (HRIS) found that Pyongyang was planning to launch a nuclear attack on Seoul in mid-2011. According to HRIS, this would be the first time that a country had conducted nuclear tests on its citizens. However, it is not clear how long this plan will take to achieve its goals. For the time being, experts say, there are no concrete plans for the launch of a new nuclear weapon. So far, however, they don't see any evidence of any imminent threat from Pyongyang. They say it's just a matter of time before the war is over. There is no evidence to support this claim. And the UN has not yet made a decision on whether or not the sanctions will be lifted. That's because the United Nations has yet to rule out the possibility of lifting the ban on nuclear testing. What do you think? What are you hoping for? Do you have any predictions for what the future holds? The UN is still waiting to see what happens in terms of sanctions? How long will it take for Pyongyang to decide whether it will stick to its old ways of dealing with the nuclear threat? It's unclear, for example, whether the regime will continue to use the \"nuclear option\" as its weapon of mass destruction against its own people. If it does decide to do so, then it'll have to wait for a long time."

Smuggling has prompted a visit to Mexico City by US Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly. Prosecutors said the remote town of Las Varas in Chihuahua state was the scene of Wednesday's battle between affiliates of the Ciudad Juarez cartel and a gang from the state of Sinaloa. Police said fighting escalated when patrols arrived. Fourteen people were found dead; 12 others were hospitalized. Grenades, launchers and rifles were found. The mountainous region is used as a corridor for smuggling into the US. El Chapo effect Chihuahua security commissioner Oscar Alberto Aparicio said a Black Hawk helicopter was called in as police chased surviving gang members through the area known for marijuana and opium poppy production. Two police officers had been killed in a \"cowardly\" way in the area a week ago, he said. In a similar incident last Friday, 17 gunmen were killed during a shootout with police on a highway in Sinaloa, Mexico's northwestern state. Sinaloa was the home base of Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, whose extradition to the US in January apparently left gangsters in a struggle for control of criminal syndicates. Homicides have surged in recent months, with the number of persons killed in May put at 2,186, the highest since the collection of such statistics began 20 years ago. Nieto and Kelly to talk In Mexico City Wednesday, President Enrique Pena Nieto's office said he and visiting US Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly had discussed how to rein in organized crime groups. \"Shared responsibility\" must become the focus of transnational efforts, Kelly said. Narcotics smuggling into the US has become a multibillion-dollar (multibillion-euro) business for Mexican drug cartels. Mexico in turn wants the US to throttle demand for narcotics and the supply of illegal weapons to Mexico cartels. Pena Nieto and US President Donald Trump, who wants a border wall, are schedule to meet Friday on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany. ipj/ng (AP, AFP, dpa)",

US President Donald Trump is expected to meet with Mexican security officials in Mexico City on Friday. Mexico's border with Sinaloa has been hit by a series of deadly gun attacks in recent months. On Wednesday, Mexican authorities said they had killed at least 10 people, including the head of the country's drug trafficking network, Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, in a shootout with police in the border town of Las Varas. Mexican officials said the attack was the result of an exchange of gunfire between police and suspected drug traffickers. The Mexican government said on Thursday that the shootout was a \"provocation\" by the cartel, and that it was not a threat to national security. In a statement, the Mexican president said he was \"deeply concerned\" about the situation in his country. \"We are deeply concerned,\" he said, referring to the ongoing drug trade war between the US and Mexico, which has killed more than 1,000 people since the end of last year. Trump has called for an end to violence between drug cartels and US troops in southern Mexico. He has also called on Mexico to step up its fight against organized crime. Last Friday, US Secretary of State John Kerry traveled to Mexico for a meeting with the president of Mexico and his Mexican counterpart, Oscar Alberto Aparicio, to discuss a possible military solution for the drug war. At the same time, he met with top US officials from the two countries' security forces, as well as the heads of state and the interior ministers of their respective states. During the meeting, Trump said that he would be \"very happy\" to see the new US president."

The case has highlighted the army's problems with equipment and morale. The men sentenced to death on Wednesday were part of the special forces division ordered in August to retake three towns in Borno state, which had been taken over by the Islamist Boko Haram insurgents. Their lawyer, Femi Falana, said the 54 men were sentenced to death by firing squad and five had been acquitted. They were accused of conspiring to commit mutiny against the authorities of the 7th Division of the Nigerian army, which is on the frontline. The trial began on October 15 and was conducted behind closed doors. It is subject to approval by top military officials, but there has so far been no indication that senior officers oppose the court martial. They were not available for comment afterwards. There was a similar case in Nigeria in September, when 12 soldiers were sentenced to death for mutiny after firing on their commanding officer in the northeast city of Maiduguri. The 7th Division, based in Maiduguri, leads the offensive but there are numerous reports of troops refusing to deploy. Soldiers have regularly complained that they lack weapons, food, and other basic supplies to fight the Islamists, who are reported to have tanks, rocket-propelled-grenade launchers, and other heavy weaponry. Boko Haram has taken a number of towns and declared an Islamic caliphate in the region near the border with Cameroon. The Nigerian military has in recent weeks claimed to have made progress in recapturing lost territory. Thousands of people have been killed since the Islamist uprising began five years ago.

Police said they had arrested a number of suspected Islamists, some of whom are suspected of being members of the sect. A military spokesman said the military had detained at least 30 suspected members, including the leader of a group known as the \"Boko Haram\" group. On Wednesday, a military court in Maiduguri declared a state of emergency and ordered the release of all suspected terrorists and their families. \"We will continue our fight against this terrorist organization,\" the spokesman, Femi Falana, said in a statement. He added that the army would continue to fight alongside the state government in its efforts to contain the extremist group's activities. According to the Nigerian military, the Islamists are believed to be responsible for more than 100,000 deaths in Nigeria since the beginning of this year, according to military officials. In August, they claimed to have killed over 1,500 people and kidnapped hundreds more. But the government has denied the claim, saying the allegations are \"baseless.\" The army has said it will carry out an internal investigation into the alleged kidnapping of civilians and the deaths of scores of soldiers and civilians.

After successfully weathering the Great Recession, Commerzbank's board of directors appears to want to signal a continuation in its growth trend with Martin Zielke's appointment as the new CEO as of May 1. Outgoing head Martin Blessing announced last year he would not renew his contract. Zielke had previously been put in charge of implementing reforms in the company's private banking sector following the recession. His restructuring measures attracted 800,000 new customers to the bank and changed the image of the 146-year-old financial institution. The 53-year-old has an illustrious career across several German financial institutions to look back on, having started at the teller of a local branch in 1983. Zielke's crowning achievement The beleaguered German financial institution recorded a profit of more than a billion euros (more than $1.1 billion) last year. It was the first time in five years that Commerzbank had made such profitable gains, which it said would translate into paid dividends for shareholders. A good portion of the yields were achieved by a restructuring and expansion drive of Commerzbank's private banking arm under Zielke's leadership. However, some of that money will go to the German government, as it had to step in and rescue the bank in 2009 to the tune of 18 billion euros ($25 billion at the time) by chiefly acquiring more than 15 percent of the shares, effectively nationalizing part of Commerzbank's operations. ss/jlw (dpa, Reuters)",

In a document on combating AIDS, the Commission said that as of 2007, around 2.2 million people carried the virus in the EU and nearby countries, an increase of 700,000 from 2001. According to Commission figures, around 730,000 of these live within the EU's 27 member states. France, Italy, Spain and Portugal have relatively high infection rates - ranging from 0.4 percent to 0.5 percent. In the Baltic country of Estonia, the infection rate stands at around 1.3 percent. In neighboring Ukraine, around 1.6 percent of the population has been diagnosed with HIV, while in Russia around 1.1 percent are HIV positive. The Commission warned that now was not the time for Europe to drop its guard on preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS, adding that in some neighboring countries the number of people carrying the virus had doubled. EU Health Commissioner Androulla Vassiliou said political momentum in the fight against HIV/AIDS needed to be maintained, adding that people must \"take responsibility for themselves and their partners by talking about and practicing safe sex and going for HIV testing.\" A cure for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has yet to be found more than a quarter century after it was brought to public attention. However, efficient treatments exist to slow the evolution of the virus. dfm/AFP Editor: Chuck Penfold",

The link between the two is so strong that many Federweisser wines have a recipe for the onion cake on their labels. Here's a recipe for it: Ingredients: 1 packet yeast, active dry 1 teaspoon sugar 1 1/2 teaspoon salt 3 cups unbleached flour 1 tablespoon shortening 1 cup water (49 to 54 C / 120 to 130 F) 6 slices bacon -- diced 2 medium onions -- sliced 1/4 teaspoon cumin 1/2 teaspoon salt Pepper 1 egg yolk 1 cup sour cream Mix the yeast with the sugar, a teaspoon of salt and half a cup of flour. Blend in the shortening and warm water, then beat for two minutes. Add enough flour to make a soft dough, and then knead the dough until smooth and elastic, about five minutes. Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, then cover it and let it rise in a warm place for 30 minutes. Pat the dough into a lightly greased 12-inch pizza pan or onto a lightly greased baking sheet. Press up the edges to make a slight rim. Fry the bacon until crisp and drain it on absorbent paper. Add onions to the bacon grease, and cook slowly until tender, but not brown. Sprinkle the onions, bacon, cumin, half a teaspoon of salt and pepper over the dough. Bake the cake at 204 C (400 F) for 20 minutes. Blend the egg yolk and sour cream and pour the mixture over the Zwiebelkuchen. Bake it for another 10 to 15 minutes, until the cake is golden brown and the sour cream has set.

There's a lot to like about this recipe, and I think that's one of the reasons why I like it so much more than I did last year. The recipe is very easy to make and tastes very good.

        "target": "Bayern blast five as Schalke draw Bayern Munich stamped their authority over the Bundesliga on Saturday, with a ruthless 5-0 drubbing of Hannover at home. Meanwhile, second-placed Schalke and third-placed Frankfurt were forced to share the points. With many critics saying Bayern might as well be given the giant Bundesliga dish already, perhaps the struggle for second is shaping up to be the more compelling battle. But Saturday afternoon's clash between second-placed Schalke and third-placed Frankfurt did not take a decisive turn, with the game ending in a 1-1 draw. Schalke drew first blood in the 11th minute, when Frankfurt's Stefan Aigner was dispossessed in midfield, and Lewis Holtby released Klaas-Jan Huntelaar in front of goal - the Dutchman's first in the Bundesliga since September. But the hapless Aigner waited just over 100 seconds to make amends for his error, when the Royal Blues allowed him a free header that left goalkeeper Lars Unnerstall with no chance. But neither side could make inroads in the second half, which allowed Dortmund to leap-frog both sides and claim second place. Bayern take command Meanwhile the imperious Bayern Munich dispelled any talk of winter form-dip - following last week's draw to Nuremberg - with a brutally efficient 5-0 win at home to Hannover. The Bavarians stormed to a 3-0 lead in just 37 minutes, celebrating a nifty overhead kick for star signing Javi Martinez in the fourth minute. Toni Kroos and Franck Ribery scored the next two against a Hannover side that were torn open at will. The overhead kick was the first for the 40-million-euro ($52-million) signing Martinez, and in the second half new defender Dante also opened his account with a straightforward header from a Kroos free-kick. The festival of football continued just four minutes later, when Mario Gomez - making first Bundesliga appearance of the season - slammed the ball into the net from a tight angle just 30 seconds after replacing Mario Mandzukic. Dortmund win The champions Dortmund, meanwhile, are still nine points behind Bayern after beating Mainz 2-1 away. It was a potentially tricky fixture in the town where J\u00fcrgen Klopp began his coaching career, and Mainz showed their brilliance in the fourth minute, when Elkin Soto knocked a dream ball into the path of Marco Caligiuri, whose volley fairly screamed into the top right corner. Dortmund's own star-Marco - national team player Marco Reus - leveled the scores just eight minutes later. Reus worked himself some room at the outer edge of the penalty area, and slotted a beautiful 17-meter effort into the far corner. And Dortmund's second goal, just before half-time, was equally aesthetic - a vertical ball bisected the Mainz defense perfectly down the middle, where Polish predator Robert Lewandowski got his eighth league goal of the season with a deft lob over the onrushing Christian Wetklo in goal. Allofs' homecoming Bremen's 1-1 draw at Wolfsburg had a special frisson of its own, as Wolfsburg's newly-minted sporting director Klaus Allofs faced the club he had served as general manager for over a decade. And there was some gesticulating from the Bremen bench in the general direction of the Wolfsburg management when the guests took the lead in the 35th minute. Just seconds after Wolfsburg missed several chances, Marko Arnautovic was left free in the box after Eljero Elia found space on the left and cut the ball back for the Austrian to finish. But Wolfsburg got their own back in the second half. In the 62th minute, Bremen were reduced to ten men when Lukas Schmitz was given second yellow card for a hard tackle on Adelino Vieirinha. Just two minutes later, Bas Dost took advantage of their guests' disorgnaization and smashed the ball into the goal after neat piece of play from Vieirinha. Dirty derby The Franconian derby between Greuther F\u00fcrth and Nuremberg was a cagey affair that ended in a frustrating 0-0 draw. The first half was marked mainly by a straight red card for Nuremberg's Markus Feulner after an ugly, flying lunge on Stephan F\u00fcrstner. But the home side's numerical advantage was short-lived - Sercan Sararer was also sent for an early ice bath after his high elbow on Javier Pinola was adjudged worthy of a second yellow card in the 61st minute. But the aggression in the tackles was not matched by ruthlessness in front of goal, and neither side could eke out any clear chances.",
        "generated_story": "Bayern Munich vs. Wolfsburg Preview: The Bavarians look to bounce back from a 2-1 defeat at Nuremberg on Saturday with a trip to Mainz to take on the Bundesliga's most expensive club. The visitors are coming off a 1-0 win over Hannover in the first round of the Champions League, and will be hoping for a bounce-back performance in their return to the top flight next week. Bayern Munich, meanwhile, are looking to get back on track after a two-game winless streak. They have a tough task ahead of them, as they travel to Cologne on Sunday to face the German side. Last season's Bundesliga champions, Bayern, have been on a tear in recent weeks, losing their last three games in all competitions. On Saturday, however, they will have to wait until the last minute to see if they can pull off their first win since the end of last season. That would be a big step up from last year, when they lost to Schalke, where they won the league by a mere 0.5 points. \"We are not going to give up,\" Bayern coach J\u00fcrgen Klopp said after the match, adding that he was \"very happy\" with the way his side performed in front of their home fans. He also pointed out that his players had a lot of work to do in order to make up for their lack of goalscoring ability. In addition, he said, the club's goalkeepers had been \"a lot better than they were last time out.\" The Dutchman, who has been linked with Bayern for some time, is expected to be fit for the return trip, although he has yet to confirm whether he will play at all this season, according to sporting director Markus Feulner. Facing a Bayern side that are struggling to find consistency in attack, Dortmund are in a difficult position, with only two top-flight matches remaining in September and three more games to go before the break. For the visitors, it's a chance to build on their recent form, which has seen them reach the quarter-finals in Germany and qualify for next year's World Cup in Russia. It's also an opportunity to test Klopp's patience with his squad, having already lost two of its last four matches in Europe, including last month's Europa League group stage final against Ajax Amsterdam. But the coach is also keen to keep his eye on his own players, saying that they have plenty of time to improve their game. After all, there are only a handful of young players who can contribute to his team's success. And that's not to say that Bayern will not be satisfied with just one of those young talents. Frank Lampard's side have already made a few changes to their starting lineup, but they are still far from ready to start the new season on top of a strong squad that has already been boosted by the arrival of Mario Mandzukic and the signing of Javi Martinez from Borussia Dortmund."

        "target": "In Argentina, red wine exports to balance Porsche imports About 100 Porsches are imported to Argentina each year. Now the country wants to keep a positive trade balance by having the value of the imported luxury cars matched by red wine exports. Porsche is currently enjoying record profits after a two-year downturn, but the export-reliant company has hit a pothole in Argentina. Buenos Aires-based Porsche importer Grupo Pulenta has signed an agreement obligating it to export several hundred bottles of red wine for each car it imports, the Argentine government announced Wednesday. Grupo Pulenta declined to comment when contacted by Deutsche Welle. Job creation During the past year, Argentina has held thousands of high-end vehicles in customs until companies agreed to export goods valued at the same amount. Most of those vehicles came from Germany. According to a spokeswoman for the Argentine embassy in Berlin, the country has been trying to safeguard domestic employment with a positive trade balance. \"Our government has negotiated with automakers to balance their imports of cars with an equivalent amount of exports,\" she told Deutsche Welle in a statement. \"Since March 2010 we have been working with the automakers and importers in order to increase local integration and reduce the trade deficit in this sector.\" Small market A Porsche spokesman said the company sells just short of 100 vehicles into Argentina each year. That compares to more than 40,000 sold worldwide during five months in 2010. \"For Porsche, Argentina is a rather small market,\" the spokesman told Deutsche Welle. \"Our importer, the Pulenta Group, also deals in wine. They have their own vineyards and export that wine. It has nothing to do with Porsche - we just have an import contract with them, and it seems they've found an individual solution with the Argentine government.\" Domestic production Volkswagen, which has an Argentine subsidiary producing the new \"Amarok\" pickup truck and transmissions, has thus far avoided mandatory exports. The company had reported an export surplus of 384 million euros ($545 million) for this year. Porsche's holding company owns 32.2 percent of Volkswagen, and the Porsche brand is intended to become integrated into Volkswagen's lineup. Daimler and BMW also have subsidiaries in Argentina. While Daimler produces its \"Sprinter\" there, BMW only imports to the country. According to the Argentine embassy in Berlin, the country has recently sought more domestic production by foreign car companies. Author: Gerhard Schneibel (dpa) Editor: John Blau",
        "generated_story": "Buenos Aires-based Porsche to balance its exports with red wine Argentina's largest car importer, Grupo Pulenta, has announced plans to double its wine exports to Argentina in 2010. The move is part of an effort by the company to reduce its dependence on German carmakers Volkswagen and BMW. In a statement on Wednesday, the carmaker said it would double the amount of wine it imports from Argentina, to 384 million euros ($545 million) from Germany. \"We are going to continue to increase our wine imports,\" the statement said, adding that the decision was made in response to growing demand in Argentina from German importers such as BMW, Daimler, BMW and Mercedes-Benz. Argentina is one of the world's top wine exporters, with the country's second-largest wine market, behind Germany's Volkswagen, accounting for more than half of all wine sales in the U.S. Last year, Porsche announced that it was doubling its production of Amarok wine, which is used in cars, trucks and sport utility vehicles. It said the move was in line with its strategy of reducing its reliance on imports of German-made cars and SUVs. However, it did not say how much it planned to spend on the new wine.

The controversial legislation prompted mass pro-democracy protesters in the European country. \"The rule of law is one of the EU's fundamental values. Making sure the rule of law is preserved throughout the Union is a key part of the European Commission's responsibilities,\" Timmermans wrote on his official Facebook page.

        "target": "Beekeepers battle mites with technology Bees are useful, hard-working and vital for our ecosystem. Aside from making honey, bees pollinate most of our food crops. But summertime is also the season for one of the biggest threats to honey bees \u2013 the varroa mite. Dete Papendieck puts on a white veiled protective hat and takes out a metal jug with a beak-shaped spout. He sets fire to the container's contents \u2013 formic acid \u2013 and starts directing the smoke that is wafting at the beehives lined up in front of him in his garden on the outskirts of Bonn. The acid doesn't harm the bees, but it does kill the varroa mites, he says. And July, after most of the honey has been harvested, is the best time to treat his hives. The one millimeter-large varroa mite is a parasite that infests beehives and lays its eggs in the honeycombs, alongside the bees' larvae. \"It feeds on the bees' and the bee brood's blood, the so-called haemolymph,\" Papendieck explains. A third of bees killed in Germany Papendieck is an apiarist at the Bee Research Institute at the University of Bonn and he knows that the threat of mites is serious. If left untreated, varroa-infested colonies rarely survive a winter. In 2010, German beekeepers lost about 200,000 hives to the mite \u2013 one third of Germany's total bee population. And it is not just the honey and beeswax production that are affected by the mite. Many of our food crops depend on bees: Some 80 percent of all agricultural plants and 90 percent of fruit trees in Europe are pollinated by Apis mellifera, the European honeybee. Varroa introduced from Asia Had Dete Papendieck been a beekeeper forty years ago he would not have had to worry about mites. He says the varroa mite that was originally native to Asia, was introduced to Europe in the 1970s. \"It happened during a research project in which it was attempted to crossbreed the European honeybee with the Asian honeybee. The researchers were exchanging bee colonies between Europe and India, and that is how the mites came to Germany,\" Papendieck said. Unlike Asian bee species, the European honeybee cannot fight off the varoa mite by itself. According to Papendieck, bees easily transmit the mite to other beekeepers' hives in what apiarists call robbery. \"It happens when certain colonies are being robbed by other bees. Large numbers of bees from different colonies attack weak hives and steal their stocks. At the same time, parasites and diseases are exchanged\", he says. Researchers have been trying to breed varroa-resistant mites, but so far they haven't had much success. High-tech tools help fight the mite Klaus Maresch is also worried about his bees. He is an organic beekeeper from Bonn and he has been passionate about bees since he was a little boy. \"They are part of my family. When I open my hives and smell the honey and hear the buzzing of the bees it's like being in another world,\" he told Deutsche Welle. In addition to using formic acid to fight the mite, Klaus Maresch employs a high-tech tool \u2013 a special cylindrical scale that helps him determine when it is best to start the varroa treatment. \"Every day this hive scale sends data about the colonies to our server. The data, such as the temperature in the hive and the amounts of nectar and pollen collected, help me to find a good day to treat varroa,\" Maresch says. Maresch also makes the data about the activities in his hives available to fellow beekeepers who can treat their colonies accordingly. A driver's license for beekeepers? But it is not the mite that angers Maresch most. \"That's nature,\" he says, \"I feel angry about beekeepers who don't fight varroa. If the bees of neighboring beekeepers are infested, I also have a problem.\" The existing German pest regulation obliges beekeepers to treat their bees against varroa, but there are no strict controls. The majority of Germany's more-than-80,000 beekeepers are amateurs who keep between one and 20 colonies. This makes it difficult to impose and survey certain quality standards. Maresch, who sees himself as a kind of 'bee activist', would like to see the government introduce stricter rules. \"There should be a law that obliges every new beekeeper to learn about beekeeping before they are allowed to keep bees. They should get an education and there should be something like a driver's license for beekeepers,\" he says. In the mean time, Europe's bees are going to have to",
        "generated_story": "German beekeeper fights varroa mite with high-tech hive scale A beekeeping expert in Germany has successfully fought a pest that has been spreading throughout the country. Dete Papendieck, a professor at the University of Bonn's Bee Research Institute (BRI), says the pest is spreading across Europe and Asia. \"It's spreading all over the world,\" he told Deutsche Welle in an interview published in July. The pest, which is known as Apis mellifera, is spread across the globe by bees and other pollinators. In Germany, it's spread through Europe, Asia, Africa, the Middle East and the Americas, and is even spreading into the European Union, he said. But in India, where it has spread as far as India and China, there is no sign of it spreading to other parts of the continent. According to the BRI's Klaus Maresch, one of Germany's leading experts in the field of honey bees, \"the pest spreads through the whole of Europe,\" adding that \"it spreads throughout Asia and Africa.\" The insect is also spread throughout Europe by spreading its venom through honeybees, making them more susceptible to attacks from the mites. It's also spreading through other species, such as the honeybee, as well as in other European countries. A recent study by the German bee research institute showed that bees are more likely to be infected with the insect than by other insects. This is due to a lack of awareness among beekeepers about the danger of spreading the disease, according to Dr. Wolfgang M\u00fcller, who heads the institute's research team. He said that the problem is that it can spread quickly and easily, but that he doesn't know how long it will take for it to spread and spread. So, in order to protect against the spread of this pest and to reduce the risk of infection, researchers have developed a new method of fighting it. They call it the \"vroal\" method, or \"mite,\" as it is commonly called in Asia-Pacific. M\u00fcllers said the technique is aimed at reducing the amount of time it takes for the larvae to reach the hive. However, this method has not been widely used in Europe because of its high cost and high number of pests. Mareck said he believes that this technique could be used to fight other pests that have spread to Europe in recent years."

        "target": "EU Mulls Warning Labels to Curb Alcohol Abuse While still targeting smoking, European Union's public health commissioner is considering adding alcohol to the list of vices the bloc should clamp down on. In a report commissioned by the European Commission, the London Institute for Alcohol Studies recommended raising the legal age to buy alcohol to 18 (in some countries, such as Germany, 16-year-olds can buy beer), lowering the permitted blood alcohol level while driving to 0.5, banning alcohol advertising on TV and in movies as well as adding warning labels to bottles as ways of preventing alcohol abuse across the bloc. Which of the methods EU Health Commissioner Markos Kyprianou actually introduces will be announced \"sometime in the autumn,\" according to a spokesperson. Other options include a 10 percent increase in the price of alcohol. Kyprianou has, however, hinted that he favors warning labels -- similar to those that appear on packs of cigarettes -- that make the dangers of alcohol clear. \"Drinking harms your unborn baby\" on bottles? Brewers and wine makers across Europe, however, have come out against placing \"Drinking Kills\" or other labels on bottles of beer. \"Warning labels are the completely wrong way to go,\" Peter Hahn, head of the German Brewers Association told Germany's Express newspaper. \"The do not deter people who have lost a sense of how much to drink and unsettle the people who enjoy a beer after work.\" Industry groups also opposed implementing EU-wide guidelines in countries with traditionally different ways of approaching drinking and drinking problems. \"Policies that do not consider cultural and regional differences, will fail to deal with the social problems, while at the same time generate a rising level of political objections,\" said Rodolphe de Looz-Corswarem of Brewers of Europe. Keeping social vices separate Green party EU parliamentarian Hiltrud Breyer meanwhile called on the alcohol industry to stop \"saber rattling\" before it sees the a final version of the EU's strategy to prevent alcohol abuse. German Consumer Affairs Minister Horst Seehofer said he would wait to see what Kyprianou's actual suggestions are before commenting. Other German politicians, however, were more willing to voice the opposition to putting a sip of wine on the same footing with a puff of a cigarette. \"People should not expect that a skull and crossbones end up on every bottle of beer and wine,\" German EU representative Karl-Heinz Florenz told Der Tagesspiegel newspaper, adding that when it comes to alcohol, each member state should be responsible for how it deals with alcohol abuse. The harm of \"passive drinking\" While cigarettes are a health risk from the first puff, moderate drinking can actually be healthy and there is no danger from \"passive drinking,\" Peter Liese, a German EU representative, told the paper. The commission's report disagreed with Liese's conclusion, saying alcohol abuse had a major role in as many as 200,000 deaths in Europe due to car accidents and disease and played a role in some 60,000 underweight births. The report also estimated the effects of alcohol abuse of costing the EU 125 billion euros ($161 billion) in 2003. Some 25 percent of men and 10 percent of women in Europe drink what the EU considers to be more than healthy amounts of alcohol and between 3 percent and 5 percent are suffering from alcoholism, according to EU statistics.",
        "generated_story": "EU warns against 'passive drinking' on bottles of beer The European Commission has warned against the use of alcohol on beer bottles. The EU's consumer affairs commissioner, Peter Liese, warned that the practice could lead to \"harmful consequences\" for consumers. According to a report by the German Brewers Association (BBA), the European Union's Consumer Affairs Commissioner, Markos Kyprianou, the problem is that alcohol can be harmful to people's health and well-being. In a letter to members of the Commission, Hahn said the EU should take a closer look at the issue. \"We have to make sure that there are no harmful effects on the health of people who drink alcohol,\" he wrote, adding that he would like to see an end to the ban on alcohol in the country's beer market. But, he added, \"we need to be careful that we don't over-promise and under-deliver.\" The Commission's report, which is due out in mid-December, said that \"the EU has made clear that it will not allow alcohol to enter the market in any way that is detrimental to human health.\" \"It is not the first time that people have been drinking alcohol. It is the second time in a very long time, and it has been the case for many, many years,\" the report said. Germany's Health Commissioner Karl-Heinz Florenz said in an interview with German daily Der Tagesspiegel in 2003 that beer should not be consumed on a regular basis. He also pointed out that, for example, beer can still be sold in supermarkets in Germany for up to 125 euros (125.6 billion euros) a year. However, it is still illegal to sell beer on an individual basis, according to German media reports."

        "target": "German Minister Urges Peace in Georgia's Separatist Regions German Foreign Minister Steinmeier has called for an end to the \"spiral of violence\" between the Georgian government in Tbilisi and its Russian-backed rebel regions and presented a three-stage plan to break the deadlock. Steinmeier issued the plea as he began a tour of the region to sponsor a new peace plan aimed at calming the simmering tensions over Georgia's separatist regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. \"This is my appeal to break out of the spiral of violence. A lack of dialogue is not an option for the future,\" he said after meeting with his Georgian counterpart Eka Tkeshelashvili. Steinmeier, who chairs the so-called Group of Friends of the United Nations' Secretary on Georgia, is proposing a three-phase peace plan based on a mutual declaration of non-violence and repatriation of about 25,000 ethnic Georgians expelled from Abkhazia in the 1990s. Negotiations over the status of the two rebel regions, which have enjoyed de facto autonomy since the end of a civil war in 1994, was reserved for the final phase of negotiations. Tkeshelashvili said, \"The plan has great potential for success,\" but added that the most difficult thing would be to convince Russia. Peace talks remain distant The threat of armed conflict in the region last month has given urgency to international pressure for renewed peace talks, but Tbilisi, Moscow and the Russian-backed regions remain far apart on the basic premises for restarting peace talks. Officials in Tbilisi oppose a treaty on the non-use of force without guarantees on the return of refugees and the withdrawal of Russian peacekeeping forces base in the region. Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was skeptical of peace efforts Thursday. \"Signing of a treaty on the return of Georgian refugees to Abkhazia is unreal now, because such a return requires a calm situation,\" Lavrov was quoted as saying by news agency RIA-Novosti. \"We think that signing a treaty on the non-use of force without any preconditions is an absolutely unavoidable first step,\" he added. Experts see little hope for Steinmeier's plan Analysts do not expect anything conclusive from Steinmeier's trip, pointing to intransigence on the part of the Abkhaz President Sergei Bagapsh, who said he would \"not consider the plan.\" \"We are not going to discuss Abkhazia's status with anyone. We are building an independent, democratic state,\" Bagapsh was quoted by Georgian news agencies as saying. Speaking to journalists ahead of the meetings Thursday, Steinmeier admitted: \"We don't have any illusions about simple answers, but we cannot stand by without acting on this conflict. That would be irresponsible.\" From Tbilisi, the German minister is to travel to the Black Sea city of Batumi for talks with Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili and then to Abkhazia on Friday before ending his three-day tour in Moscow. Most citizens of the breakaway republics have been issued Russian passports and over 2,500 Russian peacekeeping troops patrol the region under a UN ceasefire agreement. In opposition to Georgia's bid to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Russia moved to strengthen diplomatic ties with the breakaway regions sharply aggravating tensions with the Georgian leadership in recent months.",
        "generated_story": "Steinmeier to Discuss New Peace Plan for Georgia The German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier will discuss a new peace plan between Georgia and Russia in Tbilisi on Friday. The two former Soviet republics are part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), which is meant to strengthen ties between Russia and Georgia. On Thursday, the UN Security Council adopted a resolution calling for an end to the conflict in South Ossetia and Abkhazia, which began in 1990 with the overthrow of Soviet-backed President Mikhail Saakashvili. In a statement released by the group's press office, it said that the new plan would be based on a \"new peace process\" between the two countries. \"We are going to work together to find a solution to this conflict,\" the statement said, adding that it was \"the right of all Georgians to live in peace and stability in their own country.\" The statement came a day after Russian President Sergei Bagapsh announced that he would step down from his post as foreign minister of Georgia in the wake of a failed coup attempt in 1994. According to a report by RIA-Novosti news agency, he was replaced by his deputy, Eka Tkeshelashovili, who is a former deputy prime minister in Georgia's former communist regime. He is also expected to take up the post of defense minister for the region, where he has been in office since 1990. A new \"peace plan\" is being drafted by Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation (GFRO) to deal with a number of issues, including a possible return of Russian troops to Georgia, as well as the possibility of an extension of sanctions against the country's oil and gas industry. It is not yet clear whether the plan will be implemented, however, if it will lead to an increase in Russian military involvement in fighting the separatists. Russia has long been interested in a return to its role as guarantor of territorial integrity, but it has so far been unable to do so, according to Russian state-run news agencies. Moscow has also expressed concern about the potential for conflict between Russian and Georgian troops and whether it could be used as a bargaining chip in an arms race with Russia. Russian officials have said they are ready to discuss the issue with Georgian President Petro Poroshenko and his government."

        "target": "Maldives revokes state of emergency citing improved security situation The president of the Maldives has lifted a state of emergency following an outcry from the international community. The government says the measures are no longer necessary because the security threat has subsided. The government said Tuesday it had rescinded the emergency measures \"with immediate effect\" and that \"all fundamental rights that were suspended have been restored.\" President Yameen Abdul Gayoom declared the state of emergency one week ago after the discovery of a homemade bomb and a stash of weapons near his official residence. The finding followed an explosion on Gayoom's speedboat in September - an incident the government labeled an assassination attempt. The president was not hurt in the blast, but his wife, an aide and a bodyguard were injured. The emergency regulations, intended to be in place for 30 days, gave security forces wide-ranging search and arrest powers, and suspended citizens' basic rights. They drew criticism from former colonial power Britain as well as the United States, the European Union and neighboring Sri Lanka. Reading out a presidential decree revoking the emergency, Attorney General Mohamed Anil said there was no longer a threat to the Indian Ocean atoll nation. He said investigations into the September blast and the recovery of weapons had made good progress. The foreign ministry said a number of people had been arrested. Lawmakers also used the security regulations to fast-track the impeachment of Vice President Ahmed Adeeb, who stands accused of plotting the alleged attempts on the president's life. Impact on tourism Attorney General Anil said pressure from the international community, as well as \"the possible adverse impact on Maldives tourism and the economy,\" had also played a role in ending the state of emergency. Foreign tourists visiting the tropical nation, known for its luxury tourist resorts, palm-fringed beaches and coral reefs, contribute close to a third of the country's gross domestic product. The Maldives has had a rocky road to democracy since holding its first multiparty election in 2008. The country's first democratically elected leader, current opposition chief Mohamed Nasheed, was forced to step down in 2012 after a mutiny by security forces. In March, he was jailed for 13 years on terrorism charges in a trial the United Nations said was illegal. President Gayoom is under intense international pressure to release him. Nasheed's opposition Maldivian Democratic Party welcomed Tuesday's announcement. But said declaring the state of emergency in the first place was a political move designed to stop a rally planned for last week calling for Nasheed's freedom. \"It appears that Yameen is willing to make up threats about the nation's security in order to settle political scores,\" the party said in a statement, referring to the president. nm/kms (AP, AF, Reuters, dpa)",

Heidel said this week that the club was still trying to convince the German to stay. \"At the moment we're still ready to talk,\" Heidel told this week's edition of football magazine Kicker, albeit stressing that time was of the essence. \"But we must and we will plan for the new season.\" In a separate newspaper interview Heidel was even more explicit, saying the club was not in a position to wait until summer for Meyer to make up his mind. Speaking to Sport Bild magazine, meanwhile, Heidel sought to focus on Meyer's more important role at Schalke, his regular game time, arguing it might be in the youngster's best interests to stay at a club that needs him every week. \"[Coach] Domenico Tedesco has formed the team around him in such a way that there is now an ideal spot for Max. That was not always the case,\" Heidel said. \"He needs to ask himself, putting the financial aspect to one side: 'Will I get such a position at a different club?' Because one thing's clear: Max wants to play, and he needs to play.\" Schalke are already preparing for the departure of one of German football's brightest young stars, midfield all-rounder Leon Goretzka will join Bayern Munich on a free transfer at the season's end.

        "generated_story": "Schalke XI's Max Meyer: 'We're still ready to talk' About the future of midfielder Leon Goretzka, sporting director Christian Heidel told German news agency dpa. \"We still have a long way to go before we can decide whether or not we're going to take a decision on the matter at the end of the season,\" he said. Meyer, who has been linked with a move to Bayern Munich for the past two seasons, said he was \"still ready\" to discuss his future with the club. He also said that he would like to see a return to the Bundesliga, where he had been a member of Bayern's squad since the summer of 2015. The German media reported that Meyer was set to sign a new contract in February. German football magazine Sport Bild reported on Wednesday that the Schalkes XI had agreed to a \u20ac5.5 million ($6.7 million) loan deal with German club Bayern on February 15, which will see the midfielder join his former club, Borussia Dortmund, for a fee of around $6 million (7.9 million euros). \"The club is still willing to consider the possibility of extending the contract,\" Meyer said in an interview published in the German daily \"Sport Bild.\" \"It's not a question of whether we'll be able to extend the deal, but we have to think about it.\" Meyer's future is unclear, however, according to sports magazine Kicker. Bundesliga: \"I don't think it's the right time to say anything about the situation at this point,\" the sports agency said, adding that it was still \"very early days\" for Meyer to make an official announcement about a possible move away from Germany's top-flight side. Bayern, meanwhile, have already announced that they will not make any further changes to their squad after the transfer window closes on January 12. Coach Domenico Tedesco said on Tuesday that his side would look to strengthen their midfield, particularly in midfield. However, he did not rule out the idea of bringing in a transfer fee, saying that \"it's something that's been discussed for quite some time now.\" The move would have been the first step towards a potential return of Meyer after he spent the last three seasons at Bayern. But it would be a surprise if he didn't make the move, as he has already made a number of appearances for his club in recent years."

        "target": "Hurricane Irma thrashes Caribbean as Jose strengthens in wake Hurricane Irma has continued to pack 300 kph winds as it moves across the Caribbean toward Florida. The record-breaking storm has battered the Bahamas and Cuba, while Hurricane Jose followed in its path. As one of the Atlantic Ocean's largest storms plowed through the Caribbean, leaving destruction in its wake, residents of the US state of Florida prepared for what could be the worst storm to make landfall in over a century. At least 17 people have been killed and dozens more injured across several island nations in the Caribbean. Irma is expected to be there second major hurricane to make landfall in the United States in less than two weeks. Hurricane Harvey struck Texas last week, killing more than 60 people and displacing roughly 1 million others. In the US territory of Puerto Rico, 1 million people \u2013 nearly one-third of the population \u2013 lost electricity during the storm, said Puerto Rican Governor Ricardo Rossello. \"It will be difficult to estimate how long the power outage will last,\" Rossello said. Later, officials confirmed that at least two people on the island had been killed by the storm's devastation. Two other major storms have developed in the Caribbean, namely Hurricane Jose and Hurricane Katia. Jose was east of the Lesser Antilles with maximum sustained winds of 120 miles person hour (195 kilometers person hour) as a hurricane watch was in effect for Antigua and Barbuda. Jose has followed the same path as Hurricane Irma, and was upgraded to a Category 4 on Friday by the US National Hurricane Center. Katia has remained relatively static, hovering off the coast of Mexico. Florida on edge Florida Governor Rick Scott said 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain were expected after Irma made landfall at the weekend as he urged evacuations during a press conference on Friday. Nearly 700,000 people have been asked to leave Miami and its surrounding areas. \"Today is the day to do the right thing for your family and get inland for safety... Do not ignore evacuation orders. All Floridians should be prepared to evacuate soon,\" Scott said. Read more: How to reduce risks from mega-storms? \"I know many of you are stuck in traffic, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s very frustrating. Evacuations are not convenient but they are absolutely meant to keep you safe,\" he added. On Friday, US President Donald Trump described Irma as a storm of \"absolutely historic destructive potential.\" Trump also on Friday signed a $15 billion (13.5 billion euro) hurricane relief package passed by Congress, which also raises the debt ceiling and postpones the possibility of a shutdown of government funding until December. Downgraded to an \"extremely dangerous\" Category 4 but still packing winds of 185 mph (300 kph), Irma moved between the north coast of Cuba and the Bahamas as it neared the Florida Keys and the southern Florida Peninsula. 'Major hurricane' Irma will have a \"truly devastating\" impact on the state's southern coastal areas when it slams into Florida, said US Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) chief Brock Long. Read more: Is climate change making mega-hurricanes the new normal? \"Bottom line is the majority of people along the coast have never experienced a major hurricane like this. It will be truly devastating,\" Long told CNN. \"The entire southeastern United States better wake up and pay attention. Death and destruction At least 11 people have been killed and dozens more injured after Irma tore through the French Caribbean, Barbuda, Anguilla and the British Virgin Islands. Amid widening criticism from residents in British territories that not enough was done to safeguard people from the storm, British Foreign Office Minister Alana Duncan said London has sent tents, vehicles and other relief equipment. \"Anguilla received the hurricane's full blast. The initial assessment is that the damage has been severe and in places critical,\" Duncan told the British Parliament. Thousands displaced Antigua and Barbuda Prime Minister Gaston Browne said nearly every building on Barbuda was damaged when the hurricane's core crossed almost directly over the island early Wednesday and about 60 percent of the island's roughly 1,400 people were homeless.

French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said four people were confirmed dead and about 50 injured on the French side of St. Martin, an island split between Dutch and French control. French Interior Minister Gerard Collomb said 100,000 food rations were sent to St. Barts and St. Martin, the equivalent of four days of supplies. ls/jm (AP, AFP, Reuters, dpa)",

The storm is expected to make landfall on Thursday, with winds of up to 130 miles (209 kilometers) per hour (130 kph) and a storm surge of more than 13.5 kilometers (6.6 miles) expected. Forecasters said the storm's path could take at least a day or two to a week before making landfall. \"It's going to be a very, very dangerous storm,\" said British Prime Minister Edouard Philippe, adding that he was \"very concerned\" about the potential for catastrophic damage to the island's economy and infrastructure. In a statement, the US Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) said it was working closely with the government of Puerto Rico to prepare for the worst. FEMA also warned that Hurricane Jose, which made landfall earlier this week, could have a \"significant impact\" on the United States and its Caribbean neighbors, including Florida, Texas, Cuba, Barbuda, New York and New Jersey."

        "target": "Opinion: Yet another crisis for Merkel A summery turquoise blazer and fresh makeup could not hide the fact that Angela Merkel was \"not amused.\" Now she is needed as a champion in the fight against populist forces, DW's Kay-Alexander Scholz writes. Britain-EU divorce proceedings will probably last about two years. Until then, the status quo must be maintained, German Chancellor Angela Merkel emphasized in her press statement. If she is no longer chancellor after the upcoming parliamentary elections in 2017, then others will have to live with the consequences of Brexit. But that is not what she is actually thinking. It is not coincidental that foreign ministers and government leaders are visiting Berlin in the coming days. They want to discuss how things will continue. Berlin, under Merkel's chancellorship, has become a center of power outside of Brussels. Difficult international politics The Brexit decision has disrupted Europe's equilibrium. Germany has lost an important ally on European issues related to economic growth and budgetary discipline. Now, France presumably will be the next to raise its voice against Maastricht Treaty criteria. If the Netherlands and Denmark also decide to leave the EU, Germany will become isolated, as Eastern Europe is not as tight with Germany as it once was. Poland now plays a key role for the Balkan nations and the Visegrad Group (Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic and Slovakia). And Poland is still annoyed about Merkel's refugee policy. What about Germany's populists? They're giddy with glee as they feel that their anti-establishment policies have been validated. They are teaching potential AfD (Alternative for Germany) voters a lesson: \"Here, have a look: it's possible. There is always an alternative. Vote for us!\" Those are exactly the words that protest voters want to hear. Germany's AfD has forged ties with other right-wing parties in Vienna, Paris, The Hague and London. They are all pursuing a \"European\" plan to gain power. The recent Austrian presidential election was significant, as the populist candidate lost by a very narrow margin; in fact, the final election results are still undecided as they are being contested. The Brexit vote was also triggered by populist powers. Domestically difficult Many populists believe that the stronger populism becomes - no matter where - the more advantages there would be for individual parties of their persuasion. Many would also like to see Donald Trump as US president. That is how AfD may become even stronger in Germany, which also means that political majorities would fluctuate even more. Will there be enough seats after the next election for a Christian Democrat and Green coalition, or will yet another grand coalition made up of Christian Democrats and Social Democrats be formed? Can Angela Merkel change course? Can she counter the trend with a new political model in Europe and Germany? Or do we stand on the edge of a new era, a \"political revolution,\" as the AfD calls it? Until now, Europe has survived attacks on its currency (euro crisis), the principle of peaceful coexistence (Crimea crisis) and its open borders policy (refugee crisis). Merkel deserves credit for defending these values, despite mistakes that have been made along the way. The outcome of the Brexit crisis is, however, still open. Have something to say? Add your comments below.",
        "generated_story": "Merkel and the Brexit Crisis in Europe Angela Merkel is the new chancellor of Germany. She's the first woman to lead the country after Donald Trump's election victory in the US. But she's also the latest German politician to make a name for herself in politics. In 2017, Chancellor Merkel's conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) and Green Party (SPD) took over the reins of power in Germany after Trump won the election. Since then, the party has been able to form a coalition government with the Social Democrats and Greens. The CDU, however, is no longer in power. Instead, it's now part of the center-left coalition, which includes the Greens, Greens and Left parties. It's not just the Green party, but the Left party as well, too. And it has a lot to say about the future of Europe. \"I don't think it will be easy,\" said Kay-Alexander Scholz, a member of DW's German parliamentary group, \"but I think we can do it.\" \"We have to get on with it,\" she said, referring to the current political situation in Eastern Europe, where the EU's single market is dominated by the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia. Germany's chancellor, Merkel, and her party's leader, SPD, have been at loggerheads in recent weeks over how to deal with Brexit. They've been in constant conflict with each other for the past two years, with both of them losing their majority in parliament. Merkel has also been accused of being too soft on the European Union, while the SPD is accused by some of its critics of not being open enough to talk to her about Europe's future.

        "target": "Reports: Merkel to run for fourth term as German chancellor German Chancellor Angela Merkel has confirmed that she will stand for the chancellery in the 2017 election, German media reports. The Christian Democrat Leader (CDU) first took office in 2005. After months of speculation, German Chancellor Angela Merkel reportedly told her fellow Christian Democrats (CDU) in Berlin on Sunday that she is prepared to lead the party into next year's election. An official statement is expected from Merkel at 7 p.m. local time (1800 UTC) on Sunday. The 62-year-old has faced a number of difficulties in recent months, from criticism over her handling of the migration crisis to falling support amid a rise in right-wing populist sentiment. Since taking office in 2005, however, Merkel has also been praised for navigating Europe's largest economy through the financial and eurozone crises. According to an Emnid survey published in the German newspaper \"Bild am Sonntag\" 55 percent of Germans are in favor of Merkel remaining head of the German government for another four years. Thirty-nine percent said they were against her re-election. Sign of stability Should she be elected next September, another full four-year term would put Merkel on a par with her mentor Helmut Kohl who set the post-war record and presided over the Fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. In light of the UK's shock vote to leave the European Union in June and Donald Trump's election last week as US president, Merkel's re-election is likely to be welcomed in many capitals as a sign of stability. During his final visit to Berlin this week, US President Barack Obama said that if he were able to, he would vote for his longtime partner and friend. In an interview with German magazine \"Spiegel\" and broadcaster \"ARD,\" Obama said: \"She has great credibility, and she is willing to fight for those values in a way that is very, very important.\" \"I'm glad that she's there and I think the German people should appreciate her. Certainly, I've appreciated her as a partner.\" Winning back votes With the less that a year until Germany heads to the polls, Merkel's CDU is now turning its efforts to wooing back disenchanted voters who have left the conservative camp to support the right-wing populists, Alternative for Germany (AfD). Formed as a Euro-sceptic party in 2013, the AfD won 4.7 percent of the popular vote in the last federal elections in 2013, just falling short of the 5 percent threshold required to enter the Bundestag - Germany's lower house of parliament. After benefiting from the rise in europsceptic, anti-immigration sentiment, seemingly sweeping across western Europe, the party now holds seats in nine of Germany's 16 states.",
        "generated_story": "Merkel's re-election bid comes amid growing populist sentiment in Germany German Chancellor Angela Merkel has announced she will run again for a third term in office in 2017. The announcement came ahead of a parliamentary election due to take place on Sunday. German media reported that Merkel, who has been in power since 2005, was set to run for the first time since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. Merkel's party, the Christian Democrat Leader (CDU), said in a statement that she would seek a fourth term. \"We are going to have to see what happens,\" Merkel told the German newspaper Bild am Sonntag in an interview published Sunday, adding that her party would not be able to form a coalition government without the support of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, a former US president who is now the party's parliamentary leader. In the interview, Merkel said she was \"very happy\" with the outcome of Sunday's vote, saying that it was a \"positive step forward for Germany.\" The CDU, which is currently in opposition in the lower house of parliament, is expected to win a majority of seats in next year's Bundestag elections. It is not yet clear whether Merkel will seek another term as chancellor, or if she'll seek an extension of her current term, as she did in 2005 and 2006, when she first took office as head of state of Germany. Chancellor Merkel is widely regarded as a mentor to US President Donald Trump, and she is seen as one of his closest confidants. She has also been criticized by the US for not being more open to the idea of reunification with Germany, despite the fact that Germany is a member of NATO and the European Union. Germany's chancellor is also seen by many as an ally of Trump in his bid to lead the country through the next round of elections in 2018. A number of German newspapers and magazines have also reported on the chancellor's plans, including \"The New York Times\" and \"Der Spiegel\" magazine. Many of these publications, however, do not mention the president's name. Some of them, such as \"Die Zeit\" (German tabloid) magazine, say that the former German prime minister was not aware of what was going on in Berlin at the time, but that he was aware that there was an \"unprecedented\" rise in anti-immigrant sentiment among German voters."

        "target": "NFL stars defy Donald Trump's call for boycott Baltimore Ravens and Jacksonsville Jaguars players \"took a knee\" during the national anthem after Trump urged fans to boycott football matches. The kneeling protest, to highlight social injustice, has stepped up a gear. Hundreds of National Football League (NFL) stars protested President Donald Trump's call for fans to boycott the league by refusing to stand for the US national anthem this weekend, starting Sunday's game between the Baltimore Ravens and Jacksonsville Jaguars. A number of other players locked arms in solidarity ahead of the game at Wembley Stadium in London. Jacksonville Jaguars' owner Shahid Khan, who last year donated one million dollars\u00a0(840,000 euros) to the Trump campaign, locked his arms with players - a rare scene, as owners almost never take to the field. US media reported that about 200 players on Sunday sat, knelt or raised their fists in defiance of Trump's comments. In one of the most memorable moments, singer Rico LaVelle took a knee and held up a fist at the last line of the Star Spangled Banner ahead of the game between the Detriot Lions and Atlanta Falcons. The protest came in response to Trump's tweets on Sunday morning urging fans to boycott NFL games to pressure the league into firing or suspending players to kneel in protest during the national anthem. In an early morning tweet, Trump posted: \"If NFL fans refuse to go to games until players stop disrespecting our Flag and Country, you will see change take place fast. Fire or suspend!\" \"NFL attendance and ratings are WAY DOWN. Boring games yes, but many stay away because they love our country. League should back US,\" he added. Later, the president said that his rant \"has nothing to do with race,\" despite the fact that the origins of the protest are to do with police brutality against minorities, especially African Americans. Trump said his comments were instead about \"respect for our country and respect for our flag.\" Trump's spat with US professional sports began at a Republican rally in Alabama on Friday, when the president attacked activist NFL players for kneeling or sitting during the national anthem, labelling them as \"sons of bitches.\" \"Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, 'Get that son of a bitch off the field right now... he is fired'?\" Trump told a crowd of cheering supporters. That day, basketball star Stephen Curry, the top player for California's Golden State Warriors, announced that he would not be attending a traditional White House reception honoring the National Basketball Association champions. The kneeling protest was started by former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick who refused to stand for the anthem back in 2016. Kaepernick's gesture came amid a spate of deadly police shootings of black men and was aimed at drawing more attention to treatment of minorities in the US. However, Kaepernick has since become a free agent, after failing to be signed by a new team for the new NFL season. NFL executives decry Trump's calls Trump also drew the ire of senior NFL executives and team owners. Responding to Trump's tweets, Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti, said he \"100 percent\" supported his players' decision to kneel during the anthem. Robert Kraft, the owner of the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots, who is also a close friend of Trump, said in a statement on Sunday that he was deeply disappointed by the president's comments in Alabama. Kraft defended players' rights to \"peacefully affect social change and raise awareness in a manner that they feel is most impactful,\" and said that sports were a unifying force in the US. \"Our political leaders could learn a lot from the lessons of teamwork and working together toward a common goal,\" he said. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, who has taken much of the heat for Kaepernick's failure to find a new team, was also quick to condemn Trump's comments.

They include the owners of the New York Jets, New England Patriots, Dallas Cowboys, Washington Redskins, Jacksonville Jaguars, Houston Texans, Los Angeles Rams and Tampa Bay Buccaneers",

On Sunday, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said the league's players should stand in solidarity with the flag-draped coffin of NFL player Colin Kaepernick. The White House said in a statement on Friday that the NFL's decision to ban players from kneeling in front of the US flag was \"inappropriate\" and \"unacceptable.\" The statement came a day after NFL owners Robert Kraft and Steve Bisciotti announced that they would be boycotting the Super Bowl in order to protest the president's comments. \"The NFL has a responsibility to protect its players,\" said Kraft, who is also a former NFL commissioner. Trump has also called for an end to the protests, which have been ongoing since the start of last season. Last week, Trump said he would not allow NFL team owners to fire players who protest during a game. In a tweet on Sunday morning, he said: \"I will not fire anyone who disrespects our flag. I will stand up for our country and our values.\" He also said that he was not going to allow any player to sit in the locker room while the National Anthem is played. He added that \"it is not my place to criticize the players' actions, it is their right to express their opinions and their values. It is the right of all of us to be respectful and respectful of our fellow citizens.

        "target": "Turkey, Greece seek NATO mission in Aegean, says German official Germany, Greece and Turkey will ask NATO to approve a maritime surveillance mission in the Aegean to combat illegal people smugglers. Greece had previously voiced reservations about the proposal. The proposed mission to be discussed at a NATO defense ministers meeting in Brussels on Thursday comes days after German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutolgu said they would raise the issue of refugees with the Alliance. According to a Reuters report citing a senior German official, initially reticent Greece has now given the green light for the operation, which could see NATO assets deployed in the Aegean in a mostly intelligence and reconnaissance role. Under the proposal, which would need to be approved by Alliance members, NATO maritime assets would provide information to national coastguards and the EU border agency Frontex to combat illegal smugglers using rickety boats to bring migrants to Europe. Turkey would then take back the refugees, as envisioned as part of a 3 billion-euro ($3.2 billion) EU-Turkey deal agreed to last year. According to German sources, the mission would not be similar to the NATO mission in the Mediterranean intercepting migrant boats making the dangerous run from Libya to Italy. However, NATO ships could intervene in emergency situations to save passengers. \"It is not NATO's remit to push back or stop refugee boats,\" the official told Reuters. The mission would use assets from the Alliance's standing naval group, a permanent reaction force deployed in the Mediterranean. The naval group's current flagship is the German combat support ship \"Bonn.\" Denmark has already said it would provide additional ships to the mission, according to the official. However, it is unclear whether NATO members will approve the mission which may fall outside the bounds of the Alliance's mandate. Complicating matters is a long-running maritime dispute between Greece and Turkey over sovereignty in the Aegean, where the two NATO members' jets regularly engage in dogfights. Turkey has taken in more than 2.5 million Syrian refugees, and is a major transit point for migrants from Asia and Africa. More than a million migrants and refugees reached Europe last year, many making the dangerous boat journey from Turkey to Greece by boat. So far this year, more than 340 have perished in the cold waters trying to reach Europe. cw/msh (AFP, dpa, Reuters)",

Germany and France have already agreed on the deployment, which is expected to last until the end of next year. Turkey and Germany have also agreed to cooperate on a number of other issues, including the expansion of NATO's maritime surveillance network, as well as the creation of a new air defense system in Africa and the spread of anti-aircraft weapons in Asia and Africa. NATO is also looking to expand its naval presence in Libya, where it is currently stationed, to include ships and air support vessels. In addition, NATO has also announced that it will deploy a combat support ship to help tackle illegal migration into and out of Europe, a move that has been criticized by Turkey as a step too far in its quest to control the flow of migrants and refugees across its borders.

Israel's army said several militants were killed after tunneling into Israel. Secretary of State John Kerry is due to arrive in Cairo on Monday where he is expected to urge Hamas to accept a cease-fire agreement offered by Egypt that would halt nearly two weeks of fighting with Israel. Meanwhile, the death toll in Gaza continues to rise. Medics on Monday said the number of Palestinian deaths in Gaza has risen to more than 501 since fighting intensified on Jul 8. Most of the dead are civilians. On the Israeli side, 13 soldiers were killed inside Gaza on Sunday, raising the number of soldiers killed since a ground operation began late on Thursday to 18. Two Israeli civilians also died in mortar and rocket attacks. The Israeli army said that more than 10 militants from Gaza were shot dead on Monday after infiltrating southern Israel. According to army spokespeople, two squads of militants were killed after tunneling into Israel. Israel's UN ambassador Ron Prosor, meanwhile, denied a claim by Hamas that an Israeli soldier had been kidnapped by the Islamist group, saying: \"Those rumurs are untrue.\" US President Barack Obama expressed concern about the rising death toll of civilians in a telephone call Sunday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, according to a White House statement. The US State Department confirmed late Sunday that two US citizens were killed in Gaza violence and released their names, but did not immediately disclose their occupations. US media reported, however, that the two were American members of the Israeli Defense Force, citing relatives and friends. \"We can confirm the deaths of US citizens Max Steinberg and Sean Carmeli in Gaza,\" spokesperson Jen Psaki said in a two-sentence statement. Late Sunday, the United Nations Security Council in New York held urgent talks on the conflict, and expressed \"serious concern about the growing numbers of casualties.\" \"The members of the Security Council call for an immediate cessation of hostilities,\" said Rwandan ambassador Eugene Richard Gasana, whose country currently chairs the 15-member council. hc/dr (Reuters, AFP, AP, dpa)",

The two leaders are expected to hold talks on the sidelines of the UN Security Council meeting on Jul 8. Kerry, who is visiting Egypt for the first time since taking office in January, is scheduled to attend the meeting with the Egyptian foreign minister, Eugene Richard Gasana, at the United Nations in New York. \"We have a lot of work ahead of us,\" Kerry said in a statement, adding that he was \"deeply concerned\" about the situation in Gaza, which he described as a \"strange situation.\" Kerry's trip to Cairo comes as the US and Israel seek to reach an agreement on a peace deal between the two sides in the Gaza conflict. On Monday, Kerry met with Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman to discuss a possible ceasefire with Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that has ruled Gaza since the end of a six-year war with Israel in 2006. Israel, however, has rejected the idea, saying it is not a solution to the conflict and that it would be better if the Palestinians were to be allowed to return to their self-imposed exile in Egypt. Netanyahu has called for an end to violence between Hamas and the Israeli military, but has not ruled out the possibility of an Israeli-Egyptian peace accord. Israeli officials have accused Hamas of orchestrating the violence and have called on Hamas to halt its attacks on Israel. Last week, Israel's military said it was ready to resume airstrikes against Hamas targets in response to a rocket fired from Gaza by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. Hamas has denied the accusations, accusing Israel of using the rockets as weapons of mass destruction. A spokesman for Netanyahu said on Sunday that Hamas had \"no intention\" of firing rockets at Israeli targets. hc/dr (Reuters, AFP, AP, dpa)"

        "target": "A borderline war The crisis in Syria is in danger of drawing in neighboring countries. Despite the Syrian government's immediate apology, the shelling on the Turkish border has led to concerns about possible escalation. These weren't the first incidents on the Syrian-Turkish border, but the fact that several people on the Turkish side were killed by Syrian shells on Wednesday (03.10.2012) has brought the conflict between the two countries to a new level. It has led the Turkish military to retaliate for the first time. Several people were killed when Turkey shelled Syrian territory. But neither Turkey, which is a member of NATO, nor Syria would benefit from a broader conflict. An adviser to the Turkish president tweeted, \"Turkey has no interest in a war with Syria.\" Volker Perthes, director of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs in Berlin, agrees: \"Assad has no interest in an escalation,\" he told DW. \"That can be seen from the fact that the Syrian information minister apologized and expressed his regret over the victims immediately after the attack on Turkish territory.\" Perthes doesn't think it's likely that the Syrian President, Bashar Assad, wants to provoke Turkey to intervene in Syria. \"That would only accelerate the fall of his regime,\" he said. It's not yet clear who was responsible for the shelling. According to Syria's ally, Russia, it was a \"tragic accident.\" Relationship damaged The armed incidents on the Syrian-Turkish border have been going on for months. According to Amnesty International, some 300,000 Syrians have left their country since the start of the uprising against Assad, and many of them have fled to Turkey. The relationship between the two countries, which used to be close, has deteriorated dramatically, and the Turkish government is now openly supporting the Syrian opposition. \"Turkey is itself a player in the Syrian conflict,\" said Perthes. \"It provides shelter for many refugees and it's through Turkey that supplies come for the opposition.\" NATO has lined up behind Turkey and told Syria to end its \"flagrant violations of international law.\" Call for 'great discretion' The German chancellor, Angel Merkel, has also positioned herself alongside Turkey. \"We call on all parties to show great discretion,\" she said in Berlin. The foreign minister, Guido Westerwelle, declared that everything must be done to deescalate the situation, so that the Syrian conflict did not turn into a conflagration in the region. Indeed, the Syrian crisis is not only spreading to Turkey, but also to Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon. According to Perthes, \"The neighboring countries are partly victims and partly instigators. Jordan too has taken in refugees and supplies the rebels. On the other hand, Iraq has tended to support the government of Bashar Assad.\" Even so, he said, all the neighboring countries had an interest in ensuring the conflict was confined to Syria. Appeal to the international community But the number of Syrian refugees is rising by the day. Ruth J\u00fcttner, a Middle East expert with Amnesty International, believes this will continue in future months. \"It's important that the countries bordering on Syria are supported by the international community in providing accommodation, medical and psychological care and schooling for children,\" she told DW. It's an appeal she directs especially to European countries. The shelling on the Syrian-Turkish border has made it more likely that there will be armed conflict between Syria and its neighbors. According to Perthes, \"It's probably the case that political resistance in Turkey to intervention in Syria is decreasing right now.\"",
        "generated_story": "German Institute for International and Security Affairs says Turkey's response to the Syrian-Turkish conflict is \"not likely\" The German institute for international and security affairs (DIY) said Wednesday that the Turkish government's military intervention in Syria was not likely. Volker Perthes, head of the DIY think tank in Berlin, told DW that Turkish military action against Syrian President Bashar Assad would not be \"negotiable.\" \"Turkey is not a reliable partner in the fight against terrorism,\" he said. \"It is a very weak partner, and it does not play a constructive role in resolving the conflict. It has not been able to exert its influence and influence on the political and economic processes that have led to this conflict.\" The foreign minister of Germany, Guido Westerwelle, said that Turkey had \"no interest\" in intervening militarily in a conflict that has killed more than 1.5 million people since the beginning of this year. He added that it was \"very difficult\" for Turkey to act in an \"immediate and decisive way\" to resolve the crisis. In addition, he pointed out, Turkey has been \"increasingly aggressive in its approach to Syria,\" adding that \"it is very difficult for the regime in Damascus to impose its will on its own people.\" In a statement released on Wednesday, the German government said it did not see any reason for Ankara to step in. However, it also stressed the need for a \"stronger and more effective response\" from Turkey, which has so far been unable to do so. DW: What do you think about the role of Turkey in this crisis?Volker: I don't think Turkey is going to take any action at this time. I think it will have to wait and see what happens. There are a lot of things that can be done. For example, there is the question of how Turkey will respond to a situation in which there are so many people who are suffering from the effects of war. That is, if Turkey decides to use its military force against the rebels, then that would be a positive step. But it is also a negative step, because it could lead to an escalation of tensions between the two countries. So far, however, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has shown no sign of backing down from his threats. On the other hand, Russia and Iran have both expressed their support for Assad's government, while the United States has expressed its concern that Assad could use chemical weapons against civilians."

Although they sent no representatives to Switzerland, Islamists have agreed to halt the fighting. The Islamist-backed militia alliance that took over Tripoli and installed its own government announced a ceasefire on Friday, following a breakthrough in Geneva-based peace talks. Despite not attending the UN-brokered meeting, the militias have agreed to \"a ceasefire on all fronts,\" according to a statement issued by Islamist group Fajr Libya (Libya Dawn). The only condition is that \"the other parties respect the truce.\" The announcement came hours after the United Nations declared that Libya's warring factions had agreed to a roadmap for forming a unity government. Nearly four years after a NATO-backed revolt saw Moammar Gadhafi removed from power, two rival governments each backed by different groups of militias have plunged the country back into chaos and threatened all-out civil war. After the elected government of Prime Minister Abdullah al-Thinni was forced out of Tripoli by Libya Dawn, it was forced to move to the far eastern city of Tobruk while Libya Dawn reinstated the old parliament known as the GNC. The fighting and violence has displaced hundreds of thousands of civilians, left hundreds killed and thousands wounded. Most foreign diplomats fled the country and shut their embassies last year. The Tobruk government, as well as a few other factions who favor a peaceful resolution, came to Geneva to work on \"confidence-building measures,\" which includes the release of detainees from both sides, opening closed ports and securing safe freedom of movement around the country. es/bw (AP, AFP, Reuters)",

He wants to introduce a cap on the number of refugees allowed into France, he intends to make it harder for foreign nationals to access the social welfare system, and he wants to put Muslim communities and mosques under government control. In addition, Fillon advocates a renationalization of school curricula. Fillon makes gains in FN territory Fillon's agenda could turn out to be a problem for the \"National Front\" (FN). The 62-year-old appeals to similar sentiments as the right-wing party's base: concern about foreign domination and loss of identity, fear of terrorism and crime. \"For a long time, FN was the only political force that addressed those fears,\" said Henrik Uterwedde of the German-French Institute (dfi) in Ludwigsburg. \"Now a politician has arrived on the scene who addresses those fears using a different language and makes them a political offer.\" In rural, Catholic France especially, where traditions still matter a great deal, the avowed Catholic Fillon strikes a chord with his proposals pertaining to family and society policies. He receives support from traditional Catholic groups who, for years, have been able to mobilize crowds for demonstrations against gay marriage. During the intraparty election campaign, Fillon predominantly traveled to France's villages and small towns - regions which FN leader Marine Le Pen had labeled the \"forgotten France,\" regarding herself as their foremost lobbyist. \"Fillon has made gains in an environment that is also canvassed by Le Pen,\" Andreas Jung, Chairman of the Bundestag's German-French parliamentary group, told German broadcaster rbb-Inforadio. \"He does not represent the lofty levels of Parisian politics, but rather provincial entrenchment. Fillon is committed to traditional values, like the family. Therefore, he may not only be capable of defeating Le Pen, but also of taking the lead during the first ballot.\" 'Most dangerous candidate for FN' Consequently, the FN camp is less than enthusiastic about the conservative's candidacy. \"Because of Fillon, we now have a strategy problem,\" Marion Marechal Le Pen, the FN leader's niece, recently told journalists. \"He is the most dangerous candidate for the National Front.\" Pollsters' findings appear to support that statement. Recent surveys establish Fillon as the current favorite in the French presidential election scheduled for next May. However, Fillon's election is not a foregone conclusion. By denouncing the conservative candidate as a member of the establishment, FN tries to win over those who are frustrated with politics and politicians in general. There is persistent opposition against his economic-liberal plans in particular. Fillon wants to abolish the 35-hour working week and raise the retirement age to 65 years. In addition, he wants to cut 500,000 jobs in the public sector and reform industrial law. Fillon is known as an admirer of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. \"Issues pertaining to liberal economic policy have always been heavily contested in France,\" said Uterwedde. \"Fillon's adversaries have already taken up their positions, criticizing what, in France, is called 'ultra-liberalism.'\" That was one of the nastiest words in French politics, he added. An offer for the left Fillon wants to raise VAT by 2 percent. This would predominantly hurt low-income households. Exactly that clientele, however, is wooed by FN with a program that is regarded as rather left-wing. The right-wing extremists are on a clear anti-globalization course, intending to seal off the French economy against foreign countries and exit from the European Union. The party is already trying to present Fillon as a symbol of anarchic, ultra-liberal capitalism. \"Francois Fillon will even go beyond EU demands for austerity and liberalism,\" David Rachline, Marine Le Pen's election campaign manager, wrote on Twitter. According to current polls, it is very likely that Fillon will have to face Marine Le Pen in a runoff election in May. The main hazard for the Republican candidate: his economic-liberal course could deter left-wing voters from choosing the conservative in order to avert Le Pen. \"Francois Fillon will have to start making offers, also to those voters who are closer to the center and more moderate,\" said France expert Uterwedde. \"And he will, prior to the runoff election at the latest, have to make offers to left-wing voters - without changing his original course.\"",
        "generated_story": "Fillon is the most dangerous candidate for French presidential election Francois Fillon has been declared the \"most dangerous\" candidate in France's presidential race, according to a poll released by the German-French Institute of Politics. The poll results are expected to be released on Sunday, with the results due out in the first round of voting on Monday. French election results have been announced, and the election is scheduled to take place on June 24. A poll conducted by rbb-Inforadio, a German think-tank, found that the far-right candidate, Marine Le Pen, has the strongest chance of winning the French presidency. In the polls, the right-wing extremist Marine le Pen (pictured above) is leading the field of candidates for the Republican and Republican presidential elections. Her party has a majority in both houses of the Bundestag in Ludwigsburg, which is home to the state parliament, as well as the regional parliament. \"Le Pen is a very strong candidate,\" said Henrik Uterwedde, head of Germany's research institute, adding that she would be a \"strong contender\" if she were to win the nomination. He added that he was \"very optimistic\" about her chances, saying that \"if she wins, she will win.\" \"I think she's going to do a great job,\" he said, referring to her campaign slogan, \"she's got a lot of experience in politics. I think that's a good thing, because she'll be able to make a strong case for herself and for her party.\" The results of Sunday's election will be announced on Tuesday, June 19, in a special election to decide the next president of France. It will also be decided whether or not she wants to run as a conservative or a moderate candidate. On the other hand, it's not clear whether she has any experience at all in running for president. She's running as an independent candidate and has already won a number of elections, including the European Union's presidency in 2015 and 2016. But she is not the only candidate who has made a name for himself on social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Instagram and Twitter. And she hasn't lost a single vote since she took office in May, when she lost to former French Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. That was the last time she ran for office, but she did win a second term in office and she won the general election in 2012. Rbb Inforadicio's analysis of French politics is based on a survey of more than 1,000 people who have taken to Twitter to find out what they think about the current French president and his policies. Among those who are taking part in this year's elections are French Republican candidate Francois-Francois Fonseca, who is running on the left-of-center National Front (FN) and French conservative candidate Marion Marechal (SPD). Both candidates have made their voices heard on Twitter:"

        "target": "Berlin court rules Google Street View is legal in Germany A Berlin court has ruled that Google Street View is legal. But that doesn't mean the lawsuits will end, legal scholars say. A Berlin court has ruled that Google Street View is, in fact, legal in Germany. Last Tuesday, the Berlin State Supreme Court (Kammergericht) announced its decision in a court case from late last year, in which a woman had sued Google, fearing that photos of her, her family and the front of her house would be posted on Google Street View and would thus violate her property and privacy rights. The court ruled that it is legal to take photographs from street level, rejecting her argument that Google was trying to take unauthorized pictures. Part of her argument rested on the fact that Google used cameras mounted at three meters (9.84 feet) high, which could see over her two-meter-high hedge. However, the court did not find this argument convincing, given that the photographs were taken from the street, and not the sidewalk. Furthermore, because Google automatically blurs faces and license plates and did allow Germans to opt-out of the service to have their house obfuscated as well, the court did not find any potential violations. This is the first high-level court ruling, which cannot be appealed any further, regarding Street View since the service debuted in Germany at the end of last year. An ongoing debate Since Google announced plans to launch Street View in Germany last summer, debate around the service has become heated, with some politicians trying to stop it at every turn, while German Chancellor Angela Merkel famously said that she would not remove her house from Street View. In November 2010, the company announced that 244,000 German residents in the 20 cities had chosen to opt out of Street View - less than three percent of residents. However, in Germany and everywhere else, the company also allows people to report abuse, inaccuracies or request that something be blurred using an online tool. \"Our job is to develop services that respect these cultural differences,\" Peter Fleischer, Google's global privacy counsel told Deutsche Welle in November 2010. \"We try to anticipate them. We're all internationally-minded people ourselves. We try to guess how people will react to them. But a lot of these services are new and have never been on the market before, so we learn and we adapt as we go along.\" A 'landmark decision' European legal experts called the Berlin ruling a \"landmark decision,\" saying that this would now become part of German case law regarding property rights. \"Yes, other people are now warned: Don't sue Google simply claiming that Google Street View violates personality [or] property rights,\" wrote Thomas H\u00f6ren, a professor of media and communications law at the University of M\u00fcnster, in an e-mail sent to Deutsche Welle. But, he also warned that this decision was very narrow, focusing on the issue of property rights, and not on the larger issues of data protection from Google. \"The problem of Google Street View - to be honest - has never been a problem of personality rights or property rights, but the enormous risk of personal data compilations in cases where people use Google Street View for compiling personal profiles (such as building insurance companies; future employees, et cetera),\" he added. \"And this risk has not been considered by the Berlin courts.\" Similarly, Viktor Mayer-Sch\u00f6nberger, a professor at the Oxford Internet Institute, agreed that this case was \"limited in scope,\" adding in an e-mail, \"The plaintiff never alleged an actual invasion of privacy, just a potential one.\" Author: Cyrus Farivar Editor: Nancy Isenson",

The decision marks the first time that a German court has ruled in favor of Google's street-view product. German Chancellor Angela Merkel's ruling on the matter was announced on Tuesday by the Berlin State Supreme Court (Berlin), the country's highest court, in a landmark ruling that could pave the way for the future of the world's most popular online shopping destination. Germany's top court in November 2010, however, said it would not rule on whether the decision should be appealed. \"The decision will not be binding,\" the court said, adding that the ruling would have to be ratified by Berlin's lower house of parliament, the state parliament and the federal government. In the end, it will be up to the chancellor to decide whether or not to appeal. According to Deutsche Welle's Thomas H\u00f6ren, a professor of political science at the University of M\u00fcnster in western Germany, \"the decision is bound to have a positive impact on public opinion.\" The court's decision came after a long legal battle between the two sides over whether to allow the company to sell its products to third-party companies. Google, which owns the majority stake in Berlin-based online marketplace Gizmodo, had argued that it should have been allowed to do so because it was an \"open and transparent market\" and not a \"one-sided market.\" \"It is an open market,\" said Peter Fleischer, head of research and development at Google. He added that he was \"very happy\" with the outcome. Author: Cyrus Farivar Editor: Nancy Isenson"

        "target": "UK lawmakers propose jail sentences for reckless bankers A British parliamentary commission has completed its work on the overhaul of the domestic banking sector. Among other things, it proposed jail terms for bankers displaying grave malpractice and causing huge damage. Members of the UK's Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards agreed Wednesday that Britain needed a radical overhaul of its scandal-hit lenders. The panel, which was mostly composed of lawmakers, concluded in its final report that senior bankers must be made personally responsible for malpractice through the introduction of a new criminal offence of reckless misconduct. It would carry a prison sentence. The reputation of the country's banking sector had been damaged in recent years by a string of scandals, including Libor rate-rigging, credit insurance mis-selling and a controversy over staff behavior and bonuses in the run-up to the 2008 global financial crisis. The level of malpractice had been \"shocking and widespread,\" said the commission's chairman, Conservative party lawmaker Andrew Tyrie. RBS cut in two? \"Taxpayers and customers have lost out, and the economy has suffered,\" the 500-page report said. \"Under our recommendations, senior bankers who seriously damage their banks or put taxpayers' money at risk can expect to be fined, banned from the industry or in the worst cases go to jail.\" The commission called for bankers to sign up to a new code of conduct under which all key responsibilities within a bank would be assigned to specific senior officials who would be held responsible. The panel also proposed that more remuneration for bankers should be deferred for longer periods of up to ten years in order to \"reflect the longer run balance between business risks and rewards.\" The commission recommended that the government consider splitting the state-rescued Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) into a good bank and a bad one mopping up toxic assets. The report was published ahead of a key speech by Finance Minister George Osborne on his bank reform plans. hg/ipj (AFP, Reuters)",

        "target": "Party leaders call for increased wages in growing German economy Chancellor Angela Merkel and other top officials have called for upticks in Germany's economy to trickle down to workers in the form of higher pay. But a leading think tank has warned against giving raises too soon. Germany's foreign minister and deputy chancellor, Guido Westerwelle, has added his support to comments made by Economics Minster Rainer Bruederle about increased wages for German workers. \"When the economy grows and this growth is substantial and sustainable, then the benefits of this upswing should be felt by the people who worked so hard for it,\" Westerwelle told the Hamburger Abendblatt newspaper in an interview. Westerwelle heads the free-market liberal FDP, which shares power with Chancellor Merkel's Christian coalition. Earlier this week, Bruederle, also an FDP member, said in light of Germany's currently growing economy, those economic gains should trickle down to employees in the form of higher wages. Merkel, who is also the head of the Christian Democratic Union, supported Bruederle's idea. \"That is something the chancellor sees the same way, letter for letter,\" said Merkel's spokesman, Steffen Seibert. Not so fast Earlier this week, analysts predicted growth of 3.5 percent this year and 2 percent in 2011. Germany's five leading economic think tanks also predicted that the number of unemployed would fall below 3 million next year, the lowest level since 1992. Despite the current rosy outlook for the German economy, not everyone is convinced that a growing economy should inevitably lead to higher wages. The president of the German Institute for Economic Research, Klaus Zimmermann, warned against reacting too quickly. \"I can't support the idea of a general wage increase, I think it is too dangerous,\" Zimmermann said in an interview with the Handelsblatt newspaper. Zimmermann wasn't opposed to the idea of raising wages, but said he was against across-the-board increases for all sectors and pointed out that not every industry is benefitting the same from the growing economy. \"We can't forget that the German economy did not resort to mass lay-offs when it wasn't going so well last year,\" Zimmermann said. Raising wages in some branches could be a good idea, Zimmermann said, as that would make those branches more attractive option to potential workers from outside of Germany.

The previous day, the 56-year-old leader openly accused Germany and neighboring Poland of planning a coup against him. \"There were [in Germany and Poland] plans worked out for an overthrow of the constitutional order,\" Lukashenko said in the Belarusian capital, Minsk, on Thursday. \"This is not an invention of our intelligence agencies.\" Lukashenko, who came to power in 1994, was re-elected last month with 80 percent of the vote in what the opposition and international monitors said was a rigged election. Relations between the reclusive Belarusian government and the West have been strained ever since. 'Belarus question must be answered' German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said in a statement that the accusations were \"baseless\" and an attempt by Lukashenko to draw attention away from his own wrongdoing. \"The EU needs to find a clear political answer to events surrounding the presidential election and the continued incarceration of opposition politicians and their supporters,\" Westerwelle said. A wide-reaching crackdown against the regime's opponents followed Lukashenko's re-election. Hundreds of his critics were arrested and dozens threatened with long-term jail sentences. Poland also dismissed the accusations as absurd and said that relations with Minsk would not be normalized unless all political prisoners were released. Sanctions threat The situation in Belarus pushed the European Union to adopt a resolution on Thursday in support of economic sanctions against the country. The threats earned a sharp rebuke from Lukashenko, who promised the \"hardest possible reaction\" should the bloc impose sanctions against his country. At the same time, the Belarusian prime minister, Mikhail Myasnikovich, travelled to Moscow in a effort to shore up Russian support for Minsk during its standoff with the EU. That meeting ended with a Russian promise not to impose its own set of sanctions on Belarus over an unrelated spat over oil exports and a commitment to resume a nuclear power plant project shelved after the 1986 Chernobyl disaster.

        "target": "Indian government tells Supreme Court Rohingya pose'serious threat' After an appeal from two Rohingya, India's top court is considering PM Narendra Modi's plan to deport some 40,000 Rohingya in India. The government said intelligence data showed links between some Rohingya and terrorism. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government told the Supreme Court of India on Monday that the Rohingya were \"illegal\" immigrants. The hearing is taking place as Rohingya face severe violence in their native Myanmar. More than 400,000 Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh in the past few weeks to escape military and civilian reprisals that the United Nations has described as \"ethnic cleansing.\" Later on Monday, Myanmar's national security advisor said that his government was willing to welcome the refugees who had fled to Bangladesh back to their native Rakhine state, but that the details of the process still had to be worked out. \"We will make sure that everybody who left their home can return to their home but this is a process we have to discuss,\" Thaung Tun told Reuters news agency after a meeting with British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. It was unclear how this would affect the estimated 40,000 Rohingya believed to have settled in India, including 16,000 of whom are registered with the UN's refugee agency. Read more: Myanmar's Rohingya - A history of forced exoduses The Indian government told the court that it had intelligence data that showed links between some Rohingya Muslims and Pakistan-based terror groups and other international terror organizations. It argued that such links made them a \"serious threat to national security.\" The government also said there was a \"serious possibility of eruption of violence against Buddhists in India by radicalized Rohingya.\" Lawyer Colin Gonsalves, who in a separate case is representing about 7,000 Rohingya living in the northern Indian city of Jammu, countered the government's assertions. \"We just want to know: 40,000 people have been here, many of them for the last five years. Have you [the government] filed a single charge sheet, is anyone being prosecuted in the criminal court for being a terrorist? The answer is: no,\" he told DW. The court has adjourned the hearing in the matter to October 3. Lack of evidence India says it is not bound by the UN convention on refugees as it is not a signatory to the accord, but human rights activists disagree. \"The principle of non return of a person to a place where he will be executed or tortured has become a principle of customary international law which India follows,\" Gonsalves told DW. \"And it has attained the status of 'jus cogens,' which is a principle of law that no country can say is not applicable to it, such as torture and genocide.\" In a communication sent to all states in August, the Home Ministry [interior ministry] said the illegal migrants were more susceptible to terrorist recruitment efforts. But an investigation by Indian broadcaster NDTV found \"little evidence of the government claim.\" The investigation that was carried out at major Rohingya settlements in the country showed little involvement in criminal wrongdoing by the refugees. Lack of any evidence to support the government claim has led to speculations that the Rohingya were being targeted for their religion by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu-nationalist government. \"It is really unfortunate that the government is going back on its commitment to refugees which it has reiterated several times in the past merely because these Rohingyas are Muslims,\" said lawyer Prashant Bhushan, who filed the plea on behalf of two Rohingya men. \"I mean this is clearly a case of religious discrimination and an attempt to arouse a sort of feeling of... an anti-Muslim feeling or try and communalise the situation,\" he told reporters outside the courthouse. The UN's human rights chief last week deplored Indian government's move to deport Rohingya refugees. \"India cannot carry out collective expulsions, or return people to a place where they risk torture or other serious violations,\" Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein said. The Rohingya are an Indo-Aryan people, the vast majority of whom are Muslims. They usually migrate to India through a rather porous border to escape persecution in their native Rakhine state in Myanmar, where they have been denied citizenship rights. They are viewed by the local authorities as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. Myanmar's Buddhist majority is often accused of subjecting them to discrimination and violence. Read more: Rohingya people in Myanmar \u2013 What you need to know The ongoing violence follows an insurgent attack on security forces on August 25 in Rakhine state that sparked off a brutal military counteroffensive. Hundreds of people, the majority of them Rohingya, have been killed in the violence that has seen many homes destroyed and several villages burned down. Myanmar's government maintains the crackdown is part of a counter-terrorism drive, while the UN's al-Hussein has said that it \"seems a textbook example of ethnic cleansing.\"",
        "generated_story": "India says Rohingyas pose 'erious threat' to India The Indian government has issued a statement saying that the majority of Rohingya Muslims in the country are \"irreconcilable\" with Buddhists and Hindus. The statement was made in Jammu, the capital of Myanmar, on Monday. India's interior ministry said it had received a report from the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) on August 25 that said the Rohingya were a threat to its security. UNGA spokesman Colin Gonsalves told DW that India was \"deeply concerned\" by the report. \"We are deeply concerned about the situation in Rakhine state, which is a state of law and order in India,\" he said, adding that \"it is our responsibility to ensure the safety and security of our citizens.\" The UN has also expressed its concern over the influx of refugees from Myanmar into India. According to UN spokesman Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, Myanmar is the world's third-largest Muslim country, after Bangladesh and Bangladesh, and Myanmar are the third and fourth largest Muslim-majority countries, respectively. DW's Prashant Bhushan, in an interview with NDTV, said that while the UN report was not conclusive, it was clear that Myanmar's government was aware of the issue and acted quickly to address it. He added that there was a \"clear and present danger\" to the lives of people who were fleeing persecution in Myanmar. Indian Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, however, did not directly comment on the reports, saying he had not seen any evidence to substantiate the allegations. However, he did point out that it is not the first time India has come under fire for its handling of a Rohingya crisis. Last year, India banned the use of military force against Rohingya in a bid to quell the violence. In August, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that his government would not allow the military to use the force. On Monday, Modi said he would continue to support the government's efforts to deal with the crisis, calling for an end to violence against the minority community. But the Indian foreign minister, who is also a member of parliament, has called for a ceasefire between the Muslim minority and the state government. Speaking to DW, Foreign Minister Bipin Rawat said: \"India has to act decisively in its own interest to protect the interests of its citizens. We have to stand up for the rights of all the citizens of this country and we will not stand back and let the people of India be treated as if they are criminals or terrorists.\" DW: What do you think?"

Monday's announcement by Pat McQuaid, the president of the International Cycling Union, ratified recommendations in an October report from the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), which ordered Armstrong's Tour de France titles be wiped out. \"Lance Armstrong has no place in cycling,\" said McQuaid. Addressing his remarks to cyclists, McQuaid said the fight against doping was his priority. \"UCI is listening and is on your side. We\u2019ve come too far in the fight against doping to return to our past. Cycling has a future and something like this must not happen again.\" The scathing USADA report included testimony from 11 former teammates, accusing Armstrong of running the \"most sophisticated\" doping program in the sport's history.

Effect on cycling and sponsorship Monday's decision comes as the sport of cycling reels from Armstrong's well-documented fall from grace. Organizers of the Tour de France will be trying to move on from the scandal as the race prepares to celebrate its centenary next year. Sponsors have been deserting Armstrong and the sport in general. Last week, Nike - one of Armstrong's main corporate sponsors - said it was terminating its relationship with the cyclist and accused him of deception. Trek, the company that made the bicycles Armstrong rode to seven titles, announced on the same day it would terminate its sponsorship contract - as did the beer maker Anheuser-Busch. The Dutch institution Rabobank ended its association with professional cycling after the doping allegations came to light, leaving 17 riders in need of a sponsor. Last week Armstrong also announced he would step down from his own charity, the Lance Armstrong Foundation, also known as Livestrong, a move believed to have been intended to limit the damage to the organization from the USADA report.

President Obama vowed to nominate a successor 'in due time,' despite political opposition. The 79-year old justice died in his sleep, presumably of natural causes, local media reported on Saturday. Scalia was visiting Texas for a hunting trip, and his body was discovered after he failed to appear for breakfast in the resort where he was staying. US President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama extended \"their deepest condolences to Justice Scalia's family,\" White House deputy spokesman Eric Schultz said. Texas Governor Greg Abbott described the conservative justice as a \"man of God, a patriot and an unwavering defender of the written Constitution and the rule of law.\" \"He was the solid rock who turned away so many attempts to depart from and distort the Constitution. His fierce loyalty to the Constitution set an unmatched example, not just for judges and lawyers, but for all Americans,\" Abbot said. Battle for the empty seat His passing is likely to open a new political front between President Barack Obama and the Republican Party, as Scalia's replacement could shift the composition of the court towards a more liberal persuasion. Several Republican lawmakers have already urged Obama to leave the decision to the next president who will be voted in later this year. \"The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court justice,\" Senate Republican majority leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement, referring to the upcoming November general election. \"Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president,\" McConnell concluded. President Obama, however, said he would fulfill his constitutional duty and nominate Scalia's successor \"in due time.\" \"These are responsibilities I take seriously, and so should everyone. They are bigger than any one party,\" he said. Decades of controversy Scalia joined the Supreme Court in 1986, becoming the first Italian-American to serve in the top judicial body. He was nominated by US President Ronald Reagan. Throughout his long carrier, Scalia voted in favor of privacy and protecting defendants' rights, but also against legalizing abortion, same-sex marriage and gun control. He also drew public attention for his theatrical flair and sharpness of tongue, as well as his alleged unwillingness to compromise. In June last year, the nine-person Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage with a five-to-four vote. Scalia, who was in the minority, commented he would \"hide my head in a bag\" if his own name were associated with the decision. He also said that the majority opinion was \"couched in a style that is as pretentious as its content is egotistic.\" dj/jm (AP, Reuters, AFP, dpa)",

He's a university student majoring in German Studies, so he decided to come to Europe for three months for a German language course at the Goethe Institute in Freiburg. A good choice: Freiburg is a charming university town in southwestern Germany attracting three million visitors a year! Let\u2019s find out how Tonatiuh spent his day with our camera crew.",
        "generated_story": "My Freiburg: A tour with Tonatiuh Ibarra from Mexico City I'm back in Germany after a three-day visit to Germany. I've been to Mexico, where I spent a few days studying German in the Goethe Institute. It's been a long time since I was able to visit Germany, but it's definitely worth a visit. My first stop in Mexico was the city of Mexico. There, I had the chance to see the old and the new, as well as meet some of the most interesting people I have met in my life. The first thing I wanted to do was to get to know the people and learn about the history of German and German culture. That's what I did, and that's when I decided to take a tour of Germany and Mexico in order to find out what it was like to be a German-Mexican exchange student from the state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. \"It was a great experience,\" I said, \"and I really enjoyed it.\" It was also the first time I'd been in a foreign country, so I didn't have to worry about my own language, which is not German at all. In fact, my first impression was that the German language was very important to me, because I learned a lot about German from my German teacher. But I also learned that it wasn't just German that was important for me to learn German, it also helped me understand the culture of my country. So I started my trip with a lecture on German history, German studies and philosophy. Then I went on to study German for a year, then went back to my native Germany for the last two years. During that time, the two of us spent time in different cities, visiting museums, museums and cultural centers. We had a good time talking about Germany's history and culture and how it influenced the way we think about our own country and its people. And then I got to spend some time with my father, who is also a professor in German Studies at the Berlin-based German Institute of History and Culture. He was impressed by the fact that his father taught German to his son and daughter in school. After that, he took me on a guided tour through Mexico's capital city, with the help of his mother and grandmother. His father was an engineer and his grandmother worked as a teacher at a small German school in his native town. They were very close to each other and he was fascinated by how German was used to being used as an instrument for learning German."

        "target": "Opinion: The pope's impossible mission in Mexico Pope Francis's trip to Mexico is a dangerous mission - a diplomatic as well as political balancing act, one that brings with it enormous expectations. Francis won't be able to meet them, says DW's Astrid Prange. Dead prisoners, disappearing students, refugees shot dead and murdered priests. Mexico has lived through one violent episode after the other. The mood in the nation is explosive. And now this: just a day before the pope is set to arrive, more than 50 people died in the largest prison revolt in the country's history. What meaning does the pope's presence hold on such an occasion? Only one thing is certain: Francis won't be able to resolve the problems of the world's second largest Catholic nation in just a five-day trip. The unrealistic demands placed on him are not something he can fill. Yet the pope carries with him an important message: you don't have to love your enemies but you do need to speak with them. And he's living the example himself by meeting with the Russian Orthodox Patriarch Kirill on a stopover in Cuba on his way to Mexico. Cuba all over again It's sensational! Bannings and mutual ex-communications are ancient history. Nearly a millennium after the split, the head of the Roman Catholic Church and the head of the Russian Orthodox Church are speaking to each other. It's not as if the two will become friends - their positions are far too different. Yet their centuries-old enmity feels out of place and in view of the massive worldwide persecution of Christians, almost unchristian. And both of these church leaders know this. In Mexico, efforts to stem the polarizing forces at play in society have not been successful. The extreme differences between rich and poor are dividing Mexican society. President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto has prioritized economic growth over dialogue with his critics - a group which includes students as well as teachers and union members who regularly protest against government policies. They demand an end to lawlessness and corruption. The presumed murder of 43 teaching students in Iguala in September 2014, a crime which remains unsolved, stands as a symbol of the lawlessness sweeping Mexico. The recent mutiny in a Monterrey jail serves as further proof of the country's shortcomings in regard to human rights and the rule of law. With a visit to Ciudad Juarez and the largest prison in Mexico, Francis will only make that deficiency more transparent. Even the pope of peace has enemies. The route he's chosen to take on his travels through the country has displeased the staunchly Catholic president. A meeting with the relatives of the Iguala victims is therefore hush-hush and participation in a holy mass remains secret. Considering the tense situation in the country, it's still possible that the pope's route will change once again. The church in the pillory Even within his own church, Francis has met with opposition. A meeting he requested with victims from the church's abuse scandal will not take place - a bitter disappointment for many former seminarians who were abused by Marcial Maciel, the founder of the Legion of Christ, and members of his order. It's just one example of how impunity continues even within the church itself. None of the perpetrators have yet to answer for their crimes in court. It appears as though the pope has accomplished more on the world stage than he has brought on reforms to the Vatican. Despite the revolutionary coming together of Cuba and the US and the revolutionary meeting with Patriarch Kirill, the revolution in Rome has yet to materialize. Do you have something to say? Add your comments below. The thread to this editorial closes in 24 hours.",
        "generated_story": "Pope Francis' impossible mission in Mexico The pope has a difficult task ahead of him. He has to convince Mexico's Roman Catholic Church to allow him to stay in the country. The Vatican has been trying to persuade Mexico to let him stay. But the Vatican is not convinced. In September 2014, Pope Francis traveled to Mexico, where he met with President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto and Patriarch Kirill of the Russian Orthodox Church. At the time, the pontiff was visiting Cuba, Cuba and Cuba at the invitation of Pope John Paul II. During his visit, Francis was able to meet with the two leaders of both countries, as well as Pope Benedict XVI, who had been in Cuba for a year and a half. It was the first time that the pope had visited Mexico since the end of World War II, and it was his first visit to the US since then. \"It was a very difficult trip for me,\" Francis said in an interview with DW's Astrid Prange, a journalist who has covered the papacy for more than 20 years. His visit came just a few weeks after the Mexican government announced that it would no longer allow Francis to travel to Cuba or Cuba. On the contrary, he said, \"We are going to do everything in our power to make Mexico a better place for our people.\" He also said that he would be willing to work with other countries to improve the situation in Latin America, particularly in countries where the church has suffered from a lack of financial support. That's why he's been traveling around the world for the past few months, hoping to find a solution to a problem that has plagued him since he was elected president. And that's exactly what he has done: He's given Mexico an opportunity to be a leader in its own church. This is a great opportunity for all of us to get to know each other better. We have a lot to learn from this pope. I think it will be interesting to see how he manages to reach out to other churches and churches in different parts of Mexico. There are a number of churches that are very close to him, including the Legion of Christ, which is based in Monterrey. Many of them don't even know him at all, but they do know about him and his ministry. They've been working closely with him for years and have been very impressed with his ability to communicate with people in a way that is very different from what we've seen in other places. For example, when he visited Cuba last year, many of his followers said they were impressed by the work he did there. When he came back, they said he had a good rapport with them and that they would do the same for him again. However, that was not the case with Francis, because they didn't know what was going on in his home country, so they had no idea what to expect. So, it wasn't a surprise to them that Francis would come back to visit Mexico and to try to help them out."

        "target": "Report: Torture is a European problem too A day after Amnesty International published a report on Europe's collusion with the CIA's torture program, the Council of Europe published its own shocking survey of abuse in detention centers across the continent. Prison guards in several European countries carried out reprisals against detainees who talked to the Council of Europe's Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT), the new CPT report has revealed. The council considers this a violation of the spirit of cooperation between the CPT and the Council of Europe's member states. According to the CPT's 24th General Report, released on Wednesday, reprisals were carried out against prisoners in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Greece, Hungary, Moldova, Russia, Spain, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and Ukraine. \"Intimidation or retaliation against persons the CPT has interviewed may not only violate their human rights but also strikes a blow to the preventive mechanism established by the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture,\" CPT President Letif H\u00fcseynov said in a statement. \"I urge national authorities to respect their obligation to prevent, investigate and punish such actions.\" The report also highlighted several problems with the detention of juveniles around Europe, and proposed a series of practical measures to protect young people's rights when detained. Ad hoc visits The little-known CPT, now 25 years old, represents a unique approach to international torture prevention. A team of specialists make roughly 180 visits a year to all kinds of detention centers (including prisons, police stations, holding centers for immigration detainees, psychiatric hospitals, and even social care homes) all across the 47-member Council of Europe - one of the few international blocs that offer platforms for dialogue with Eastern European regimes considered to have poor human rights records, such as Russia, Azerbaijan, and Ukraine. The method combines the carrot of talks with government officials and the stick of ad hoc visits, which all members are committed to allowing into their prisons. Once inside, the CPT also has the right to interview any detainees it chooses - in private, though of course the detainees have the right to refuse. \"The first thing to say is how important the CPT is,\" said Carla Ferstman, director of Redress, a UK-based organization that helps torture survivors. \"As a result of their boot work over a very long period of time, the UN has set up a global system which in many ways mirrors the approach of the CPT.\" But given that the committee has no powers to enforce its proposals to governments, there are question marks over its effectiveness. \"In the report, they complain about how some of the recommendations they've made have not been implemented,\" said Ferstman. \"It's a sign that they're a little bit frustrated.\" But in the long run, she maintains, the CPT has more than proved its value. \"The dialogue that they are able to have is really important,\" she said. \"Looking long-term, they have been very effective.\" CIA collusion, asylum seekers The CPT's report comes a day after Amnesty International released its own report on European collusion with the CIA's torture program. While the CPT's report examines more prosaic day-to-day mistreatment, rather than mass rendition of terrorist suspects at the behest of the US, there are obvious links between the two, since some countries - such as Poland, Macedonia, and the UK - are highlighted in both reports. \"What is finally coming out in all of this is that the Europeans, despite all the criticism of the Bush and Obama administrations on the use of torture - so many of them connived,\" said Judy Dempsey, senior associate at Carnegie Europe. \"It's really a double standard. This report is quite damning and quite shameful, and it follows the Amnesty International one as well.\" The CPT's work also mentions the mistreatment of asylum seekers, a problem increasingly afflicting European countries that take in the largest number of asylum seekers - particularly Spain, Italy, and Greece. \"With Greece there are two things to remember,\" Dempsey told DW. \"A - the appalling situation of the prison system, and B - the lack of training among police of how to deal with asylum seekers. Awful things have happened. Parallel to this is the illegal detention centers. There have been lots of cases of terrible mistreatment over the last several years.\" \"Immigration detention is a growing issue,\" added Ferstman. \"In the UK, there was a whole parliamentary inquiry into one immigration detention center, where some of the women alleged that guards propositioned them in order to get quick treatment on their claims. Each country has its own history of torture.\"",

        "target": "Dresden marks 70 years since massive Allied bombing Seventy years ago, Allied bombers attacked Dresden, killing tens of thousands of people, the majority of them civilians and refugees. Every year, the East German city remembers its dead. DW's Naomi Conrad was on hand. As the tram trundled through Dresden's drab suburbs on Friday morning, a prim, elderly woman suddenly turned to her friend sitting on the seat beside her: \"You know, my mother never told me about the bombings.\" She shrugged, then, after a moment's pause, continued. \"It must have been such unspeakable hell that she just couldn't talk about it,\" the woman said. She was referring to February 13, 1945 - the morning, exactly 70 years ago, when Allied bombers swooped down on an unsuspecting city famous for its baroque architecture and that, until that point, had survived the war mostly unscathed. That was to change in the course of three dreadful days: As the bombs rained down on the city, its churches and palaces were turned to rubble. Up to 25,000 people - many of them refugees fleeing the advancing Soviet Red Army - died in the inferno that raged in the city for days. \"There was nothing left, nothing,\" a frail, bent man with a checkered cap recalled, \"just rubble and death.\" He was leaning on the balustrade of a viewing platform in Dresden's old gasometer, staring down at the 360-degree painting by the Iranian-German artist Yadegar Asisi; sirens howled from hidden speakers and strobe lighting illuminated the ruined churches and black smoke billowing from the burnt skeletons that were once buildings. The man swallowed, his voice hoarse, barely audible: \"It's so hard being here.\" The soundtrack and images, he said, \"bring back too many memories.\" 'So, so many dead' He was 15, he recalled, working on a school essay when the sirens began to wail. He never finished the essay. Instead, he ran for shelter with his family. When they returned home three days later, the roof had been blown off, the windows smashed. \"But we were lucky: We survived,\" he said. \"There were so, so many dead.\" His voice broke and, muttering an apology, he shuffled off. The bombings were intended to break the German population's morale - a decision that to many was incomprehensible, given that the war had long been decided and Dresden's economic and strategic importance was relatively minimal. Consequently, the death and destruction wreaked by the Allied bombers quickly became a tool, first for the Nazi propagandists in the last months of the war, then by the East German regime for its anti-West propaganda, and then later by neo-Nazi groups, who traditionally congregate on February 13. Even today, \"the debate continues about guilt and innocence, even about the exact number of victims,\" Dresden Mayor Helma Orosz told a packed audience, including delegations from abroad, gathered for a memorial service in the city's Frauenkirche, which in 2005 was rebuilt with the help of private donations after Germany's reunification, many of them from the United States and Great Britain. Call for peace \"War, hatred and violence begin in people's minds,\" Orosz said. \"We must resist any attempt at once again categorizing people based on their origin and skin color,\" she added, referring to what has often been described as a right-wing catchall movement called PEGIDA, generally translated as Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West, which has taken to the streets in Dresden since October. Later, on a platform overlooking thousands of people, many of them wearing white roses as a sign of peace while bracing the icy cold outside the church, Orosz called on Dresden to remember every victim of the Nazi terror - a plea that was reiterated by German President Joachim Gauck when he took to the microphone: \u201cWe don't want the pain that people suffered here to be misused by others.\u201d Behind him, the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, who, back in the Frauenkirche, had talked of the \u201cmiracle that peace in Europe represents,\u201d leaned in closer to his interpreter. Then, as evening fell over Dresden and church bells tolled, thousands - possibly as many as 10,000, according to the city's press office - lined up along Dresden's riverfront, holding hands to commemorate the dead and call for peace as police men dressed in black riot gear looked on. \"I can remember it all,\" Siegfriede Leonhard, a vivacious woman in her late 70s said. She was 7 when the bombs fell, she said, and had been coming to the commemorations in Dresden \"for at least 60 years.\" Sometimes, she said, stomping her feet to keep warm, she wondered whether she shouldn't remember at home, alone. \"",
        "generated_story": "German city of Dresden hit by Allied bombings On February 13, 1945, a German city in eastern Germany was attacked by the Allied forces. The bombing of the city's Frauenkirche was the first major Allied attack on the German capital since the end of World War II. German Chancellor Joachim Gauck ordered the evacuation of all German citizens from Dresden, the capital of Germany's former East German colony of Saxony and the former Soviet republic of Great Britain. \"We have to move quickly,\" said Helma Orosz, Dresden's mayor, referring to the bombing. She said that the attack was part of a \"new wave of anti-Semitism\" in Germany, and that it was \"the first time that we have seen such an attack in the history of our country.\" \"It was a new wave,\" she said, adding that \"we are not going to allow it to happen again.\" The attack came just a few days after the Soviet Red Army had attacked Dresden in February 1945 with a series of bombings that killed more than 1,000 people and wounded hundreds more. In the aftermath of that attack, German authorities declared a state of emergency, with the aim of preventing further attacks on German cities and towns. A number of German politicians and civil servants were killed and hundreds of thousands of civilians were injured, according to a report by DW's Naomi Conrad. Many of those killed were civilians, such as Yadegar Asisi, an Iranian-born artist who painted a swastika for the Nazi regime in Dresden. He was one of only a handful of people to have been killed by an Allied bombing during the war. His work, which was published in German in 2005, was translated into English as \"Nazi propaganda,\" and he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work. During his time in office, he worked as a police officer and as an interior minister. When he returned to Dresden from the United States in October 2005 to take part in a peace conference in Berlin, his wife and three children were among the victims. They were all refugees from East Germany at the time, as were many of his friends and relatives, including his sister and brother-in-law. After his return to Germany from exile in Britain in 2006, Chancellor Angela Merkel announced that she would no longer be able to attend the conference because she was ill and unable to work in her native Germany. But she did not rule out the possibility of reunification between the two countries. DW: What do you think of this attack?"

        "target": "Experts: Taliban have not changed strategy with Kabul restaurant attack The weekend attack on a Kabul restaurant frequented by foreigners came as no surprise to international organizations on the ground. Experts don't believe the Taliban have changed their strategy to target more civilians. Dramatic scenes must have played out in the restaurant: Guests sought cover under tables as a group of terrorists shot wildly into the dining rooms. News agencies report the restaurant owner tried in vain to fend off the attackers. He was among the more than 20 people who perished, most of whom were employees at international organizations. The attackers were also among the dead. During the evening dinner rush, at 7:00 p.m. Friday (17.01.2014), one of three Taliban members detonated his explosives-laden vest and blew a breach in the highly secured restaurant. Neither the man-high blast walls, nor the secured access points with armed guards could stop the attackers. The two remaining terrorists were killed later in a firefight with security forces at the scene. No change in Taliban strategy The suicide bombing on the popular Lebanese restaurant, Taverna Du Liban, in the high-end Kabul neighborhood of Wazir Akbar Khan was the worst attack so far in 2014. Afghanistan votes for a new president in April; and the international troops are scheduled to withdraw from the country by the end of the year. Although there are plans for a small contingent to remain in Afghanistan, President Hamid Karzai first has to sign a bilateral security agreement with the United States. But he continues to play for time. In this context, the Taliban may be targeting civilians more in order to drive out not just the military coalition, but the entire international community. Yet \"as horrible as this incident is, I don't see a change in strategy,\" said Thomas Ruttig, the co-director of the Afghan Analysts Network. Similar attacks have also been launched before, \"at least 12 to 15 times in the past eight years,\" Ruttig said. The worst attack was in 2012 at Qargha Lake, a popular weekend destination near Kabul. More than 20 people were killed, all of them Afghans. Extensive security precautions The Taliban, which normally doesn't miss an opportunity for fiery rhetoric, hasn't declared a change in strategy. A spokesman for the Islamist militant group said the attack was retaliation for a NATO airstrike in Parwan Province, a few kilometers north of Kabul. According to an assistant of the Afghan president, seven children and one woman died in the coalition strike. \"You have to carefully monitor the security situation,\" Nils W\u00f6rmer, head of the Konrad Adenauer Institute in Kabul, told DW. \"But I think it's a bit early to talk about a change in [Taliban] strategy.\" W\u00f6rmer's office lies just a few hundred meters from the site of Friday's attack. He could clearly hear the explosion, which shook the window panes in his office. \"It was immediately clear to me that something had happened,\" W\u00f6rmer recounted. But the Konrad Adenauer Institute was prepared. \"We had a relatively concrete warning in the last week related to our neighborhood, and we were very cautious,\" W\u00f6rmer said. He met with colleagues in his secured office. Like most of the international organizations, the Konrad Adenauer Institute is also integrated into the security networks. \"The security precautions are high,\" W\u00f6rmer said. \"But that doesn't exclude the possibility that something similar could happen again.\" But the Afghan security forces have succeeded in preventing many attacks in the past few months, he said. Kabul residents criticize Taliban An informal, impromptu poll by DW's Kabul correspondent, Hussein Sirat, suggested the Taliban are not winning Afghan hearts and minds with such attacks. \"Wherever the Taliban have killed civilians, they have not achieved their goal,\" said Mirwais, a pedestrian in the Kabul city center. Idris, another Kabul resident, seconded Mirwais' sentiment. \"The Taliban intimidate the people so that the security agreement won't be signed,\" he said. \"But the people won't bend to this intimidation.\" How the international organizations adapt to the tense security situation in Kabul will come after many conversations, analyses, and briefings in the following days. But W\u00f6rmer is not thinking about giving up. \"We have a clear agenda and long-term projects, which I considered to be very sensible,\" W\u00f6rmer said. \"I am of the opinion, as I was before, that what I'm doing here with the Konrad Adenauer Institute is worth the risks.\"",
        "generated_story": "Afghan Analysts Network: The Taliban haven't changed their strategy with the Kabul restaurant attack The Afghan government has not changed its strategy in the wake of the deadly attack on a popular restaurant in Kabul. Afghan analysts say the Taliban are not changing their approach to Afghanistan. \"The Taliban don't have a strategy for Afghanistan,\" said Nils W\u00f6rmer, an analyst at the Konrad Adenauer Institute in Kandahar province. Wazir Akbar Khan's restaurant, Taverna Du Liban, was attacked by the Afghan Taliban on 17.01.2014. The attack took place on the Qargha Lake in Parwan Province, the capital of Afghanistan's most populous province, near the border with Pakistan. A Taliban spokesman said the attack was carried out in retaliation for President Hamid Karzai's decision to step down from office in April. According to the spokesman, Afghan security forces have been fighting the insurgents since the beginning of 2014, but the group has yet to make any major breakthroughs in their fight against the government. Last month, a suicide bomber blew himself up in front of a crowd of about 100 people, killing at least 30 people and wounding more than 100 others, according to Afghan officials. In the aftermath of that attack, Taliban leaders have vowed to carry out more attacks against Afghan civilians, particularly in rural areas such as the western Ghazni region, where they control large swathes of land. However, it is not clear whether the attackers are still planning to attack the restaurant or whether they will continue to do so until the end of this year. DW: What do you think about this latest attack? Wirmer: I think it's a good thing that the people of Kabul are aware of what's going on, and that they're going to keep fighting until they see what they can do to stop the attacks. What's important is that we can see that there is a change in strategy. It's not just about the money. There's also the fact that people are willing to give up their own lives to fight for the interests of their country. That's something that's very important to see in Afghanistan, because it has become a very dangerous place to live and work in. We have to be careful what we say to each other. But we also need to look at what is happening in our own country and what can be done to help our country move forward. This is something we've been talking about for a long time.\" Wary of Taliban attacks, W\u00fcrmer told DW that he doesn't see any reason to believe that this attack will be the last. He believes that it will only be a last resort."

        "target": "Teabag filter cleans water with nanotechnology A new water filter developed in South Africa could provide millions of people with clean drinking water. The filter, about the size and shape of a teabag, would be inexpensive, easy to distribute and simple to use. Marelize Botes is conducting a final set of tests on a new type of diminutive water filter before industrial production can begin. The microbiologist pours water from a plastic bottle though a high-tech, teabag-sized filter before analyzing it in her in her laboratory at the University of Stellenbosch in South Africa. \"The filter is much cheaper than bottled water as well as any other filter on the market,\" she told Deutsche Welle. Instead of being filled with black or green tea, the bag contains active carbon granules and is made from nanofibers treated with biocide, which kills bacteria rather than simply filtering them from the water. Nanotech for pennies \"This project takes nanotechnology to the poorest of the poor people who live in this world, and it will make a difference in their lives,\" said Eugen Cloete, who in addition to inventing the filter is dean of the faculty of science at Stellenbosch University and chair of Stellenbosch University's Water Institute. With some 300 million people in Africa - and over a billion worldwide - living without access to clean drinking water, the need for such a filter is huge. When in mass production, the developers said they expect the teabag to cost just a few South African cents (under half a US cent and under a third of a euro cent). In addition to being inexpensive, Botes said, the filter is also easy to distribute to rural area and simple to use as it can be place in an adapter that fits on nearly any regular-sized plastic bottle. Each filter can clean one liter (one quart) of the most polluted water to the point where it is completely safe to drink. Once used, the filter can be disposed of and is biodegradable. African countries, led by Somalia, Mauritania and Sudan, were ranked to have the most vulnerable water supplies, according to a June report by UK-based risk consultancy firm Maplecroft. Decentralized use The filter's small size and light weight make it ideal for rural areas where other means of filtration do not exist, Cloete said. \"It is simply impossible to build purification infrastructure at every polluted stream,\" Cloete said. \"So we have to take the solution to the people. The water is cleaned right then and there when you drink from the bottle.\" The filter is now undergoing testing by the South African Bureau of Standards, after which Cloete and his team hope it can be rolled out to the United Nations and non-governmental organizations that have expressed interest in it by the end of the year. The project grew out of research into larger filters, according to Cloete. \"We were busy developing filters for larger applications, but when you do the tests in the labatory you do the tests on a much smaller scale,\" he said. \"The results we were getting on a smaller amount of water promoted me to think about a smaller application.\" Author: Joerg Poppendieck, Sean Sinico Editor: Anke Rasper",
        "generated_story": "South Africa launches Teabag-sized water filter for decentralized drinking in Africa South Africa's water institute has launched a new technology that will allow people to drink water from their taps without having to pay for it. Marelize Botes, head of the Water Institute at the University of Stellenbosch in the South African capital, told Deutsche Welle that the technology could be used to make drinking water more efficient and efficient. \"The technology is being tested in a laboratory and is expected to be available by the end of this year,\" she said in an interview. The project is part of a project to develop a system for decentralizing water supply to the country's cities and towns. It will be the first of its kind to use a water-based system, which can be easily adapted to meet the needs of people living in rural areas, according to a press release from the project's lead scientist, Eugen Cloete, who is also a professor of water science and technology at Johannesburg University. In the US, the water technology has been used in Somalia and Mauritania, where the government has banned the use of bottled water for drinking purposes. However, it is not yet ready for use in other African countries, such as the UK, Somalia, Sudan and the United Nations (UNO) which have banned water purification in their countries. At the same time, there is a growing demand for clean water in many developing nations. This is due to an increasing number of cases where water is contaminated with bacteria and other toxins. According to one expert, this is the most common problem in developing countries where people are drinking from tap water. Another expert says the problem is that there are too many people who don't know what to do with their own water, and that they are not able to afford to buy a large, expensive water system.

It's very easy and the best bit is, it can be reused. Maybe it will come back to you on your birthday. 1. All you need is a piece of fabric big enough to wrap your gift, a ribbon long enough to go right around it, and if you want to make a gift tag, you will also need a piece of old cardboard, a hole punch and another small piece of ribbon. Ready? 2. No, wait, we forgot the present. Get that, and you have everything you need. Spread the fabric on the ground and put your gift on top 3. Fold the fabric around the gift you are wrapping 4. With the last little bit, you don't tuck it under, but create a little flap on top 5. Fold that flap over like this 6. Take one end of the parcel and tuck the fabric inside, BEHIND the gift inside 7. You can take your time to wiggle it all inside. Make it as flat as you can 8. Once it is all inside, turn to the other end and do the same thing again 9. When you have done both ends, it should look like this. Your present is all tucked up inside and you don't need any tape to keep it closed 10. Now for the ribbon. Place the gift on top of it 11. Tie the bow 12. So it looks like this. Finished? If you want a gift tag, that comes now. If you don't you're done! 13. Cut a piece out of an old cardboard box and make a hole in it using a hole punch. Watch your fingers though ;) 14. Put a piece of short ribbon through your hole 15. Tie the tag to your gift 16. And you are finished! P.S. You can either ask your friend to reuse the fabric, and show them how to wrap with it, or if they don't like that idea, you can take it home with you to use again the next time. And remember, you don't have to buy the fabric. You can use an old pillow case, an old t-shirt or skirt, or whatever you want. You can even make your ribbon from an old t-shirt if you don't have any.

        "target": "European court overturns law requiring German-language skills for spouse visas The European Court of Justice has overturned a German law requiring foreign spouses from certain non-EU countries to take a language test before receiving a visa. The ruling primarily affects Germany's Turkish minority. The European Union's highest court on Thursday ruled in favor of a Turkish citizen, who was denied a visa to live in Germany with her husband, because she was illiterate and therefore unable to demonstrate basic German-language skills. According to the court, a lack of language skills shouldn't automatically lead to the rejection of an entry visa application. Instead, Germany must consider the unique circumstances of each individual case. The court went on to say that quickly granting visas for spouses improves the quality of life and promotes the integration of foreign residents. Specifically addressing the case of the Turkish plaintiff, the court ruled that the rejection of her visa had violated a bilateral treaty between Turkey and the EU. In 1970, Brussels and Ankara agreed not to tighten their residency laws for each other's citizens. Law only applies to some In 2007, Germany introduced the requirement that spouses from certain non-EU countries must demonstrate a basic grasp of German before being granted a visa to live in Germany with their husbands or wives. Spouses affected by the law are required to obtain a basic language certificate from recognized centers, such as Germany's Goethe Institute, proving that they have an A1 level, or \"Beginning German\" language ability. The German government claims that the goal of the language requirement is to prevent forced marriages as well as marriages made simply for the sake of obtaining a visa. Citizens of European Free Trade Association (EFTA) member states are exempt from the language requirement. That includes Iceland, Lichtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. In addition, citizens of Australia, Canada, Israel, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea and the United States also don't have to demonstrate German-language skills. slk/xx (AFP, AP, dpa, KNA)",

It also said that the EU's Free Trade Association (FTA) should be able to regulate the use of German as a foreign language in its member states.

        "target": "Bayern Munich coast to win over Nuremberg Bayern Munich wrapped up the 12th Bundesliga match day with an easy win over Nuremberg. Freiburg scored an extra time goal to squeak out a victory against Hoffenheim. Bayern Munich cruised to a 3-0 victory at home against Bavarian rival FC Nuremberg on Sunday, closing the German soccer tables for the weekend. Striker Mario Gomez got things going in the 10th minute for Bayern and also scored the final goal in the 75th minute off a corner kick from Franck Ribery. Ribery came on as a substitute five minutes earlier, making his first appearance for the team since injuring his ankle in September. Near the end of the match, Gomez had an opportunity for his third goal on a penalty kicked but missed. Thirty points at break Phillipp Lahm successfully converted a penalty kick in the 57th minute to round out the scoring for Bayern. The victory for Bayern moved them into sixth place in the table with 19 points and has continued a slow shift in momentum following a rough start to the season. Bayern coach Louis van Gaal said after the game he hoped his team would have 30 points by the end of the first half of the season in five more matches. Cisse saves win for Freiburg In Sunday's other Bundesliga match, Senegal striker Papiss Demba Cisse broke a scoreless deadlock with a goal in the 91st minute to give Freiburg a 1-0 win over Hoffenheim. Cisse has now scored 10 goals in 12 games and is currently the Bundesliga's second highest scorer. The win moves Freiburg into fourth place in the table with 21 points, one ahead of Frankfurt in fourth and three behind Bayer Leverkusen and Mainz, in second and third place, respectively. Nuremberg drop to 10th place with 18 points at the end of a very tight middle group. Just three points separate Nuremburg from Freiburg. Hoffenheim also have 18 points but are two places ahead of Nuremberg in eighth place on goal difference. Author: Matt Zuvela (dpa, sid) Editor: Sean Sinico",
        "generated_story": "Bayern Munich 3-0 Freiburg: Papiss Demba Cisse seals 3rd Bundesliga win for Bayern Bayern Munich have secured a third consecutive win in the Bundesliga. The win over FC Nuremberg on Sunday was the club's third in as many games. It also marked the first time in club history that a player from Senegal has scored a goal in a Bundesliga match. Bayern, who have won three of their last four league games, have a three-game winning streak in all competitions. On Sunday, the Bavarian side came from behind to beat their Bundesliga rivals, 1-1, at home to Hoffenheim. German coach Phillipp Lahm said his side were \"very happy\" with the result. \"We are very happy,\" he told reporters after the match, adding that he was happy with his team-mates' performances in recent weeks. He also said that his players were happy to be playing in front of the home fans, and that they would be happy if they could get a win against a team that has been struggling for a few weeks now. After a frustrating first half, Bayern were able to get back into the game with a solid performance, but they were unable to find a way past the visitors. In the second period, they had to settle for just a single goal, with Mario Gomez scoring the only goal for their side. That was Bayern's first goal since the end of last season's Bundesliga season, when they went on to win the league by a margin of 10 points. They had been in great form in their previous three matches, scoring four goals and conceding just one in that span. But they are now on course for the same kind of success this time around, thanks in large part to the goalscoring prowess of midfielder Pisse and striker Franck Ribery. Both of them have been on the pitch for some time now, so it is no surprise that the German side have come into this match with an impressive record. Last year's Champions League final was won by Bayern at the expense of Cologne, where they lost 2-2 to Mainz last month. This time, however, it was a different story, as the two sides had a very different approach to their matches in September and October. For one thing, both teams are still in good shape, while the other has a lot of work to do ahead of this weekend's trip to Cologne. However, there is still a long way to go before Bayern can get their first win since September. Author: Matt Zuvela (dpa, sid) Editor: Sean Sinico"

They were originally arrested for taking photographs of restricted areas. Slovak citizens detained by the Iranian authorities on suspicion of taking photographs out of bounds have returned home, said Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico. Eight people in total were arrested in May after taking photographs of restricted areas. A Slovakian news website said the group was detained near the central city of Isfahan, where Iran has nuclear facilities. The six that have been freed attended a news conference held by Prime Minister Fico in the capital, Bratislava on Sunday. Fico told reporters that the government was working to secure the release of the remaining two paragliders who are stiil in custody. \"Negotiations were fair and their result is the release of six out of eight detainees,\" Fico was quoted as saying on the government's website. He added that Slovakia had not made any \"financial commitments\" in the negotiation process. Detainees 'unaware' of rule-breaking One of the released paragliders, Vladislav Frigo, said the group did not break any rules it was aware of. \"We had information that there was a ban on taking photographs below the height of 2,300 metres. We were taking pictures from higher (altitudes),\" said Frigo. He added that the detainees were well treated, had access to television, a refrigerator and could cook for themselves as well as getting regular meals. Foreign nationals accused of spying In recent years, Iran has levelled accusations of espionage against both foreign nationals and Iranians. Two U.S. citizens - Josh Fattal and Shane Bauer - were sentenced to eight years in jail for spying after being arrested while hiking along the Iraq-Iran border in 2009. They denied espionage - neighbouring Oman helped secure their release in 2011 by posting bail of 1-million US dollars (756,000 euros). Last year, Iranian-American Amir Hekmati was sentenced to death for spying for the CIA, but judges overturned the decision and ordered a retrial. lw/ipj (Reuters, dpa)",
        "generated_story": "Vladislav Frigo, a Slovak paraglider, has been arrested in Iran on suspicion of spying for the U.S. The charges stem from an alleged spying operation in the Iranian city of Isfahan in 2009. Slovakia's prime minister, Robert Fico, was arrested on Sunday in connection with the alleged espionage operation. Slovaks, who are not officially recognized by the United States as citizens of the Republic of Slovakia, have been living in exile since 2009, when they fled to Iran. They are believed to have fled the country to escape persecution in neighboring Iran, where they were detained by Iranian authorities in May. In a statement released Sunday, Slovakia said the arrests were the result of an \"ongoing investigation\" into allegations of espionage. \"The investigation is ongoing,\" the statement said, adding that it was not possible to prove the charges were politically motivated. It did not elaborate on the allegations, however, and said that the investigation was being carried out \"in accordance with law and procedure.\" The arrests came as the Czech Prime Minister's office said on Monday that a special investigation team had been set up to look into the case, which was first reported by Reuters news agency, citing unnamed sources close to the matter. A court in Bratislava has ordered the arrest of all six suspects, including the head of state's intelligence agency and deputy director of national intelligence, Josh Fattal, as well as two other officials, according to a court document released by prosecutors in a separate case filed last week. Prosecutors have said they are seeking to extradite the men to face charges of conspiracy to commit espionage and money laundering. According to court documents, they have also been ordered to pay a total of 7.56 million euros ($8.6 million) to Iranian prosecutors. Ficio has denied the accusations, saying that he had no evidence to back them up. He also said he was \"not aware of any evidence\" to support them, but that they had \"nothing to do with any of this.\" Slovakia is one of several countries in which the US and the European Union have imposed sanctions against Iran over its involvement in Iraq and other conflicts of interest. Last month, the CIA said it had found evidence that Iran's Revolutionary Guards had attempted to interfere with a parliamentary vote on a bill to ban the sale of US passports to foreign nationals."

        "target": "French presidential debate does little to woo undecided voters This year's French presidential race is perhaps the most closely watched election in recent history. Many voters are still undecided, including those in the Paris caf\u00e9 where DW's Jake Cigainero saw the latest TV debate. Just over two weeks ahead of the first round of voting in France's presidential election, all 11 candidates met for the second televised debate of the campaign. It was the first time in the history of French elections that the entire official ballot shared a television stage. This race for the Elysee is perhaps the most closely watched election in the history of the Fifth Republic in view of conservative candidate Francois Fillon's embezzlement charges, the deterioration of the left, political amateur Emmanuel Macron's surprise surge to the top, and the rise of Marine Le Pen's National Front. With so much media attention on the five main candidates, Tuesday's debate felt almost like a consolation for the six other candidates rarely in the spotlight. For French voters watching the televised debate at Cafe des Phares on Place de la Bastille, the saturated stage kept the candidates from detailed discussion of pressing issues. For those who are still undecided, the debate did little to bring them closer to choosing their pick for president. Vincent Couronne, a researcher, said it was good to see candidates who don't get as much media attention. However, 11 candidates at once for the political spectator was overkill. \"It wasn't very interesting. It's just one position after another. There's no real debate. It's not like when it was just five candidates.\" Boredom all round Charlotte Theuvenin and her friends, all students in their early 20s, tuned out early on from boredom and exasperation. \"It was too flat and too hypocritical. Fillon and Le Pen play with our money, then say they did nothing and that they are good for our country,\" she said. As though addressing the candidates in front of her on the TV screen, she added, \"How dare you talk about being president when you use our money for your own interests.\" Le Pen had come under fire over accusations that she misused public funds to pay bodyguards as parliamentary assistants. Francois Fillon of Les Republicains, meanwhile, is under investigation for allegedly paying family members more than 1 million euros ($1.1 million) for government work they never carried out. Frequently casting a blank stare at his opponents, Fillon also seemed bored, or at least more subdued compared to the first debate. Couronne said, \"Fillon seems to be not there. Probably because he knows all the small candidates can attack him on the criminal offenses he's accused of.\" Debate watchers cited Europe as the most important issue of this election, with many fearing Le Pen's promise to tear France out of the European Union in a so-called Frexit. Though no one at the cafe vocally supported Le Pen's plan, several acknowledged the EU is a pressure point for France. \"France's place in Europe in relation to Germany is a very important issue,\" said student Thibault Cirier. \"The general problem is France has lost its influence at the European level over the years, and that needs to be remedied, because France is one of the founders of Europe and should have a strong place in the union. The EU is also important for cohesion and to have a strong position internationally.\" Caf\u00e9 viewers say no to Le Pen Cirier was initially excited by Macron when he launched his campaign, but ultimately decided there was no substance. Now he says he will probably vote for far-left candidate Jean-Luc Melenchon. Kevser Taspinar also said she liked Melenchon for his fighting spirit and that \"he throws barbs.\" As a practicing Muslim who wears a headscarf, she said the most important issue for her is laicite, France's state institution of secularism. \"For me Hamon has the best interpretation of this. Maybe Hamon,\" Taspinar said hesitating. \"I'm still undecided, because there's Melenchon.\" Another viewer, Marie Dubois, said that although she really liked Melenchon, she had definitively decided on Macron. \"Melenchon has a way of putting humanity in politics and giving hope,\" she said. \"But Macron is the only possible candidate.\" With polls putting Le Pen and Macron in the second round on May 7, the undecided voters at this Paris cafe said they were certain which candidate they would not for vote for in that scenario. \"Definitely Macron. There is no way I am going to vote for Le Pen,\" Theuvenin said. \"I will never vote for that woman or Front National, no matter who is running against them in the second round.\" Tuesday was the final debate for Macron and Melenchon, two of the crowd-pleasers among the candidates. Both have pulled out of the third debate on grounds that it cuts too close to the first vote just two days later on April 23.",
        "generated_story": "France's far-right National Front faces off against Le Pen, Francois Fillon The French presidential candidate for France's presidential election on Tuesday, May 7, is facing off with the far right in the country's capital, the Elysee. French student Thibault Cirier is one of the leading candidates for the French presidency. He's a student at the Ecole des Republicains in Paris, where he's studying business and politics. \"I've always wanted to be a part of this party,\" he told DW's Jake Cigainero in an interview on the sidelines of a rally in his hometown of Paris. The student said that he and his fellow students had a lot to learn about politics in France, and that it was important for them to get the job done in order to stay on course for a second round of presidential elections in May. But, he added, \"It's not just about the candidates, it's also about how they're going to win.\" \"The candidates are all very different,\" said the student, who hopes to become the next president of France next year, adding that \"they're all the same people, they all have their own ideas and they have to work together to make sure that they get what they want.\" In his interview with DW, Thierry Hamon, a political science student from the Paris suburb of Leuvenin, said he was \"very impressed\" by the candidate's style of politics, which he described as \"a mixture of old-school and new-age politics.\" He also pointed to the fact that his father, Jean-Luc, was born in Germany and was a member of his mother's family when he moved to France as a child. His father was also a teacher at a nearby school, but he didn't have any experience in politics at that time. In the end, his parents were able to afford to send him to Germany, France and Germany to study and work on his thesis. And, as far as he knows, Germany is the only country in Europe that is willing to give him a chance to pursue his dream of becoming president. So far, so good. DW: What do you think?"

        "target": "German Interior Ministry Claims Progress on Crime Interior Minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble released his department's official statistics concerning crime in 2006 in Berlin on Tuesday. And the news was good -- most of the numbers were down compared to the preceding year. Germany's streets were never particularly dangerous, but according to the Interior Ministry, they are now safer than at any time since statistics have been collected. Reported criminal offenses on the whole dropped by 1.4 percent over 2005 -- to a total of just over 6.3 million. \"The statistics show reductions in crime among children, adolescents and teenagers, as well as adults,\" said Sch\u00e4uble. He added that criminality among foreigners living in Germany also fell, saying that this development reflected Germany's efforts to integrate non-Germans. Drugs offenses were down 7.8 percent, followed by theft and street crime, which both declined by four percent or more. Youth violence Vandalism, on the other hand, was up 5.9 percent. Fraud rose slightly, as did violent crime -- among young people by an alarming 4.5 percent. Berlin Interior Minister Erhart K\u00f6rting said that was part of a decade-long trend in Germany. \"As many experts have pointed out,\" K\u00f6rting said, \"the potential for violence in society is increasing.\" The head of the German Police Officers' Union Konrad Freiberg also said those figures showed that German society was not truly getting safer. Frankfurt tops most-dangerous list Crime was down in Frankfurt am Main, but it's still the German city with the greatest number of criminal offenses person 100,000 people. Hanover was a close second, followed by D\u00fcsseldorf, Bremen and Berlin. The total percentage of criminal cases solved by German police also improved slightly from 55 to 55.4 percent. According to the study, Germany's safest place was Bergisch Gladbach, a city of 100,000 inhabitants in the west of the country -- coincidentally, model Heidi Klum's home town.",
        "generated_story": "Sch\u00e4uble: State of Crime in Germany The state of the union is in the grip of a \"state of crime\" in German society, according to a report released Tuesday by the German Interior Ministry. The report, which is based in Frankfurt am Main, is set to be published on Tuesday. It is the first report from Germany's interior ministry, published in 2006, that shows that crime is on the rise across the country. According to the report's author Konrad Freiberg, the state is \"increasingly becoming more and more difficult to control.\" \"It is becoming harder and harder to stop crime,\" he told a news conference in Berlin. \"We have to make sure that we don't allow criminals to get away with murder and other forms of violence.\" The German government, however, said that it would continue to fight against crime, even if it was only through the use of force. In the past, police and prosecutors have been able to use force against suspected criminals, but the government has been unable to do so in recent years. On Tuesday, German prosecutors said they had opened a criminal investigation into a number of cases, including the murder of two men in 2005 and the attempted rape of three women in Bremen. Prosecutors said the charges were politically motivated, and that the investigation was carried out with the cooperation of prosecutors and police. A spokesman for the prosecutors' office said investigators had found no evidence of any criminal activity committed against the two women, adding that they were not involved in any organized crime at the time of their arrest."

        "target": "All or nothing for Bayern in Champions final Bayern Munich have one last chance to salvage a season that has otherwise been marked by their inability to beat Borussia Dortmund: a win against Chelsea in the Champions League final at their home stadium. All season long, Bayern Munich have been consumed with achieving one goal: reaching the final of the Champions League, held at their own Allianz Arena in Munich, and raising the trophy in front of their home fans. After finishing a distant second place to Dortmund in the Bundesliga and dismally losing to them 5-2 in the German Cup final, Bayern Munich are in a must-win situation Saturday against Chelsea. A loss would be the final straw in a disappointing season for a team that can't stand second place. A win for Bayern would mean redemption, to some extent, for their shortcomings in the league. Key players were rested down the stretch in the Bundesliga, especially before the two legs of Bayern's European semifinal against Real Madrid. That was an indication that Bayern had given up on the league and put all their eggs in one basket, hoping for a big payoff with the Champions League title. The same can be said for the German Cup final against Dortmund: true, Bayern essentially beat themselves by making mistake after mistake, but Bayern could, if they win Saturday, wipe the slate clean. Saving the season Win this match, and all will be forgiven in Munich. Lose, and it will be Bayern's second straight season without a piece of hardware, not to mention the heartbreak of losing the biggest match at Allianz Arena since it opened in 2005. \"We must not even think about [losing],\" said Bayern's Franck Ribery on Thursday. \"If we win the Champions League, then we can forget about not winning the league or the cup, nobody will care about that.\" Bayern are a team that thrives under pressure, and the high stakes of this match will be good for them. Chelsea are a team that showed in their semifinal upset of Barcelona that they can rise to a challenge, even if that challenge is simply holding on against a superior opponent. \"We are not the favorites of the game, we are playing away,\" Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech said on Thursday. \"It is very rare when you have the home team playing in the home stadium, using the home dressing room, so I think the advantage goes to Bayern Munich because of that. But we know we have a chance and we will fight for it.\" But this match will come down to the team that can better take advantage of holes that have been blown in each team's defense due to injuries and suspensions. Filling the gaps Between the two sides, seven starting players will miss out on the final. Chelsea saw Raul Meireles, Ramires, and Branislav Ivanovic each get their third yellow card in the second leg against Barcelona, and captain John Terry was given a straight red. Terry and Ivanovic are fixtures on Chelsea's backline, which was already at half-strength due to hamstring injuries suffered by Gary Cahill and David Luiz. Chelsea coach Roberto di Matteo hopes those two are fit enough for the final, since Chelsea will need all the help they can get in the back. For Bayern, David Alaba and Holger Badstuber - both defenders - and Luiz Gustavo, a defensive midfielder, are also suspended for picking up three yellow cards. The impact of the suspensions will hit Chelsea the most. In addition to a weakened back line, Meireles and Ramires are mainstays on offense, supporting strikers Didier Drogba or Fernando Torres. With Ramires out, Drogba could start as striker, with Torres moving to the wing. At any rate, there is more uncertainty in The Blues' lineup than there is in Bayern's, who will be able to rely on striker Mario Gomez and the dynamic-duo of Arjen Robben and Ribery on the wings as they have all season. Most of the question marks will still be defensive for both teams, but to think that this is an indication of a high-scoring affair on Saturday would be a discredit to both team's last lines of defense. Between the posts Neither side would be competing in the final if it wasn't for the heroics of the teams' keepers. Cech defended against wave after wave of attacks from Barcelona in the semifinal for Chelsea, and Manuel Neuer showed nerves of steel in Bayern's penalty shootout in the final leg against Real Madrid, blocking penalties from Madrid stars Cristiano Ronaldo and Kaka. Chelsea's best shot will be to come out of the gate at a sprint and gain an early advantage against Bayern, who will be doing everything they can to keep their long-cultivated dream-final in their control. Otherwise, Bayern's determination to salvage their season may be enough to carry them through to the trophy ceremony - at home, just like they planned it.

        "generated_story": "Borussia Dortmund vs. Bayern Munich in Champions League final The Blues are in the final of the German Cup with a chance to reach the last 16, but they have to wait until next week to make it happen. Manchester United striker David Luiz and Manchester City striker Romelu Lukaku are the favorites to win the Bundesliga title next season. The two have been linked since the end of last season, when they were both on loan at the Allianz Arena in Munich, Germany, for the first time since 2006. Lukak, who scored the winning goal against Real Madrid last week, has been named as the Blues' starting goalkeeper for this weekend's match against Barcelona. \"I'm very happy with the way we've been able to get through the group stage,\" said the 27-year-old Lukup, adding that he was \"very happy\" with his performance in Dortmund's 2-1 win over Barcelona on Thursday night. But it's not all about the goals, either. For the second time in as many years, the team has managed to score at least one goal in each of its three games in all competitions. That's a lot of goals for a team that has never won a major trophy in its history, and that's something that can only be achieved if you have the right combination of strikers and midfielders. And that combination is what we're going to do in this match. We'll see if we can get the result that we want, because we know what's in store for us. It's all up to the players to decide what they want to play for next year. If they decide to go for it, it will be the same as last year's final, in which they lost to Barcelona in a penalty shootout. Coach Roberto di Matteo, meanwhile, is hoping that his side can do it again. He's been in great form in his first two years in charge of Manchester, scoring four goals in 12 games. His first goal came against Borussia in 2005, which he won in extra time. In his second game as a Blues player, he scored three goals and set up one of his best performances in recent years.

He allegedly possessed and exchanged \"a large quantity\" of child pornography. A high-ranking Vatican diplomat will face trial in the Holy See on charges of possessing child pornography in the US and Canada. Catholic priest Carlo Alberto Capella was indicted on Saturday after a Vatican investigation found he had allegedly possessed and exchanged \"a large quantity\" of child pornography during his diplomatic posting. His trial will start on June 22 in front of a Vatican magistrate. If convicted, he could be sentenced to between one and five years in prison and fined between \u20ac2,500 and \u20ac50,000 ($2,100 to $42,000). He is being held in the city's police barracks.

The church rejected the request and withdrew him in September to face investigation at home. Shortly afterwards, Canadian authorities issued an arrest warrant for allegedly possessing and distributing child pornography while visiting a church in Canada. The Capella case has hampered the Catholic Church's attempts to move on from its myriad of pedophile priest scandals. There has been particular focus in recent months on the Chilean branch of the Catholic Church ignoring and covering up of child abuse by pedophile priest Fernando Karadima during the 1980s and 1990s. Pope Francis wrote a letter to Chileans last week expressing \"shame\" for the affair despite previously defending one of the main alleged offenders behind the cover-up. The Vatican's third-highest ranking official, Cardinal George Pell, is facing trial in Australia on abuse-related charges. aw/kms (AFP, Reuters, dpa)",

The Vatican said on Saturday that the charges against the former priest were politically motivated. \"The Vatican is investigating the allegations of sexual abuse of minors,\" Vatican spokesman George Pell said in an email to AFP, adding that \"it is clear that there is a clear and present basis for these allegations.\" The pope also said the Vatican was examining allegations made by former Chilean priest Fernando Karadima, who had been accused of sexually abusing minors in the 1980s and 1990s. He said he had no knowledge of the accusations, but that they were \"not substantiated by the evidence presented to the grand jury,\" according to a statement released by Vatican spokeswoman Christine Lagarde. Last year, the pope ordered the expulsion of three Chilean bishops and three priests from the Catholic Church over allegations they had sex with minors under the cover of a priest's cover-up. In September, Pope Francis announced that Vatican investigators would be looking into the case, which was first reported by The Associated Press on June 22. Vatican: 'We have no evidence to support this allegation' The accusations come as Vatican prosecutors are seeking to extradite the accused priest to Washington, D.C., where he faces up to five years in prison if found guilty of child sex abuse.

According to RIA, Moscow was planning to devote \"at least 100 billion roubles\" (2 billion euros) to the fund, which will mainly be aimed at helping cash-starved Russian banks and key oil companies. \"These 100 billion roubles will be added to the reserve next year, which will allow us to help companies,\" RIA quoted Siluanov as saying. \"We are planning to create a reserve of significant size.\" Just last week, the European Union and the United States imposed a third round of sanctions on Moscow for Russia's involvement in the Ukraine conflict. The latest sanctions target the Russian banking sector as well as key energy firms and arms manufacturers. As one of several companies that have asked for government help, Russia's oil giant Rosneft said it would need 1.5 trillion roubles ($39.70 billion) in aid to keep exploring for oil. Siluanov also told RIA news agency that the decision to stop transferring money to the Pension Fund would hand the budget an extra 309 billion roubles. It will be the second year running that Moscow has stopped transfers of funds from the budget to the Pension Fund, which provides benefits for Russia's pensioners, some invalids and families who have lost their breadwinners. uhe/nz (Reuters, RIA)",

The move is part of a plan by the European Union and the United States to ease sanctions against Russia. \"We are going to set up a multi billion-euro (2 billion euros) fund to help companies that have been hit with sanctions,\" the ministry said in a statement. It did not specify how much the fund would cover, but it is expected to be able to raise up to 1.5 trillion rouble from the EU's sovereign wealth fund, the State Pension Fund (SPSF), the Russian news agency RIA, reported Monday. Russian President Vladimir Putin said the plan would be implemented \"in accordance with the spirit of the agreement reached between the two countries.\" The announcement came a day after the US and EU announced they would impose sanctions on Russian companies in the wake of Ukraine's military intervention in eastern Ukraine, which Moscow accuses Moscow of supporting. Moscow has said it will use the money to finance the new fund. Uhe/nz (Reuters, Ria)"

        "target": "Heidi hits the Big Screen Heidi, the world famous girl from the Swiss Alps who first appeared in a novel 121 years ago, has hit the big screen in a fresh look. A century after the death of Heidi inventor Johanna Spyri, the lovable Alpine heroine is being portrayed in a new film which replaces grassy slopes and mountainous range with city skyscrapers and city streets. The $ 3.5 million \"Heidi\", funded by the Z\u00fcrich-based film company Vega and directed by German film maker Markus Imboden, is to be launched in Germany on Thursday. The making of the film was one of the highlights of a past year of events including exhibitions, lectures and fireworks celebrating the July 7 2001 centenary of the death of Spyri, whose novel \"Heidi\" sold 20 million copies and has been translated in 50 languages worldwide. It is thought to be one of the most successful books of all times. The book has inspired 17 films, including Shirley Temple\u2019s Oscar winning portrayal of Heidi in 1937 and a Japanese cartoon series. Imboden\u2019s remake is the 18th \"Heidi\" film. Blue hair in Berlin According to Vega, \"the film was transmitted to today\u2019s world without losing sight of the original novel\". But Imboden\u2019s new movie is far from the charming original, with its rosy-cheeked, curly-headed Heidi, delicate Clara and goat-tending shepherd Peter\u2019s frail old grandmother. In the first film, Heidi, who lives happily with her grandfather in a tiny hut in the Swiss Alps is plucked from her contented life by her Aunt Dete to live in a stiff, rich family in the bustling metropolis, Frankfurt. Heidi becomes so home-sick, she starts to sleepwalk and is eventually sent home. But not before she causes confusion in the otherwise prim household and brings laughter in the life of the disabled and homely, Clara. The Heidi in the latest film has blue hair, surfs the net and roams the streets of Berlin. Friend and shepherd Peter sheds his rustic pastimes and whizzes down streets on his mountainbike. Clara is not the weak, lame young girl of the Spyri novel, but a moody Britney Spears wannabe. Aunt Dete is a modern-day stylist living fashionably in the German capital. The new surroundings are a far cry from the tranquil days of cow milking, goat- tending and flower-plucking in the verdant meadows of the Swiss Alps. Transforming the Heidi myth According to a Berlin daily, the remake is a \"refreshing Heidi\", adding that the script writers had managed to transform the Heidi \"myth\" into an independent, self-assured girl and not into a \"transfigured mountain heroine\". However, it is just this portrait of a naive and charming alpine heroine that has made Heidi so popular all over the world. Heidi has become a well-known Swiss brand worldwide. Some 60,000 tourists \u2013 half from Japan \u2013 are said to visit the picturesque wine-growing village in Graubuenden, which boasts the original Heidi House and other Heidi related attractions such as winding mountain trails and pastures. Imboden\u2019s film, which is to be launched in Germany on Thursday, will also open elsewhere in Europe, and may reach fans in Japan and South Korea too. Whether Imboden\u2019s blue-haired, computer savvy Heidi will charm her Asian viewers, however, remains to be seen.",
        "generated_story": "The Remake of Heidi in the Swiss Alps Film maker Markus Imboden's latest film, Heidi, is set to be released in Switzerland on July 7 2001. The film is based on the novel by Shirley Temple, which was first published in 1937. Heidi is the first film in a series of short stories about a Swiss woman inventor who became famous for inventing the transistor radio. In the book, the author describes the inventor's invention of the radio and how it was used to communicate with the world at large. \"He invented radio,\" says Johanna Spyri, a German-Swiss film maker who has been working on a film about Heidi for more than a decade. She has also written a book about her experiences with radio, television and film. Her first novel, \"Shirley Temple\" (1937), was published by the German film company Vega, and was translated into English in 2006. It was adapted into German in 2009, when the film premiered in Z\u00fcrich, Germany, as Heidi House. After the movie's release, she moved to Frankfurt, where she now lives with her husband, Peter, their son and daughter-in-law and their dog, Clara, who was born in 1938. They have since moved back to Switzerland and are now living in Germany together with their daughter and step-grandson, Joanna. Their son Peter lives in Frankfurt with his grandmother, his mother and sister. He has a girlfriend and a son, but he is not allowed to travel to Germany. His father is a professor at the University of Zurich, so he doesn't have much time to prepare for his son's arrival. When he returns to his hometown of Graubuenden, he plans to start a new life as a shepherd. But he has to find a way to make it work for him and his family. So he's going to have to take a break from his studies and work on his new book. That's why he decided to write a novel about his experiences as an inventor in his home country of Switzerland. And that's when he found out that his wife was pregnant and that he was expecting a baby. Now he wants to get married and take care of his daughter. This is where Heidi's dream comes to an end, because he can't wait to see what happens to the baby and what he'll be able to do with it."

        "target": "Rethinking the term 'honor killing' The murder of 28-year-old Samia Shahid comes less than two weeks after Qandeel Baloch was killed by her brother. The media was quick to report them as \"honor killings.\" We have to rethink that term, writes Gouri Sharma. When news broke that Samia Shahid, a British-Pakistani woman, had been found dead while visiting relatives in Pakistan at the end of July, mainstream media outlets were quick to report it as an honor killing. It was the second time in two weeks that the media had reported a killing of a woman this way - the first being the murder of Pakistani social media star Qandeel Baloch. There are strong similarities between the cases. Both were murdered in places where they would have felt they were at their safest - in their family homes. It's likely they knew their killers - in Baloch's case, her brother has admitted to strangling her, and Shahid's father and cousin have already been questioned. And as more reports emerge about Shahid's death, it's clear that both were killed because they didn't behave in a way deemed acceptable in a conservative, patriarchal society. 'Deeply offensive' term The debate around terminology in \"honor killings\" isn't new, and after Baloch's murder there were members of the media - such as ABC Australia journalist Juanita Phillips - who decided against using the term, calling it \"deeply offensive\" and referring to it as a \"family killing\" instead. And there are outlets, like the Guardian, that already use inverted commas with the word honor. But some commentators argue that more needs to happen if media consumers are to gain a better understanding of the problem. \"I think an important step for the media would be to refuse to give weight to the term 'honor crimes,'\" said UK-based freelance journalist Shehnaz Khan. \"While it is imperative to highlight that these crimes and murders stem from the roots of misogyny and therefore a false sense of 'honor,' there is absolutely nothing but'shame' within them, as murder is nothing but dishonorable.\" \"The word 'honor' can sometimes carry an almost positive connotation that we are inclined to automatically accept just because it's not happening to us, when the reality is, this a huge problem affecting thousands of girls and women across the world,\" she added. Naming the issue But this isn't a view shared by all journalists. Ruby Hamad, a writer at Australia's Daily Life newspaper, said that the first step in dealing with the issue is naming it. \"There are some deeply patriarchal societies that still limit women's freedom according to old tribal concepts of honor, where, unfairly, the behavior of women reflect on their entire family,\" Hamad said. \"By naming these 'honor killings,' we are acknowledging the role that this misogynistic concept of honor plays, not only in the murders themselves but in these entire societies, and how it entraps both men and women.\" Through the eyes of the perpetrator? There are other issues with the term though. Some have argued that by framing it as such, media outlets are showing the crime through the eyes of the perpetrator - and not through the victim - as they should. And with such cases regularly hitting the headlines, framing is important. The United Nations estimates that around 5,000 women - predominantly from Asia and the Middle East - are killed annually in honor-related crimes, a figure that women's advocacy groups say is closer to 20,000 worldwide. This raises an important cultural element for the media to consider - how far does the term play into cultural stereotypes? \"When honor is considered the most important thing in life, then all family members become expendable,\" Hamad said. \"The collective outweighs the rights of the individual. Does this feed into cultural stereotypes? Perhaps. But that doesn't mean we should pretend that this cultural context isn't there.\" Looking for answers - and alternatives There have been many alternatives put forward by women's advocacy groups, including hate crime, misogynistic murder, femicide and shame killings. But which one should we pick? Al Jazeera for one has decided which one they won't use. \"We are always updating our style guidelines to convey a deeper and more authentic understanding of world affairs. Recent events in Pakistan ignited a healthy debate in Al Jazeera on the term 'honor killings' in particular. Our editors are currently studying alternatives to the term, but'misogynistic murder' is not one of them,\" said an Al Jazeera spokesperson. Terminology in the media matters, and for murders as complex as these, it's the media's responsibility to find a name that better fits the crime. Only then will it become easier to work towards a solution.",

        "target": "Myanmar Junta Announces Amnesty The junta in Myanmar, also known as Burma, announced an amnesty for more than 7,000 prisoners on Friday, including a few political detainees. The amnesty came on the 21st anniversary of the brutal crackdown of a student-led pro-democracy movement in 1988 and the subsequent seizure of power by the current junta. Journalists were invited to Yangon\u2019s notorious Insein prison on Friday as the authorities released the first batch of prisoners. At least 600 inmates were freed as part of an amnesty for over 7,000 inmates nationwide. Among those released in Yangon were two journalists and 25 political prisoners -- rights groups say this is only 1 percent of the total number of political prisoners held by the military regime. Maung Zarni, a research fellow at the London School of Economics, was \u201chappy for the prisoners who were part of the release\u201d. \u201cThis is a very positive personal development and I am happy they have been released but we need to understand that the junta is using the prisoners\u2019 release as a public relations exercise. It is the 21st anniversary of the military coup so they are using this as a way to pacify political discontent in the country.\u201d Amnesty comes ahead of next year\u2019s polls Myanmar's director general of prisons, Zaw Win, said that the prisoners had been freed so they could take part in next year's polls. In recent months, rights activists, pro-democracy activists and Western countries have cast doubt on the credibility of the planned elections as many key political activists are still in detention. This includes pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who recently began a new 18-month period of house arrest after being found guilty of violating her house arrest order in a widely condemned trial. \u201cThe whole Suu kyi trial is rather unlawful,\u201d said Zarni. \u201cBecause the country does not have an independent judiciary, the judges are just puppets who dance to the tune of the top leadership.\u201d Junta is holding on tightly In 1990, Suu Kyi\u2019s National League for Democracy won Myanmar\u2019s last general election by a landslide. But the junta never recognised the results and has since tightened its control over the country. The 2008 constitution, which was drafted and approved by the military generals, which guarantees the army 25 percent of parliamentary seats, is yet another sign of its desire to consolidate power. \u201cThe military is going to be in power for a long time,\u201d warns Zarni, \u201cbecause they have got control of all the political and economic institutions in the country as well as the entire state of Burma. So with or without elections, this is likely to remain the same.\u201d New Democratic Party formed Meanwhile, a new political party has been formed in Myanmar. The Democratic Party is headed by Mya Than Than Nu, who is the daughter of the country\u2019s first democratically-elected prime minister, U Nu. The party has proposed a power-sharing deal with the military, which would give 40 percent of power to politicians and 60 percent to the military rulers. Harn Yawnghwe, the director of the Brussels-based Euro-Burma Office, doubts the new party stands a chance: \u201cIt is possible that they they would be able to get some votes. But it is not likely, even if they were able to contest the elections freely, that they will be able to form a new government because the military is not prepared to let any party rule.\u201d Democrats should exploit elections He thinks the only way out for the democratic forces in Myanmar is to use the upcoming elections wisely and \u201cto take part in them even if they are against them. I think we have to look at the elections as a process which will lead to democracy -- maybe in few more years.\u201d The National League for Democracy has indicated that it will not take part in the polls unless all Myanmar\u2019s political prisoners, including Suu Kyi, are released. Suu Kyi\u2019s lawyers have filed an appeal against the extension of her house arrest and the court is expected to give a ruling on October 2. But few are hopeful that the junta will amnesty her anytime soon. Author: Disha Uppal Editor: Anne Thomas",
        "generated_story": "Maung Zarni: Myanmar's 'new junta' is a disaster for democracy Author: Disha Uppal Editor: Aung San Suu Kyi has called for the release of political prisoners in Myanmar. \"Myanmar's New Junta\" is the latest in a series of crackdowns on dissent in the country. The country's new military government, which has been in power since the end of the military's rule in 1990, is accused by rights groups of suppressing dissent and suppressing peaceful demonstrations. A report released on Friday by the Euro-Burma Office found that more than 1,000 political detainees had been released from prison since October 2, 2008. According to the report, the number of people released has risen to around 3,500. Author's note: \"This is not the first time that this has happened. In the past, there have been many cases where the government has failed to protect the rights of peaceful demonstrators. This time, however, it seems that it has succeeded in doing so,\" said Harn Yawnghwe, a professor of international relations at the London School of Economics. He added that the new government is also trying to improve the lives of thousands of internally displaced people, who have fled to neighboring Bangladesh in search of a better life for themselves and their families. However, he added, \"I don't think it will be the last time this will happen.\" The report also said that there was a rise in political violence in recent years, with the arrest of hundreds of civilians and the death of at least one prominent opposition leader, Mya Than Than Nu, in 2008, leading to an increase in violence against peaceful protesters. It also pointed to a drop in anti-government protests in Yangon, where thousands were killed in clashes between pro-democracy forces and security forces, as well as the deaths of scores of police officers, soldiers and civilians, according to Reuters news agency citing unnamed sources. Myanmar has long been accused of human rights abuses, including rape, murder, torture and murder of women and girls, and that many of them were tortured and tortured.

The Rohingya are facing a new wave of violence and persecution in their home state of Rakhine and a crackdown on peaceful protests has left thousands dead and hundreds more injured, says expert Aunty Win, an expert on Myanmar who has researched the situation. She says the crackdown is part of an ongoing process to bring about an end to political repression and allow for a peaceful transition of power, but that Myanmar is still far from being ready to accept a return to civilian rule."

        "target": "A quarter of deaths caused by environmental degradation, says UN A new United Nations report warns that pollution and global warming are causing millions more deaths than conflicts. The UN's environment agency has called for an urgent roll-back on harmful substances and fossil fuels. In its report \"Healthy Environment, Health People,\" the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), the World Health Organization and several other environment organizations said that, in 2012, an estimated 12.6 million deaths were attributable to deteriorating environment conditions. The largest numbers of deaths took place in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific regions, followed by sub-Saharan Africa, where around a quarter of deaths were likely caused byair pollution, chemicals, climate change and a lack of access to sanitation. \"By depleting the ecological infrastructure of our planet and increasing our pollution footprint, we incur an ever-growing cost in terms of human health and well-being,\" said UNEP Executive Director Achim Steiner. He added that humanity's life support systems had been compromised by globalization and powerful economic interests. The report was released during UN climate talks in the German city of Bonn which are drawing up rules pertaining to the Paris agreement, which seeks to lower carbon emissions. The document suggested that several drivers were responsible for the threat to human health, including ecosystem disruption, climate change, inequality, unhealthy and wasteful lifestyles, along with unsustainable consumption and production. Worsening effects UNEP estimated that an extra 250,000 deaths could occur each year between 2030 and 2050 as a result of climate change, leading to malnutrition, malaria, diarrhea and heat stress. Between them air pollution and a lack of access to clean water and sanitation cause almost 8 million premature deaths each year. Environmental impacts are responsible for the deaths of more than one quarter of all children under the age of five, the report states. UNEP called for governments to act to remove harmful substances from working environments, reduce the use of carbon fuels and rely instead on renewable energy, and change lifestyles to allow a more sustainable use of the world's resources. The report also called for a bigger investment to protect the planet's natural ecosystem. UNEP predicted a further increase in emerging zoonotic diseases (spread between animals and humans), and called on developing countries, in particular, to prioritize prevention methods. \"Never before have so many animals been kept by so many people - and never before have so many opportunities existed for pathogens to pass through the biophysical environment and wild animals to livestock and people,\" the report warned.",
        "generated_story": "Nearly a quarter of deaths due to environmental degradation, says UNEP The World Health Organization (WHO) has released a report on the impact of climate change on human health and well-being. The report, published in the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) on Thursday, found that more than half of all deaths in developing countries are attributable to the effects of greenhouse gas emissions. According to a new report released by the organization, the number of people dying from climate-related diseases is expected to rise by half by 2030, compared to 2012, when the global average was around 1.5 deaths a year. This figure is the highest since the Paris agreement was signed in 2012. In the past three years, almost one-third of the world's deaths have been attributed to greenhouse gases, according to an analysis of WHO data released in Bonn, Germany, in December. \"This is an alarming trend,\" said the report's Executive Director Achim Steiner, adding that it is \"unacceptable that so many people are suffering from chronic diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, respiratory diseases and cancer.\" \"We have to take action now,\" he said in an interview with the German daily \"Bonn Zeitung\" in which the WHO's Environment Programme (EHP) presented its findings. It said that the most common causes of death are human-caused environmental problems, such as high levels of carbon dioxide in air, water and soil, as well as a lack of access to clean drinking water. Environmental degradation is also a major cause of poverty in sub-Saharan Africa and the Western Pacific, which is home to about one in five people who live in poverty or are unable to afford to pay for basic basic necessities like food, clothing, shelter and medical care. More than 40 million people die from environmental diseases every year in Africa, Asia, Latin America, Europe and Africa. A third of these deaths occur in low-income countries, while the rest are from people living in high-cost countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei, Cambodia, Thailand and Vietnam. These deaths are estimated to be at least 10,000 people every day, and are likely to increase as the climate warms and more people leave the country."

Germans shouldn't be biting into a \"vegan sausage\" or cutting a slice of \"vegetarian schnitzel,\" German Minister for Food and Agriculture Christian Schmidt told the daily \"Bild\" newspaper on Wednesday, adding that names traditionally used for meat-based dishes should not be applied to plant-based foods. \"I don't want anyone to pretend that these pseudo-meat dishes are actual meat dishes,\" Schmidt said. The minister said manufacturers should come up with distinct names for plant-based meat-substitutes. Schmidt also said meat was part of a healthy and balanced diet and belonged on the menu in schools and kindergartens. Soy? Steak? Soy-steak? Schmidt's statements echo demands from the German Farmers Association and German Butchers Association. Both lobbying groups have asked for a ban on terms such as \"vegetarian ham\" or \"soy steak.\" Schmidt's call for plant-based foods to have their own name was also made in October in the state of Lower Saxony, a state with many large livestock farms. The German Vegetarian Association, however, argued against the proposal. A spokesperson for the organization said that \"names that are used for animal-based products should without a doubt also be legal to use for vegetarian substitute products.\" More meatless 'whatever-you-want-to-call-thems' The market for vegetarian and vegan dishes has grown steadily in the past few years in Germany, partly at the expense of the meat industry.

Stephen Harper has stepped down as leader of the Conservatives after nine years in the top job. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper resigned as Conservative Party leader on Tuesday after the Liberals, led by Justin Trudeau, emerged victorious in legislative elections. \"I have spoken to Prime Minister Stephen Harper, and he has instructed me to reach out to the newly elected parliamentary caucus to appoint an interim leader,\" Conservative Party president John Walsh said in a statement. \"The people are never wrong,\" Harper said of his defeat. \"The disappointment is my responsibility and mine alone,\" Harper said, adding that he had called Trudeau to congratulate him. Trudeau calls for hopeful, diverse future In electing Trudeau, the charismatic son of a former popular prime minister, Canadian voters illustrated the growing discontent with nine years of Conservative rule that saw lowering of corporate taxes, avoidance of climate change legislation and disagreement with the Obama administration over the controversial Keystone XL pipeline. \"Canadians have spoken,\" Trudeau said, adding that he would be the man to lead the \"hopeful, positive\" country \"with a vision\" that they had asked for. In his victory speech, Trudeau said his government \"believed deeply in the diversity of our country,\" striking a contrast with the strain of nativism that had become apparent under Conservative rule. \"We beat fear with hope,\" said Trudeau, a 43-year-old former teacher. Liberals blow past projected results Projections ahead of the elections had Harper and Trudeau in a dead heat, but as polls closed on Monday night it became clear that the Liberals had won an outright majority, with a projected 175 of parliament's 338 seats. This represented a huge leap from four years ago when Liberals were handed their most crushing defeat in history with a mere 34 seats. Harper will stay on as a member of Parliament for his constituency, public broadcaster CBC reported, as he was re-elected to his seat. The left-leaning New Democratic Party had hoped to capitalize on its second-place finish in 2011, but only managed to come in third with CBC estimating that the party had garnered 32 seats. es/cmk (AP, Reuters) Have something to say?

He urged them to stop fighting. \"We hope the Houthis will come to their senses and realize the interests of Yemen and the Yemeni people should be the top priority for everyone,\" he said. It is unclear whether the Houthis would reciprocate the Saudi gesture. \"The cease-fire will end should Houthis or their allies not live up to the agreement - this is a chance for the Houthis to show that they care about their people and they care about the Yemen people,\" the Saudi foreign minister emphasized. At this point, US Secretary of State John Kerry said anyone who cared about Yemeni people \"should take clear notice of the fact that a human catastrophe is building,\" adding that a cease-fire was \"not peace\" and that all parties must find a political solution to end the conflict. Kerry urged all sides to hold talks immediately. Saudi ultimatum Hours before the cease-fire announcement, Saudi Arabia declared a Houthi stronghold along its southern border a \"military target,\" giving an ultimatum to the residents to leave the area, Saudi state-run TV reported. Lately, the northern Yemeni province of Saada has become a battleground for the Shiite rebels and the Saud-led coalition forces as the Houthis carried out border attacks on nearby Saudi cities. More than 50 airstrikes hit Saada overnight and in the early hours of Friday morning, Yemeni officials said. A Saudi-led coalition of Arab states launched an air campaign against the Houthis on March 26. Riyadh accuses Tehran of backing the rebels, who have made significant territorial gains in the impoverished Middle Eastern country, capturing the capital Sanaa and ousting internationally recognized President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, who fled Yemen back in March. The Sunni Gulf states are wary of Iran's increasing influence in the region, and they see the Houthis' advance in Yemen as a move that threatens their regional and geopolitical interests. Over 1,200 people have been killed in Yemen since the start of the Saudi campaign, according to the United Nations. shs/bw (AFP, dpa, Reuters, AP)",

He said that his victory meant voters had chosed the path of \"European Integration.\" Exit polls gave Petro Poroshenko, a 48-year-old billionaire and owner of a chocolate factory, between 55.9 and 57.3 percent of the vote. This put him well ahead of former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, who was reported to have come in second, at 12.9 percent. Andrij Shevchenko, one of Tymoshenko's political allies, said on Twitter that she had conceded defeat. DW's reporter Kitty Logan in Kyiv said voter turnout was extremely high in the capital. Most polling stations in the east of the country remained closed on Sunday. If the figures are confirmed, there will not be a need for a runoff on June 15. Poroshenko, who has promised closer economic and political ties with the West, has also vowed to mend relations with Russia, but insisted that Ukraine's territorial integrity was of top importance to him. In his first statements following the publication of the early results, Poroshenko announced he would travel to the east of the country quickly. He also announced that parliamentary elections would be held later this year. rg/lw (Reuters, dpa)",

        "target": "The Shift in Libya's Relations to the West The La Belle disco bombing in Berlin on April 5, 1986 was ruled to be Libya's doing. Twenty years later, relations between Libya and Europe have done an about-face. The Berlin disco \"La Belle\" was packed as usual on the night of April 5, 1986. Among its guests were many US soldiers, who were certainly not thinking of politics, the Middle East or strained relations between the United States and Libya. But reality caught up with them: a bomb detonated near the dance floor that night, killing two Americans and a Turkish woman. Over 200 people were injured. A Berlin court ruled that Libya and its intelligence services were responsible for the bombing. In 2001, following a nearly four-year long trial, the judges convicted a Libyan diplomat and three others to prison sentences between 12 and 14 years. The big oil-exporting country in the meantime was busy working on its reputation. Already in the 1990s, Tripoli began striving to improve its relations to the European Union. Financial reparation opened the door to Europe In 2004, the Gaddafi International Foundation for Charity Associations and the legal representatives of the German La Belle victims settled on $35 million in compensation. This opened the door to Europe. Just a few weeks later, Germany's chancellor at the time, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, visited Moammar Gadhafi in a traditional Bedouin tent outside of Tripoli. Britain's Prime Minister Tony Blair also paid Gadhafi a visit. A few months earlier, in April 2004, the European Union had welcomed the Libyan leader to Brussels. It was Gadhafi's first official visit to Europe in 15 years. Bernd Westphal, the German ambassador to Libya, said bilateral relations had been through difficult times. \"The German Embassy in Tripoli today is working for a quick return to the liveliness of close relations between Germany and Libya,\" Westphal said. \"We want to build on our traditional friendship with Libya and we want to strengthen the political, economic and cultural cooperation between our two countries and peoples.\" Business interests booming in Libya In the past few years, Libya has moved from being the supporter of international terrorism to an attractive economic partner for the West. European business representatives have been increasingly knocking on Libya's door. Even the United States is showing increased interest in the northern African nation. Washington is pleased that Libya announced at the end of 2003 that it would discontinue its efforts to develop and produce weapons of mass destruction. Libya's ambassador to Germany, Said Abdulaati, said political and economic relations between Libya and Germany were \"excellent.\" Libya is one of Germany's strongest trading partners in northern Africa. Last year, Germany exported goods to Libya worth 657.7 million euros ($805.7 million), according to the German Federal Statistics Office. \"The economy is the driving power in German-Libyan relations,\" said Abdulaati in an interview with the Arab-German association for trade and industry. But Germany isn't the only European country making deals in Libya. France last month signed an accord with Libya on peaceful nuclear research. \"This accord represents a qualitative leap in relations between the two countries and proves that Libya has transformed its weapons of mass destruction into constructive weapons,\" Public Works Minister Maatuk Maatuk said at the signing ceremony in March. \"We are telling the world that we are moving towards the development of Libyan nuclear technology for peaceful purposes.\" This week, the Netherlands' Economics Minister Laurens Jan Brinkhorst will visit Libya to negotiate gas and oil agreements. It will be the first high-level visit by a Dutch official since Gadhafi took power in 1969.",
        "generated_story": "Libyan President Moammar Gadhafi's regime has been overthrown and his regime is now in power. German Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der has called for an end to the conflict in Libya. The German government is calling for the end of the regime's rule of law in the country. \"We are calling on the government of Libya to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of its people,\" said Chancellor Bernd Westphal, who heads the German Federal Statistics Office (GFSO) in Berlin. He added that the new government would be able to impose its own laws and regulations on Libya's political and economic elites. Germany has long been a staunch supporter of democracy in Africa, but in recent years it has become more and more critical. In April 2004, German Public Works Minister Said Abdulaati announced that Germany would no longer be involved in negotiations with the Libyan government over the transfer of power to Tripoli. According to a statement released by the ministry, the decision was made \"in the interest of national security and the security of our country.\" The announcement came after a meeting between German and Libyan officials in Brussels on April 5, 2003, in which the two sides agreed on how to deal with a crisis that had been brewing for some time. At the time, Germany was the only EU country that was willing to take part in a peace process. Since then, however, there have been tensions between Germany and Libya, and in particular between the United States and Britain, which has a long history of hostility toward the former regime. This has led to an increase in anti-American sentiment in Germany, as well as a rise in attacks on German-owned companies and government buildings in Europe. But Germany is not alone in its concern about this. It is also concerned about the growing influence of US President Donald Trump's administration on Libyan politics. On the other hand, it is Germany's foreign policy that is at the center of this conflict. There are a number of factors that contribute to this, including the fact that Libya is the largest Arab country in terms of population. For example, Libya has more than 1.5 million people living in poverty than it does in other Arab countries, according to figures from the European Union's statistics office, Eurostat. Another factor is that many of these people live in conflict zones, such as the Middle East and North Africa. As a result, most of them are fleeing their homes and seeking refuge in neighboring countries. That is why it's important for Germany to make sure that its citizens are safe and well-educated and that they have access to education, health care, education and employment opportunities, among other things."

        "target": "Bremen Election Results Could Have National Repercussions It might be Germany's smallest state with a population of less than 700,000, but the make-up of Bremen's new government could curb the ability of Angela Merkel's coalition to continue with planned reforms. The Social Democrats (SPD) and Christian Democrats (CDU) have ruled the small northern city-state of Bremen in a coalition for the past 12 years. But after winning state elections on Sunday with 36.8 percent, the SPD is now flirting with the idea of ditching their previous coalition partners to rule together with the Greens, who made their best-ever showing in a German state poll with 16.4 percent. Bremen's state SPD leadership is to hold talks later on Wednesday with the CDU, which polled 25.7 percent. After an SPD meeting in Bremen, Mayor Jens B\u00f6hrnsen made the first signal he could be favoring the Greens. He said that during the campaign he had deliberately abstained from mentioning the possibility of a renewed CDU coalition because \"after 12 years it shouldn't automatically be continued.\" Bremen's acting head of government and CDU member Thomas R\u00f6wekamp, however, warned against an SPD-Green coalition. \"The majority of people don't want a red-green experiment, but a continuation of the grand coalition,\" he said. Both the SPD and CDU conceded heavy losses in the election, which showed a swing towards the Greens and the Left Party, which scored an unexpected 8.4 percent to win representation in a western German state legislature for the first time in its brief history. Block reforms? If Bremen's SPD decide in favor of the Greens, this would affect the ability of Chancellor Angela Merkel's grand coalition of CDU and SPD to push ahead with reforms requiring constitutional changes, such as stage two of Germany's urgently needed federalism reform. The federal Bundesrat, which is made up of state cabinet members, has to approve the majority of legislative bills passed by the lower chamber, the Bundestag, before they become law. Also, any proposed constitutional changes require two-thirds of all votes in order to be passed by the Bundesrat. The CDU and SPD currently hold 47 of the Bundesrat's 69 seats, which is one seat more than the necessary two-thirds majority. But without Bremen, the number held by the grand coalition would fall to 44 seats, meaning they would need the cooperation of one of the small opposition parties for any constitutional changes. Internal strife Earlier in the week, Chancellor Merkel called for unity within her ruling left-right coalition after the losses in Bremen set the stage for more infighting between the two parties. Merkel also warned the SPD against moving to the left after it lost some five percent points. The chancellor said the outcome showed the SPD had made a mistake by attacking the coalition and campaigning on promises of a minimum wage, which she believes will hamper efforts to fight unemployment of just under 10 percent. \"The result showed that this strategy did not pay off,\" Merkel told a press conference.",
        "generated_story": "Merkel's coalition of Social Democrats and CDU could block reforms Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives and Greens are set to form a coalition government in the eastern German state of Bremen on Wednesday. The coalition is expected to be formed by the end of the week, with the Greens, the center-left Christian Democrats (CDU) and the Left Party (SPD) set for elections on Sunday. Chancellor Merkel has said she will not allow the SPD, Greens or Greens to take over the government from her conservatives. \"I don't think we can do this,\" Merkel said in a speech at the Bundestag in Germany's largest city on Tuesday. Merkel, who has been in coalition talks with her conservative coalition partners for months, has called for a \"grand coalition\" of conservative parties and smaller parties. She has also called on the federal government to introduce new laws that would make it easier for small business owners to sell their goods and services to small and medium-sized firms. But she has not ruled out the possibility of a grand coalition, which would include the Social Democrat and Green parties, as well as Greens. On Sunday, Merkel announced that she would seek a new constitution for the country's biggest economy, a move that could have a negative impact on economic growth and job creation. Her coalition would also be able to block a tax increase on small businesses, she said, adding that the tax hike would not be enough to offset the loss of jobs and raise wages for workers. German media reported that Merkel and her coalition partner, SPD leader Thomas R\u00f6wekamp, were planning to hold a referendum on tax increases on Thursday. A spokesman for Merkel told the German news agency dpa: \"The chancellor is not going to allow this to happen.\" The SPD is currently the largest party in parliament, and its leader, Jens B\u00f6hrnsen, said he was confident that his party would win the vote. However, he added that he did not expect the coalition to win a majority of votes, saying that it would be \"hard to predict the outcome of this election.\" Merkel could also face stiff opposition from the conservative Greens if she fails to reach a deal on a controversial tax reform package."

US General Philip Breedlove said Russian forces were still operating inside Ukraine. Speaking to reporters after a meeting with NATO military chiefs in Lithuania's capital Vilnius on Saturday, US General Philip Breedlove expressed \"sincere hope\" about a renewed peace plan, agreed to earlier in the day in the Belarusian capital Minsk, by separatists and representatives from Ukraine's and Russia's governments. The new pact, including an artillery buffer zone, was a move to strengthen a peace plan signed earlier this month, also in Minsk. However, Breedlove said violence levels in Ukraine in recent days were as high as prior to the earlier ceasefire. \"The ceasefire is still there in name, but what is happening on the ground is quite a different story,\" Breedlove said, adding that Russian forces were still operating in Ukraine, although he could not pinpoint how many. \"The fluidity of movement of Russian forces and Russian-backed forces back and forth across that border makes it almost impossible to understand the numbers,\" he said. A convoy from Russia consisting of about 170 trucks arrived in Ukraine on Saturday, with a reported cargo of humanitarian aid. Previous aid convoys sent from Russia were met with outrage in Kyiv, as it was suspected they may have been used to provide support to the pro-Moscow separatists in eastern Ukraine. Russia has repeatedly denied such accusations. The separatists have said they want to break from Kyiv and have already declared \"people's republics'\" in Donetsk and Luhansk. This week Ukraine's parliament passed a bill which paves the way for more autonomy for those areas.

        "target": "German FA calls off matches with China under-20 team after protests Germany's football association has called off several friendly matches between China's under-20 team and German lower league sides. The move follows a political protest at the first such match. In a statement released on Friday, the German football association (DFB) announced that the games would be rescheduled for 2018 and that talks would take place between them and their Chinese counterparts in order explore how to move forward. \"To the regret of all parties involved, the project has not received the broad approval that had been expected,\" the DFB said. \"In fact, the project was used by a handful of spectators to send messages that were considered hurtful by the Chinese team, officials, the Chinese Football Association's support staff and Chinese spectators.\" Protests in opening match The first of the arranged matches, against TSV Schott Mainz of the fourth-tier Regionalliga S\u00fcdwest was interrupted midway through the first half when the Chinese players left the field because a small group of activists had unfurled Tibetan flags. The team later returned to the field after the flags had been taken down, before succumbing to a 3-0 defeat. On Monday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry strongly criticized the protest. Initially, it had been thought that the Chinese side would play in the Regionalliga S\u00fcdwest - a regional division of Germany's fourth tier which has only 19 teams but the plan was revised so the matches would just be friendlies. This followed an agreement signed in 2016 between the German FA and the Chinese government to help boost the sport in the Asian country, where the Bundesliga is increasingly popular. Financial boost not enough to soothe concerns Despite the financial boost for the clubs \u2013 TSV Schott Mainz were reportedly paid a fee of \u20ac15,000 ($17.800) for last weekend's game \u2013 the move hasn't proved entirely popular with German fans, many of whom see it as just another example of commercial interests trumping sporting concerns. But the protests, and potential for further disruption, seem to be behind the cancellations - the DFB said both federations were aware of \"substantial evidence of further escalation,\" FSV Frankfurt, who were due to host the Chinese side on Saturday, said earlier this week that they would not ban protests despite an angry response to last week's incident from Beijing. \"We will not back a single centimeter off the basic rights our our democracy, including those relating to freedom of speech,\" FSV Frankfurt President Michael G\u00f6rner said in an interview with the Stuttgarter Nachrichten and Stuttgarter Zeitung newspapers. His words echoed those of DFB vice-president Ronny Zimmerman, who said that the games should be played \"within the framework of freedom of expression.\" The fixtures that have been abandoned include games against Wormatia Worms and Bundesliga club Hoffenheim's reserves. mp/pfd (dpa, SID)",

The association said on Saturday that it had canceled the club's invitation to play in the Regionalliga S\u00fcdwest. \"We regret to inform you that we will not be able to take part in this event,\" the association's vice-president, Ronny Zimmerman, told the Stuttgarter Zeitung, adding that he was \"deeply disappointed\" by the cancellation of the event, which was scheduled to begin at 1 p.m. local time (local time) on Monday. According to a statement from the German Football Association (Bundesliga), the decision was made \"in accordance with the rules and regulations of our association,\" which is responsible for organizing the tournament. German football associations have been criticized by Chinese football officials for not having enough resources to organize a fair and fair competition in their region. Germany, however, has been accused of failing to provide sufficient support for the Chinese team in its bid to qualify for next year's World Cup in Russia. In an interview with German news agency dpa, Bundesliga vice president Michael G\u00f6rner said that his club had \"no choice\" but to participate. He also pointed out that there was a \"very high level of cooperation\" between the two sides, and that the players were willing to work together to improve the team's chances of qualifying. However, he said, \"there is still a lot of work to be done in terms of training and training.\" \"It is a very difficult situation for us,\" he added, referring to the fact that \"we have to make sure that our players are well-trained and ready to compete in international competition.\" The decision to cancel the match was the latest in a series of protests that have taken place across Germany over the past few weeks. On Friday, the Bundesliga's governing body, FSV Frankfurt, announced that they had cancelled their participation. It was not immediately clear how many players had been invited to attend the game, but it is believed that at least one of them was invited. A number of players and coaches have also been banned from attending the games, according to local media reports, citing \"foreign ministry\" and the Foreign Ministry. Last week, a group of Chinese soccer fans staged a protest outside the stadium in Wormatia Worms, near the eastern city of D\u00fcsseldorf. They said they were protesting against the ban on Chinese players from participating in football matches in Germany. mp/pfd (dpa/ SID)"

        "target": "For drivers in Germany, 2010 was the most expensive year ever Owning and operating a car in Germany has never been cheap, but it's never been more expensive than in 2010. German auto club ADAC says costs associated with owning a car have risen more than 40 percent since 1995. In 2010, German car owners had to pay a high price for their mobility, according to ADAC, which cited record-high fuel prices as the major cost factor. \"For drivers, 2010 will go down in history as the most costly year ever,\" ADAC said in a statement. High taxes The cost of acquiring and operating a car has risen 42 percent since 1995, compared to a 24 percent increase in the general cost of living. Due to tax increases and higher production costs, fuel prices soared 86 percent over the 15-year period. In 2010 alone, the average price for a liter of super gasoline was more than 1.40 euros ($1.84) - the highest the average price ever. According to ADAC, urban singles spent an average of 3,340 euros on their cars in 2000. Five years later, that figure had jumped to 3,900 euros. By the end of 2010, their expenses reached 4,380 euros, or 1,000 euros more than a decade earlier. Driving is also pricey for four-person families with two cars. According to the automobile club, their annual costs have risen 30 percent over the past 10 years from 5,940 euros to 7,740 euros. Taxes account for the lion's share of gasoline and diesel prices. The German government's mineral oil and value added taxes account for nearly 88 cents of the 1.35-euro price of a liter of fuel. Low toll revenue While the German government reaps more revenue year for year from vehicle-related taxes, income generated by its highway toll for trucks is expected to fall this year for the first time since the haulage charges were introduced in 2005. The government predicts this year's toll revenues will amount to 4.2 billion euros, down from 4.3 billion euros in 2009. Author: John Blau Editor: Sam Edmonds",
        "generated_story": "Most Costly Year in History For German Auto Clubs, 2010 was the most expensive year in history. The most costly year for German auto clubs was 2010. Author: John Blau Editor: Sam Edmonds \"2010 was a record year,\" he told DW. \"The average German car club costs a total of 4.2 billion euros ($4.3 billion) in 2009. That's a lot of money for an auto club to spend on a car. It's not only the cost of a new car, it's also the highest for a German club in terms of the number of cars sold in the country. This is not just because the average car costs more than any other club, but also because there are so many new cars coming out every year. In addition to the high prices for cars, there was also a huge increase in interest rates for new models. For example, in 2005, ADAC had a 3,900-euro (4,380 euros) interest rate, while in 2006, the rate was 5,940 euros. And in 2007, with the addition of an additional 1,000 euros for the first time since the introduction of electric cars in 1995, car clubs in Germany were able to reduce their costs by 7,740 euros, according to a study by the German Automobile Clubs Association (ADAC). The study also found that car owners were more likely to invest in new equipment than in previous years, and that the costs of new vehicles were far higher than they had been in 2000, when the car was first introduced. However, this was not to be the case in 2010, as the total cost for 2009 was only 3.9 percent of what it was in 1999, which was at the time the world's second-biggest car market, behind only China's Mercedes-Benz. Compared to 2009, however, that figure is much lower. According to German industry figures, automobile clubs spend more on maintenance and repair than their counterparts in other industries, such as pharmaceuticals, chemicals, medical equipment, energy, food and so on. They also spend less on advertising and marketing, making it more expensive for them to advertise and promote their products and services. Overall, German automotive clubs spent more money on marketing and advertising than ever before. Although the figures do not reflect the actual costs, they do show that they have a good chance of achieving their goals. Despite the fact that most of their members are German-born, many of them are from the same family, so it is no surprise that their families are not as well-educated as they were in their 20s and 30s."

The release comes as US President Barack Obama prepares to meet with Cuban President Nicolas Maduro in Madrid on Thursday. \"We are very happy to see that the detainees have been released,\" Obama said at a news conference at the end of his visit to Spain, where he is expected to hold talks with his Cuban counterpart, Miguel Angel Moratinos, ahead of a trip to Cuba later in the day. Obama's first meeting with the Cuban president was scheduled to take place at Madrid's airport, but the talks were postponed until after the inauguration of President Obama. In a statement released by the Spanish Interior Ministry, the president said: \"Today, we are pleased to announce that we have released five of our prisoners, including a Palestinian, a Spanish citizen and a British citizen. We are hopeful that they will be able to return home to their families and be reunited with their loved ones.\" The US has accused Spain of being a \"hostile state\" for the Guantanamo detainees, who are being held in solitary confinement for more than a year. A US court has ruled that Spain is not guilty of any crime in connection with Guantanamo, and that it will not seek to extradite any of its prisoners to Guantanamo. US officials have also said that Cuba is willing to release the remaining five Guantanamo prisoners in exchange for their release from prison. But the Obama administration has not ruled out the possibility of extraditing the other five, which are currently serving sentences of up to 15 years in prison for crimes committed during the war on terror. jen/AFP/AP Editor: Andreas Illmer"

But now they should take care that Great Britain does not move further away from Europe, writes Birgit Maass. If only they had done it out of full conviction. If they at least believed that they could really benefit their country by withdrawing from the EU. But many of the parliamentarians whose vote will finally set Brexit on its wayhave voted against their hearts, as well as their minds. It was a vote against their minds, because the withdrawal from the EU will almost certainly, at least on a short to medium term basis, have negative repercussions for the British economy. And it was a vote against their hearts, because for many, a view of the future, divorced from Brussels and increasingly reliant on an unpredictable US President Donald Trump, is somewhat alarming. In recent days, many members of parliament have described it as \"a catastrophe.\" No vote \"against the will of the people.\" Of course there are \"Brexiteers\" who believe that a Britain independent of Brussels will be able to return to its former greatness, once it is no longer held back by the \"Little Europeans.\" But they are in the minority - the majority of parliamentarians already declared their support for remaining in the EU during the referendum campaign. Yet despite this, Theresa May's government was able to push its legislative proposal through the House of Commons without any great difficulty. The predominant view, also amongst members of the two leading parties, is that to hinder Brexit and to fail to support the government in its endeavors to do so, would be to go \"against the will of the people.\" Anti-EU newspapers have targeted Brexit opponents. And those who have publically come out in support of the EU have had to reckon with death threats. The at times passionate debate in the lower house, that went on over several days, was a temporary highlight in this European tragedy, which in the worst case could contribute to the continent disintegrating into individual sovereign states. Don't be intimidated The British public supports the hard-line position taken by Prime Minister May in withdrawing from the common market. Polls are showing that her strategy is gaining increased support. There is no turning back now. The British are now looking for clarity on the repercussions of their withdrawal from the EU. They want the negotiations with the EU to start as soon as possible. It was an historical misjudgement by David Cameron that he could win the referendum. Most of the members of the lower house believed the then-prime minister and voted to hold a referendum. But now they can no longer stop Brexit. But they should not let themselves be intimidated by party discipline, nor the leading Brexiteers, nor by voter impatience. Over the next two years they should use every chance they can to influence the withdrawal process. May announced that although they are leaving the European Union, they will not be moving away from Europe. The parliamentarians must now hold her to her word. Have something to say?

The vote will be held in the House of Commons on Thursday, May said in a statement released by the British government. \"We have decided that we are going to hold a vote on the question of whether or not we want to go ahead with our plans for the future relationship with the EU,\" Prime Minister Theresa May told the chamber. May also said that the referendum would not be an \"impedant\" vote, but rather a \"voting of confidence.\" \"The referendum is an opportunity for us to make our own decisions,\" she said, adding that she was confident the vote would result in an orderly and orderly withdrawal of Britain from the bloc. However, she also pointed out that there was no \"clear majority\" in favor of a no-deal Brexit, which would leave Britain without an EU-wide single market and a customs union. She also noted that \"there is no clear majority in this house of parliament\" that would allow the UK to continue to be a member of EU. Brexiteers, however, have been critical of May's decision to back out of talks with Brussels. They have called for a second referendum, in which Britain would have to agree to the terms of its departure. But they have also called on May to step down from her role as prime minister and to take a more active role in shaping the country's future relations with Europe and the US. In the end, it is May who will have the final say on what happens to Britain's EU membership and whether it will stay or leave. EU leaders have said they are ready to accept the outcome of this vote. European leaders, meanwhile, are calling for an early referendum on whether Britain should remain in EU or remain. Author: Birgit Maass"

        "target": "A Brief History of the Seaside Holiday These days, millions take seaside holidays for granted as one of life's pleasures. But 200 years ago, a dip in the sea was more a test of courage. Hardly anyone could swim. As late as the 18th century, many Europeans still thought of the sea as the realm of Satan: storm-tossed and inhabited by terrifying monsters. \"Unlike the mountains, the coasts were terra incognita as a holiday spot,\" says Manfred B\u00e4tje, director of the Bade-Museum on the North Sea island of Norderney. Anyone who set foot in the water was \"stepping into the unknown\". Brighton showed the way That only began to change after the British aristocracy discovered the healing power of salt water. As early as 1780, Brighton, England's biggest and oldest seaside resort, was a bustling spa. Philosopher and physicist Georg Christoph Lichtenberg (1742-1799) of G\u00f6ttingen gave Germans the starting signal with his 1793 essay \"Why doesn't Germany have any large public seaside resorts?\" In it, he called for the creation of a resort in Cuxhaven on the North Sea. He received support from the most notable German physician of the time, the Prussian king's court physician, Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland. But things turned out somewhat differently. Germany's first seaside resort was indeed built in September, 1793, but in Heiligendamm on the Baltic Sea. Four years later, permission was granted for construction of Germany's first resort on the North Sea, on Norderney. \"For the first bathing season on July and August of 1800, only around 250 guests turned up. Now, the nearly 6000 residents host a good 530,000 bathers annually, plus around 230,000 day-trippers,\" B\u00e4tje reels off the figures. Romanticist inspiration In the 19th century, the landscapes of Caspar David Friedrich, such as his famous Chalk Cliffs on R\u00fcgen (1818), gave seaside holidays added impetus. From then on, the sea was no longer a voracious beast. From the shore, the cultivated, modern European contemplated the vast melancholy of the deep. \"The calm sea became an embodiment of unspecified yearning, the waves an expression of vitality and dynamism,\" soliloquizes museum director B\u00e4tje. But the journey to the sea long remained an arduous, time-consuming one. It took the mail coach a good thirty hours to cover the distance from Hamburg to the North Frisian town of Aurich over bumpy, muddy roads. The express cab from Bremen only took about 16 hours to reach the East Frisian town of Norden - including six changes of horses along the way. \"It wasn't comfortable,\" explains B\u00e4tje. Not until the introduction of seaside tourist steamers out of Hamburg and Bremen to the islands and the expansion of the railways did the journey become easier. Strict bathing rules At first, it was primarily the well-to-do bourgeois and nobility who were able to afford a seaside holiday. Victorian-era society is known for its extreme prudishness, and the beach was not exempt. Bathing machines were essentially changing cabins on wheels that could be rolled into the surf. The sexes were kept strictly separated. Wet swimsuits could not be allowed to cling, thus revealing the body's contours. Women sported baggy flannel garments with bloomers underneath that swiftly became waterlogged to where the bather was risking her life. Hardly anyone really knew how to swim anyway. \"Most bathers wouldn't stay in the water any more than two minutes, often just seconds at a time. The English had a rule: 'Three dips and out',\" quips archivist Manfred B\u00e4tje, whose Bade-Museum is housed in a building for a former wave pool, just a few steps from Norderney's Weststrand, where, during the summer months, vacationers sunbathe in wicker beach chairs and on blankets, cooled by a salty sea breeze. Sunbathing first came in style early in the 20th century, and the first true swimsuits were produced in the United States. \"Starting in 1919, today's bathing culture gradually began to take shape,\" B\u00e4tje looks back. At the same time, ideals of beauty were in flux - such as the attitude towards tan skin, which had long been regarded as a mark of farmers and manual laborers. B\u00e4tje: \"People were still cultivating their genteel pallors.\" Water, Waves, Wellness Today, the sun worshipers are the devout masses, and seaside holidays are their pilgrimages. The North Sea resorts alone count some 12.9 million overnight stays annually. Health is once again a primary concern: sea air, sea water, sea salts and the algaes and mud used in",
        "generated_story": "A Brief History of the Seaside Holiday in Germany The Bade-Museum in Norderney in the German city of G\u00f6ttingen is home to the world's most famous seaside holiday, the Chalk Cliffs on R\u00fcgen. Manfred B\u00e4tje was born in 1818 and grew up on the coast of Germany's North Frisian coast. In 1780, he and his family moved to Bremen, where he studied medicine at the University of Cologne. His father, a physician, worked as a ship's navigator, and he was one of only a handful of Europeans to travel to Germany at that time. He was the first German to take part in such a trip. After all, it was his father who first took him to England in 1799. The trip was part of a series of scientific expeditions, including the discovery of ancient German medicine and the construction of bridges and tunnels. During this time, German scientists were able to study the history of German science and technology. They also discovered that there was a great deal of knowledge and knowledge about the science of science, technology, engineering and mathematics. This led to a number of discoveries and discoveries. One of these discoveries is that the theory of quantum mechanics can be applied to all kinds of phenomena. For example, there is the idea that a computer program could be used to calculate the distance between a person's brain and a body's body. That is, if the person is a physicist or a mathematician, then they can use the computer to determine the distances between the body and its brain. It is also possible to use computer programs to understand the physical properties of objects, such as the bones of bones, teeth, hair, eyes, bones and even the skin of teeth. There are also the possibility that people can read the minds of other people as well, as if they were in a laboratory. These are all possibilities that can only be explored with the help of computer software. And then there's the fact that you can do it all yourself, without having to do anything at all. You don't have to be a scientist to know what you're doing, because you have the knowledge of what's going on in your head. What do you know about your brain? What does it tell you about it? It tells you a lot about how it works and what it's like to live in an environment where it doesn't matter what the weather is like. \"It's very interesting to me because I can't think of anything that's different from what I've experienced in my life,\" he said, adding that he's always been fascinated by the sea and that it reminds him of his own experiences at sea. But he also points out that this is not the case in his native Germany, which has a reputation for being the most beautiful place on earth. A few years ago, his wife, Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland, married a German woman and they had a son, Caspar David Friedrich, who died of natural causes. Her son died in childbirth and her daughter died when she was 10 years old. She was buried in her home town of Heiligendamm, near the village of Cuxhaven."

Military spokesman Col. Joseph Biden, however, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In a tweet, Obama said: \"The military is doing everything it can to protect our troops and our nation. We are going to do everything we can in our power to prevent this from happening again.\" A spokesman for the Obama administration said he had not seen any evidence of a terrorist attack. Obama also said that he would not be commenting on the ongoing investigation into the alleged shooting at an Air Force base in Maryland.

However, he added that \"there is no evidence to suggest that this is an isolated incident, and we will continue to monitor this situation closely as we move forward with our mission.\" Obama, who has been in office for more than a year and a half, said his administration was working closely with the state of Maryland and the federal government to make sure that all personnel were safe and that no harm was done to civilians."

        "target": "Threat of the Punjabi Taliban is growing Deutsche Welle talks to Pakistani political expert Hasan Askari Rizvi about the growing ties between militants in northwest Pakistan and Punjab province. At least four gunmen disguised in police uniforms raided a hospital in Pakistan's eastern city of Lahore on Monday night, claiming at least five lives. Local officials said the gunmen were trying to free a militant, who was being treated there after being captured during attacks on two mosques last Friday. The police said the gunfight at Jinnah Hospital had lasted around 45 minutes but the gunmen had managed to flee. Friday's twin attacks on the minority Ahmadi community left more than 90 people dead. They were claimed by a group, which identified itself as the Punjabi wing of the Taliban. Deutsche Welle spoke to political expert Hasan Askari Rizvi in Lahore, where there has been a wave of violence in recent days. DW: Who are the \"Punjabi Taliban\"? It is a kind of a pejorative term, which includes a host of groups. Initially in Punjab, you had two types of militancy: One, the groups that focussed mainly on Indian-administered Kashmir and there were other types of groups that focussed on Pakistan. Those were the sectarian groups targeting mainly the Shias, and there were some Shia groups targeting the Sunni leadership. Over the years a lot of factions have broken away from these groups and these small entities are functioning more or less autonomously. They have trainings in the tribal areas because these are secured for them and certain parts are not under Pakistani control so these groups go there. They operate with the Pakistani Taliban based in tribal areas against the Pakistani troops in the region. They also have an autonomous agenda, which they pursue in Punjab, as they have been doing in the past days. These groups also play host or are a kind of a local link to Taliban suicide bombers who come into the main part of Pakistan from the tribal areas (let's say to Punjab). If they have to target some place, they park themselves with these Punjab groups, and then do it. All these factions and groups that have broken away from traditional militant groups and are functioning in close collaboration with tribal area Taliban are often described as the \"Punjabi Taliban\". Why do you think these militants are resurfacing now? They have always existed here and there and generally the trend is that they undertake a couple of operations, one after the other. Then the government comes in and takes action against them. Then they just disappear or become sleeping groups and suddenly after a couple of months they resurface. That's the standard pattern. The last major incident in Lahore was in the first week of March. Then there was nothing in April and now towards the end of May you have this kind of incident. Do you think the government should have taken stronger action against them? They should have but the problem is that the Punjab government has a kind of ambiguous approach and I think there is some element of denial within the leadership also. These groups also have some sympathy if not support at the societal level and that makes it difficult for the government to go against them openly. They need to work together and to emphasise to the people that they are terrorists. They use different names and Islam but actually their agenda is terrorism. Somehow the government of Punjab has been rather confused and ambiguous regarding these groups. Interview: Disha Uppal Editor: Anne Thomas",
        "generated_story": "Punjabi Taliban in northwest Pakistan Growing threat The Pakistani government has warned of a growing threat from the Pakistani Taliban. German political expert Hasan Askari Rizvi told Deutsche Welle on Monday that the threat of the militant group is growing. \"It is becoming more and more clear that Pakistan is facing an existential threat,\" he said in an interview published on the German news agency's website. He said the country was facing a \"new wave of terrorism\" and that it was \"increasingly becoming a threat to the stability of our country.\" \"We have to be very careful about what we do in the future,\" said Hasan, who is a political analyst in Lahore, the capital of Pakistan's south-eastern province of Punjab. The Taliban, he added, \"are not going to give up their fight against the Indian government, but rather, to establish a new state of terror in Pakistan.\" In the past few months, Pakistan has seen a rise in militant attacks on hospitals, schools and other public institutions. Last week, a suicide bomber attacked the Jinnah Hospital in Ahmadi, killing at least 10 people and injuring dozens more. In April, Pakistani security forces shot and killed a dozen people in a shootout between Pakistani and Indian forces. Since then, there have been a number of attacks in Punjab, where the Taliban have taken control of large swathes of territory. According to Disha Uppal, an expert in political science at the University of Pennsylvania, more than 1,000 people have died in Pakistani-administered Kashmir since the beginning of this year, according to data compiled by the US-based political research firm Open Doors.com, which has been publishing the interview, said it had found \"a lot of information\" about the attacks. It also said that there was an increase in suicide bombings in recent months. But it did not say how many people were killed or injured, or whether the attack was linked to a terrorist attack.

He was 45. The Catalan club announced the death of its former bench boss in a statement posted on its website on Friday. \"FC Barcelona is in immense mourning. Tito Vilanova has died at the age of 45. May he rest in peace,\" the statement said. Vilanova had first been diagnosed with a tumor in a saliva gland in November 2011, while he was an assistant to then-Barcelona head coach Pep Guardiola. He had been battling against recurring cancer ever since and had been admitted to a Barcelona hospital last week. He led Barca to the Primera Liga title last season, his only campaign as head coach, when the Catalans earned a record-tying 100 points. Last July he stepped down due to his ongoing health problems. Vilanova is survived by his wife and two children, including a son who now plays in Barcelona's youth academy. pfd/lw (AP, dpa, AFP)",
