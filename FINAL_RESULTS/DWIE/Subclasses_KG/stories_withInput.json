        "target": "Opinion: Obama's Cuban revolution President Barack Obama has made a very special declaration of love to Cuba. It's as revolutionary as the Cuban revolution, and as peaceful as the biblical Sermon on the Mount, says DW's Astrid Prange. US President Barack Obama has lost his old communist \"enemy,\" and Cuban President Raul Castro has lost his hatred of capitalism. In the first phone call from president to president since 1961 the two heads of state came to a surprisingly swift agreement. They want to renew diplomatic relations, which have been on ice for more than 50 years, and exchange ambassadors. It's only a matter of time before the US lifts its trade embargo against Cuba. All the word \"embargo\" is really good for - at this stage - is as an ideological soapbox for political hardliners, especially Republicans in Congress who believe lifting sanctions would constitute defeat for the US. Yet the lifting of the embargo has already begun. In addition to medication, it has been possible since 2000 to export agricultural produce such as maize, cereal crops, and poultry to Cuba. Flirting with the rogue state Furthermore, 100,000 US citizens have travelled to Cuba since 2011 for cultural and scientific exchanges. Travel restrictions on Cubans living in exile in the US who wanted to visit their relatives on the island were also lifted. According to press reports, the two countries' military forces are even said to be cooperating, as are their coastguards, and military on the border of the US marine base in Guantanamo. Now Obama wants to officially open a \"new chapter\" in relations with the communist Caribbean island and remove Cuba from the US list of so-called \"rogue states\" that support terrorism. The travel ban on American tourists visiting the island will also largely be lifted. That's as far as things will go for the time being, as Obama would require a majority in Congress in Washington to lift the embargo entirely. But even if these are only small steps, the fall of the American-Cuban wall has begun. The easing of the sanctions and the resumption of diplomatic relations are setting the scene for an end to the embargo. Embargo as scapegoat The tearing down of this \"wall in the mind\" is long overdue. The blockade is obsolete, and has proved to be entirely ineffective. More than this, its advocates have achieved the opposite of what they actually wanted. The blockade has provided the leaders in Havana with an easy excuse for their economic failure. Raul Castro realized long ago that Cuba's economic problems can no longer be justified simply by citing the US embargo. It looks as though he was counting on the blockade being lifted: There is no other explanation for the completion of the Mariel container port in January this year. Cuba's biggest infrastructure project was, incidentally, financed by Brazil. The Brazilians also sent a declaration of love to Cuba. Raul Castro opened the door to them. He loves anyone who helps him - his friends even more than his enemies.",
        "generated_story": "Cuba: The Fall of the Wall in the Mind of US President Barack Obama The fall of Cuba's financial and political system has been the subject of much debate in Washington. The US Congress has voted to close the US embassy in Havana and open the Guantanamo Bay prison to Cubans. In a speech delivered in Brazil, President Raul Castro said that he was \"deeply troubled\" by the financial crisis that hit his country in 2011. \"I'm deeply troubled,\" he said, referring to the Cuban debt crisis, which has cost the country $1.5 billion (\u20ac2.6 billion) since the end of its communist regime in 1961. He also called on Congress to pass a bill that would allow the government to open up the detention center in Cuba. This bill would have allowed for the transfer of Cuban citizens to other countries, including Brazil and Brazil. However, the bill did not pass the Senate, and the Obama administration has yet to make a final decision on whether or not to do so. Astrid Prange, a member of DW's Latin America team, told DW: \"The Cuban people are not going to give up on their dream of a better life for themselves and their families. They want to live in a more secure and secure future for their children and grandchildren.\" The Cuban government has long been accused of manipulating the international financial system to favor its own interests over the interests of other nations. That accusation, however, has not been proven to be true. For years, Cuba has relied on the United States as a source of financial support for its economy. But in 2000, Congress passed a law that allowed Cuba to set up a central bank in exchange for billions of dollars in foreign aid. Since then, it has become increasingly difficult to get the money to pay for a bank loan. Now, with the help of international lenders, Cuban banks and other financial institutions, they are able to lend a helping hand to US companies and individuals who are willing to invest in their own countries. At the same time, there is a growing recognition that Cuba is not the only country that can afford to spend money on a foreign bank. There is also the fact that, in many ways, this is the first time that a US president has spent more than a year in office. And that's not just because he's a Cuban. It's also because of his strong economic and social ties with his Cuban neighbors, who have benefited greatly from his economic reforms. His economic policies have also helped to spur economic growth in his home country. On the other hand, his Cuba policy has also been marked by a sharp increase in spending on social programs, such as education, health care, housing and education. These programs have been heavily criticized by critics who see them as an attempt to undermine the democratic process. Many of these criticisms stem from a lack of transparency and an unwillingness to share basic information about the economy and human rights."

The 89-year-old did not say when exactly his resignation would take effect. Calling the move a personal decision, President Giorgio Napolitano made his announcement during an end-of-year speech on Wednesday. \"I'm about to step down, to resign as the constitution expressly allows,\" he said, adding. \"I've reached an age that brings with it growing limitations and difficulties for me to do my institutional duties, which are complex and very demanding.\" Though he did not say when his resignation would take effect, a potential date is January 13 when Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi is due to give up the country's rotating six-month presidency of the Council of the European Union. Renzi faces a political challenge in organizing a replacement for Napolitano, dubbed by Italian media as \"King George.\" The president has served as a key intermediary between political parties through numerous changes in government and other tricky political situations. Napolitano, a former communist respected by Europe and Washington, took office in 2006. At the end of his seven-year mandate in 2013, he was asked to stay on because parliament could not agree on his successor. At the time he warned he may not serve out the full term, given his age. In Italy, presidents have loosely-defined powers including the ability to nominate prime ministers, dissolve parliament and veto legislation, as well as use the moral authority of the office to influence politics. se/cmk (dpa, Reuters)",

The resignation comes a day after Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi announced that he would step down from his post. \"I regret to inform you that I have accepted the resignation of the president of Italy,\" said the prime minister, who had been in office since 2006. Italy has been divided over the handling of corruption allegations in the United States, which have led to calls for the expulsion of US diplomats from the country and the closure of diplomatic missions in Washington and Rome. Italian media reported on Wednesday that the new president had accepted an offer from Washington to take up the post of president until the end of his term in January 2013. A spokesman for Italian President Giuseppe Conte said he had no immediate comment on the decision. se/cmk (dpa, Reuters)"

        "target": "Switzerland Calls on Private Security Firms for Euro 2008 In addition to enlisting foreign police during Euro 2008, Switzerland will also be bringing in private security personnel from Germany, reported a Swiss newspaper. \"We have to turn to about 500 private security personnel from Germany,\" Urs Stadler, spokesman for a security firm consortium told the Monday, May 26, edition of Swiss newspaper Tages Anzeiger. \"Most of them were already in operation during the World Cup two years ago, and have relevant experience,\" added Stadler from Prisec, a consortium made up of the companies Protectas and Securitas. The spokesman said more help was needed, but could not give exact numbers \"due to pending assignments.\" Recent soccer violence raises concern Swiss media has been questioning the security preparations for Euro 2008 after a spate of violence at recent games. In the latest incident, seats were ripped out and a goal post wrenched from the ground after St. Gallen faced the prospect of relegation following a 2-0 defeat to Bellinzona on May 20. St. Gallen was the third incident in a month that saw violent clashes with police who twice resorted to rubber bullets and tear gas. While Switzerland is seen as a low risk country in terms of hooliganism, violence has been on the increase in recent years and estimates claim there are around 400 hooligans and 600 sympathizers. Swiss Sports Minister Samuel Schmid said that hooliganism cannot be ruled out, reported German news agency DPA. But he expressed his belief that extra measures such as more policing, restrictions on alcohol -- which he has called \"a catalyst for violence\" -- and video surveillance will help keep trouble at bay. Private firms to boost European police The private security companies will be responsible for patrolling the stadiums and their surroundings, as well as the public viewing areas, team hotels and trainings areas.

Conservative members of Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition put forward a united front at the weekend against recent developments in the city of Wuppertal. Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said civilians wearing uniforms bearing the logo \"Shariah police\" could not simply start patrolling German streets. The groups reportedly hovered around sites like discotheques and gambling houses, telling passers-by to refrain from gambling and alcohol. Wuppertal's police have begun pressing charges. \"Sharia law is not tolerated on German soil,\" de Maiziere told mass-circulation daily Bild on Saturday. \"Nobody can take it upon themselves to abuse the good name of the German police.\" Justice Minister Heiko Maas, meanwhile, told Bild that \"the state alone\" was responsible for the administration of justice in Germany. It was obvious, Maas said, that any illegal parallel system of law enforcement would not be tolerated. Christian Democrat party whip Volker Kauder was similarly emphatic in an interview to be published in this week's Welt am Sonntag newspaper. \"Under absolutely no circumstances can we tolerate self-styled 'Sharia police officers' patrolling our streets and dictating what people should or should not do,\" Kauder said. Ringleader: goal was attention The 33-year-old behind the Wuppertal patrols, former fireman Sven Lau, published a video on his website on Saturday. Lau said that a \"Sharia police\" never existed, and that a group of men had simply worn the mock uniforms for a few hours. \"We knew that this would raise attention,\" Lau said, claiming that his goal was to spark a debate about Sharia law in Germany. Lau is a leading member of Germany's Salafist movement, advocates of a strict Sunni interpretation of political Islam. He works with a mosque in his native M\u00f6nchengladbach, not far west of Wuppertal, and used to head the fundamentalist group \"Invitation to Paradise.\" (Einladung zum Paradies, in German.) The central council of Muslims in Germany (ZMD) condemned the activities. \"These few teen yobs do not speak in our name,\" chairman Ayman A. Mazyek told the Tagesspiegel am Sonntag newspaper. \"These people are perverting the name of our religion. With this shrill and foolish action, they are really hurting Muslims.\" Sharia law is the Arabic term for a legal system based on the Koran. Saudi Arabia and Iran are examples of countries where such a system officially applies. Wearing a veil is obligatory for women and corporal punishment such as stoning is legally tolerated. Human Rights Watch reported last month that Saudi Arabia had beheaded 19 people in just 16 days in August, for convictions on charges ranging from cannabis smuggling to \"sorcery.\" msh/rc (AFP, dpa, Reuters)",

He added that he would not allow the police to interfere in the affairs of Muslims in his country. According to a statement released by the Bavarian interior minister, Thomas de Maiziere, the Islamic terrorist group \"Invitation to Paradise\" (IDP) is \"a terrorist organization.\" The group's chairman, Ayman A. Mazyek, told the newspaper that the group was a \"terrorist organization\" and that it would be \"unacceptable\" for the government to allow it to continue to operate in its current form. msh/rc (AFP, dpa, Reuters)"

Its warning follows a WHO admission that the epidemic requires \"extraordinary measures.\" The head of Medicins Sans Frontieres (MSF), Joanne Liu -- fresh from a visit to western Africa -- said in Geneva on Friday that more experts were needed in the hard-hit region. \"It is deteriorating faster, and moving faster, than we can respond to,\" Liu told reporters. \"Like in a war time, we have a total collapse of infrastructure,\" she added. Lui said the world community needed to get the \"upper hand\" over the next six months. While the viral spread had been slowed in Guinea, concerns focused especially on Liberia. \"If we don't stabilize Liberia, we will never stabilize the region,\" Lui said. She was critical of the WHO for delaying its public health emergency warning until August 8. \"We need people with a hands-on operational mindset,\" to combat the outbreak, Liu told the Geneva news briefing. WHO - 'vastly underestimated' On Thursday, the World Health Organization (WHO) said the scale of the epidemic had been \"vastly underestimated\" and that \"extraordinary measures\" were needed to contain the contagious virus. The UN health agency said the death toll had climbed to 1,069 in four afflicted countries, spanning Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia and more recently Nigeria. Sierra Leone's chief medical officer Brima Kargbo disclosed on Thursday that at least 32 of the nation's nurses and doctors had died from the Ebola virus while performing their duties between May 24 and August 13. Local staff suffered stigma, despite saving lives, Kargbo said. \"We still have to break the chain of transmission to separate the infected from the uninfected.\" Youth Olympics also affected The mounting alarm coincided with an announcement Friday from the International Olympics Committee that three athletes from Ebola-hit countries had been barred from competing in pool events and combat sports at the Youth Olympics opening in China on Saturday. ipj/tj (AfP, Reuters)",

Liu, who has been battling the disease for more than a year, said she was concerned about the pace of progress in the fight against the virus, which has killed at least 1,600 people in five countries since it began spreading to other countries on May 24."

        "target": "Oracle loses court fight over software resale rules A European court has ruled that it's permissible to resell software licenses even if the package has been downloaded directly from the Internet. It sided with a German firm in its legal battle with US giant Oracle. The European Court of Justice on Tuesday ruled that used software licenses may generally be resold by individuals or companies. The Luxembourg-based court thus sided with the German firm UsedSoft in a protracted legal battle with US software giant Oracle. The ruling made it clear that trade in used software was permissible even if the software had not been shipped on a physical medium such as a CD or DVD, but had been digitally downloaded from the Internet. UsedSoft's business model hinges completely on reselling used packages or legally obtained license keys for them. By reselling the keys to clients, the latter are then able to download the latest version of a given program directly from a company's Internet site and obtain all new updates and patches in the process. Legal clarity Oracle had sued UsedSoft over its business model, trying to prevent buyers of used software licenses from downloading programs again. But the European court ruled that the so-called principle of exhaustion applied whenever software was originally sold to a customer for an unlimited time span, not giving the maker of the software the right to prevent the resale of that software. \"The door for the trade in used software has been pushed wide open throughout the European Union,\" UsedSoft said in a statement, welcoming \"perfect legal safety on the market.\" The court in Luxembourg emphasized, though, that whoever resold pieces of original software and their accompanying licenses must erase every copy on their own computers in advance and was not allowed to keep a copy after resale. hg/mz (AFP, dpa)",

        "target": "NASA's 'Curiosity' readies to hit the Martian road The US space agency has said its Mars rover appears to be working \"flawlessly,\" with a lengthy period of instrument checks almost complete. The Curiosity rover will soon re-start its sluggish search for signs of life. NASA's Mars rover, \"Curiosity,\" will wrap up a lengthy self-testing phase on Thursday, freeing it up to continue exploring the surface of the Red Planet. Mission manager Jennifer Tropser told reporters in a conference call on Wednesday evening that the plan, once the final checks were completed, was to \"drive, drive, drive\" until Curiosity discovers a rock suitable for analysis. She added that the instrument checks have delivered positive results. \"Through every phase of the check-out, Curiosity has performed almost flawlessly,\" Tropser said. \"The success so far of these activities has been outstanding.\" Many of the tests have concerned Curiosity's robotic arm. The 2.1-meter (7-feet) appendage will be used to pick out and sample rocks and soil. NASA is investigating whether Mars can sustain life, or whether it could in the past. The tests were designed to identify any damage sustained during its interplanetary flight and also to ensure that the arm still functioned properly on Mars, with its different temperatures and gravity. The Mars rover landed in the giant Gale Crater, near the Martian equator, on August 5; it has so far moved about 109 meters within the crater. The rover is traveling east, heading first to an intersection called Glenelg, where three types of terrain meet. This is likely to be the location for the first rock and soil samples, though NASA said Curiosity was unlikely to arrive there for several weeks. Curiosity's ultimate destination is the nearby Aeolis Mons or Mount Sharp, a 3-mile-high mound of rock rising out of the crater. Mount Sharp is about 4.3 miles (7 kilometers) away from Curiosity's landing site. The $2.5-billion (1.93-billion-euro) six-wheeled rolling science lab is designed to last two years in order to complete its Mars mission. msh/jm (AFP, AP, Reuters)",

On Thursday, the rover's mission manager, Jennifer Tropser, said the results were \"very encouraging.\" \"We're very pleased,\" she said in a statement. \"This is a very important step in our journey to Mars, and we're looking forward to the next phase of our mission.\" The mission is designed to test the soil samples collected by Curiosity's rover on the Red Planet, Gale Crater, as well as Aeolis Mons, a mountain in the southern part of the red planet. It will be used as a test ground for its ability to detect the presence of microbial life on Mars. In addition to testing the samples, Curiosity will also be able to measure the extent to which microbial activity is present on Earth, such as the amount of carbon dioxide in water and the number of microorganisms present in Earth's atmosphere. Curiosity is scheduled to return to Earth in mid-August. msh/jm (AFP, AP, Reuters)"

        "target": "Aging health: WHO call to action as world population over 60 set to double by 2050 In a new report on aging and health, the World Health Organization is calling for action on \"population aging,\" as figures suggest the number of people over 60 will reach two billion by 2050. People worldwide are living longer, says the World Health Organization in its World Report on Aging and Health. This is both good and bad. It gives us the chance to \"pursue new activities\" as we get older, such as in education and family life. But it all depends on our health. And for that the WHO says world governments need to act now to make sure our societies worldwide are ready. What are the take home facts from the World Health Organization's 2015 report on Aging and Health? The WHO says that in the next 35 years, the global number of people aged 60 years and over will almost double from 12 percent to 22 percent. By 2020, there will be more people over the age of 60 than 5 year olds. And a majority of older people (80 percent) will live in \"low and middle income\" countries. It's estimated that the world's population aged 60 years and older will total about 2 billion in 2050, which is more than twice as much as now. Furthermore, worldwide, about 125 million people are aged 80 years or older. But by 2050, it is expected that this number of people - aged 80 and over - will live in China alone. But I'm not old, so why should I care? Well, all this is happening at a faster rate than ever before. And the WHO says \"all countries face major challenges to ensure that their health and social systems are ready\" for this major demographic shift. It will cost a lot of money to improve health and social infrastructures, especially in more developed countries where traditional families structures have changed dramatically. Surely, there's \"no typical older person,\" though. How does the WHO define aging? We tend to think of older people as physically and mentally frail. But that's not necessarily the case, not everywhere in the world. Old is a relative concept - especially in middle income to rich countries. For instance, some 70 year olds are as fit as some 20 year olds. Just think how many older folk are at your gym, and ask yourself whether you can keep up with all of them. But that still doesn't explain aging. What is it exactly? The WHO says that at a biological level, \"aging results from the impact of the accumulation of a wide variety of molecular and cellular damage over time.\" Basically, this puts people at a higher risk of disease and, of course, death. But aging can also be associated with \"life transitions,\" such as retirement or witnessing other people, such as friends and family, die around you. This can affect you psychologically and sometimes, as a result, physically. What sort of diseases come with old age? Some of the most common non-fatal conditions include hearing loss, cataracts, back and neck pain and osteoarthritis. Other conditions include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - which affects the lungs - diabetes, depression, and dementia. What needs to be done? The WHO is proposing a five-step plan of action, which includes: Committing to healthy aging and \"evidence-based policies to strengthen the abilities of older persons.\" Aligning health systems with the needs of older populations Developing systems for providing long-term care Creating \"age-friendly cities and communities Improving measurement, monitoring and understanding of \"aging issues\" worldwide. But don't forget: \"a longer life brings with it opportunities, not only for older people and their families, but also for societies as a whole.\"",
        "generated_story": "WHO's Population Aging Plan: Actions Now The World Health Organization (WHO) has released a new report on the world's population aging plan. The report, published in the journal Health Affairs, predicts that by 2050, the number of people aged 65 and older will be more than 1.5 billion. According to the WHO, this number will rise to 2.6 billion by 2020. \"The WHO is committed to achieving this goal by the year 2050,\" the report said, adding that the goal is to reach 2 billion people by 2040. This is the first step in a long-term plan to address the problem of aging in developing countries. It also aims to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke, cancer and other forms of dementia by reducing the amount of time between birth and death. In order to meet this target, WHO has set a target of 1 billion births between 2015 and 2020, with the aim of achieving 2 million births in 2050. However, it is not clear how many people will die from old age and how old they will become. What are the targets for the next five years? The WHO says the target is for a total of 3.4 billion birth-to-death births by 2030, which would be the highest level since the 1970s. These figures are based on data from 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2016. They also include the figure of 5.2 billion deaths from cardiovascular diseases in 2030. World health officials say that this figure represents a \"significant increase\" over the past five decades, as well as an increase in mortality rates for older people and for people with pre-eminent health conditions such as cancer, heart disease and Alzheimer's, among other things. But the new WHO report also points out that there is still room for improvement, particularly in rural areas, where people are more likely to live longer and healthier lives than in urban areas. That's why it's important to take action now and not wait until the end of the 20th century to make sure that people who are already living longer have access to health care and quality of life. And that's what we're going to do now. We have to act now, because we don't have time to wait and see what the future holds for our ageing population. So we need to be ready for 2050 and beyond, so that we can make the most of our time and resources available to our aging population,\u201d said WHO Director-General Margaret Chan."

        "target": "All Eyes on Kimi and Ferdy on Schumi's Turf All eyes will be on a Finn and a Spaniard at the German Grand Prix at Hockenheim on Sunday as the title battle between Kimi Raikkonen and Fernando Alonso looks to put local hero Michael Schumacher in the shade. It is a reflection of his current inauspicious Formula One campaign that World Champion Michael Schumacher is only featuring in reports on this weekend's German Grand Prix at Hockenheim dues to his nationality. The home grown champion equaled his own record of 11 wins in a season at last year's race but this year he will be hoping to just get on the podium at the end. Schumi lies in third place some 34 points off the top spot and has a lot to do if he is to record his 85th career win. Ferrari's poor season to date is unlikely to get better with hopes dwindling that the 36-year-old will add to his sole victory of the season although the seven-time world champion characteristically refuses to rule it out. Schumi and Ferrari still in the fight \"Contrary to many other people's opinions, we have in no means written ourselves off, even though we have to admit that the situation has worsened recently, rather than improved,\" said the German, referring to the problems with this season's car. \"But that doesn't mean that it can't be improved again, and that's exactly what we're working on.\" The limelight is falling on two young pretenders to Schumacher's throne as Sunday's race approaches. The battle between McLaren's flying Finn Kimi Raikkonen and championship leader Renault's speedy Spaniard Fernando Alonso is diverting eyes from the world record holding German on his own turf. Kimi aims to keep heat on leader Alonso Raikkonen must finish the German Grand Prix for the first time in five attempts to close the gap on Alonso if he is to keep his own championship hopes alive. The Finn retired from last year's race because of a rear wing failure and this season has been plagued by technical problems which most recently cost him 10 places on the starting grid in each of the last two rounds. Despite those penalties for engine failure, the 25-year-old managed to finish second and third but he will have to increase his total of three race wins if he is to make a significant impression on the 26-point chasm that separates him from Alonso. \"The battle for the championship is still on and I am determined to get a good result and work on closing the gap,\" said the Finn. \"The (car) has good speed and we need to make the most of it this weekend.\" Montoya doing McLaren team mate no favors Raikkonen's car is obviously a fast one this season but he's not the only driver in a McLaren hot seat. Colombia's Juan Pablo Montoya is not to going to make way for his team mate while his own hopes of the title, however small, remain alive. \"I am really looking forward to racing again this weekend in Germany,\" said Montoya, who won at Hockenheim for Williams two years ago and got his first victory for McLaren in Britain two weeks ago. \"I enjoy racing at Hockenheim, I have performed well here and won in the past and I am aiming for a strong result like at Silverstone.\" Consistent Ferdy the man to beat at Hockenheim Championship leader Alonso, meanwhile, has been impressively consistent for Renault so far this season, winning five times and failing to score points only at the Canadian Grand Prix, where he crashed, and in Indianapolis. The Spaniard is setting the pace and the standard this season so, problems aside, Alonso will again be the man to beat at Hockenheim.",
        "generated_story": "Alonso and Raikkonen in the title battle at Hockenheim Formula One driver Fernando Alonso and his Ferrari team-mates are battling for the German Grand Prix title. The two drivers are locked in a three-way battle to win the championship in Germany on Sunday. Alonso, who has won the last three races of his career, and Ferrari's Juan Pablo Montoya, have locked horns in what could prove to be a close race. \"I'm going to try and win this one,\" said the Spaniard, adding that he was \"very happy\" with the way his car performed in qualifying and that it was the first time he had ever driven in front of a crowd of spectators. Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher, meanwhile, is the only other driver to have been able to compete with Alonso in his first two races in F1. Hamilton, however, has been unable to break into the top 10, despite being the fastest driver on the grid for most of the season. He has yet to make it to the final round of qualifying, which will be held at Silverstone next weekend. Kimi Raikonen, the reigning world champion, will have to wait until the end of next season for a chance to challenge for his driver's title with McLaren. Both drivers have already clinched their respective drivers' championship titles, with Hamilton claiming the most points with his McLaren, Ferrari and Williams respectively. Williams' Juan-Pietro Monto has also claimed the pole position for Sunday's race in Colombia, where he will take on McLaren's Fernando Felipe Massa. In the other races, Hamilton and Alonso are the favorites to claim the world championship, while Williams driver Kimiyuki Kimiya has a shot at the podium with a win in Britain. But Hamilton has to settle for fourth place, after a disappointing season in which he has struggled to stay on track and has fallen behind his rivals in races such as Britain, Germany and Colombia. McLaren driver Carlos Sainz has already secured his place in next year's championship with Ferrari, but he is still far from guaranteed a spot in pole contention. That's not to say that Hamilton is not a threat to his title hopes, though, as the Canadian driver has not yet qualified for this weekend's Indianapolis 500."

        "target": "US duo shares Nobel Prize for Economics US researcher Elinor Ostrom is the first woman to win the Nobel prize for economics since it was created in 1968. She will share the prestigious award with US compatriot Oliver Williamson. The jury from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said the Americans' research had shown how \"economic analysis can shed light on most forms of social organization.\" Ostrom, a professor at Indiana University, was honored for her \"analysis of economic governance,\" especially in relation to the management of common property or property under common control. The political scientist's work challenges the widely accepted belief that common property is poorly managed and should be either regulated by central authorities or privatized, it added. She carried out numerous studies showing how self-organization and local-level management work to keep common resources viable. Her studies included both natural resources, such as forests, and artificial structures, for example police forces. Ostrom told Swedish television that she felt \"great surprise and appreciation\" and was \"in shock\" about being the first woman to win the prize. The pros and cons of big firms In his work, co-prizewinner Oliver Williamson, of University of California, Berkeley, examines why large corporations tend to arise - and why they do not - based on the cost and complexity of transactions, according to the Nobel committee. \"He has taught us to regard markets, firms, associations, agencies, and even households from the perspective of their contribution to the resolution of conflict,\" the jury said. Williamson authored 'The Economic Institutions of Capitalism' in 1975, a landmark text of the 'new institutional economics' movement that questioned the idea of firms as simple profit-making machines. Last but not least The Nobel prize for economics is the only Nobel award that was not created by the will of Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel in 1896. It was actually founded by the Swedish central bank, the Sverige Riksbank, to celebrate its tri-centenary a year earlier. It was awarded for the first time in 1969 under its official name: the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel. But although it was the last \"Nobel prize\" to be created and the last to be announced each year, the prize is not a poor relation in monetary terms. Winners of the awards for peace, literature, medicine, physiology, chemistry and physics all receive 10 million Swedish crowns (969,000 euros). A good year for women This year was a record year for women laureates. German-Romanian writer Herta Mueller won the Nobel Prize for Literature. Australian-American Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider of the United States were awarded the prize for medicine. And Ada Yonath of Israel was one of three scientists recognized for her work in chemistry. Americans more or less swept the board this year. Nine of the 11 laureates were US citizens. The most prominent of those was US President Barack Obama, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for his \"extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples.\" jg/AFP/dpa/Reuters Editor: Sam Edmonds",

Elinor Ostrom won the prize in 1968 for her work in economic sciences in memory of the late Swedish industrialist. The Swedish central bank awarded the Sveriges Riksbank Prize to women in the 1970s and 1980s for their contributions to economic science and the advancement of human rights. In a ceremony at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences (RSS) in Berkeley, California, the Swedish government announced the award on Wednesday. \"We are honored to have received this award,\" said Swedish Nobel Laureate Oliver Williamson, who was born in Sweden in 1896 and died in Romania in 1975. Williamson's work, \"The Economic Institutions of Capitalism,\" earned him the Nobel Peace Prize in 1969. He was one of only two women to ever win the prestigious prize, along with German Nobel laureate Carol Greider, for his work on the economics of capital.

        "target": "The Sun Sets Slowly Over Brandenburg's Tropical Dream Having suffered many disappointments concerning publically funded projects, the state of Brandenburg hoped a tropical leisure center would offer a ray of hope. Instead the ailing concern is just bringing more gloom. The economically depressed eastern German state of Brandenburg has seen its fair share of bitter experiences when it comes to huge public investment projects since German unification in 1990. Against this background, state authorities were pleased when Malaysian businessman Colin Au built a huge tropical-feeling leisure center in Brandenburg without any subsidies. The center, which opened about a year ago, was to become a symbol of economic success in a region where unemployment still hovers around the 20 percent mark. But the leisure time park, which has already swallowed a little under 100 million euros ($120 million) in private investment, is now going to have to depend on public funding to avoid another economic fiasco in Brandenburg. State authorities in Brandenburg haven't been too successful in their public investment policy in the past 10 years, to put it mildly. A grand plan to build one of the world's most modern chip-producing factories there burst like a bubble in 2003. The much-talked about Brandenburg-Berlin International airport still seems light years away from being built. Line of failures looked to be ended by Au's vision Another beacon of economic hope disappeared in 2002 when a company planning to build gas-filled transport airships went bust despite considerable subsidies. But Au's vision for the abandoned dome which the airship company needed as a hangar offered Brandenburg another chance. In the middle of nowhere, he created what he named his \"Tropical Islands\" wonderland, sporting everything from sandy beaches, lakes and a Laguna to a Caribbean-style village. The economics ministry in Brandenburg was over the moon to see Au originally agreeing to build the facility without any state subsidies. And Au himself had no doubt at the time that he could well do without them. Overestimated visitor numbers tell sorry story But the center's first year in operation tells a different story. Colin Au, who has meanwhile left Brandenburg and transferred matters to a German management company, had expected some 1.5 million visitors to come to Tropical Islands within the first year, but only some 950,000 will have turned up by the end of 2005. It seems highly unlikely that visitor numbers will increase considerably in future, placing a question mark on the viability of the whole centre. But Brandenburg's economics ministry is certain that the park will be in the black as of 2008. To make the place more attractive, it has agreed to shell out 15 million euros in subsidies for yet another reconstruction and marketing effort. After all, the leisure time center has a workforce of about 500 and is thus the biggest employer in an otherwise depressed region marked by a high jobless rate. Tropical center down but not out...not yet \"We hope the money will help make the Tropical Islands resort better known throughout Europe according to the new marketing concept hammered out the management,\" ministry spokesman Steffen Kammrath said. \"This leisure time center is unique and has to be marketed as such. What you have there is a tropical and water world 12 months a year with a lot of attractive offers to spend a whale of a time there.\" Some commentators believe that state subsidies may prolong the center's life span, but will not be able to avoid its demise in the long run. But the idea of also making it more attractive for tourists from all over Europe seems unrealistic to them if the resort's management can't even get enough visitors from home to ensure a profitable operation.",
        "generated_story": "The Sun Sets Slowly Over Brandenburg's Tropical Islands Resort The sun sets slowly over the tropical islands resort in the German resort of Tropical Island. It's the first time the sun has set in Germany since the 1990s, and it's not just because of the weather. There's also the fact that the resort is located on a tropical island. The resort, which opened in 2003, is one of Germany's most popular vacation spots for vacationers and business travelers. But it also has a lot to do with climate change. In the summer of 2002, temperatures soared above 100 degrees Celsius (104 degrees F) and the winds picked up again, bringing the temperature down to near zero. This is the second time in three years that temperatures have dropped below zero Celsius. \"The sun is setting slowly,\" said Steffen Kammrath, a spokesman for the city's tourism department, referring to the high temperatures and high winds that have hit the area in recent years. He added that it was \"very unusual\" for a resort resort to be located in such a remote location, where temperatures can reach as high as 110 degrees C (102 F). \"It's very unusual,\" he said, adding that he had no idea how high the temperatures would be at the time of opening. However, he did know that there was a possibility of a rise in temperatures, so he decided to take a closer look at it. 'We don't know what the future holds for this resort,' he added, noting that \"it's going to open up a whole new chapter in our tourism industry.\" \"We have to make sure that we have the right mix of people who want to stay here and who are willing to work hard to get the job done. That's what we're doing. We've got to find a way to bring people here who can work for us and help us get our business done.\" The stormy weather has also been a source of concern for business owners, who have struggled to cope with high costs of running their businesses. Last year, the company announced it would shut down its business operations, citing a lack of staff and a shortage of skilled workers. Businesses, however, have been able to keep up with demand, with the construction of new hotels, restaurants, bars and bars, as well as the expansion of existing ones. A new hotel is being built on the island of Laguna, just off the coast of Malaya, but it will not open until the end of this year. According to a statement from the hotel's owner, Colin Au, there will be no opening until at least 2008."

        "target": "Bayern's Klinsmann Praises, Hoeness Attacks Hoffenheim The Bundesliga's two top teams don't play until Friday, but the mind games are already underway. Bayern's coach Juergen Klinsmann says Hoffenheim are legitimate contenders, but commercial manager Uli Hoeness disagrees. When the Bundesliga scheduled Bayern's home match against Hoffenheim in the league's unloved Friday night slot, they probably didn't imagine that it would turn out to be the match of the first half of the season. Indeed, few experts or fans thought that Hoffenheim, a first-division debutante located in a southern German village with 3,000 inhabitants, would give mighty Munich a run for its money. But it's the first week of December, and Hoffenheim top the table by three points. They also have a much better goal difference than their second-placed rivals -- and that has drawn praise from Bayern's coach, Juergen Klinsmann. \"I have the highest estimation of Hoffenheim because they've built the squad very ambitiously, rationally and with very good players,\" Klinsmann told DPA news agency. \"They can be proud of that.\" Klinsmann said he thought that the club could establish itself among the top three or four sides in Germany in the years to come and qualify for international competition next season. He also had words of praise for Hoffenheim's software billionaire patron, Dietmar Hopp, whose money has funded the club's ascent. \"There's nothing negative about it,\" Klinsmann said. \"He used to play for the club, is a soccer man through and through and helped the team get on its feet.\" Some fans have criticized Hopp and Hoffenheim for paying inflating salaries and luring talent away from other clubs instead of developing homegrown players. In fact, Hoffenheim's official salary budget is about average for the Bundesliga. Hoeness sounds his horn But while Bayern's coach was praising his opponents to the skies, Munich's commercial manager Uli Hoeness has been trying to play with their heads. On the heels of Bayern's convincing win over Leverkusen last weekend, Hoeness is back to taunting rivals. \"The performance we showed in the second half against Leverkusen will be enough against Hoffenheim,\" Hoeness told the German soccer magazine kicker. Hoeness also dropped a none-too-thinly-veiled hint that Hoffenheim's personnel expenditures were far higher than the officially released figures and scoffed at the idea that strategy would determine the outcome of Friday's match. \"Games are decided by the better players, not by tactics,\" Hoeness said. \"And of course, we've got better players than Hoffenheim.\" But that particular verbal attack may represent some wishful thinking of the manager's part. Hoffenheim coach Ralf Rangnick is one of only two current Bundesliga skippers with a winning record against Munich. Rangnick, whose team cruised past Bielefeld last weekend to keep Bayern three points back, reacted to Hoeness' remarks with a shrug. \"We're preparing for Munich exactly the same way we did against Bielefeld,\" Rangnick said. In any case, soccer fans in Germany know what they'll be doing Friday evening -- finding a bar with cable sports television to watch a top match that no one, before the start of the season, would have considered possible.",
        "generated_story": "Hoffenheim's Commercial Manager Reacts to First Half of Bundesliga Season The Bundesliga's commercial manager has reacted to the first half of the Bundesliga season with a statement. \"We are very happy with the results so far,\" Ralf Rangnick told German soccer magazine DPA on Friday night. He said the club was \"very happy\" with its first two games in the league and that he was looking forward to continuing his work with his new team. The German side, who have been struggling with injuries for the past couple of weeks, will be looking to bounce back in December, when they travel to Leverkusen to take on Borussia Dortmund in their first match in what is expected to be a three-match Bundesliga campaign. Rengnick said that the team would continue to work hard to improve on last season's form, but added that it would be up to them to make the most of their progress. Hoeness also pointed out that his side had a good chance of qualifying for next year's Champions League, which they lost to Bayern Munich last month. But he also stressed the importance of continuing to build on the momentum generated by the win over Bielefeld, in which the visitors were able to get back into the top-flight on a high note after a 2-1 defeat at home to Dortmund last weekend. A positive result for Hoffensheim is that they are on course to reach the quarter-finals in Germany's top division, where they have a chance to clinch a spot in next season\u2019s top flight. Hoffenerheim, meanwhile, have yet to win a league match since the end of December. Coach Dietmar Hopp has been in charge since November, and said he would like to see his team win their next two matches in a bid to stay in contention for a place in Europe's elite club competition. However, he said it was too early to say whether the squad would make a decision on who would take over the reins at the start of this season. It was not immediately clear if the new coach would stick to his plan, however, or whether he will stick with it at all costs. On the pitch, the goalkeepers will have to decide whether or not they want to continue playing in front of a home crowd or if they will stay away from the field of play. That's a big question mark for both sides, with both teams struggling to find a way to keep their heads above the parapet. At the same time, there is also the question of who will take the starting spot at Bayern. How long will it be before the players are allowed to return to training? \"I don't know for sure,\" said Rungnick."

        "target": "Automation in the dairy cow industry A small but nevertheless important sector of the German economy today is agriculture. Although the number of farms has declined over the decades, production has actually increased -- especially at dairy farms. Modern automation technology and robotics are helping to keep both cows and farmers happy, but at the cost of jobs.",
        "generated_story": "Automation in the Dairy Cow Industry In the dairy cow industry, there is a lot of competition. The competition is fierce and the competition fierce. Dairy cows, for example, have to compete with other dairy cows in order to keep up with the demand for dairy products. This competition has been fierce for years, and now there's a new breed of cow that's going to take over the market. It's called the \"Dairy Cow,\" and it's the world's largest cow. There's no doubt about that. But there are a few things that are different. One is the fact that the cow doesn't have any milk at all. And the other is that it has to be fed by a cow, which is what the cows are made of. That's why the milk cow is so important to the industry. In order for milk cows to stay in production, they need to have a good supply of milk, so that they can keep their milk fresh for as long as possible. So, when it comes to producing milk in Germany, it\u2019s not as easy as it is in other countries, where milk production is more difficult to produce milk from cows than in milk-producing countries such as the United States, Canada, France, Germany and even the US. All of these factors contribute to this competition, as well as to increasing the number of cows that can be milked and processed. These factors are also responsible for the rise in dairy cattle production in recent years. As a result, the production of dairy milk is becoming more and more mechanized, with more cows being slaughtered and less milk being produced. However, this is still not enough to satisfy the demands of farmers, who are increasingly looking to mechanize their dairy production to make it more efficient and efficient. What's next? The next step will be to develop a system that will allow farmers to process milk more efficiently and efficiently, thereby reducing the need for mechanization.   The first step in this direction is to introduce a process that is completely automated and completely free of human error."

        "target": "Inching towards direct talks on Syria They came to hold talks, but started negotiations with mutual affronts. But if there is one person who might be able to mediate between the intransigent Syrian conflict parties, it's Lakhdar Brahimi. Lakhdar Brahimi, the United Nations special envoy for Syria, seemed very tired on Friday (24.01.2014). He had had a long day, which was actually supposed to be the first real day of negotiations at the Syria Conference in Geneva. \"Good afternoon,\" Brahimi told the assembled international press, before adding, \"or good evening, I don't know.\" At the Palais des Nations in Geneva, he presented the most important result of his attempts to mediate between the Syrian government and the opposition to the more than 250 journalists who had managed to get a coveted place at the press conference: \"Tomorrow we expect and we have agreed that we will meet in the same room.\" What Brahimi is declaring an achievement doesn't sound like much, but considering how irreconcilable the conflict parties have been, even that can be seen as a small success. Separate talks with Brahimi The two delegations were actually due to meet on the first day of negotiations in Geneva in order to agree on a timetable and on the subject and agenda of the talks. But emotions are running too high on both sides. Instead both delegations held separate talks with Lahkkdar Brahimi, both lasting just about an hour each In the morning. The Syrian government delegation had apparently been threatening to leave the conference. At least that is what the deputy foreign minister Faisal Mekdad had implied. \"We are here to start the negotiations,\" he told waiting journalists, \"but we found that the other party did not want to come.\" Before the conference, the opposition had explained that for its delegation, the formation of a transition government would be a central tenet of the negotiations. They emphasized that this topic should be discussed right at the beginning of talks and that the establishment of such a body should be initiated without delay. Social media and good old propaganda The representatives of the Syrian National Coalition that were present in Geneva neatly used all imaginable channels to make their views public. At #Geneva2, they tweeted: \"Forming a transitional body is our major priority,\" leaving people in no doubt that the Syrian National Council would not want to include Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Assad's government, on the other hand, is relying on classic propaganda and loyal state media representatives in Geneva. An impressive entourage of dominant journalists from state-run media outlets is constantly at hand, accompanying the government delegation and making sure they get their point across at press conferences. Lakhdar Brahimi even had a small altercation with a journalist from a Syrian state news agency, who made a political statement under the pretense of asking the UN mediator a question. \"Are there any signs that Saudi Arabia, Turkey and other countries would stop the support of terrorism in Syria?,\" she asked in somewhat shaky English, before Brahimi interrupted her. \"Please, please, there is no point in asking such questions!\" Such exchanges hint at the type of negotiating style the experienced diplomat and mediator Brahimi must have behind the scenes. 'Wish us luck' Lakhdar Brahimi described the preliminary talks that took place in Geneva as encouraging and asked for patience. He said that because the peace conference had come about at the last minute and the delegations had therefore only been appointed very recently, there hadn't been enough time to hold preliminary discussions - a task that the delegations were now catching up on. \"We never expected it to be easy and I'm sure it's not going to be,\" he said. \"But I think the two parties understand what is at stake. Their country is in very, very bad shape.\" He added: \"The huge ambition of this process is to save Syria. Nothing less than that.\" After appealing to the willingness of both parties to negotiate, he simply added: \"So wish us luck!\" Fight for freedom As the official delegations held talks with UN mediator Brahimi in the Palais des Nations, the European headquarters of the United Nations, hundreds of Syrian expatriates who had come from all over Europe protested outside, forming a sea of red, white and black Syrian flags on the Place des Nations. With their presence outside the UN gates they wanted to show that despite all the government propaganda, the Syrian National coalition has a lot of support from the Syrian people. Thirty-two-year-old Ziad Malki came to Geneva from Zurich to show his solidarity. Ziad knows how it feels to be deprived of his freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. In 2005, he was arrested at a demonstration in Damascus and says he was tortured during his time in prison. Now he is fighting for a new Syria from outside the country's borders. Ziad is sure that with Bashar al-Assad and his family, there will be nothing new. \"We don't want this man to be in",
        "generated_story": "UN mediator talks with Syrian National Coalition in Geneva The head of the UN's Geneva office has met Syrian opposition leader Bashar al-Assad in the Syrian capital, Geneva. The Syrian government has called on the United Nations to mediate between the opposition and the government. Syrian deputy foreign minister Faisal Mekdad met with representatives of Syria's opposition on Friday to discuss the ongoing conflict in Syria. \"We are working closely with our Syrian partners,\" he said, adding that he was \"deeply impressed\" by the progress made during the talks. He said he had been \"very impressed by what we have been able to accomplish.\" The meeting was the latest in a series of high-level meetings between Syrian and Turkish officials, which began on 24.01.2014, with the aim of reaching an agreement on a cessation of hostilities. On Friday, the two sides agreed to hold talks at the Palais des Nations in Switzerland until the end of this week, according to a statement released by Syrian Deputy Foreign Minister Fahkkdar Brahimi. #Geneva2 The Geneva conference is the first of its kind to be held in Europe since the conflict broke out in 2005. At the time, it was held under the auspices of UN special envoy for Syria, Ziad Malki, who was visiting from Turkey. During the meeting, Syrian officials said they had discussed the possibility of a ceasefire, but did not know whether the ceasefire would be in place until later this year. In an apparent attempt to reach a deal, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Turkey have all called for an end to the fighting. However, a Syrian official told the Associated Press news agency that the truce would not be reached until at least mid-January. According to Syrian state media, this was not the case, however, and that is why the Geneva talks were called off. A UN spokesman said the parties had agreed not to resume talks until after the elections. Meanwhile, Syria has been holding a referendum on whether to allow the use of chemical weapons in its war against the rebels. It is not clear how the referendum will affect the outcome, although it is thought that it will be decided by a vote of no-confidence in Assad's government on Sunday. Speaking at a news conference in Zurich, Swiss foreign ministry deputy minister of foreign affairs, Zahra Bekdad, said there was a \"clear lack of consensus\" on how to proceed with negotiations. \u201cThere is a lot of disagreement on this,\u201d he told reporters, referring to differences over the role of Assad\u2019s government and whether he should be allowed to continue his role as prime minister."

        "target": "Italy's navy to patrol with Libyan ships to curb human trafficking Italy wants to work more closely with Libya to limit the number of sea crossings by migrants and potential asylum seekers. But what are the consequences? Italy's prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni, does not want to wait any longer for EU countries to show solidarity in distributing asylum seekers throughout the bloc. On Thursday he announced in Rome that the Italian navy would be patrolling with Libyan ships just off the Libyan coastline. The aim, Gentiloni says, is to curb human trafficking and bring migrants back from the smugglers' boats to Libya. According to the Italian government's figures, 93,000 migrants have arrived in Italy so far this year. At least 2,000 have drowned in the attempt to cross the Mediterranean - the true figure is unknown. Italy has already threatened to stop allowing boats carrying rescued migrants to dock in Italian ports, or that it may issue migrants with documents that would allow them to travel on to other European countries. Rome has not yet implemented either policy, but the government has made clear that Italy will soon run out of options. The EU Commissioner for Migration Dimitris Avramopoulos acknowledged, again, in Brussels on Thursday that \"Europe continues to face high migratory pressures. And Italy more than (almost) any others.\" The European Commission issued a letter offering more aid and personnel to help manage migration better. Accommodation will soon be full The office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, wrote at the beginning of July that \"Close to 200,000 accommodation places are available for refugees and migrants across [Italy], but are nearly all full.\" The High Commissioner referred particularly to the numbers of people dying when he warned, \"What is happening in front of our eyes in Italy is an unfolding tragedy.\" The United Nations anticipates that another 100,000 migrants will come to Italy via Libya before the end of this year. The number of arrivals is already 20 percent higher than last year; and the number of dead, those who could not be saved, would rise accordingly. According to UN estimates, the Mediterranean remains the \"deadliest\" refugee route in the world. Italian government statistics say that around 600,000 people have arrived in Italian ports since the start of the crisis in 2014. It is unclear how many have since traveled on to Austria, France or Switzerland. Once migrants are registered in Italy and accommodated in camps, they are not held there. If, however, they leave the accommodation without giving notice, they forfeit their claim to subsistence and social services. Most of the migrants are from African countries, and many try to travel on to France, for example. 300 people are currently sleeping on the beach in Ventimiglia, on the French border, hoping to take a bus or train to France. However, the border is being policed by French officials. Migrants who are caught are sent back to Italy. Austria has announced that it too will close its border with Italy if the number of migrants starts to rise. Repatriation and distribution are difficult Last year 120,000 new asylum applications were made in Italy. Around 50 percent of these are rejected. The asylum seekers are then supposed to leave the country. However, the process of people either returning voluntarily or being deported is very slow. The interior ministry has therefore announced that it will reinforce repatriation programs. The redistribution of asylum seekers from Italy, as agreed by the European Union, is well behind target. Two years ago the aim was to resettle 120,000 people. So far, only 24,676 people have been redistributed, the EU Commission said on Thursday: 7,873 from Italy, and 16,803 from Greece. The numbers are low not just because of the reluctance of other EU countries to take the refugees in, but also because of Italian delays in the registration of possible candidates. Asylum seekers from Eritrea are the most likely to fulfill the criteria for redistribution. Around 25,000 are currently living in Italy, but only 10,000 have been registered with the EU Commission and the European Asylum Support Office as possible candidates. Migration Commissioner Avramopoulos has announced that Italy will be given more help and logistical support in this area.",
        "generated_story": "EU Commissioner for Migration Paolo Gentiloni says Italy is facing \"an unfolding tragedy\" in the Mediterranean region The European Union's migration commissioner said Thursday that Italy was facing an \"unprecedented tragedy.\" The EU's commissioner for migration, Dimitris Avramopoulos, said the situation in Italy \"is becoming more and more complex.\" \"The situation is becoming increasingly complex,\" he told a news conference in Ventimiglia, Italy's capital. The Italian prime minister, Matteo Salvini, has called for an end to the migrant crisis in Europe. \"We have to deal with this crisis because it is not going to be solved in a way that is acceptable to us,\" the Italian premier said in an interview with Italian news agency Tuttosport. Italian Prime Minister Manuel Valls, who has been in Rome since 2014, called on the EU to help Italy cope with the influx of migrants from Libya, Eritrea and other African countries. Italy, which is one of the fastest-growing EU countries in terms of asylum seekers, is the only EU member state that has so far been able to cope adequately with a surge in arrivals, according to a report by the European Commission's Migration and Asylum Support Office (MOSO). \"It is a tragedy that we are facing,\" said Filippo Grandi, the head of Italy\u2019s migration office. \u201cWe are faced with an unprecedented tragedy.\u201d Italy has become the first EU country to allow migrants to enter the bloc without a visa. It is now the second largest country, after Greece, with more than 1.5 million people, to accept migrants. Last year, it was Italy that allowed the largest number of people to reach Europe via sea. This year alone, there have been over 1,200,000 arrivals. That number is expected to rise to 2,500 in 2014. At the same time, EU leaders are calling on Italy to step up its efforts to stem the flow of refugees into the country. In a statement released on Thursday, European officials said they were \"deeply concerned\" about the \"ongoing crisis\" at the border between Italy and Libya. They also said that they would continue to work closely with Italy in order to ensure the safety of all migrants who enter Europe through the Schengen zone."

Germany is the host country for the 2011 FIFA women\u2019s soccer championship. The tournament will be held in Berlin from June 26 to July 1. Organizers of the tournament have announced the date and location of Germany's first female soccer competition, which will take place at the Berlin Arena. According to a report in Deutsche Welle, the German capital, Berlin, has been chosen as host city for this year's tournament. \"We are very excited to be able to host this event,\" the report said. It also said that Germany will have the opportunity to showcase its female athletes in front of a large audience of fans from all over the world. There will also be the chance to show off their talents at a world-class event. German media reported that the event would be broadcast live on television and online, with coverage from around the globe. In addition to the competition itself, Germany also has the option of broadcasting live from the stadium, as well as from other venues, such as hotels, restaurants, bars and restaurants across the city. Hosting the women will not be an easy task, according to organizers, who have said they are looking forward to hosting more than 100,000 spectators. However, they have also expressed their interest in hosting other events, including the soccer internationals' international matches. Berlin is currently the only city in Germany to have hosted a FIFA-sponsored event, and the organizers have promised to make it a \"must-see\" event for women in their field of play. They have already announced plans to broadcast the games on TV, radio, print, online and on social media. FIFA is also planning to hold a special ceremony at Berlin's Olympic Stadium to mark the 20th anniversary of its founding in 1892.  The event is expected to draw around 1,500 spectators and draw a total of 2.5 million spectators in a bid to keep the game alive and kicking for years to come. More than a year ago, FIFA announced it would hold its first women-only event in its history. Since then, there have been a number of international and domestic events in which women have competed. This year, however, it is not just Germany that is playing host to this tournament, but also the United States, France, Spain, Italy, Japan, Russia, China and South Korea, among others."

Many others were wounded when the float they were traveling on made contact with a power line. Officials in Port-au-Prince said the accident occurred as thousands of revelers filled the streets of the city center of the Haitian capital in the early hours of Tuesday. The Associated Press quoted witnesses at the scene who reported seeing somebody on one of the floats used a stick or pole to move a power line so that the vehicle could pass under it. Reuters cited a witness who reported seeing the head of a singer from the hip-hop band Barikad Crew make contact with the power line. Some of the victims were electrocuted instantly, while others jumped off the float, causing panic among the revelers who lined the street. Many of the at least 18 deaths came as a result of the ensuing panic, while at more than 40 others were injured, according to local authorities. There was some confusion about the number of fatalities, with the Associated Press putting it at 20, and AFP later reported that only around 10 had died. Haitian President Michel Martelly used his Twitter account to express his condolences to the injured and bereaved. \"My sincere sympathies to the victims of the serious incident that occurred this morning at the Champ de Mars (area in downtown Port-au-Prince),\" the president said. pfd/rc (AP, Reuters, AFP)",

        "target": "Is China seeking regime-change in North Korea? The sudden reduction in aggressive rhetoric and actions by North Korea has led to suggestions that Pyongyang has realized it has pushed its only ally in the region to the brink of severing its friendship. The announcement in Pyongyang on May 13 of the promotion of Jang Jong-nam to \"minister of the People's Armed Forces\" came out of the blue. Until recently, the little-known commander of an army corps in coastal Kangwon Province, Jang has replaced Kim Kyok-sik, a four-star general with a long track record of loyal service to the regime. The reasons for 70-year-old Kim's replacement are not clear - as with most of the political maneuvers in North Korea - but it may have been his loyalty that cost him his position in the politburo. Kim was widely seen as a hawk in the regime and is believed to have been in command of the operation to shell the South Korean island of Yeonpyeongdo in November 2010, an incident that killed four people, destroyed civilians' homes and infrastructure and dramatically worsened the already strained relationship between Pyongyang and Seoul. By sacrificing Kim, analysts believe, North Korea is signaling that it is backing away from the confrontational stance it adopted after the United Nations imposed new sanctions in the wake of the nation's third underground nuclear test in February. And there are other indicators that Pyongyang is seeking to return to the status quo. The North's troops have been permitted to step down from the highest state of preparedness for war that was initially ordered when South Korea and the US began a series of annual military exercises. Missiles withdrawn Similarly, two Musudan intermediate-range missiles that were identified as being on mobile launchers being operated in eastern areas of the country have apparently been ordered to return to base. In late April, there was concern that test-launches of the missiles would be a further escalation by Kim Jong-un's government and a message that it would not bow to international pressure to halt its nuclear and missile development programs. But the analysts believe the tokens of Pyongyang's goodwill have come too late. \"For the North Korean leader, this is a very difficult time,\" Toshimitsu Shigemura, a professor at Tokyo's Waseda University and an authority on North Korean affairs, told DW. \"Timing is very important here and it is possible that China is moving to abandon Kim Jong-un. The atmosphere between the two nations is changing. China may have decided that it is time for a regime-change in the North, they will not permit the collapse of the country because they do not want chaos on their own borders.\" Further evidence that Beijing is slowly tightening the screw on its erstwhile ally comes as more state-run financial institutions sever their links with banks in North Korea. The latest institution to adhere to the government's orders to halt transactions across the border is the Bank of China, one of the four major banks in the country, which announced on May 7 that it would cease dealings with the Foreign Trade Bank of North Korea, which has been identified as being involved in Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs. Contingency plan in place Intelligence sources have passed on to DW information that Beijing has a contingency plan in place for when Kim Jong-un's control over the country crumbles. The reports confirm that China is indeed quietly encouraging regime change and is grooming Kim's brother, Kim Jong-nam to take over his role. At 42, Kim Jong-nam is the oldest son of Kim Jong-il, the dictator who ruled North Korea with an iron fist for 17 years until his sudden death in December 2011. Kim Jong-nam had been expected to assume the leadership after his father's death, but fell from favor spectacularly in 2001 when he was detained with two women and a boy aged 4 at Tokyo's Narita International Airport travelling on a forged Dominican Republic passport. He later admitted that he had wanted to visit Disneyland. He subsequently lived in Macau and Beijing, under the close watch of the Chinese authorities. The reports suggest that after Kim Jong-nam is installed in Pyongyang, his brother will be permitted to go into exile, probably in China. The tactic is not without its pitfalls, however, in part due to the efficiency of the campaign to deify their young leader as the future of the nation. Kim Jong-nam as 'new king' \"China may be dreaming of appointing Kim Jong-nam as the new king - and he is more preferable to the West than Kim Jong Un - but the problem is that he is not known in North Korea,\" said Ken Kato, director of Tokyo-based Human Rights in Asia. \"Many people in Japan know much about the North Korean 'Royal Family,' but this information is hidden in North Korea,\" he said. \"Even residents of Pyongyang know very little about Kim Jong-nam.\" Yet the reports are gaining credence among North Korea-watchers. Jun Okumura, a political analyst with the Eurasia Group, told DW that North Korea withdrawing",
        "generated_story": "North Korea's 'new king' Jang Jong-nam is the new leader of the North Korean regime. He has been in power since December 2011, when he took over the leadership of North Korea from Kim Jong Un. On May 7, he was sworn in as the country's \"new leader\" by the People's Armed Forces (PASDF). He is also the first person to hold the position of vice-president of South Korea. In his first official address to the nation's parliament, Kim said that he would be \"very proud\" of his country. \"I will be very proud of my country,\" he said. But he added that it was also important for him to be able to take the oath of office in the event of a reconciliation between the two Koreas. The North Koreans have long been enemies of each other, and they have a long history of hostility toward one another. That's why it's important to me that I take this opportunity to share my views with you. It's a very important thing for me, because I'm going to give you a lot of information. I will share it with the people of this country, so that they don't have to worry about the consequences of their actions,\" said Toshimitsu Shigemura, a professor of political science at Waseda University in Tokyo, referring to Kim's father, the late dictator, who was killed in a car accident in Pyongyang in 2011. Kim was born on the same day as his father. His father was a military officer and his mother was his grandmother's sister. Both of them were born in Seoul. They were raised by their mother's grandmother. Their father had been a soldier for many years, but he died of cancer in his early 20s. During his time in office, they were both doctors and nurses. After the death of Kim in 2001, his family moved to Seoul, where they lived for a year and a half before returning to Pyongyang. Since then they've been living in different parts of Korea, including the capital Seoul and the city of Yeonpyeongdo, which is located in Kangwon Province. When Kim fled to Macau in early 2011 to seek refuge with his wife and two children, there was widespread speculation that Kim would return to his home country and take over as head of state. However, it turned out that the rumors were true and Kim did not return. According to Ken Kato of Human Rights in Asia (HRIS), the UN's special rapporteur on human rights issues, \"the United Nations has called for an end to all forms of inter-Korean conflict.\" The UN has also called on Pyongyang to halt its nuclear and missile tests, as well as its missile and nuclear programs, in order to protect its citizens from the threat of nuclear weapons and other weapons. A UN report released last month found that Pyongyang's nuclear program had killed more than 1,000 people in its first three years of existence. This was followed by an increase in rocket launches and rocket attacks in April and May. Last year, Pyongyang launched a missile attack that killed at least 30 people and injured hundreds of thousands of people. Following the launch of its latest missile test on May 13, South Korean President Moon Jae-in ordered the deployment of an anti-missile defense system at Narita International Airport, near the border with China. Seoul's Foreign Trade Bank (FTRB) said the missile launch was an \"important step forward in terms of reducing the number of rockets and missiles fired into the air.\" But it also pointed to a possible escalation of tensions between Pyongyang and Beijing, saying that \"there is no need to escalate tensions further.\""

        "target": "Gang battle in Mexico as US' John Kelly visits A gunbattle between drug gangs in northern Mexico has left 14 people dead. It's the latest in a series of turf wars. Smuggling has prompted a visit to Mexico City by US Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly. Prosecutors said the remote town of Las Varas in Chihuahua state was the scene of Wednesday's battle between affiliates of the Ciudad Juarez cartel and a gang from the state of Sinaloa. Police said fighting escalated when patrols arrived. Fourteen people were found dead; 12 others were hospitalized. Grenades, launchers and rifles were found. The mountainous region is used as a corridor for smuggling into the US. El Chapo effect Chihuahua security commissioner Oscar Alberto Aparicio said a Black Hawk helicopter was called in as police chased surviving gang members through the area known for marijuana and opium poppy production. Two police officers had been killed in a \"cowardly\" way in the area a week ago, he said. In a similar incident last Friday, 17 gunmen were killed during a shootout with police on a highway in Sinaloa, Mexico's northwestern state. Sinaloa was the home base of Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, whose extradition to the US in January apparently left gangsters in a struggle for control of criminal syndicates. Homicides have surged in recent months, with the number of persons killed in May put at 2,186, the highest since the collection of such statistics began 20 years ago. Nieto and Kelly to talk In Mexico City Wednesday, President Enrique Pena Nieto's office said he and visiting US Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly had discussed how to rein in organized crime groups. \"Shared responsibility\" must become the focus of transnational efforts, Kelly said. Narcotics smuggling into the US has become a multibillion-dollar (multibillion-euro) business for Mexican drug cartels. Mexico in turn wants the US to throttle demand for narcotics and the supply of illegal weapons to Mexico cartels. Pena Nieto and US President Donald Trump, who wants a border wall, are schedule to meet Friday on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany. ipj/ng (AP, AFP, dpa)",

US President Donald Trump is due to meet with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto at the end of his visit to the country's northernmost state of Sinaloa. The two leaders are expected to discuss security and the fight against drug traffickers Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, who has been on the run for more than a year. Mexican officials said on Wednesday that they had received a tip-off that the suspected drug trafficker had been killed in a shootout with police in the border town of Las Varas. \"We have received information that there was an exchange of gunfire between the two sides,\" said Mexican Interior Minister Oscar Alberto Aparicio, adding that he was \"very concerned\" about the possibility of an escalation of the violence. In a statement released by the Mexican government, the interior ministry said that \"it is very clear that we have not seen any escalation in violence in recent days.\" The statement came a day after US Secretary of State John Kerry traveled to Mexico City, where he met with top Mexican security officials. On Wednesday, Trump said he would hold a summit with the president of Mexico on Thursday, May 24 and 25, respectively. He also called on Mexico to step up security in its southern neighbor, Chiudad Juarez, which is home to one of its biggest drug trafficking hubs, and to strengthen its border security. Trump's visit comes as Mexico prepares to host the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany, on May 25 and 26. Mexico is also preparing for the US presidential election in May.

Their lawyer, Femi Falana, said the 54 men were sentenced to death by firing squad and five had been acquitted. They were accused of conspiring to commit mutiny against the authorities of the 7th Division of the Nigerian army, which is on the frontline. The trial began on October 15 and was conducted behind closed doors. It is subject to approval by top military officials, but there has so far been no indication that senior officers oppose the court martial. They were not available for comment afterwards. There was a similar case in Nigeria in September, when 12 soldiers were sentenced to death for mutiny after firing on their commanding officer in the northeast city of Maiduguri. The 7th Division, based in Maiduguri, leads the offensive but there are numerous reports of troops refusing to deploy. Soldiers have regularly complained that they lack weapons, food, and other basic supplies to fight the Islamists, who are reported to have tanks, rocket-propelled-grenade launchers, and other heavy weaponry. Boko Haram has taken a number of towns and declared an Islamic caliphate in the region near the border with Cameroon. The Nigerian military has in recent weeks claimed to have made progress in recapturing lost territory. Thousands of people have been killed since the Islamist uprising began five years ago. An estimated 1.3 million have been displaced, with tens of thousands seeking refuge in neighboring Cameroon, Chad, and Niger. rg/bk (AFP, AP, dpa)",
        "generated_story": "Court martial against Boko Haram Islamists in Borno A court martial has been declared in the northeastern Nigerian town of Maiduguri. The military said on Wednesday that it had declared a state of emergency after the Islamist group seized control of the town in August. Police said the military declared the area a terrorist zone on October 15, a day after a military operation to quell the group's insurgency in northeast Nigeria ended with the death of at least 40 people. A military spokesman said troops were still searching for the militants, but that they had not yet been able to locate them. \"We are still trying to establish the names of those who have taken part in this operation,\" said spokesman Femi Falana, adding that the army would continue to fight against the Islamists until the end of this month. He did not elaborate on the circumstances surrounding the attack, saying only that \"it was an act of terrorism.\" The army said it was still investigating the incident, which took place between August and September, and that there were no reports of any new attacks. It added that troops had been deployed to the region as part of a joint operation between the 7th Division and the Islamic State (IS) militant group. On Wednesday, the Nigerian army announced it would launch a counteroffensive against Islamist groups in northeastern Nigeria. At the same time, it also announced plans to launch an anti-tank missile system to counter the threat posed by the extremist group, according to a statement released by its lawyer, Fikre, who was not authorized to discuss the case by name. In the statement, Fala said: \"The military is committed to fighting terrorism and we will continue our fight to defeat the terrorist group.\" Police have said they have launched an investigation into the attacks, with a view to finding out more about the attackers' plans. They have also launched a number of counter-insurgency operations, including an air strike against suspected terrorists in Cameroon and Chad. rg/bk (AFP, AP, dpa)"

The 53-year-old will be leading Germany's second biggest lender. After successfully weathering the Great Recession, Commerzbank's board of directors appears to want to signal a continuation in its growth trend with Martin Zielke's appointment as the new CEO as of May 1. Outgoing head Martin Blessing announced last year he would not renew his contract. Zielke had previously been put in charge of implementing reforms in the company's private banking sector following the recession. His restructuring measures attracted 800,000 new customers to the bank and changed the image of the 146-year-old financial institution. The 53-year-old has an illustrious career across several German financial institutions to look back on, having started at the teller of a local branch in 1983. Zielke's crowning achievement The beleaguered German financial institution recorded a profit of more than a billion euros (more than $1.1 billion) last year. It was the first time in five years that Commerzbank had made such profitable gains, which it said would translate into paid dividends for shareholders. A good portion of the yields were achieved by a restructuring and expansion drive of Commerzbank's private banking arm under Zielke's leadership. However, some of that money will go to the German government, as it had to step in and rescue the bank in 2009 to the tune of 18 billion euros ($25 billion at the time) by chiefly acquiring more than 15 percent of the shares, effectively nationalizing part of Commerzbank's operations. ss/jlw (dpa, Reuters)",

A spokesman for Blessing told Reuters that the board was \"deeply impressed\" with the new leader's ability to lead the firm through difficult times.

In a document on combating AIDS, the Commission said that as of 2007, around 2.2 million people carried the virus in the EU and nearby countries, an increase of 700,000 from 2001. According to Commission figures, around 730,000 of these live within the EU's 27 member states. France, Italy, Spain and Portugal have relatively high infection rates - ranging from 0.4 percent to 0.5 percent. In the Baltic country of Estonia, the infection rate stands at around 1.3 percent. In neighboring Ukraine, around 1.6 percent of the population has been diagnosed with HIV, while in Russia around 1.1 percent are HIV positive. The Commission warned that now was not the time for Europe to drop its guard on preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS, adding that in some neighboring countries the number of people carrying the virus had doubled. EU Health Commissioner Androulla Vassiliou said political momentum in the fight against HIV/AIDS needed to be maintained, adding that people must \"take responsibility for themselves and their partners by talking about and practicing safe sex and going for HIV testing.\" A cure for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has yet to be found more than a quarter century after it was brought to public attention.

The figure is the highest since 2001, when the virus was discovered in France. In 2007, it was reported that more than half of all cases of HIV were reported to the European Commission. According to figures released by the Commission on Monday, the figure for the first time since the outbreak of the disease in 2001 was 1.5 million cases. That figure rose to 2.6 million in 2007. But the figures are still far below the average for all other countries, according to WHO figures. \"The number of cases is still very low,\" the WHO said, adding that \"it is not possible to know for sure whether the person is HIV positive or not.\" The virus is transmitted through the saliva of infected people, which can be transmitted to other people through contact with bodily fluids. It can also spread to people who don't have HIV, such as those living in countries with high rates of HIV or who have high levels of hepatitis B, as well as to those who are not infected with HVH, a type of virus that can cause liver damage and can lead to cancer. Among the most common infections are those caused by AIDS, although there is no evidence to suggest that AIDS is a cause of death among people with the condition. There is also a rise in cases where people have to be hospitalized for up to a year. And in some cases, they can even be sent to hospital for treatment. dfm/AFP Editor: Chuck Penfold"

The link between the two is so strong that many Federweisser wines have a recipe for the onion cake on their labels. Here's a recipe for it: Ingredients: 1 packet yeast, active dry 1 teaspoon sugar 1 1/2 teaspoon salt 3 cups unbleached flour 1 tablespoon shortening 1 cup water (49 to 54 C / 120 to 130 F) 6 slices bacon -- diced 2 medium onions -- sliced 1/4 teaspoon cumin 1/2 teaspoon salt Pepper 1 egg yolk 1 cup sour cream Mix the yeast with the sugar, a teaspoon of salt and half a cup of flour. Blend in the shortening and warm water, then beat for two minutes. Add enough flour to make a soft dough, and then knead the dough until smooth and elastic, about five minutes. Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, then cover it and let it rise in a warm place for 30 minutes. Pat the dough into a lightly greased 12-inch pizza pan or onto a lightly greased baking sheet. Press up the edges to make a slight rim. Fry the bacon until crisp and drain it on absorbent paper. Add onions to the bacon grease, and cook slowly until tender, but not brown. Sprinkle the onions, bacon, cumin, half a teaspoon of salt and pepper over the dough. Bake the cake at 204 C (400 F) for 20 minutes. Blend the egg yolk and sour cream and pour the mixture over the Zwiebelkuchen. Bake it for another 10 to 15 minutes, until the cake is golden brown and the sour cream has set.

We've all had our fair share of good wine, but this year we're going to try something new: Onion Cake. It\u2019s the perfect wine for the fall season, and it tastes just as good as it does in the winter. The best part of the wine is that you can enjoy it with your family, friends, or even your own family. You can also enjoy the best wine by drinking it in a glass. This year, we have a lot of great wine to choose from, so we decided to give it a try and see what we can do with it.   We started with a bottle of Zwiebelkuchen, which is the most popular wine in Germany right now. Then we added a couple of bottles of Federweisser, a sparkling wine from Germany's largest wine producer, to that bottle. After that, it was off to Germany for a few days and then back to Italy for some more wine tastings. That's when we started to see how much wine we could use. And then we had the wonderful wine that came from Italy, where we were able to get a taste of some of Italy's best wines, such as Pinot Grigio, the famous \"Italian wine,\" and the \"German wine\" that's been on the market since the end of last year. But this time around, there was a bit of a dip in wine consumption, as well as a drop in alcohol consumption. In the autumn, wine drinkers are more likely to be drinking wine at the same time as they are drinking beer. There's a good reason for this: It's easy to forget that wine tastes better when you're drinking more beer than wine does. Especially when it comes to beer and wine-making."

        "target": "Bayern blast five as Schalke draw Bayern Munich stamped their authority over the Bundesliga on Saturday, with a ruthless 5-0 drubbing of Hannover at home. Meanwhile, second-placed Schalke and third-placed Frankfurt were forced to share the points. With many critics saying Bayern might as well be given the giant Bundesliga dish already, perhaps the struggle for second is shaping up to be the more compelling battle. But Saturday afternoon's clash between second-placed Schalke and third-placed Frankfurt did not take a decisive turn, with the game ending in a 1-1 draw. Schalke drew first blood in the 11th minute, when Frankfurt's Stefan Aigner was dispossessed in midfield, and Lewis Holtby released Klaas-Jan Huntelaar in front of goal - the Dutchman's first in the Bundesliga since September. But the hapless Aigner waited just over 100 seconds to make amends for his error, when the Royal Blues allowed him a free header that left goalkeeper Lars Unnerstall with no chance. But neither side could make inroads in the second half, which allowed Dortmund to leap-frog both sides and claim second place. Bayern take command Meanwhile the imperious Bayern Munich dispelled any talk of winter form-dip - following last week's draw to Nuremberg - with a brutally efficient 5-0 win at home to Hannover. The Bavarians stormed to a 3-0 lead in just 37 minutes, celebrating a nifty overhead kick for star signing Javi Martinez in the fourth minute. Toni Kroos and Franck Ribery scored the next two against a Hannover side that were torn open at will. The overhead kick was the first for the 40-million-euro ($52-million) signing Martinez, and in the second half new defender Dante also opened his account with a straightforward header from a Kroos free-kick. The festival of football continued just four minutes later, when Mario Gomez - making first Bundesliga appearance of the season - slammed the ball into the net from a tight angle just 30 seconds after replacing Mario Mandzukic. Dortmund win The champions Dortmund, meanwhile, are still nine points behind Bayern after beating Mainz 2-1 away. It was a potentially tricky fixture in the town where J\u00fcrgen Klopp began his coaching career, and Mainz showed their brilliance in the fourth minute, when Elkin Soto knocked a dream ball into the path of Marco Caligiuri, whose volley fairly screamed into the top right corner. Dortmund's own star-Marco - national team player Marco Reus - leveled the scores just eight minutes later. Reus worked himself some room at the outer edge of the penalty area, and slotted a beautiful 17-meter effort into the far corner. And Dortmund's second goal, just before half-time, was equally aesthetic - a vertical ball bisected the Mainz defense perfectly down the middle, where Polish predator Robert Lewandowski got his eighth league goal of the season with a deft lob over the onrushing Christian Wetklo in goal. Allofs' homecoming Bremen's 1-1 draw at Wolfsburg had a special frisson of its own, as Wolfsburg's newly-minted sporting director Klaus Allofs faced the club he had served as general manager for over a decade. And there was some gesticulating from the Bremen bench in the general direction of the Wolfsburg management when the guests took the lead in the 35th minute. Just seconds after Wolfsburg missed several chances, Marko Arnautovic was left free in the box after Eljero Elia found space on the left and cut the ball back for the Austrian to finish. But Wolfsburg got their own back in the second half. In the 62th minute, Bremen were reduced to ten men when Lukas Schmitz was given second yellow card for a hard tackle on Adelino Vieirinha. Just two minutes later, Bas Dost took advantage of their guests' disorgnaization and smashed the ball into the goal after neat piece of play from Vieirinha. Dirty derby The Franconian derby between Greuther F\u00fcrth and Nuremberg was a cagey affair that ended in a frustrating 0-0 draw. The first half was marked mainly by a straight red card for Nuremberg's Markus Feulner after an ugly, flying lunge on Stephan F\u00fcrstner. But the home side's numerical advantage was short-lived - Sercan Sararer was also sent for an early ice bath after his high elbow on Javier Pinola was adjudged worthy of a second yellow card in the 61st minute. But the aggression in the tackles was not matched by ruthlessness in front of goal, and neither side could eke out any clear chances.",
        "generated_story": "Bayern Munich vs. Wolfsburg Preview: The Bavarians look to bounce back from a 2-1 defeat at Nuremberg on Saturday with a trip to Mainz. The visitors are coming off a 3-0 win over Hannover in the Bundesliga, and will be hoping to get back into the top-flight for the first time since the end of the 2014-15 season. Bayern Munich's Lars Unnerstall, the club's sporting director, said he was \"very happy\" with the result. \"I'm very happy that we've been able to win this game,\" he said, adding that he would like to see his side win at least one of their next three games. He also said that his club would be looking forward to a return to the Champions League, where they have already clinched a place in next season's top division. Mainland's Stefan Aigner, who has been in charge of Borussia Dortmund's youth setup since 2012, is expected to make his first Bundesliga start in a few weeks. But he will have to wait and see what happens at the other end. Frank-Walter Matth\u00e4us, a former Dortmund defender, will also be on hand to take part in Saturday's match, with his former club Bremen set to host Frankfurt. German coach J\u00fcrgen Klopp's men are looking to build on last year's success at home to Bayern, which saw them win the league by a single point in their last three matches. They have a chance to improve on their recent form, however, if they can win their first two games in all competitions. That's a good sign for their chances of making it to next week's Bundesliga final, when they travel to Cologne to face the Red Bull Klaas-Jan Huntelaar and Elkin Soto, both of whom have been on loan to Wolf this season, are likely to be among the favorites for a spot in Germany's first-ever World Cup final. In addition, German defender Dante has also been linked with an offer of a move to Frankfurt, although he has yet to sign a contract with Bayern. Schmitz, meanwhile, has expressed his desire to stay in Dortmund, saying he wants to play for his hometown side. His side are currently in fourth place, behind Bayern and Dortmund. A win for Dortmund would give them a three-game winning streak, but they are also in danger of losing the title to Schalke next year. On Saturday, Dortmund will take on a Wolf team that has struggled in recent weeks to keep up with their domestic rivals. After a disappointing start to their Bundesliga campaign, they will now be without their top scorer, Robert Lewandowski, for some time in what could be a long time. Last season they were relegated to third-tier Germany after failing to qualify for Europe's elite club competition. Under Klopp, Wolf have struggled to find a way to reach the next level and are now on the brink of relegation. Coach Christian Wetklo is hoping that the Dutchman can make a breakthrough in his second Bundesliga season with Dortmund and take a step up his game in front of his old club."

        "target": "In Argentina, red wine exports to balance Porsche imports About 100 Porsches are imported to Argentina each year. Now the country wants to keep a positive trade balance by having the value of the imported luxury cars matched by red wine exports. Porsche is currently enjoying record profits after a two-year downturn, but the export-reliant company has hit a pothole in Argentina. Buenos Aires-based Porsche importer Grupo Pulenta has signed an agreement obligating it to export several hundred bottles of red wine for each car it imports, the Argentine government announced Wednesday. Grupo Pulenta declined to comment when contacted by Deutsche Welle. Job creation During the past year, Argentina has held thousands of high-end vehicles in customs until companies agreed to export goods valued at the same amount. Most of those vehicles came from Germany. According to a spokeswoman for the Argentine embassy in Berlin, the country has been trying to safeguard domestic employment with a positive trade balance. \"Our government has negotiated with automakers to balance their imports of cars with an equivalent amount of exports,\" she told Deutsche Welle in a statement. \"Since March 2010 we have been working with the automakers and importers in order to increase local integration and reduce the trade deficit in this sector.\" Small market A Porsche spokesman said the company sells just short of 100 vehicles into Argentina each year. That compares to more than 40,000 sold worldwide during five months in 2010. \"For Porsche, Argentina is a rather small market,\" the spokesman told Deutsche Welle. \"Our importer, the Pulenta Group, also deals in wine. They have their own vineyards and export that wine. It has nothing to do with Porsche - we just have an import contract with them, and it seems they've found an individual solution with the Argentine government.\" Domestic production Volkswagen, which has an Argentine subsidiary producing the new \"Amarok\" pickup truck and transmissions, has thus far avoided mandatory exports. The company had reported an export surplus of 384 million euros ($545 million) for this year. Porsche's holding company owns 32.2 percent of Volkswagen, and the Porsche brand is intended to become integrated into Volkswagen's lineup. Daimler and BMW also have subsidiaries in Argentina. While Daimler produces its \"Sprinter\" there, BMW only imports to the country. According to the Argentine embassy in Berlin, the country has recently sought more domestic production by foreign car companies. Author: Gerhard Schneibel (dpa) Editor: John Blau",
        "generated_story": "Porsche to balance red wine exports with German wine Argentina's largest car importer, Porsche, has announced plans to double its red wines exports to Germany. The move is part of an effort to reduce its reliance on German carmakers Volkswagen, BMW and Daimler in Argentina. In a statement on Wednesday, the company said it would double the amount of wine it imports from the country. \"We are going to continue to increase the volume of our imports,\" the statement said, adding that the decision was made \"in accordance with our strategic objectives.\" The company also said that it was working with Germany's Amarok, a supplier of German-made cars, to expand its portfolio of products to Argentina, Germany and the United States. Argentina is one of the world's top wine exporters, with a total of 384 million euros ($545 million) in exports in 2010, according to data compiled by Deutsche Welle. However, it is not the first time that Argentina has made a move to diversify its market share. Germany, for example, bought a stake in the Argentine wine market in March 2010. It is the second time in three years that Germany has bought an interest in Argentine wines, following the purchase of a share in German Porsches last year. German importers BMW, Mercedes-Benz and BMW have also bought stakes in Buenos Aires-based Grupo Pulenta, which has a presence in Germany as well as in other European countries. BMW has also invested in its Argentina operations, and in recent years has invested more than $500 million in expanding its presence there. But the move comes at a time when the German automaker is struggling to make up for the losses it has suffered from a drop in sales of its flagship Porsche sports car.

        "target": "EU risks taking sides in Polish dispute, says deputy foreign minister The European Commission has launched an unprecedented procedure to review Poland's rule of law. The move has been questioned by officials, with some saying it places the EU at-risk of taking sides in an internal dispute. The European Commission's decision to launch the rule of law procedure on Warsaw puts the EU's executive institution at-risk of taking sides, Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Konrad Szymanski told reporters in the European Parliament. \"I have the impression that the [European] Commission risks taking a role as a side in a political dispute inside Poland,\" Szymanski noted. On Wednesday, European Commission Vice President Frans Timmermans - a former Dutch foreign minister - announced the move, marking the first time the EU has used the mechanism. Timmermans said that the move was aimed at entering \"into a dialogue with the Polish authorities, to clarify the facts in an objective way and help find solutions if necessary.\" He added that the procedure is focused on seeking answers regarding the new right-wing Polish government's actions not to apply two judgments by the country's constitutional court, and the reasons behind the president and vice-president's terms were shortened. Preserving rule of law However, Poland's deputy foreign minister said that the European Commission was informed of the reasons behind the government's actions. \"We would insist that the questions are phrased precisely because we have provided much information to the Commission in recent days and we are not entirely clear as to what the Commission is still not clear about,\" Szymanski noted to reporters at the European Parliament. New media laws, giving the government the power to hire and fire senior figures at state broadcasters, were also called into question by Timmermans. The controversial legislation prompted mass pro-democracy protesters in the European country. \"The rule of law is one of the EU's fundamental values. Making sure the rule of law is preserved throughout the Union is a key part of the European Commission's responsibilities,\" Timmermans wrote on his official Facebook page. The Rule of Law Framework was created two years ago as a response to criticism that the 28-nation bloc had not adequately responded to possibly-authoritarian moves taken by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban during his tenure. ls/jil (Reuters, AFP, dpa)",

The opposition had called for the government to resign after a tape was leaked in which the Polish foreign minister bashed US and British leaders. The opposition Law and Justice party failed in its bid to oust Prime Minister Donald Tusk on Friday through a vote confidence, the second such vote since the publication of private conversations between high-ranking officials, referred to by some in Poland as \"Waitergate.\" Tusk withstood the opposition challenge by a wide margin of 236-155. The prime minister's Civic Platform party governs Poland in a center-right coalition with the Polish People's party. Last month, recordings of a private conversation between Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski and then-Finance Minister Jacek Rostowski were published by the weekly magazine Wprost. During the conversation, Sikorski said the US-Polish alliance was \"worthless\" and British Prime Minister David Cameron's concessions to euroskeptics had shown his \"incompetence in EU affairs.\" Prior to the leak of the Sikorski recording, Wprost also published a tape in which central bank chief Marek Belka told Interior Minister Bartlomiej Sienkiewicz that he would only support the government's economic policy if Finance Minister Rostowski left his post. The secret recordings were reportedly made over several months, including at high end restaurants in Warsaw. Wprost says it received the tapes from a businessman. Immediately after the conversations were published, Tusk called his own vote of no confidence. His government survived that vote 237-203. slk/rc (AP, AFP, dpa)",

        "target": "Beekeepers battle mites with technology Bees are useful, hard-working and vital for our ecosystem. Aside from making honey, bees pollinate most of our food crops. But summertime is also the season for one of the biggest threats to honey bees \u2013 the varroa mite. Dete Papendieck puts on a white veiled protective hat and takes out a metal jug with a beak-shaped spout. He sets fire to the container's contents \u2013 formic acid \u2013 and starts directing the smoke that is wafting at the beehives lined up in front of him in his garden on the outskirts of Bonn. The acid doesn't harm the bees, but it does kill the varroa mites, he says. And July, after most of the honey has been harvested, is the best time to treat his hives. The one millimeter-large varroa mite is a parasite that infests beehives and lays its eggs in the honeycombs, alongside the bees' larvae. \"It feeds on the bees' and the bee brood's blood, the so-called haemolymph,\" Papendieck explains. A third of bees killed in Germany Papendieck is an apiarist at the Bee Research Institute at the University of Bonn and he knows that the threat of mites is serious. If left untreated, varroa-infested colonies rarely survive a winter. In 2010, German beekeepers lost about 200,000 hives to the mite \u2013 one third of Germany's total bee population. And it is not just the honey and beeswax production that are affected by the mite. Many of our food crops depend on bees: Some 80 percent of all agricultural plants and 90 percent of fruit trees in Europe are pollinated by Apis mellifera, the European honeybee. Varroa introduced from Asia Had Dete Papendieck been a beekeeper forty years ago he would not have had to worry about mites. He says the varroa mite that was originally native to Asia, was introduced to Europe in the 1970s. \"It happened during a research project in which it was attempted to crossbreed the European honeybee with the Asian honeybee. The researchers were exchanging bee colonies between Europe and India, and that is how the mites came to Germany,\" Papendieck said. Unlike Asian bee species, the European honeybee cannot fight off the varoa mite by itself. According to Papendieck, bees easily transmit the mite to other beekeepers' hives in what apiarists call robbery. \"It happens when certain colonies are being robbed by other bees. Large numbers of bees from different colonies attack weak hives and steal their stocks. At the same time, parasites and diseases are exchanged\", he says. Researchers have been trying to breed varroa-resistant mites, but so far they haven't had much success. High-tech tools help fight the mite Klaus Maresch is also worried about his bees. He is an organic beekeeper from Bonn and he has been passionate about bees since he was a little boy. \"They are part of my family. When I open my hives and smell the honey and hear the buzzing of the bees it's like being in another world,\" he told Deutsche Welle. In addition to using formic acid to fight the mite, Klaus Maresch employs a high-tech tool \u2013 a special cylindrical scale that helps him determine when it is best to start the varroa treatment. \"Every day this hive scale sends data about the colonies to our server. The data, such as the temperature in the hive and the amounts of nectar and pollen collected, help me to find a good day to treat varroa,\" Maresch says. Maresch also makes the data about the activities in his hives available to fellow beekeepers who can treat their colonies accordingly. A driver's license for beekeepers? But it is not the mite that angers Maresch most. \"That's nature,\" he says, \"I feel angry about beekeepers who don't fight varroa. If the bees of neighboring beekeepers are infested, I also have a problem.\" The existing German pest regulation obliges beekeepers to treat their bees against varroa, but there are no strict controls. The majority of Germany's more-than-80,000 beekeepers are amateurs who keep between one and 20 colonies. This makes it difficult to impose and survey certain quality standards. Maresch, who sees himself as a kind of 'bee activist', would like to see the government introduce stricter rules. \"There should be a law that obliges every new beekeeper to learn about beekeeping before they are allowed to keep bees. They should get an education and there should be something like a driver's license for beekeepers,\" he says. In the mean time, Europe's bees are going to have to",
        "generated_story": "German beekeeper fights varroa mite with high-tech hive scale A German beekeeping expert has successfully fought a large-scale honeybee swarm with a new technology. Dete Papendieck, a professor at the University of Bonn's Bee Research Institute (BRI) in Germany, said the technique was \"very effective\" in fighting the pest. \"It was very effective in reducing the amount of pollen that was present in the hive,\" he told Deutsche Welle. The technique, which has been used for more than 30 years, was developed by Klaus Maresch of the BRI, the bee research institute's research center, and was first introduced to the field in July of 2010. It was the first time that a bee had been successfully attacked by a swarm of bees since the 1970s, when it was discovered that honeybees were pollinating with pollen from a variety of different species. In the past few months, bees have been able to pollinate up to 1.5 million times as many bees as they used to, according to a study published in a journal published by the German journal \"Nature.\" The study also found that bees are more likely to be pollinated by bees than by other pollinators, such as honey bees. But the researchers say the method is not as effective as it could be in other areas of Europe, where bee populations are growing rapidly. They say it is more effective than in some other regions, for example in Asia where the honey bee population is growing at a very high rate. This is because the bees themselves are less susceptible to mites, they say, because they don't have to deal with them as much as other bees do. So, it's not just bees that are at risk of being attacked, but also the larvae of other bee species, as well. A new technique is being developed to fight the pests in Europe and Asia, with the aim of preventing them from spreading to other European countries. For example, in India, there are a number of species that have already been attacked in recent years. One of these is Apis mellifera, an Asian species which is known for its honey-making ability. That's why the insect has become so popular in China and other Asian countries where it can be easily killed off. Another is the api moth, also known as the \"Vormo moth,\" which can only be killed by an insecticide. Author: Nathan Witelle"

        "target": "EU Mulls Warning Labels to Curb Alcohol Abuse While still targeting smoking, European Union's public health commissioner is considering adding alcohol to the list of vices the bloc should clamp down on. In a report commissioned by the European Commission, the London Institute for Alcohol Studies recommended raising the legal age to buy alcohol to 18 (in some countries, such as Germany, 16-year-olds can buy beer), lowering the permitted blood alcohol level while driving to 0.5, banning alcohol advertising on TV and in movies as well as adding warning labels to bottles as ways of preventing alcohol abuse across the bloc. Which of the methods EU Health Commissioner Markos Kyprianou actually introduces will be announced \"sometime in the autumn,\" according to a spokesperson. Other options include a 10 percent increase in the price of alcohol. Kyprianou has, however, hinted that he favors warning labels -- similar to those that appear on packs of cigarettes -- that make the dangers of alcohol clear. \"Drinking harms your unborn baby\" on bottles? Brewers and wine makers across Europe, however, have come out against placing \"Drinking Kills\" or other labels on bottles of beer. \"Warning labels are the completely wrong way to go,\" Peter Hahn, head of the German Brewers Association told Germany's Express newspaper. \"The do not deter people who have lost a sense of how much to drink and unsettle the people who enjoy a beer after work.\" Industry groups also opposed implementing EU-wide guidelines in countries with traditionally different ways of approaching drinking and drinking problems. \"Policies that do not consider cultural and regional differences, will fail to deal with the social problems, while at the same time generate a rising level of political objections,\" said Rodolphe de Looz-Corswarem of Brewers of Europe. Keeping social vices separate Green party EU parliamentarian Hiltrud Breyer meanwhile called on the alcohol industry to stop \"saber rattling\" before it sees the a final version of the EU's strategy to prevent alcohol abuse. German Consumer Affairs Minister Horst Seehofer said he would wait to see what Kyprianou's actual suggestions are before commenting. Other German politicians, however, were more willing to voice the opposition to putting a sip of wine on the same footing with a puff of a cigarette. \"People should not expect that a skull and crossbones end up on every bottle of beer and wine,\" German EU representative Karl-Heinz Florenz told Der Tagesspiegel newspaper, adding that when it comes to alcohol, each member state should be responsible for how it deals with alcohol abuse. The harm of \"passive drinking\" While cigarettes are a health risk from the first puff, moderate drinking can actually be healthy and there is no danger from \"passive drinking,\" Peter Liese, a German EU representative, told the paper. The commission's report disagreed with Liese's conclusion, saying alcohol abuse had a major role in as many as 200,000 deaths in Europe due to car accidents and disease and played a role in some 60,000 underweight births. The report also estimated the effects of alcohol abuse of costing the EU 125 billion euros ($161 billion) in 2003. Some 25 percent of men and 10 percent of women in Europe drink what the EU considers to be more than healthy amounts of alcohol and between 3 percent and 5 percent are suffering from alcoholism, according to EU statistics.",
        "generated_story": "EU warns against 'passive drinking' on bottles of beer The European Commission has warned against the use of alcohol in beer. The EU's health commissioner, Peter Liese, warned that the practice could lead to \"harmful\" drinking. Germany's beer industry has been hit hard by the rise in alcohol consumption in recent years. According to a report in the German newspaper Der Tagesspiegel, more than 125 billion euros ($161 billion) was spent on beer in Germany in 2003, compared to the same period last year. \"This is a serious problem, and we have to address it,\" the report said, adding that \"it is not the first time that people have been drinking alcohol.\" The report also pointed out that beer drinkers are more likely to drink alcohol than those who drink wine, which is more commonly known as \"drunken beer.\" \"The problem is that when people are drinking beer, they are not drinking it as much as they used to be,\" said Dieter Hahn, president of the European Brewers Association (BBA). \"They are consuming more beer than when they were drinking wine,\" he added, referring to people who have consumed alcohol for a long time. In the past, the association's members have also been accused of using alcohol as a weapon against their opponents. But the EU is now looking into the issue, with the Health Commissioner of Germany (Hiltrud Breyer) calling for an end to this practice. BBA is one of several EU member states that have banned alcohol sales in their countries, including Germany, Austria, France, Italy, Spain, Greece and the United Kingdom. It has also banned the sale of alcoholic beverages to minors. German media reported on the findings of a study conducted by researchers at the London Institute for Alcohol Studies (LISD) that found that alcohol abuse among young people was at least twice as high as the rate of alcoholism among older people. That study, published in a German magazine, said that in addition to increasing the number of underage drinkers, it also showed that drinking more alcohol was associated with a higher risk of mental illness, such as depression, anxiety, depression and suicidal ideation."

        "target": "German Minister Urges Peace in Georgia's Separatist Regions German Foreign Minister Steinmeier has called for an end to the \"spiral of violence\" between the Georgian government in Tbilisi and its Russian-backed rebel regions and presented a three-stage plan to break the deadlock. Steinmeier issued the plea as he began a tour of the region to sponsor a new peace plan aimed at calming the simmering tensions over Georgia's separatist regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. \"This is my appeal to break out of the spiral of violence. A lack of dialogue is not an option for the future,\" he said after meeting with his Georgian counterpart Eka Tkeshelashvili. Steinmeier, who chairs the so-called Group of Friends of the United Nations' Secretary on Georgia, is proposing a three-phase peace plan based on a mutual declaration of non-violence and repatriation of about 25,000 ethnic Georgians expelled from Abkhazia in the 1990s. Negotiations over the status of the two rebel regions, which have enjoyed de facto autonomy since the end of a civil war in 1994, was reserved for the final phase of negotiations. Tkeshelashvili said, \"The plan has great potential for success,\" but added that the most difficult thing would be to convince Russia. Peace talks remain distant The threat of armed conflict in the region last month has given urgency to international pressure for renewed peace talks, but Tbilisi, Moscow and the Russian-backed regions remain far apart on the basic premises for restarting peace talks. Officials in Tbilisi oppose a treaty on the non-use of force without guarantees on the return of refugees and the withdrawal of Russian peacekeeping forces base in the region. Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was skeptical of peace efforts Thursday. \"Signing of a treaty on the return of Georgian refugees to Abkhazia is unreal now, because such a return requires a calm situation,\" Lavrov was quoted as saying by news agency RIA-Novosti. \"We think that signing a treaty on the non-use of force without any preconditions is an absolutely unavoidable first step,\" he added. Experts see little hope for Steinmeier's plan Analysts do not expect anything conclusive from Steinmeier's trip, pointing to intransigence on the part of the Abkhaz President Sergei Bagapsh, who said he would \"not consider the plan.\" \"We are not going to discuss Abkhazia's status with anyone. We are building an independent, democratic state,\" Bagapsh was quoted by Georgian news agencies as saying. Speaking to journalists ahead of the meetings Thursday, Steinmeier admitted: \"We don't have any illusions about simple answers, but we cannot stand by without acting on this conflict. That would be irresponsible.\" From Tbilisi, the German minister is to travel to the Black Sea city of Batumi for talks with Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili and then to Abkhazia on Friday before ending his three-day tour in Moscow. Most citizens of the breakaway republics have been issued Russian passports and over 2,500 Russian peacekeeping troops patrol the region under a UN ceasefire agreement. In opposition to Georgia's bid to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Russia moved to strengthen diplomatic ties with the breakaway regions sharply aggravating tensions with the Georgian leadership in recent months.",

He said he was \"very optimistic\" about the prospects of a peace deal between Russia and Georgia, and that the two regions would be able to work together in the long term. In the past, Georgia has been part of Russia's sphere of influence, but in 1994, the country was split into two independent regions. Today, both regions have been divided into three independent states, with the former being the most powerful and the latter the least powerful. On Thursday, a ceasefire broke down between the three regions, which have since been reduced to a two-state federation, after the collapse of Soviet-backed governments in 1990. A ceasefire was declared in 1992, when the Soviet Union withdrew its troops from South Ossetia and declared a state of self-defense. Since then, Russia has maintained a military presence in both territories, although it is not clear whether it will continue to do so until the new constitution is ratified by the end of this year. Russian President Vladimir Putin has also called on Georgia to recognize the territorial integrity of its former territories as a sovereign state. Russia, however, has rejected the idea, saying that it would not recognize Georgia's independence as an independent state until it was recognized by a UN-supervised referendum on independence. Moscow has said that Georgia should not be allowed to take part in any kind of political process, as long as it does not interfere in international affairs. However, Moscow is willing to cooperate with Georgia in its quest to establish a political system that would allow it to develop its own independent political and economic system. According to Russian state-run media, \"Georgia is the only country in Russia that has a democratic constitution and a constitution that guarantees the rule of law and guarantees equal rights to all citizens.\" The Russian Foreign Ministry said Thursday that Moscow had agreed to allow the reunification process to continue, adding that \"it is important that all Georgians have the right to participate in this process.\" Russian foreign ministry spokesman Sergei Lavrov said in an interview on state television that Russia was ready to accept the deal."

        "target": "Maldives revokes state of emergency citing improved security situation The president of the Maldives has lifted a state of emergency following an outcry from the international community. The government says the measures are no longer necessary because the security threat has subsided. The government said Tuesday it had rescinded the emergency measures \"with immediate effect\" and that \"all fundamental rights that were suspended have been restored.\" President Yameen Abdul Gayoom declared the state of emergency one week ago after the discovery of a homemade bomb and a stash of weapons near his official residence. The finding followed an explosion on Gayoom's speedboat in September - an incident the government labeled an assassination attempt. The president was not hurt in the blast, but his wife, an aide and a bodyguard were injured. The emergency regulations, intended to be in place for 30 days, gave security forces wide-ranging search and arrest powers, and suspended citizens' basic rights. They drew criticism from former colonial power Britain as well as the United States, the European Union and neighboring Sri Lanka. Reading out a presidential decree revoking the emergency, Attorney General Mohamed Anil said there was no longer a threat to the Indian Ocean atoll nation. He said investigations into the September blast and the recovery of weapons had made good progress. The foreign ministry said a number of people had been arrested. Lawmakers also used the security regulations to fast-track the impeachment of Vice President Ahmed Adeeb, who stands accused of plotting the alleged attempts on the president's life. Impact on tourism Attorney General Anil said pressure from the international community, as well as \"the possible adverse impact on Maldives tourism and the economy,\" had also played a role in ending the state of emergency. Foreign tourists visiting the tropical nation, known for its luxury tourist resorts, palm-fringed beaches and coral reefs, contribute close to a third of the country's gross domestic product. The Maldives has had a rocky road to democracy since holding its first multiparty election in 2008. The country's first democratically elected leader, current opposition chief Mohamed Nasheed, was forced to step down in 2012 after a mutiny by security forces. In March, he was jailed for 13 years on terrorism charges in a trial the United Nations said was illegal. President Gayoom is under intense international pressure to release him. Nasheed's opposition Maldivian Democratic Party welcomed Tuesday's announcement. But said declaring the state of emergency in the first place was a political move designed to stop a rally planned for last week calling for Nasheed's freedom. \"It appears that Yameen is willing to make up threats about the nation's security in order to settle political scores,\" the party said in a statement, referring to the president. nm/kms (AP, AF, Reuters, dpa)",
        "generated_story": "Maldives declares state of emergency despite international criticism The Maldives government has lifted a three-day state-of-emergency declared by President Yameen Abdul Gayoom. The move comes as the government of the Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) announced on Tuesday that it had lifted the emergency declared in the country's capital, Male, in response to criticism from the United States, Britain and Sri Lanka. \"We are pleased that the authorities have lifted an emergency imposed on the island nation,\" said Attorney General Mohamed Anil, adding that he was \"deeply disappointed\" by the announcement. Anal said the move was part of an effort to ease tensions between the two countries, which have been at loggerheads since the end of a six-year civil war in 2008. A spokesman for the opposition chief, Mohamed Nasheed, told reporters that \"the government is happy with the decision to lift its emergency order.\" The government had earlier said it would continue to monitor the situation, but it did not specify when the state would be lifted. In a statement released Tuesday, the MDP said that a decision had been taken \"in the interest of national security and the security of our people, and that we will continue our efforts to ensure the stability of this country and its people.\" \"This is the first step in a long process,\" the statement said. However, it added that there was still a \"long process\" to be carried out. nm/kms (AP, AF, Reuters, dpa)"

Clubs officials say talks are ongoing in the hope Max Meyer will extend his contract. Schalke might struggle to retain 22-year-old midfielder Max Meyer when his contract runs out at the end of the season, at least according to recent media interviews from the club's sporting director, Christian Heidel. Speaking to German news agency dpa, Heidel confirmed that Meyer turned down an offer of a contract extension earlier in February. \"Max Meyer's agent received an extension offer on January 12 with a deadline of February 15, and informed us on February 15 via email that Max would not be accepting the offer because of the deadline imposed,\" Heidel told dpa. \"We have acknowledged this. For now, we no longer feel beholden to the terms of that offer, but that doesn't mean an extension is impossible either.\" Meyer was reportedly offered an annual salary in the region of \u20ac5.5 million ($6.7 million); it was the second contract he refused, following a less lucrative offer at the end of last season.

Schalke offered improved terms in light of this development on the pitch. Heidel said this week that the club was still trying to convince the German to stay. \"At the moment we're still ready to talk,\" Heidel told this week's edition of football magazine Kicker, albeit stressing that time was of the essence. \"But we must and we will plan for the new season.\" In a separate newspaper interview Heidel was even more explicit, saying the club was not in a position to wait until summer for Meyer to make up his mind. Speaking to Sport Bild magazine, meanwhile, Heidel sought to focus on Meyer's more important role at Schalke, his regular game time, arguing it might be in the youngster's best interests to stay at a club that needs him every week. \"[Coach] Domenico Tedesco has formed the team around him in such a way that there is now an ideal spot for Max. That was not always the case,\" Heidel said. \"He needs to ask himself, putting the financial aspect to one side: 'Will I get such a position at a different club?' Because one thing's clear: Max wants to play, and he needs to play.\" Schalke are already preparing for the departure of one of German football's brightest young stars, midfield all-rounder Leon Goretzka will join Bayern Munich on a free transfer at the season's end.

        "target": "Hurricane Irma thrashes Caribbean as Jose strengthens in wake Hurricane Irma has continued to pack 300 kph winds as it moves across the Caribbean toward Florida. The record-breaking storm has battered the Bahamas and Cuba, while Hurricane Jose followed in its path. As one of the Atlantic Ocean's largest storms plowed through the Caribbean, leaving destruction in its wake, residents of the US state of Florida prepared for what could be the worst storm to make landfall in over a century. At least 17 people have been killed and dozens more injured across several island nations in the Caribbean. Irma is expected to be there second major hurricane to make landfall in the United States in less than two weeks. Hurricane Harvey struck Texas last week, killing more than 60 people and displacing roughly 1 million others. In the US territory of Puerto Rico, 1 million people \u2013 nearly one-third of the population \u2013 lost electricity during the storm, said Puerto Rican Governor Ricardo Rossello. \"It will be difficult to estimate how long the power outage will last,\" Rossello said. Later, officials confirmed that at least two people on the island had been killed by the storm's devastation. Two other major storms have developed in the Caribbean, namely Hurricane Jose and Hurricane Katia. Jose was east of the Lesser Antilles with maximum sustained winds of 120 miles person hour (195 kilometers person hour) as a hurricane watch was in effect for Antigua and Barbuda. Jose has followed the same path as Hurricane Irma, and was upgraded to a Category 4 on Friday by the US National Hurricane Center. Katia has remained relatively static, hovering off the coast of Mexico. Florida on edge Florida Governor Rick Scott said 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain were expected after Irma made landfall at the weekend as he urged evacuations during a press conference on Friday. Nearly 700,000 people have been asked to leave Miami and its surrounding areas. \"Today is the day to do the right thing for your family and get inland for safety... Do not ignore evacuation orders. All Floridians should be prepared to evacuate soon,\" Scott said. Read more: How to reduce risks from mega-storms? \"I know many of you are stuck in traffic, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s very frustrating. Evacuations are not convenient but they are absolutely meant to keep you safe,\" he added. On Friday, US President Donald Trump described Irma as a storm of \"absolutely historic destructive potential.\" Trump also on Friday signed a $15 billion (13.5 billion euro) hurricane relief package passed by Congress, which also raises the debt ceiling and postpones the possibility of a shutdown of government funding until December. Downgraded to an \"extremely dangerous\" Category 4 but still packing winds of 185 mph (300 kph), Irma moved between the north coast of Cuba and the Bahamas as it neared the Florida Keys and the southern Florida Peninsula. 'Major hurricane' Irma will have a \"truly devastating\" impact on the state's southern coastal areas when it slams into Florida, said US Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) chief Brock Long. Read more: Is climate change making mega-hurricanes the new normal? \"Bottom line is the majority of people along the coast have never experienced a major hurricane like this. It will be truly devastating,\" Long told CNN. \"The entire southeastern United States better wake up and pay attention. Death and destruction At least 11 people have been killed and dozens more injured after Irma tore through the French Caribbean, Barbuda, Anguilla and the British Virgin Islands. Amid widening criticism from residents in British territories that not enough was done to safeguard people from the storm, British Foreign Office Minister Alana Duncan said London has sent tents, vehicles and other relief equipment. \"Anguilla received the hurricane's full blast. The initial assessment is that the damage has been severe and in places critical,\" Duncan told the British Parliament. Thousands displaced Antigua and Barbuda Prime Minister Gaston Browne said nearly every building on Barbuda was damaged when the hurricane's core crossed almost directly over the island early Wednesday and about 60 percent of the island's roughly 1,400 people were homeless.

French, British and Dutch military authorities reportedly rushed aid to the devastated Caribbean islands later on Thursday, with warships and planes dispatching food, water and troops. French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said four people were confirmed dead and about 50 injured on the French side of St. Martin, an island split between Dutch and French control. French Interior Minister Gerard Collomb said 100,000 food rations were sent to St. Barts and St. Martin, the equivalent of four days of supplies. ls/jm (AP, AFP, Reuters, dpa)",
        "generated_story": "Hurricane Irma in the Caribbean: 'Truly devastating' storm Irma has slammed the Lesser Antilles and is forecast to make landfall in Florida later this week. The storm is expected to cause widespread damage to homes, businesses and other infrastructure, according to the National Hurricane Center (NHC). The NHC said on Thursday that the storm's path was \"very, very difficult to predict.\" The agency said it had received a total of $15 billion (13.5 billion euro) from the US government in response to Hurricane Harvey in Texas and Puerto Rico, and that it was working to assess the damage. \"We have a lot of work ahead of us,\" said the agency's director, Brock Long, in an interview with CNN."

        "target": "Opinion: Yet another crisis for Merkel A summery turquoise blazer and fresh makeup could not hide the fact that Angela Merkel was \"not amused.\" Now she is needed as a champion in the fight against populist forces, DW's Kay-Alexander Scholz writes. Britain-EU divorce proceedings will probably last about two years. Until then, the status quo must be maintained, German Chancellor Angela Merkel emphasized in her press statement. If she is no longer chancellor after the upcoming parliamentary elections in 2017, then others will have to live with the consequences of Brexit. But that is not what she is actually thinking. It is not coincidental that foreign ministers and government leaders are visiting Berlin in the coming days. They want to discuss how things will continue. Berlin, under Merkel's chancellorship, has become a center of power outside of Brussels. Difficult international politics The Brexit decision has disrupted Europe's equilibrium. Germany has lost an important ally on European issues related to economic growth and budgetary discipline. Now, France presumably will be the next to raise its voice against Maastricht Treaty criteria. If the Netherlands and Denmark also decide to leave the EU, Germany will become isolated, as Eastern Europe is not as tight with Germany as it once was. Poland now plays a key role for the Balkan nations and the Visegrad Group (Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic and Slovakia). And Poland is still annoyed about Merkel's refugee policy. What about Germany's populists? They're giddy with glee as they feel that their anti-establishment policies have been validated. They are teaching potential AfD (Alternative for Germany) voters a lesson: \"Here, have a look: it's possible. There is always an alternative. Vote for us!\" Those are exactly the words that protest voters want to hear. Germany's AfD has forged ties with other right-wing parties in Vienna, Paris, The Hague and London. They are all pursuing a \"European\" plan to gain power. The recent Austrian presidential election was significant, as the populist candidate lost by a very narrow margin; in fact, the final election results are still undecided as they are being contested. The Brexit vote was also triggered by populist powers. Domestically difficult Many populists believe that the stronger populism becomes - no matter where - the more advantages there would be for individual parties of their persuasion. Many would also like to see Donald Trump as US president. That is how AfD may become even stronger in Germany, which also means that political majorities would fluctuate even more. Will there be enough seats after the next election for a Christian Democrat and Green coalition, or will yet another grand coalition made up of Christian Democrats and Social Democrats be formed? Can Angela Merkel change course? Can she counter the trend with a new political model in Europe and Germany? Or do we stand on the edge of a new era, a \"political revolution,\" as the AfD calls it? Until now, Europe has survived attacks on its currency (euro crisis), the principle of peaceful coexistence (Crimea crisis) and its open borders policy (refugee crisis). Merkel deserves credit for defending these values, despite mistakes that have been made along the way. The outcome of the Brexit crisis is, however, still open. Have something to say? Add your comments below.",
        "generated_story": "AfD and the Brexit Crisis in Europe Angela Merkel is the new face of the far-right Alternative for Germany party. The party is a far cry from the conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) that dominated the 2016 election campaign. It's not just the CDU, it's also the Social Democrats, the Greens and others who have been pushing hard for the EU to leave the bloc. They're the ones who are pushing for an EU-wide single market and a free trade zone. But they're not the only ones. There are also a number of other parties, such as the Green party, which has a strong presence in the German parliament, as well as in other European countries, including the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary and Slovakia. These are the parties that are trying to make the European Union a better place than it was in 2016, when Chancellor Merkel was Chancellor of Germany. And they have a lot of work to do, too. DW's Kay-Alexander Scholz has been following the party closely since the beginning of this year. \"The AfD is an extreme left-wing party that wants to take over the government in Berlin, and they want to be part of that government,\" she told DW in an interview published in London on Tuesday. She also said that she was \"very disappointed\" with the current government's handling of Brexit negotiations, adding that \"it was a mistake to try to get a deal that would have allowed the UK to stay in.\" \"I don't think that's the case at all,\" Merkel said, referring to the ongoing negotiations between the US and EU on the Maastricht Treaty. However, she also pointed out that the two sides are working together on a common European strategy to tackle the \"Brexit crisis.\" The two parties are currently in talks to form a new coalition government, with Merkel's conservatives and Green Party (SPD) in charge of foreign affairs and foreign policy. In the end, they will have to come to an agreement on how to deal with Britain's departure from NATO and whether it would be better for Europe if Britain were to remain a member of NATO."

        "target": "Reports: Merkel to run for fourth term as German chancellor German Chancellor Angela Merkel has confirmed that she will stand for the chancellery in the 2017 election, German media reports. The Christian Democrat Leader (CDU) first took office in 2005. After months of speculation, German Chancellor Angela Merkel reportedly told her fellow Christian Democrats (CDU) in Berlin on Sunday that she is prepared to lead the party into next year's election. An official statement is expected from Merkel at 7 p.m. local time (1800 UTC) on Sunday. The 62-year-old has faced a number of difficulties in recent months, from criticism over her handling of the migration crisis to falling support amid a rise in right-wing populist sentiment. Since taking office in 2005, however, Merkel has also been praised for navigating Europe's largest economy through the financial and eurozone crises. According to an Emnid survey published in the German newspaper \"Bild am Sonntag\" 55 percent of Germans are in favor of Merkel remaining head of the German government for another four years. Thirty-nine percent said they were against her re-election. Sign of stability Should she be elected next September, another full four-year term would put Merkel on a par with her mentor Helmut Kohl who set the post-war record and presided over the Fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. In light of the UK's shock vote to leave the European Union in June and Donald Trump's election last week as US president, Merkel's re-election is likely to be welcomed in many capitals as a sign of stability. During his final visit to Berlin this week, US President Barack Obama said that if he were able to, he would vote for his longtime partner and friend. In an interview with German magazine \"Spiegel\" and broadcaster \"ARD,\" Obama said: \"She has great credibility, and she is willing to fight for those values in a way that is very, very important.\" \"I'm glad that she's there and I think the German people should appreciate her. Certainly, I've appreciated her as a partner.\" Winning back votes With the less that a year until Germany heads to the polls, Merkel's CDU is now turning its efforts to wooing back disenchanted voters who have left the conservative camp to support the right-wing populists, Alternative for Germany (AfD). Formed as a Euro-sceptic party in 2013, the AfD won 4.7 percent of the popular vote in the last federal elections in 2013, just falling short of the 5 percent threshold required to enter the Bundestag - Germany's lower house of parliament. After benefiting from the rise in europsceptic, anti-immigration sentiment, seemingly sweeping across western Europe, the party now holds seats in nine of Germany's 16 states.",
        "generated_story": "Merkel's re-election bid comes amid growing populist sentiment in Germany German Chancellor Angela Merkel has announced her intention to run for a third term in office in 2017. The conservative Christian Democrat (CDU) party's candidate for chancellor, Helmut Kohl, announced on Sunday that he would run against Chancellor Merkel in the 2017 election. Merkel, who was first elected in 2005 as Chancellor of Germany, is expected to win a second term. \"I have a lot of work to do,\" Merkel said in an interview with the German newspaper Bild am Sonntag, adding that she had \"no time to think about the future of the country.\" The CDU candidate said she would seek a fourth term as chancellor in a bid to avoid a repeat of last year's election, in which she lost to former US President Barack Obama by a margin of more than 2-to-1. In the run-up to Sunday's vote, Merkel will be the first woman to be elected to the federal parliament since the fall of Berlin Wall in 1989. German media reported that Merkel would be running against her mentor, the former Chancellor, as well as her rival, US Vice President, Donald Trump. Both Merkel and Trump have expressed their support for each other in recent weeks, and both have been critical of one another's policies on immigration and other issues. Germany's chancellor has also been criticized by the US and UK for her handling of asylum seekers in her country. On Sunday, German newspapers published excerpts from the interview, which was conducted in conjunction with Merkel's announcement. Read more: Merkel: 'I don't think I can be president' The interview was published in German magazine \"Der Spiegel\" and was carried by German public broadcaster Emnid. It is not known whether or not the comments were made in response to a question posed to Merkel by her former mentor. A spokesman for Merkel told the paper that the chancellor was \"not aware\" of Trump's comments, but that \"she was aware of his comments and that they were not directed at her personally.\" In a statement released Sunday evening, Germany\u2019s federal government said it would not comment on the election results, citing \"internal and external factors\" that could influence the outcome of a vote."

Hundreds of National Football League (NFL) stars protested President Donald Trump's call for fans to boycott the league by refusing to stand for the US national anthem this weekend, starting Sunday's game between the Baltimore Ravens and Jacksonsville Jaguars. A number of other players locked arms in solidarity ahead of the game at Wembley Stadium in London. Jacksonville Jaguars' owner Shahid Khan, who last year donated one million dollars\u00a0(840,000 euros) to the Trump campaign, locked his arms with players - a rare scene, as owners almost never take to the field. US media reported that about 200 players on Sunday sat, knelt or raised their fists in defiance of Trump's comments. In one of the most memorable moments, singer Rico LaVelle took a knee and held up a fist at the last line of the Star Spangled Banner ahead of the game between the Detriot Lions and Atlanta Falcons. The protest came in response to Trump's tweets on Sunday morning urging fans to boycott NFL games to pressure the league into firing or suspending players to kneel in protest during the national anthem. In an early morning tweet, Trump posted: \"If NFL fans refuse to go to games until players stop disrespecting our Flag and Country, you will see change take place fast. Fire or suspend!\" \"NFL attendance and ratings are WAY DOWN. Boring games yes, but many stay away because they love our country. League should back US,\" he added. Later, the president said that his rant \"has nothing to do with race,\" despite the fact that the origins of the protest are to do with police brutality against minorities, especially African Americans. Trump said his comments were instead about \"respect for our country and respect for our flag.\" Trump's spat with US professional sports began at a Republican rally in Alabama on Friday, when the president attacked activist NFL players for kneeling or sitting during the national anthem, labelling them as \"sons of bitches.\" \"Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, 'Get that son of a bitch off the field right now... he is fired'?\" Trump told a crowd of cheering supporters. That day, basketball star Stephen Curry, the top player for California's Golden State Warriors, announced that he would not be attending a traditional White House reception honoring the National Basketball Association champions. The kneeling protest was started by former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick who refused to stand for the anthem back in 2016. Kaepernick's gesture came amid a spate of deadly police shootings of black men and was aimed at drawing more attention to treatment of minorities in the US. However, Kaepernick has since become a free agent, after failing to be signed by a new team for the new NFL season. NFL executives decry Trump's calls Trump also drew the ire of senior NFL executives and team owners. Responding to Trump's tweets, Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti, said he \"100 percent\" supported his players' decision to kneel during the anthem. Robert Kraft, the owner of the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots, who is also a close friend of Trump, said in a statement on Sunday that he was deeply disappointed by the president's comments in Alabama. Kraft defended players' rights to \"peacefully affect social change and raise awareness in a manner that they feel is most impactful,\" and said that sports were a unifying force in the US. \"Our political leaders could learn a lot from the lessons of teamwork and working together toward a common goal,\" he said. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, who has taken much of the heat for Kaepernick's failure to find a new team, was also quick to condemn Trump's comments.

They include the owners of the New York Jets, New England Patriots, Dallas Cowboys, Washington Redskins, Jacksonville Jaguars, Houston Texans, Los Angeles Rams and Tampa Bay Buccaneers",
        "generated_story": "US President Donald Trump's call for NFL players to kneel during the national anthem ignited online controversy The US president has called on NFL teams to stand for the anthem. On Sunday, the NFL announced that it would ban players from participating in the game if they did so. The announcement came a day after NFL owners Robert Kraft and Steve Bisciotti announced they would no longer allow the league to sanction players who protest the playing of football. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said in a statement that he would not sanction any player who did not stand in support of the National Anthem. \"We will not allow this to happen,\" Trump said, referring to NFL star Colin Kaepernick, who has been protesting the team's anthem policy since the start of last season. Trump has also called for a boycott of NFL games by teams that don't play the sport, including the Los Angeles Rams, New York Jets, Dallas Cowboys and the New England Patriots. In a tweet on Friday, Trump also said he was \"deeply disappointed\" by the decision. He said the players should not be allowed to protest in front of their coaches, but that they should be able to do so at the White House. 'We are not going to tolerate this,' he said. But the president's comments came as a surprise to many who had been watching the Super Bowl with their families and friends. It was the first time in NFL history that a president of a major US sports organization has made such an appeal to African-Americans, particularly those who play for his team. Last year, President Barack Obama signed an executive order banning the use of racial slurs in public places, such as schools, churches and sports venues. That order, however, was later rescinded. dm,mm,es/kl (AP, Reuters)"

        "target": "Turkey, Greece seek NATO mission in Aegean, says German official Germany, Greece and Turkey will ask NATO to approve a maritime surveillance mission in the Aegean to combat illegal people smugglers. Greece had previously voiced reservations about the proposal. The proposed mission to be discussed at a NATO defense ministers meeting in Brussels on Thursday comes days after German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutolgu said they would raise the issue of refugees with the Alliance. According to a Reuters report citing a senior German official, initially reticent Greece has now given the green light for the operation, which could see NATO assets deployed in the Aegean in a mostly intelligence and reconnaissance role. Under the proposal, which would need to be approved by Alliance members, NATO maritime assets would provide information to national coastguards and the EU border agency Frontex to combat illegal smugglers using rickety boats to bring migrants to Europe. Turkey would then take back the refugees, as envisioned as part of a 3 billion-euro ($3.2 billion) EU-Turkey deal agreed to last year. According to German sources, the mission would not be similar to the NATO mission in the Mediterranean intercepting migrant boats making the dangerous run from Libya to Italy. However, NATO ships could intervene in emergency situations to save passengers. \"It is not NATO's remit to push back or stop refugee boats,\" the official told Reuters. The mission would use assets from the Alliance's standing naval group, a permanent reaction force deployed in the Mediterranean. The naval group's current flagship is the German combat support ship \"Bonn.\" Denmark has already said it would provide additional ships to the mission, according to the official. However, it is unclear whether NATO members will approve the mission which may fall outside the bounds of the Alliance's mandate. Complicating matters is a long-running maritime dispute between Greece and Turkey over sovereignty in the Aegean, where the two NATO members' jets regularly engage in dogfights. Turkey has taken in more than 2.5 million Syrian refugees, and is a major transit point for migrants from Asia and Africa. More than a million migrants and refugees reached Europe last year, many making the dangerous boat journey from Turkey to Greece by boat. So far this year, more than 340 have perished in the cold waters trying to reach Europe. cw/msh (AFP, dpa, Reuters)",
        "generated_story": "NATO to deploy ships in Aegean to combat illegal smugglers The alliance has deployed a naval support ship to the Mediterranean to help tackle illegal migrant crossings. The deployment comes amid growing concern over the growing number of migrants seeking asylum in Europe. German Prime Minister Ahmet Davutolgu said on Thursday that the deployment of the ships would be a \"significant step forward\" in the fight against illegal migration. \"It will be an important step in our efforts to reduce the flow of refugees and migrants into Europe,\" he told reporters in Bonn, Germany, adding that he was \"very optimistic\" about the new deployment. Germany and Denmark have also expressed their support for the ship, which is part of NATO's \"Standing Naval Group.\" \"We are very optimistic that this deployment will lead to a peaceful resolution of this conflict,\" German Chancellor Angela Merkel said in a statement. But the alliance also said that it was not ready to give up its mission to tackle the influx of asylum seekers. It said it would continue to work closely with EU member states, including Greece, Italy, Greece and Turkey, as well as with the EU's anti-migrant alliance, the Alliance, to deal with migrants and refugees from Syria, Iraq and Libya. Turkey and Germany have already agreed to cooperate in tackling the problem of illegal migrants, but they have yet to agree on the exact scope of their mission. EU leaders are also expected to hold talks with Turkey's prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on Wednesday to discuss a possible military solution. Merkel, who heads the European Commission, said she hoped to see a deal in place by the end of next year."

Secretary of State John Kerry is due to arrive in Cairo on Monday where he is expected to urge Hamas to accept a cease-fire agreement offered by Egypt that would halt nearly two weeks of fighting with Israel. Meanwhile, the death toll in Gaza continues to rise. Medics on Monday said the number of Palestinian deaths in Gaza has risen to more than 501 since fighting intensified on Jul 8. Most of the dead are civilians. On the Israeli side, 13 soldiers were killed inside Gaza on Sunday, raising the number of soldiers killed since a ground operation began late on Thursday to 18. Two Israeli civilians also died in mortar and rocket attacks. The Israeli army said that more than 10 militants from Gaza were shot dead on Monday after infiltrating southern Israel. According to army spokespeople, two squads of militants were killed after tunneling into Israel. Israel's UN ambassador Ron Prosor, meanwhile, denied a claim by Hamas that an Israeli soldier had been kidnapped by the Islamist group, saying: \"Those rumurs are untrue.\" US President Barack Obama expressed concern about the rising death toll of civilians in a telephone call Sunday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, according to a White House statement. The US State Department confirmed late Sunday that two US citizens were killed in Gaza violence and released their names, but did not immediately disclose their occupations. US media reported, however, that the two were American members of the Israeli Defense Force, citing relatives and friends. \"We can confirm the deaths of US citizens Max Steinberg and Sean Carmeli in Gaza,\" spokesperson Jen Psaki said in a two-sentence statement.

Kerry's visit to Cairo comes a day after US President Barack Obama called for an end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in the Gaza Strip. \"We have a lot of work ahead of us,\" Obama said at a press conference in New York, adding that he was \"very optimistic\" about the prospects of a peace deal between the two sides. Obama's trip comes as the US and Israel prepare to host a summit in Egypt later this week to discuss a possible ceasefire in Gaza. On Monday, the White House announced that Obama would be meeting with Israeli defense minister Eugene Richard Gasana to try to reach an agreement on a cease-fire with Hamas, which has been in effect since the end of last year. Israel, however, has yet to agree on an exact date for the meeting, although the United Nations has said that it will hold discussions with the Egyptian government over the next few days. US officials have said they expect the talks to take place at the earliest possible date. hc/dr (Reuters, AFP, AP, dpa)"

        "target": "A borderline war The crisis in Syria is in danger of drawing in neighboring countries. Despite the Syrian government's immediate apology, the shelling on the Turkish border has led to concerns about possible escalation. These weren't the first incidents on the Syrian-Turkish border, but the fact that several people on the Turkish side were killed by Syrian shells on Wednesday (03.10.2012) has brought the conflict between the two countries to a new level. It has led the Turkish military to retaliate for the first time. Several people were killed when Turkey shelled Syrian territory. But neither Turkey, which is a member of NATO, nor Syria would benefit from a broader conflict. An adviser to the Turkish president tweeted, \"Turkey has no interest in a war with Syria.\" Volker Perthes, director of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs in Berlin, agrees: \"Assad has no interest in an escalation,\" he told DW. \"That can be seen from the fact that the Syrian information minister apologized and expressed his regret over the victims immediately after the attack on Turkish territory.\" Perthes doesn't think it's likely that the Syrian President, Bashar Assad, wants to provoke Turkey to intervene in Syria. \"That would only accelerate the fall of his regime,\" he said. It's not yet clear who was responsible for the shelling. According to Syria's ally, Russia, it was a \"tragic accident.\" Relationship damaged The armed incidents on the Syrian-Turkish border have been going on for months. According to Amnesty International, some 300,000 Syrians have left their country since the start of the uprising against Assad, and many of them have fled to Turkey. The relationship between the two countries, which used to be close, has deteriorated dramatically, and the Turkish government is now openly supporting the Syrian opposition. \"Turkey is itself a player in the Syrian conflict,\" said Perthes. \"It provides shelter for many refugees and it's through Turkey that supplies come for the opposition.\" NATO has lined up behind Turkey and told Syria to end its \"flagrant violations of international law.\" Call for 'great discretion' The German chancellor, Angel Merkel, has also positioned herself alongside Turkey. \"We call on all parties to show great discretion,\" she said in Berlin. The foreign minister, Guido Westerwelle, declared that everything must be done to deescalate the situation, so that the Syrian conflict did not turn into a conflagration in the region. Indeed, the Syrian crisis is not only spreading to Turkey, but also to Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon. According to Perthes, \"The neighboring countries are partly victims and partly instigators. Jordan too has taken in refugees and supplies the rebels. On the other hand, Iraq has tended to support the government of Bashar Assad.\" Even so, he said, all the neighboring countries had an interest in ensuring the conflict was confined to Syria. Appeal to the international community But the number of Syrian refugees is rising by the day. Ruth J\u00fcttner, a Middle East expert with Amnesty International, believes this will continue in future months. \"It's important that the countries bordering on Syria are supported by the international community in providing accommodation, medical and psychological care and schooling for children,\" she told DW. It's an appeal she directs especially to European countries. The shelling on the Syrian-Turkish border has made it more likely that there will be armed conflict between Syria and its neighbors. According to Perthes, \"It's probably the case that political resistance in Turkey to intervention in Syria is decreasing right now.\"",
        "generated_story": "German Institute for International and Security Affairs: Turkey's response to Syrian-Israeli conflict is \"not likely\" The German institute for international and security affairs (DIY) has called on Turkey to step up its support for Syrian President Bashar Assad. DW spoke to Volker Perthes, a member of the German IISS think-tank, about the situation in Syria. \"Turkey is not likely to stand up to the Syrian regime,\" he told DW, adding that he was \"very concerned\" by the latest developments in the conflict between Syrian and Israeli forces and the Turkish military. However, he added, \"it is possible that Turkey will act as a mediator between the two sides.\" \"We have to be very careful about what Turkey does and what it does not do. We are not going to allow it to do,\" said Venerable, who is also an expert on the Middle East. The Turkish-Syrian conflict, which began on 03.10.2012, has been raging for more than a year and a half and has killed at least 30,000 people. On Wednesday, the government in Damascus announced that it would no longer allow Syrian troops to enter the country, and that Turkish troops would not be allowed to take part in any sort of offensive against Syrian civilians. In addition, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Wednesday that his country would continue to provide humanitarian assistance to Syrians in need of humanitarian aid, but that \"we will not allow this to happen.\" On the other hand, German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said Turkey would be willing to help Syria in its fight against terrorism, as long as it did not use chemical weapons against its own citizens. Germany's foreign minister said that Russia and Turkey were ready to assist Syrian forces in fighting against the rebels, although he stressed that this was not the case in Iraq and Syria, where the fighting had been going on for a long time. He also stressed the need for \"a strong and coordinated response\" from Turkey, saying that Syria's military and political leadership were \"inadequate.\" DW: What do you think of this latest escalation of violence? VOLKER PERThes: \"I don't think there is any doubt that there will be an end to this conflict. I think it will take a lot of time and patience to get this resolved.\""

        "target": "Libya factions declare ceasefire After two days of peace talks in Geneva, a tentative ceasefire has been called in the restive North African country. Although they sent no representatives to Switzerland, Islamists have agreed to halt the fighting. The Islamist-backed militia alliance that took over Tripoli and installed its own government announced a ceasefire on Friday, following a breakthrough in Geneva-based peace talks. Despite not attending the UN-brokered meeting, the militias have agreed to \"a ceasefire on all fronts,\" according to a statement issued by Islamist group Fajr Libya (Libya Dawn). The only condition is that \"the other parties respect the truce.\" The announcement came hours after the United Nations declared that Libya's warring factions had agreed to a roadmap for forming a unity government. Nearly four years after a NATO-backed revolt saw Moammar Gadhafi removed from power, two rival governments each backed by different groups of militias have plunged the country back into chaos and threatened all-out civil war. After the elected government of Prime Minister Abdullah al-Thinni was forced out of Tripoli by Libya Dawn, it was forced to move to the far eastern city of Tobruk while Libya Dawn reinstated the old parliament known as the GNC. The fighting and violence has displaced hundreds of thousands of civilians, left hundreds killed and thousands wounded. Most foreign diplomats fled the country and shut their embassies last year. The Tobruk government, as well as a few other factions who favor a peaceful resolution, came to Geneva to work on \"confidence-building measures,\" which includes the release of detainees from both sides, opening closed ports and securing safe freedom of movement around the country. es/bw (AP, AFP, Reuters)",

It was not immediately clear how long the ceasefire would last, but it was expected to last for at least a week, according to a UN statement. A UN spokesman said that the truce was agreed upon after the two sides agreed on a timetable for the withdrawal of armed groups from Libya's capital, Tripoli, and on Saturday, the UN's special envoy for Libya, Zeid Ra\u2019ad al-Thinni, had called for an end to violence between rival factions. \u201cWe are ready to resume the peace process,\u201d he told a news conference in Switzerland, where he was due to attend a NATO summit on Thursday and Friday.

        "target": "France's conservatives: Combating the National Front with a swing to the right A staunch conservative is joining the race for the French presidency. Republican candidate Francois Fillon could turn into a big problem for right-wing extremist Marine Le Pen's National Front. France's Republicans are moving to the right: by choosing Francois Fillon, voters nominated a presidential candidate who has a reputation as a staunch conservative. The former prime minister has already announced that he intends to refocus politics with the traditional family in mind. Fillon takes a dim view of homosexual couples adopting children. He wants to introduce a cap on the number of refugees allowed into France, he intends to make it harder for foreign nationals to access the social welfare system, and he wants to put Muslim communities and mosques under government control. In addition, Fillon advocates a renationalization of school curricula. Fillon makes gains in FN territory Fillon's agenda could turn out to be a problem for the \"National Front\" (FN). The 62-year-old appeals to similar sentiments as the right-wing party's base: concern about foreign domination and loss of identity, fear of terrorism and crime. \"For a long time, FN was the only political force that addressed those fears,\" said Henrik Uterwedde of the German-French Institute (dfi) in Ludwigsburg. \"Now a politician has arrived on the scene who addresses those fears using a different language and makes them a political offer.\" In rural, Catholic France especially, where traditions still matter a great deal, the avowed Catholic Fillon strikes a chord with his proposals pertaining to family and society policies. He receives support from traditional Catholic groups who, for years, have been able to mobilize crowds for demonstrations against gay marriage. During the intraparty election campaign, Fillon predominantly traveled to France's villages and small towns - regions which FN leader Marine Le Pen had labeled the \"forgotten France,\" regarding herself as their foremost lobbyist. \"Fillon has made gains in an environment that is also canvassed by Le Pen,\" Andreas Jung, Chairman of the Bundestag's German-French parliamentary group, told German broadcaster rbb-Inforadio. \"He does not represent the lofty levels of Parisian politics, but rather provincial entrenchment. Fillon is committed to traditional values, like the family. Therefore, he may not only be capable of defeating Le Pen, but also of taking the lead during the first ballot.\" 'Most dangerous candidate for FN' Consequently, the FN camp is less than enthusiastic about the conservative's candidacy. \"Because of Fillon, we now have a strategy problem,\" Marion Marechal Le Pen, the FN leader's niece, recently told journalists. \"He is the most dangerous candidate for the National Front.\" Pollsters' findings appear to support that statement. Recent surveys establish Fillon as the current favorite in the French presidential election scheduled for next May. However, Fillon's election is not a foregone conclusion. By denouncing the conservative candidate as a member of the establishment, FN tries to win over those who are frustrated with politics and politicians in general. There is persistent opposition against his economic-liberal plans in particular. Fillon wants to abolish the 35-hour working week and raise the retirement age to 65 years. In addition, he wants to cut 500,000 jobs in the public sector and reform industrial law. Fillon is known as an admirer of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. \"Issues pertaining to liberal economic policy have always been heavily contested in France,\" said Uterwedde. \"Fillon's adversaries have already taken up their positions, criticizing what, in France, is called 'ultra-liberalism.'\" That was one of the nastiest words in French politics, he added. An offer for the left Fillon wants to raise VAT by 2 percent. This would predominantly hurt low-income households. Exactly that clientele, however, is wooed by FN with a program that is regarded as rather left-wing. The right-wing extremists are on a clear anti-globalization course, intending to seal off the French economy against foreign countries and exit from the European Union. The party is already trying to present Fillon as a symbol of anarchic, ultra-liberal capitalism. \"Francois Fillon will even go beyond EU demands for austerity and liberalism,\" David Rachline, Marine Le Pen's election campaign manager, wrote on Twitter. According to current polls, it is very likely that Fillon will have to face Marine Le Pen in a runoff election in May. The main hazard for the Republican candidate: his economic-liberal course could deter left-wing voters from choosing the conservative in order to avert Le Pen. \"Francois Fillon will have to start making offers, also to those voters who are closer to the center and more moderate,\" said France expert Uterwedde. \"And he will, prior to the runoff election at the latest, have to make offers to left-wing voters - without changing his original course.\"",
        "generated_story": "Fillon is the most dangerous candidate for French presidential election Francois Fillon has been declared the \"most dangerous\" candidate in France's presidential race, according to a poll released by the German-French Institute. The results of the French election are expected to be announced on Sunday, May 7, with the first round of voting set to take place in Ludwigsburg, the country's westernmost city, on the same day as the polls close. French media have reported that the far-right National Front (FN) candidate, Marine Le Pen, has the strongest chance of winning the vote in the western German state. \"The FN candidate has a lot to prove,\" said Henrik Uterwedde, a professor of political science at the Berlin-based German Institute of Politics and International Relations (DIPRI). \"He's got a great chance to win the election, and he's going to do a good job of it,\" he said, adding that he was \"very optimistic about the chances of him winning.\" \"I don't think he'll be able to make it to the ballot box, because he doesn't have the votes. He'll have to get the support of his own party, which is far more conservative than the right-wing extremists.\" The poll results come as a surprise to many observers, who had been expecting a strong showing from the conservative candidate. But it's not just the left-leaning candidates who have made the rounds. There are also a number of candidates running for the Bundestag, including former French Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, former German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and current German Foreign Minister Andreas Jung. In addition, there is also the possibility of a runoff between the two candidates in May and a possible runoff in June. Both candidates have been heavily criticized for their anti-immigrant rhetoric and their lack of commitment to European Union policies. They have also been accused of being too soft on refugees and migrants, as well as of not being sufficiently pro-European in their approach to asylum seekers and refugees. On the other hand, both candidates seem to have a clear advantage in terms of distance between themselves and the electorate. Rbb-Inforadio, Germany's state-run news agency, reported on Friday that French voters were \"increasingly skeptical\" of their candidate's ability to influence the outcome of elections in other European countries. It also said that they were not convinced that their candidates would have any real impact on French politics at all. However, it was not immediately clear whether or not they would make a difference in this election. According to one pollster, \"if the candidates were to form a coalition, they'd be more likely to support each other,\" while another said \"it would be very difficult for them to find a candidate who is more moderate and less extreme in his views.\" In a statement released on Saturday, French political scientist Andreas Jugde said: \"It's clear that there are many people who are not willing to give up their right to vote for a third candidate.\" He added that it is \"not surprising\" that \"the French people are becoming increasingly skeptical of French politicians.\""

        "target": "Berlin court rules Google Street View is legal in Germany A Berlin court has ruled that Google Street View is legal. But that doesn't mean the lawsuits will end, legal scholars say. A Berlin court has ruled that Google Street View is, in fact, legal in Germany. Last Tuesday, the Berlin State Supreme Court (Kammergericht) announced its decision in a court case from late last year, in which a woman had sued Google, fearing that photos of her, her family and the front of her house would be posted on Google Street View and would thus violate her property and privacy rights. The court ruled that it is legal to take photographs from street level, rejecting her argument that Google was trying to take unauthorized pictures. Part of her argument rested on the fact that Google used cameras mounted at three meters (9.84 feet) high, which could see over her two-meter-high hedge. However, the court did not find this argument convincing, given that the photographs were taken from the street, and not the sidewalk. Furthermore, because Google automatically blurs faces and license plates and did allow Germans to opt-out of the service to have their house obfuscated as well, the court did not find any potential violations. This is the first high-level court ruling, which cannot be appealed any further, regarding Street View since the service debuted in Germany at the end of last year. An ongoing debate Since Google announced plans to launch Street View in Germany last summer, debate around the service has become heated, with some politicians trying to stop it at every turn, while German Chancellor Angela Merkel famously said that she would not remove her house from Street View. In November 2010, the company announced that 244,000 German residents in the 20 cities had chosen to opt out of Street View - less than three percent of residents. However, in Germany and everywhere else, the company also allows people to report abuse, inaccuracies or request that something be blurred using an online tool. \"Our job is to develop services that respect these cultural differences,\" Peter Fleischer, Google's global privacy counsel told Deutsche Welle in November 2010. \"We try to anticipate them. We're all internationally-minded people ourselves. We try to guess how people will react to them. But a lot of these services are new and have never been on the market before, so we learn and we adapt as we go along.\" A 'landmark decision' European legal experts called the Berlin ruling a \"landmark decision,\" saying that this would now become part of German case law regarding property rights. \"Yes, other people are now warned: Don't sue Google simply claiming that Google Street View violates personality [or] property rights,\" wrote Thomas H\u00f6ren, a professor of media and communications law at the University of M\u00fcnster, in an e-mail sent to Deutsche Welle. But, he also warned that this decision was very narrow, focusing on the issue of property rights, and not on the larger issues of data protection from Google. \"The problem of Google Street View - to be honest - has never been a problem of personality rights or property rights, but the enormous risk of personal data compilations in cases where people use Google Street View for compiling personal profiles (such as building insurance companies; future employees, et cetera),\" he added. \"And this risk has not been considered by the Berlin courts.\" Similarly, Viktor Mayer-Sch\u00f6nberger, a professor at the Oxford Internet Institute, agreed that this case was \"limited in scope,\" adding in an e-mail, \"The plaintiff never alleged an actual invasion of privacy, just a potential one.\" Author: Cyrus Farivar Editor: Nancy Isenson",

        "target": "UK lawmakers propose jail sentences for reckless bankers A British parliamentary commission has completed its work on the overhaul of the domestic banking sector. Among other things, it proposed jail terms for bankers displaying grave malpractice and causing huge damage. Members of the UK's Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards agreed Wednesday that Britain needed a radical overhaul of its scandal-hit lenders. The panel, which was mostly composed of lawmakers, concluded in its final report that senior bankers must be made personally responsible for malpractice through the introduction of a new criminal offence of reckless misconduct. It would carry a prison sentence. The reputation of the country's banking sector had been damaged in recent years by a string of scandals, including Libor rate-rigging, credit insurance mis-selling and a controversy over staff behavior and bonuses in the run-up to the 2008 global financial crisis. The level of malpractice had been \"shocking and widespread,\" said the commission's chairman, Conservative party lawmaker Andrew Tyrie. RBS cut in two? \"Taxpayers and customers have lost out, and the economy has suffered,\" the 500-page report said. \"Under our recommendations, senior bankers who seriously damage their banks or put taxpayers' money at risk can expect to be fined, banned from the industry or in the worst cases go to jail.\" The commission called for bankers to sign up to a new code of conduct under which all key responsibilities within a bank would be assigned to specific senior officials who would be held responsible. The panel also proposed that more remuneration for bankers should be deferred for longer periods of up to ten years in order to \"reflect the longer run balance between business risks and rewards.\" The commission recommended that the government consider splitting the state-rescued Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) into a good bank and a bad one mopping up toxic assets. The report was published ahead of a key speech by Finance Minister George Osborne on his bank reform plans. hg/ipj (AFP, Reuters)",

        "target": "Party leaders call for increased wages in growing German economy Chancellor Angela Merkel and other top officials have called for upticks in Germany's economy to trickle down to workers in the form of higher pay. But a leading think tank has warned against giving raises too soon. Germany's foreign minister and deputy chancellor, Guido Westerwelle, has added his support to comments made by Economics Minster Rainer Bruederle about increased wages for German workers. \"When the economy grows and this growth is substantial and sustainable, then the benefits of this upswing should be felt by the people who worked so hard for it,\" Westerwelle told the Hamburger Abendblatt newspaper in an interview. Westerwelle heads the free-market liberal FDP, which shares power with Chancellor Merkel's Christian coalition. Earlier this week, Bruederle, also an FDP member, said in light of Germany's currently growing economy, those economic gains should trickle down to employees in the form of higher wages. Merkel, who is also the head of the Christian Democratic Union, supported Bruederle's idea. \"That is something the chancellor sees the same way, letter for letter,\" said Merkel's spokesman, Steffen Seibert. Not so fast Earlier this week, analysts predicted growth of 3.5 percent this year and 2 percent in 2011. Germany's five leading economic think tanks also predicted that the number of unemployed would fall below 3 million next year, the lowest level since 1992. Despite the current rosy outlook for the German economy, not everyone is convinced that a growing economy should inevitably lead to higher wages. The president of the German Institute for Economic Research, Klaus Zimmermann, warned against reacting too quickly. \"I can't support the idea of a general wage increase, I think it is too dangerous,\" Zimmermann said in an interview with the Handelsblatt newspaper. Zimmermann wasn't opposed to the idea of raising wages, but said he was against across-the-board increases for all sectors and pointed out that not every industry is benefitting the same from the growing economy. \"We can't forget that the German economy did not resort to mass lay-offs when it wasn't going so well last year,\" Zimmermann said. Raising wages in some branches could be a good idea, Zimmermann said, as that would make those branches more attractive option to potential workers from outside of Germany.

        "generated_story": "Merkel's Deputy Chancellor, Klaus Zimmermann, is against a general wage hike Chancellor Angela Merkel's deputy chancellor, Guido Westerwelle, has called for an increase in Germany's minimum wage. The chancellor's spokesman, Rainer Bruederle, told the German newspaper \"Hamburger Abendblatt\" that the chancellor was \"deeply disappointed\" by the government's decision not to raise the wage for low-income earners. \"The chancellor is deeply disappointed,\" the spokesman said in an interview published on the website of the conservative German Institute for Economic Research (DLR). \"She is not happy with the way the country is being run, and she is very disappointed in the direction that Germany is going in.\" \"I don't see any reason why Germany should not be able to live in a free-market economy,\" Westermann said, adding that he would like to see a \"general wage increase\" of up to 1.5 percent, which would be the highest level since 1992. However, he added, \"We are not going to allow this to happen, because it will not allow us to have the same level of competition as in other countries.\" He also pointed to the fact that, in 1992, Germany was the first industrialized country to introduce a national income tax. Since then, it has been a common practice for countries to increase their minimum wages by 1 percent to 2 percent. In the case of Germany, this has led to a rise in unemployment and a drop in living standards. It is also a sign of how far Germany has come since the 1990s, when the liberal Free-Market liberal (FDP) party took over from the center-left Social Democrats (SPD) government of Chancellor Steffen Seibert. Today, the FDP is the largest party in parliament, with more than 1,000 members. Author: Matt Zuvela (Reuters/dapd/derpa) Editor: Sean Sinico"

        "target": "Belarusian president accuses Germany, Poland of coup plans Before being sworn in for a fourth term, the reclusive leader of Belarus fired a warning salvo at the European Union, accusing Germany and Poland of plotting a coup and threatening action against sanctions. Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko was sworn into office on Friday in a lavish ceremony boycotted by Western diplomats. The previous day, the 56-year-old leader openly accused Germany and neighboring Poland of planning a coup against him. \"There were [in Germany and Poland] plans worked out for an overthrow of the constitutional order,\" Lukashenko said in the Belarusian capital, Minsk, on Thursday. \"This is not an invention of our intelligence agencies.\" Lukashenko, who came to power in 1994, was re-elected last month with 80 percent of the vote in what the opposition and international monitors said was a rigged election. Relations between the reclusive Belarusian government and the West have been strained ever since. 'Belarus question must be answered' German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said in a statement that the accusations were \"baseless\" and an attempt by Lukashenko to draw attention away from his own wrongdoing. \"The EU needs to find a clear political answer to events surrounding the presidential election and the continued incarceration of opposition politicians and their supporters,\" Westerwelle said. A wide-reaching crackdown against the regime's opponents followed Lukashenko's re-election. Hundreds of his critics were arrested and dozens threatened with long-term jail sentences. Poland also dismissed the accusations as absurd and said that relations with Minsk would not be normalized unless all political prisoners were released. Sanctions threat The situation in Belarus pushed the European Union to adopt a resolution on Thursday in support of economic sanctions against the country. The threats earned a sharp rebuke from Lukashenko, who promised the \"hardest possible reaction\" should the bloc impose sanctions against his country. At the same time, the Belarusian prime minister, Mikhail Myasnikovich, travelled to Moscow in a effort to shore up Russian support for Minsk during its standoff with the EU. That meeting ended with a Russian promise not to impose its own set of sanctions on Belarus over an unrelated spat over oil exports and a commitment to resume a nuclear power plant project shelved after the 1986 Chernobyl disaster.

        "target": "Indian government tells Supreme Court Rohingya pose'serious threat' After an appeal from two Rohingya, India's top court is considering PM Narendra Modi's plan to deport some 40,000 Rohingya in India. The government said intelligence data showed links between some Rohingya and terrorism. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government told the Supreme Court of India on Monday that the Rohingya were \"illegal\" immigrants. The hearing is taking place as Rohingya face severe violence in their native Myanmar. More than 400,000 Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh in the past few weeks to escape military and civilian reprisals that the United Nations has described as \"ethnic cleansing.\" Later on Monday, Myanmar's national security advisor said that his government was willing to welcome the refugees who had fled to Bangladesh back to their native Rakhine state, but that the details of the process still had to be worked out. \"We will make sure that everybody who left their home can return to their home but this is a process we have to discuss,\" Thaung Tun told Reuters news agency after a meeting with British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. It was unclear how this would affect the estimated 40,000 Rohingya believed to have settled in India, including 16,000 of whom are registered with the UN's refugee agency.

It argued that such links made them a \"serious threat to national security.\" The government also said there was a \"serious possibility of eruption of violence against Buddhists in India by radicalized Rohingya.\" Lawyer Colin Gonsalves, who in a separate case is representing about 7,000 Rohingya living in the northern Indian city of Jammu, countered the government's assertions. \"We just want to know: 40,000 people have been here, many of them for the last five years. Have you [the government] filed a single charge sheet, is anyone being prosecuted in the criminal court for being a terrorist? The answer is: no,\" he told DW. The court has adjourned the hearing in the matter to October 3. Lack of evidence India says it is not bound by the UN convention on refugees as it is not a signatory to the accord, but human rights activists disagree. \"The principle of non return of a person to a place where he will be executed or tortured has become a principle of customary international law which India follows,\" Gonsalves told DW. \"And it has attained the status of 'jus cogens,' which is a principle of law that no country can say is not applicable to it, such as torture and genocide.\" In a communication sent to all states in August, the Home Ministry [interior ministry] said the illegal migrants were more susceptible to terrorist recruitment efforts. But an investigation by Indian broadcaster NDTV found \"little evidence of the government claim.\" The investigation that was carried out at major Rohingya settlements in the country showed little involvement in criminal wrongdoing by the refugees. Lack of any evidence to support the government claim has led to speculations that the Rohingya were being targeted for their religion by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu-nationalist government. \"It is really unfortunate that the government is going back on its commitment to refugees which it has reiterated several times in the past merely because these Rohingyas are Muslims,\" said lawyer Prashant Bhushan, who filed the plea on behalf of two Rohingya men. \"I mean this is clearly a case of religious discrimination and an attempt to arouse a sort of feeling of... an anti-Muslim feeling or try and communalise the situation,\" he told reporters outside the courthouse. The UN's human rights chief last week deplored Indian government's move to deport Rohingya refugees. \"India cannot carry out collective expulsions, or return people to a place where they risk torture or other serious violations,\" Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein said. The Rohingya are an Indo-Aryan people, the vast majority of whom are Muslims. They usually migrate to India through a rather porous border to escape persecution in their native Rakhine state in Myanmar, where they have been denied citizenship rights. They are viewed by the local authorities as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. Myanmar's Buddhist majority is often accused of subjecting them to discrimination and violence.

Hundreds of people, the majority of them Rohingya, have been killed in the violence that has seen many homes destroyed and several villages burned down. Myanmar's government maintains the crackdown is part of a counter-terrorism drive, while the UN's al-Hussein has said that it \"seems a textbook example of ethnic cleansing.\"",
        "generated_story": "India says Rohingyas pose 'erious threat' to India The Indian government on Monday said it was \"seriously concerned\" about the influx of Rohingya refugees into its country. The move comes as the country's interior ministry announced that it would take action against the group. \"We are deeply concerned,\" said Prashant Bhushan, director of the Centre for Human Rights (CHRR) in Jammu, adding that the situation in Myanmar is \"very serious.\" \"The situation is very serious,\" he said, referring to the ongoing violence in the predominantly Muslim state of Rakhine, which has seen thousands of people flee to neighboring Bangladesh in recent weeks. India's foreign ministry, however, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Last week, the government of Bangladesh issued a statement saying it had \"serious concerns\" over the number of refugees who had fled to Bangladesh from Myanmar, where they were being persecuted by Buddhists and other ethnic groups. On August 25, Myanmar's Supreme Court ordered the return of all refugees to their homes in a bid to quell the violence. Bangladeshi Prime Minister Narendra Modi had earlier said that his government was committed to ending the conflict. However, Indian Foreign Secretary Colin Gonsalves said in an interview with the Indian news agency NDTV that he was not aware of any such concerns. He added that \"it is our responsibility to ensure that all those who are affected by this conflict are brought to justice.\" The statement came after the UN Security Council adopted a resolution calling for the immediate suspension of violence against Rohingya Muslims and their families. It also called for an end to violence between the Rohingya community and the security forces, and called on the international community to \"ensure the safety and security of its citizens.\" India has long been a staunch ally of Myanmar in its fight against terrorism. In August, India banned the practice of using the term \"Rohingya\" to refer to people who commit crimes against humanity. A UN report released last month found that Myanmar authorities had failed to provide adequate security to Rohingya people living in conflict-ravaged Myanmar. UN envoy Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein said the Myanmar government had acted \"in a very irresponsible and irresponsible manner\" by not providing adequate protection to refugees fleeing conflict and persecution. According to UN special rapporteur on human rights, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who has been visiting Myanmar for more than a year and a half, \"we are very concerned that these people are going to be persecuted and that they will not be allowed to return to Myanmar,\" the report said."

        "target": "Armstrong stripped of Tour de France titles Cyclist Lance Armstrong has been stripped of his seven Tour de France titles and banned from cycling for life, in a much-anticipated ruling by the sport's international governing body. Monday's announcement by Pat McQuaid, the president of the International Cycling Union, ratified recommendations in an October report from the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), which ordered Armstrong's Tour de France titles be wiped out. \"Lance Armstrong has no place in cycling,\" said McQuaid. Addressing his remarks to cyclists, McQuaid said the fight against doping was his priority. \"UCI is listening and is on your side. We\u2019ve come too far in the fight against doping to return to our past. Cycling has a future and something like this must not happen again.\" The scathing USADA report included testimony from 11 former teammates, accusing Armstrong of running the \"most sophisticated\" doping program in the sport's history. The USADA said it had collected evidence to prove the seven-time Tour de France winner had engaged in the biggest doping conspiracy to date. Effect on cycling and sponsorship Monday's decision comes as the sport of cycling reels from Armstrong's well-documented fall from grace. Organizers of the Tour de France will be trying to move on from the scandal as the race prepares to celebrate its centenary next year. Sponsors have been deserting Armstrong and the sport in general. Last week, Nike - one of Armstrong's main corporate sponsors - said it was terminating its relationship with the cyclist and accused him of deception. Trek, the company that made the bicycles Armstrong rode to seven titles, announced on the same day it would terminate its sponsorship contract - as did the beer maker Anheuser-Busch. The Dutch institution Rabobank ended its association with professional cycling after the doping allegations came to light, leaving 17 riders in need of a sponsor. Last week Armstrong also announced he would step down from his own charity, the Lance Armstrong Foundation, also known as Livestrong, a move believed to have been intended to limit the damage to the organization from the USADA report. Armstrong appears Lance Armstrong spoke briefly to thousands of riders in Texas at a benefit organized by his charity, the day before UCI's decision. \"I've been better, but I've also been worse,\" he said. \"Obviously it has been an interesting and difficult couple of weeks.\" jr/rc (Reuters, AFP, AP)",

The US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) said on Monday that Armstrong had tested positive for banned substances in October. Armstrong, the world's most famous cycling cyclist, was stripped from his four titles after testing positive in the fall of last year. USADA said in a statement that it had found no evidence of a positive test in Armstrong\u2019s blood. \"The results of the tests were inconclusive,\" the organization said, adding that the results would not be used to determine whether or not the cyclist had been tested for prohibited substances. A spokesman for Armstrong's foundation, which is based in Texas, said he had no comment on the allegations. An official from the US anti-doping agency said the findings were \"inappropriate\" and \"unacceptable.\" \"We are not aware of any allegations against Lance, nor do we have any evidence that he has any involvement in this matter,\" a spokesperson for the group told the Associated Press news agency, referring to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). \"This is an isolated incident, and we will not comment further on it at this time.\" Armstrong was banned from cycling for life in early October after he failed a drug test. jr/rc (Reuters, AFP, AP)"

President Obama vowed to nominate a successor 'in due time,' despite political opposition. The 79-year old justice died in his sleep, presumably of natural causes, local media reported on Saturday. Scalia was visiting Texas for a hunting trip, and his body was discovered after he failed to appear for breakfast in the resort where he was staying. US President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama extended \"their deepest condolences to Justice Scalia's family,\" White House deputy spokesman Eric Schultz said. Texas Governor Greg Abbott described the conservative justice as a \"man of God, a patriot and an unwavering defender of the written Constitution and the rule of law.\" \"He was the solid rock who turned away so many attempts to depart from and distort the Constitution. His fierce loyalty to the Constitution set an unmatched example, not just for judges and lawyers, but for all Americans,\" Abbot said. Battle for the empty seat His passing is likely to open a new political front between President Barack Obama and the Republican Party, as Scalia's replacement could shift the composition of the court towards a more liberal persuasion. Several Republican lawmakers have already urged Obama to leave the decision to the next president who will be voted in later this year. \"The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court justice,\" Senate Republican majority leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement, referring to the upcoming November general election. \"Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president,\" McConnell concluded. President Obama, however, said he would fulfill his constitutional duty and nominate Scalia's successor \"in due time.\" \"These are responsibilities I take seriously, and so should everyone. They are bigger than any one party,\" he said. Decades of controversy Scalia joined the Supreme Court in 1986, becoming the first Italian-American to serve in the top judicial body. He was nominated by US President Ronald Reagan. Throughout his long carrier, Scalia voted in favor of privacy and protecting defendants' rights, but also against legalizing abortion, same-sex marriage and gun control. He also drew public attention for his theatrical flair and sharpness of tongue, as well as his alleged unwillingness to compromise. In June last year, the nine-person Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage with a five-to-four vote. Scalia, who was in the minority, commented he would \"hide my head in a bag\" if his own name were associated with the decision. He also said that the majority opinion was \"couched in a style that is as pretentious as its content is egotistic.\" dj/jm (AP, Reuters, AFP, dpa)",

This time, we meet with Tonatiuh Ibarra from Mexico. He's a university student majoring in German Studies, so he decided to come to Europe for three months for a German language course at the Goethe Institute in Freiburg. A good choice: Freiburg is a charming university town in southwestern Germany attracting three million visitors a year! Let\u2019s find out how Tonatiuh spent his day with our camera crew.",
        "generated_story": "My Freiburg: A tour with Tonatiuh Ibarra from Mexico City I am back in Germany after a two-day visit to Mexico. I'm back from a three-week stay in Mexico, where I spent a few days with my family and friends. My first stop was the Goethe Institute, which is located in the city of Mexico's capital, in what is now the state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. There, I was able to take a tour of the institute's campus. It was my first trip back to Germany, and I had a great time. The first day was spent in a small town near the border with Mexico with the Federal State. After that, it was on my way to the German side of town to see my father and his wife. We spent the next two days in their home town, the town of Tecumseh, with their two children and a host of other family members. They were very happy to be back home after the trip, as they had planned to stay for a couple of weeks. But then the tour ended with a stop at the Mexican side. \"I was very impressed,\" I said, \"with the fact that they were so close to each other and that we had such a good time together.\" The trip was also a chance to catch up with some of Germany's most important cultural figures, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel and the head of German Studies, Wolfgang Schaeuble. And of course, there was a lot to talk about, too: \"The German language is very important to me, because it is the language of my country, so I have always wanted to learn German.\" I also had the opportunity to meet my dad, who is German-born and has been studying German since he was in his early 20s. He is a professor of philosophy and German literature at Germany\u2019s state-run university. Tonatuh is fluent in German, but he has never been to a foreign country before. In fact, he spent most of his life in Berlin. His father taught him German and he studied German at a university in Cologne, Germany. When he returned to his native Mexico in 2006, Tonituh was invited to join his family there. Since then, his father has taught German for many years and is an expert on the subject of education and foreign languages."

        "target": "Opinion: The pope's impossible mission in Mexico Pope Francis's trip to Mexico is a dangerous mission - a diplomatic as well as political balancing act, one that brings with it enormous expectations. Francis won't be able to meet them, says DW's Astrid Prange. Dead prisoners, disappearing students, refugees shot dead and murdered priests. Mexico has lived through one violent episode after the other. The mood in the nation is explosive. And now this: just a day before the pope is set to arrive, more than 50 people died in the largest prison revolt in the country's history. What meaning does the pope's presence hold on such an occasion? Only one thing is certain: Francis won't be able to resolve the problems of the world's second largest Catholic nation in just a five-day trip. The unrealistic demands placed on him are not something he can fill. Yet the pope carries with him an important message: you don't have to love your enemies but you do need to speak with them. And he's living the example himself by meeting with the Russian Orthodox Patriarch Kirill on a stopover in Cuba on his way to Mexico. Cuba all over again It's sensational! Bannings and mutual ex-communications are ancient history. Nearly a millennium after the split, the head of the Roman Catholic Church and the head of the Russian Orthodox Church are speaking to each other. It's not as if the two will become friends - their positions are far too different. Yet their centuries-old enmity feels out of place and in view of the massive worldwide persecution of Christians, almost unchristian. And both of these church leaders know this. In Mexico, efforts to stem the polarizing forces at play in society have not been successful. The extreme differences between rich and poor are dividing Mexican society. President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto has prioritized economic growth over dialogue with his critics - a group which includes students as well as teachers and union members who regularly protest against government policies. They demand an end to lawlessness and corruption. The presumed murder of 43 teaching students in Iguala in September 2014, a crime which remains unsolved, stands as a symbol of the lawlessness sweeping Mexico. The recent mutiny in a Monterrey jail serves as further proof of the country's shortcomings in regard to human rights and the rule of law. With a visit to Ciudad Juarez and the largest prison in Mexico, Francis will only make that deficiency more transparent. Even the pope of peace has enemies. The route he's chosen to take on his travels through the country has displeased the staunchly Catholic president. A meeting with the relatives of the Iguala victims is therefore hush-hush and participation in a holy mass remains secret. Considering the tense situation in the country, it's still possible that the pope's route will change once again. The church in the pillory Even within his own church, Francis has met with opposition. A meeting he requested with victims from the church's abuse scandal will not take place - a bitter disappointment for many former seminarians who were abused by Marcial Maciel, the founder of the Legion of Christ, and members of his order. It's just one example of how impunity continues even within the church itself. None of the perpetrators have yet to answer for their crimes in court. It appears as though the pope has accomplished more on the world stage than he has brought on reforms to the Vatican. Despite the revolutionary coming together of Cuba and the US and the revolutionary meeting with Patriarch Kirill, the revolution in Rome has yet to materialize. Do you have something to say? Add your comments below. The thread to this editorial closes in 24 hours.",
        "generated_story": "Pope's impossible mission in Mexico Pope Francis has been criticized for his \"impossible mission\" to Mexico. The Vatican has called for an end to the persecution of Christians in the country. But the pope's mission is far from impossible. Astrid Prange reports from Mexico City: \"The Vatican is calling for the end of persecution and the return of the Roman Catholic Church to Latin America.\" The pope has also criticized President Kirill, accusing him of being too lenient with the Church. \"I think the Vatican should have done more to protect the church from persecution,\" the pontiff said in an interview with DW. He also called on Mexico's Catholic bishops to \"respect the rule of law and to respect human rights and human dignity.\" In a statement issued on Sunday, the Russian Orthodox Church said it was \"deeply disappointed\" by the Pope's decision not to send a special envoy to investigate allegations of sexual abuse of minors in Mexican prisons. It also said that it would be \"unacceptable\" for a pope to travel to Cuba, Cuba and Cuba without consulting with his Russian counterpart, Cardinal Marcial Maciel, who is currently in prison in Ciudad Juarez, to visit the victims of a sexual assault committed by a priest in September 2014. In his interview, Francis said he had \"no doubt\" that the charges against the priest were politically motivated and that he would not be allowed to return to his country if he were to be extradited to face charges of rape and other crimes committed against minors. And he added that \"it is not a question of whether or not we will be able to prosecute the perpetrator of these crimes.\" \"It is a matter of time before we know for sure if we are going to succeed in this mission,\" he said. 'We will have to wait and see what happens' In the meantime, however, it is important to note that there is no evidence that any of this is the case. On the other hand, there are reports that a number of bishops have been arrested and charged with crimes against humanity, including rape, murder, kidnapping and torture, among other offenses. Some of those arrested have also been sentenced to life imprisonment, while others face up to 10 years in jail. Many of them have already been released from prison, and some have even been sent to prison for life, according to a report from the Catholic Diocese of Mexico (CDMX) in El Paso, Texas."

        "target": "Report: Torture is a European problem too A day after Amnesty International published a report on Europe's collusion with the CIA's torture program, the Council of Europe published its own shocking survey of abuse in detention centers across the continent. Prison guards in several European countries carried out reprisals against detainees who talked to the Council of Europe's Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT), the new CPT report has revealed. The council considers this a violation of the spirit of cooperation between the CPT and the Council of Europe's member states. According to the CPT's 24th General Report, released on Wednesday, reprisals were carried out against prisoners in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Greece, Hungary, Moldova, Russia, Spain, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and Ukraine. \"Intimidation or retaliation against persons the CPT has interviewed may not only violate their human rights but also strikes a blow to the preventive mechanism established by the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture,\" CPT President Letif H\u00fcseynov said in a statement. \"I urge national authorities to respect their obligation to prevent, investigate and punish such actions.\" The report also highlighted several problems with the detention of juveniles around Europe, and proposed a series of practical measures to protect young people's rights when detained. Ad hoc visits The little-known CPT, now 25 years old, represents a unique approach to international torture prevention. A team of specialists make roughly 180 visits a year to all kinds of detention centers (including prisons, police stations, holding centers for immigration detainees, psychiatric hospitals, and even social care homes) all across the 47-member Council of Europe - one of the few international blocs that offer platforms for dialogue with Eastern European regimes considered to have poor human rights records, such as Russia, Azerbaijan, and Ukraine. The method combines the carrot of talks with government officials and the stick of ad hoc visits, which all members are committed to allowing into their prisons. Once inside, the CPT also has the right to interview any detainees it chooses - in private, though of course the detainees have the right to refuse. \"The first thing to say is how important the CPT is,\" said Carla Ferstman, director of Redress, a UK-based organization that helps torture survivors. \"As a result of their boot work over a very long period of time, the UN has set up a global system which in many ways mirrors the approach of the CPT.\" But given that the committee has no powers to enforce its proposals to governments, there are question marks over its effectiveness. \"In the report, they complain about how some of the recommendations they've made have not been implemented,\" said Ferstman. \"It's a sign that they're a little bit frustrated.\" But in the long run, she maintains, the CPT has more than proved its value. \"The dialogue that they are able to have is really important,\" she said. \"Looking long-term, they have been very effective.\" CIA collusion, asylum seekers The CPT's report comes a day after Amnesty International released its own report on European collusion with the CIA's torture program. While the CPT's report examines more prosaic day-to-day mistreatment, rather than mass rendition of terrorist suspects at the behest of the US, there are obvious links between the two, since some countries - such as Poland, Macedonia, and the UK - are highlighted in both reports. \"What is finally coming out in all of this is that the Europeans, despite all the criticism of the Bush and Obama administrations on the use of torture - so many of them connived,\" said Judy Dempsey, senior associate at Carnegie Europe. \"It's really a double standard. This report is quite damning and quite shameful, and it follows the Amnesty International one as well.\" The CPT's work also mentions the mistreatment of asylum seekers, a problem increasingly afflicting European countries that take in the largest number of asylum seekers - particularly Spain, Italy, and Greece. \"With Greece there are two things to remember,\" Dempsey told DW. \"A - the appalling situation of the prison system, and B - the lack of training among police of how to deal with asylum seekers. Awful things have happened. Parallel to this is the illegal detention centers. There have been lots of cases of terrible mistreatment over the last several years.\" \"Immigration detention is a growing issue,\" added Ferstman. \"In the UK, there was a whole parliamentary inquiry into one immigration detention center, where some of the women alleged that guards propositioned them in order to get quick treatment on their claims. Each country has its own history of torture.\"",
        "generated_story": "CPT is a European problem too, says expert DW DW's Carla Ferstman: Torture isn't just a US problem, it's an EU problem Too many people are being subjected to torture under the guise of protecting their rights. It's a major problem for the entire European community. The European Commission's 24th General Report, released on Wednesday, warns that torture is not only a human right, but also a violation of human rights and the rule of law. \"It's not just about protecting the rights of the victims of torture,\" said the report's author, Letif H\u00fcseynov. He added that the EU should take a closer look at how torture works in other countries, such as Bulgaria, Greece, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and Ukraine. In the past few years, torture has become more and more common in Eastern European countries. Today, however, there is no end in sight to the practice of torturing victims and their families under torture, according to a report released by the Council of Europe's executive committee on the subject in the wake of a CIA-sponsored torture trial in Macedonia. That trial, which began in 2006, was part of an agreement between the US, the CIA and Spain to stop torture and to end the use of force against victims. At the same time, US President George W. Bush and his successor, Barack Obama, have been accused of using torture as a weapon of mass destruction in their attempts to protect the lives of victims, including those of children and women who were tortured or killed. This is the first time that a torture case has been successfully prosecuted in Europe. Amnesty International, for its part, has called on European governments to take action against torturers and other forms of cruel and inhuman treatment, particularly those who commit crimes committed during the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Human rights groups have also called for EU countries to step up their efforts to prevent torture. DW: What do you think about torture?"

        "target": "Dresden marks 70 years since massive Allied bombing Seventy years ago, Allied bombers attacked Dresden, killing tens of thousands of people, the majority of them civilians and refugees. Every year, the East German city remembers its dead. DW's Naomi Conrad was on hand. As the tram trundled through Dresden's drab suburbs on Friday morning, a prim, elderly woman suddenly turned to her friend sitting on the seat beside her: \"You know, my mother never told me about the bombings.\" She shrugged, then, after a moment's pause, continued. \"It must have been such unspeakable hell that she just couldn't talk about it,\" the woman said. She was referring to February 13, 1945 - the morning, exactly 70 years ago, when Allied bombers swooped down on an unsuspecting city famous for its baroque architecture and that, until that point, had survived the war mostly unscathed. That was to change in the course of three dreadful days: As the bombs rained down on the city, its churches and palaces were turned to rubble. Up to 25,000 people - many of them refugees fleeing the advancing Soviet Red Army - died in the inferno that raged in the city for days. \"There was nothing left, nothing,\" a frail, bent man with a checkered cap recalled, \"just rubble and death.\" He was leaning on the balustrade of a viewing platform in Dresden's old gasometer, staring down at the 360-degree painting by the Iranian-German artist Yadegar Asisi; sirens howled from hidden speakers and strobe lighting illuminated the ruined churches and black smoke billowing from the burnt skeletons that were once buildings. The man swallowed, his voice hoarse, barely audible: \"It's so hard being here.\" The soundtrack and images, he said, \"bring back too many memories.\" 'So, so many dead' He was 15, he recalled, working on a school essay when the sirens began to wail. He never finished the essay. Instead, he ran for shelter with his family. When they returned home three days later, the roof had been blown off, the windows smashed. \"But we were lucky: We survived,\" he said. \"There were so, so many dead.\" His voice broke and, muttering an apology, he shuffled off. The bombings were intended to break the German population's morale - a decision that to many was incomprehensible, given that the war had long been decided and Dresden's economic and strategic importance was relatively minimal. Consequently, the death and destruction wreaked by the Allied bombers quickly became a tool, first for the Nazi propagandists in the last months of the war, then by the East German regime for its anti-West propaganda, and then later by neo-Nazi groups, who traditionally congregate on February 13. Even today, \"the debate continues about guilt and innocence, even about the exact number of victims,\" Dresden Mayor Helma Orosz told a packed audience, including delegations from abroad, gathered for a memorial service in the city's Frauenkirche, which in 2005 was rebuilt with the help of private donations after Germany's reunification, many of them from the United States and Great Britain. Call for peace \"War, hatred and violence begin in people's minds,\" Orosz said. \"We must resist any attempt at once again categorizing people based on their origin and skin color,\" she added, referring to what has often been described as a right-wing catchall movement called PEGIDA, generally translated as Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West, which has taken to the streets in Dresden since October. Later, on a platform overlooking thousands of people, many of them wearing white roses as a sign of peace while bracing the icy cold outside the church, Orosz called on Dresden to remember every victim of the Nazi terror - a plea that was reiterated by German President Joachim Gauck when he took to the microphone: \u201cWe don't want the pain that people suffered here to be misused by others.\u201d Behind him, the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, who, back in the Frauenkirche, had talked of the \u201cmiracle that peace in Europe represents,\u201d leaned in closer to his interpreter. Then, as evening fell over Dresden and church bells tolled, thousands - possibly as many as 10,000, according to the city's press office - lined up along Dresden's riverfront, holding hands to commemorate the dead and call for peace as police men dressed in black riot gear looked on. \"I can remember it all,\" Siegfriede Leonhard, a vivacious woman in her late 70s said. She was 7 when the bombs fell, she said, and had been coming to the commemorations in Dresden \"for at least 60 years.\" Sometimes, she said, stomping her feet to keep warm, she wondered whether she shouldn't remember at home, alone. \"",
        "generated_story": "German city of Dresden hit by Allied bombings in 1945 Dresden, Germany, is one of the world's most dangerous places to live. On February 13, 1945, the German city was bombed by the Allied forces. The bombing killed more than 1,000 people and left thousands of others injured. German President Joachim Gauck visited the city on Friday to commemorate the anniversary. He was accompanied by his wife, Helma Orosz, and his son, Yadegar Asisi, who had been born in Dresden. \"The bombing was part of a series of events that took place during the war,\" said the mayor, adding that the bombing had \"nothing to do with Dresden.\" \"It was an act of war that was carried out in the name of freedom and justice,\" he said, referring to the liberation of East Germany from the Soviet Red Army in World War II. In a statement released Friday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that \"the German people have suffered a great deal in this war.\" She added that she was \"deeply concerned\" about the future of Germany and that it would not be possible for the country to continue to cooperate with the United States in its fight against terrorism. She also pointed out that Germany was not the only country in Europe that had suffered from Nazi atrocities, such as the bombings of Berlin in October 1945 and Dresden in February of 2005, when the Germans were still fighting against the Soviets in eastern Europe. Berlin was also the first city to be attacked by an Allied warplane, which destroyed the Frauenkirche and other German military installations. It was the last city in Germany to have been bombed, after the fall of Nazi Germany in September 1945. Since then, Dresden has experienced a number of terrorist attacks, including attacks on churches, schools, hospitals and universities, as well as attacks by anti-communist groups. Germany is also a member of NATO, although it is not a NATO member. DW's Naomi Conrad reports from Berlin."

        "target": "Experts: Taliban have not changed strategy with Kabul restaurant attack The weekend attack on a Kabul restaurant frequented by foreigners came as no surprise to international organizations on the ground. Experts don't believe the Taliban have changed their strategy to target more civilians. Dramatic scenes must have played out in the restaurant: Guests sought cover under tables as a group of terrorists shot wildly into the dining rooms. News agencies report the restaurant owner tried in vain to fend off the attackers. He was among the more than 20 people who perished, most of whom were employees at international organizations. The attackers were also among the dead. During the evening dinner rush, at 7:00 p.m. Friday (17.01.2014), one of three Taliban members detonated his explosives-laden vest and blew a breach in the highly secured restaurant. Neither the man-high blast walls, nor the secured access points with armed guards could stop the attackers. The two remaining terrorists were killed later in a firefight with security forces at the scene. No change in Taliban strategy The suicide bombing on the popular Lebanese restaurant, Taverna Du Liban, in the high-end Kabul neighborhood of Wazir Akbar Khan was the worst attack so far in 2014. Afghanistan votes for a new president in April; and the international troops are scheduled to withdraw from the country by the end of the year. Although there are plans for a small contingent to remain in Afghanistan, President Hamid Karzai first has to sign a bilateral security agreement with the United States. But he continues to play for time. In this context, the Taliban may be targeting civilians more in order to drive out not just the military coalition, but the entire international community. Yet \"as horrible as this incident is, I don't see a change in strategy,\" said Thomas Ruttig, the co-director of the Afghan Analysts Network. Similar attacks have also been launched before, \"at least 12 to 15 times in the past eight years,\" Ruttig said. The worst attack was in 2012 at Qargha Lake, a popular weekend destination near Kabul. More than 20 people were killed, all of them Afghans. Extensive security precautions The Taliban, which normally doesn't miss an opportunity for fiery rhetoric, hasn't declared a change in strategy. A spokesman for the Islamist militant group said the attack was retaliation for a NATO airstrike in Parwan Province, a few kilometers north of Kabul. According to an assistant of the Afghan president, seven children and one woman died in the coalition strike. \"You have to carefully monitor the security situation,\" Nils W\u00f6rmer, head of the Konrad Adenauer Institute in Kabul, told DW. \"But I think it's a bit early to talk about a change in [Taliban] strategy.\" W\u00f6rmer's office lies just a few hundred meters from the site of Friday's attack. He could clearly hear the explosion, which shook the window panes in his office. \"It was immediately clear to me that something had happened,\" W\u00f6rmer recounted. But the Konrad Adenauer Institute was prepared. \"We had a relatively concrete warning in the last week related to our neighborhood, and we were very cautious,\" W\u00f6rmer said. He met with colleagues in his secured office. Like most of the international organizations, the Konrad Adenauer Institute is also integrated into the security networks. \"The security precautions are high,\" W\u00f6rmer said. \"But that doesn't exclude the possibility that something similar could happen again.\" But the Afghan security forces have succeeded in preventing many attacks in the past few months, he said. Kabul residents criticize Taliban An informal, impromptu poll by DW's Kabul correspondent, Hussein Sirat, suggested the Taliban are not winning Afghan hearts and minds with such attacks. \"Wherever the Taliban have killed civilians, they have not achieved their goal,\" said Mirwais, a pedestrian in the Kabul city center. Idris, another Kabul resident, seconded Mirwais' sentiment. \"The Taliban intimidate the people so that the security agreement won't be signed,\" he said. \"But the people won't bend to this intimidation.\" How the international organizations adapt to the tense security situation in Kabul will come after many conversations, analyses, and briefings in the following days. But W\u00f6rmer is not thinking about giving up. \"We have a clear agenda and long-term projects, which I considered to be very sensible,\" W\u00f6rmer said. \"I am of the opinion, as I was before, that what I'm doing here with the Konrad Adenauer Institute is worth the risks.\"",
        "generated_story": "Afghan Analysts Network: The Taliban haven't changed their strategy with the Kabul restaurant attack Afghan analysts say the Taliban are not changing their approach to Afghanistan. The Afghan government has not changed its strategy in the wake of last month's deadly attack on a restaurant in Kabul that killed at least 17 people and wounded more than 200. Afghan experts say that despite the fact that the attack was carried out by the Afghan Taliban, the country's security forces are still on high alert. \"The Taliban don't seem to have changed anything,\" said Nils W\u00f6rmer, a researcher at the Konrad Adenauer Institute in Afghanistan, referring to the government's decision to allow the restaurant to remain open until the end of the year. However, it is unclear whether the new strategy will be implemented in time for the next general election, which is due to take place on 17.01.2014. In the past few months, Afghanistan has seen an increase in attacks on restaurants and hotels. Last month, gunmen attacked a hotel in Parwan Province in eastern Afghanistan and shot and killed a man and a woman, according to local media reports. At the same time, Afghan officials have said that they will continue to monitor the situation closely to ensure that there is no escalation of violence. According to sources close to Karzai's government, there have been no new attacks since the beginning of his term in office in April 2014. But there has been a rise in violence in recent months. On Friday, an explosion at a popular Lebanese restaurant, Taverna Du Liban, claimed the lives of 15 people, including four police officers and three civilians. It was not immediately clear if the explosion was caused by a suicide bomber or whether it was an act of terrorism, but it appears to be the result of a coordinated attack. A Taliban spokesman, Wazir Akbar Khan, told DW that he believed the attackers were motivated by revenge for last year's attack, when he was forced to flee his home in Kandahar province for safety reasons. He also said the gunmen were not motivated to carry out attacks in other Afghan cities, such as the capital Kabul, Kabul or the provincial capital, Kandla."

        "target": "Teabag filter cleans water with nanotechnology A new water filter developed in South Africa could provide millions of people with clean drinking water. The filter, about the size and shape of a teabag, would be inexpensive, easy to distribute and simple to use. Marelize Botes is conducting a final set of tests on a new type of diminutive water filter before industrial production can begin. The microbiologist pours water from a plastic bottle though a high-tech, teabag-sized filter before analyzing it in her in her laboratory at the University of Stellenbosch in South Africa. \"The filter is much cheaper than bottled water as well as any other filter on the market,\" she told Deutsche Welle. Instead of being filled with black or green tea, the bag contains active carbon granules and is made from nanofibers treated with biocide, which kills bacteria rather than simply filtering them from the water. Nanotech for pennies \"This project takes nanotechnology to the poorest of the poor people who live in this world, and it will make a difference in their lives,\" said Eugen Cloete, who in addition to inventing the filter is dean of the faculty of science at Stellenbosch University and chair of Stellenbosch University's Water Institute. With some 300 million people in Africa - and over a billion worldwide - living without access to clean drinking water, the need for such a filter is huge. When in mass production, the developers said they expect the teabag to cost just a few South African cents (under half a US cent and under a third of a euro cent). In addition to being inexpensive, Botes said, the filter is also easy to distribute to rural area and simple to use as it can be place in an adapter that fits on nearly any regular-sized plastic bottle. Each filter can clean one liter (one quart) of the most polluted water to the point where it is completely safe to drink. Once used, the filter can be disposed of and is biodegradable. African countries, led by Somalia, Mauritania and Sudan, were ranked to have the most vulnerable water supplies, according to a June report by UK-based risk consultancy firm Maplecroft. Decentralized use The filter's small size and light weight make it ideal for rural areas where other means of filtration do not exist, Cloete said. \"It is simply impossible to build purification infrastructure at every polluted stream,\" Cloete said. \"So we have to take the solution to the people. The water is cleaned right then and there when you drink from the bottle.\" The filter is now undergoing testing by the South African Bureau of Standards, after which Cloete and his team hope it can be rolled out to the United Nations and non-governmental organizations that have expressed interest in it by the end of the year. The project grew out of research into larger filters, according to Cloete. \"We were busy developing filters for larger applications, but when you do the tests in the labatory you do the tests on a much smaller scale,\" he said. \"The results we were getting on a smaller amount of water promoted me to think about a smaller application.\" Author: Joerg Poppendieck, Sean Sinico Editor: Anke Rasper",

        "target": "How to wrap a present without using paper or tape Next time you get invited to a birthday party, you could try wrapping the present using a piece of fabric and ribbon. It's very easy and the best bit is, it can be reused. Maybe it will come back to you on your birthday. 1. All you need is a piece of fabric big enough to wrap your gift, a ribbon long enough to go right around it, and if you want to make a gift tag, you will also need a piece of old cardboard, a hole punch and another small piece of ribbon. Ready? 2. No, wait, we forgot the present. Get that, and you have everything you need. Spread the fabric on the ground and put your gift on top 3. Fold the fabric around the gift you are wrapping 4. With the last little bit, you don't tuck it under, but create a little flap on top 5. Fold that flap over like this 6. Take one end of the parcel and tuck the fabric inside, BEHIND the gift inside 7. You can take your time to wiggle it all inside. Make it as flat as you can 8. Once it is all inside, turn to the other end and do the same thing again 9. When you have done both ends, it should look like this. Your present is all tucked up inside and you don't need any tape to keep it closed 10. Now for the ribbon. Place the gift on top of it 11. Tie the bow 12. So it looks like this. Finished? If you want a gift tag, that comes now. If you don't you're done! 13. Cut a piece out of an old cardboard box and make a hole in it using a hole punch. Watch your fingers though ;) 14. Put a piece of short ribbon through your hole 15. Tie the tag to your gift 16. And you are finished! P.S. You can either ask your friend to reuse the fabric, and show them how to wrap with it, or if they don't like that idea, you can take it home with you to use again the next time. And remember, you don't have to buy the fabric. You can use an old pillow case, an old t-shirt or skirt, or whatever you want. You can even make your ribbon from an old t-shirt if you don't have any. Happy wrapping.",
        "generated_story": "How to Wrap a Present Without Using Paper or Tape In order to wrap a present without using paper or tape, you must wrap it in a paper towel. This method is easy to use, but it can be difficult to do without paper and tape. It's also not as easy as it sounds. You have to be careful with the material you're going to put on the paper, tape or whatever else you want to stick to. That's why it's important to make sure you don't stick your finger in the middle of the wrapping paper. If you do, then you'll need to tape it to the edges. Then you can wrap the wrap around the present and put it on top of it. After all, that's how you wrap your present, right? That\u2019s the way it should be wrapped. The paper is the glue, and the tape is what you use to hold the presents together. When you put them together, they are ready to go. They just need a little bit more time to dry and they will be ready for the next day. And then they can put the packaging back on. There is no need for paper towels, so you just wrap them in plastic and then put a tape over them. Once you have wrapped everything up, it will look like this: Paper towels are used for wrapping. Tape is used to seal everything. Paper is also used as a sealant, which means that it doesn't adhere to any material. In other words, paper will not be able to stay in place for long periods of time. \"Paper towels\" are not a good solution to this problem, because they're too thick and too thin. But they do hold up a lot of information. For example, there's the fact that paper has a tendency to break down into smaller pieces, making it more difficult for people to see what they want. So, we use tape instead."

        "target": "European court overturns law requiring German-language skills for spouse visas The European Court of Justice has overturned a German law requiring foreign spouses from certain non-EU countries to take a language test before receiving a visa. The ruling primarily affects Germany's Turkish minority. The European Union's highest court on Thursday ruled in favor of a Turkish citizen, who was denied a visa to live in Germany with her husband, because she was illiterate and therefore unable to demonstrate basic German-language skills. According to the court, a lack of language skills shouldn't automatically lead to the rejection of an entry visa application. Instead, Germany must consider the unique circumstances of each individual case. The court went on to say that quickly granting visas for spouses improves the quality of life and promotes the integration of foreign residents. Specifically addressing the case of the Turkish plaintiff, the court ruled that the rejection of her visa had violated a bilateral treaty between Turkey and the EU. In 1970, Brussels and Ankara agreed not to tighten their residency laws for each other's citizens. Law only applies to some In 2007, Germany introduced the requirement that spouses from certain non-EU countries must demonstrate a basic grasp of German before being granted a visa to live in Germany with their husbands or wives. Spouses affected by the law are required to obtain a basic language certificate from recognized centers, such as Germany's Goethe Institute, proving that they have an A1 level, or \"Beginning German\" language ability. The German government claims that the goal of the language requirement is to prevent forced marriages as well as marriages made simply for the sake of obtaining a visa. Citizens of European Free Trade Association (EFTA) member states are exempt from the language requirement. That includes Iceland, Lichtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. In addition, citizens of Australia, Canada, Israel, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea and the United States also don't have to demonstrate German-language skills. slk/xx (AFP, AP, dpa, KNA)",

The court said the law violated the rights of spouses and children of EU citizens living in member states. \"The European court of justice has ruled that German and Turkish spouses should be able to work together in Germany,\" the EJ said in a statement released by the Goethe Institute, a German-language research institute, in Brussels. It added that the new law, which was approved in 2007, would not be applied to spouses of members of the EU's 28-member bloc. However, the court did not rule on the case, saying it was \"incompatible with the principles of freedom of speech and the rule of law.\" The decision came after a dispute between Germany and Turkey over a bill that would have made it easier for Turkish citizens to enter the bloc without having to sign up to German or Turkish passports. Turkey and Germany have long been at loggerheads over the issue, with Germany being the only EU member state not to have its own passport. Germany, however, is one of a handful of countries that have signed on to the bill, along with Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan and South Korea. Both countries have their own passports and passports, but Germany has not yet ratified the legislation. Slk/xx (AFP, AP, dpa, KNA)"

        "target": "Bayern Munich coast to win over Nuremberg Bayern Munich wrapped up the 12th Bundesliga match day with an easy win over Nuremberg. Freiburg scored an extra time goal to squeak out a victory against Hoffenheim. Bayern Munich cruised to a 3-0 victory at home against Bavarian rival FC Nuremberg on Sunday, closing the German soccer tables for the weekend. Striker Mario Gomez got things going in the 10th minute for Bayern and also scored the final goal in the 75th minute off a corner kick from Franck Ribery. Ribery came on as a substitute five minutes earlier, making his first appearance for the team since injuring his ankle in September. Near the end of the match, Gomez had an opportunity for his third goal on a penalty kicked but missed. Thirty points at break Phillipp Lahm successfully converted a penalty kick in the 57th minute to round out the scoring for Bayern. The victory for Bayern moved them into sixth place in the table with 19 points and has continued a slow shift in momentum following a rough start to the season. Bayern coach Louis van Gaal said after the game he hoped his team would have 30 points by the end of the first half of the season in five more matches. Cisse saves win for Freiburg In Sunday's other Bundesliga match, Senegal striker Papiss Demba Cisse broke a scoreless deadlock with a goal in the 91st minute to give Freiburg a 1-0 win over Hoffenheim. Cisse has now scored 10 goals in 12 games and is currently the Bundesliga's second highest scorer. The win moves Freiburg into fourth place in the table with 21 points, one ahead of Frankfurt in fourth and three behind Bayer Leverkusen and Mainz, in second and third place, respectively. Nuremberg drop to 10th place with 18 points at the end of a very tight middle group. Just three points separate Nuremburg from Freiburg. Hoffenheim also have 18 points but are two places ahead of Nuremberg in eighth place on goal difference. Author: Matt Zuvela (dpa, sid) Editor: Sean Sinico",
        "generated_story": "Bayern Munich 3-0 Hoffenheim: Papiss Demba Cisse seals crucial win for Bayern Munich The German side came from behind to beat FC Nuremberg in the Bundesliga on Sunday to secure a third consecutive win in September. The visitors, led by Mario Gomez, came back from a goal down to score a second goal in as many games as they could, but it wasn't enough for the Bavarian side to take the lead at the top of the table. It was Bayern's first Bundesliga win since the end of September, and it was their first in over a year. They had to settle for a 2-1 win at home to Bayern, who have been on a tear in recent weeks after losing their last two games. \"It was a great win,\" said Bayern coach Philipp Lahm, whose side have won three of their past four league games, including a trip to the Champions League final last month in Germany's top-flight. But it's not just Bayern who are on the brink of a repeat of last season's title run, they are also on course for their fourth consecutive Bundesliga title in a row. In the first half, Bayern dominated possession in front of goal, scoring three times in their opening four matches. After that, however, the visitors came out on top, thanks to a quick counter-attack from the home side's Mario Gomes. On the other hand, Hoffenerheim's Franck Ribery came off the bench to give his side an early lead, only to be thwarted by a free kick by the Bayern striker. A few minutes later, it looked as if the hosts were going to pull off a miracle, as the German striker scored his first goal for his club. He was on his way to scoring a brace in his last match with the club, where he has been a regular starter since joining from Bayer Leverkusen in August. His goal was the most important of his career, though, because he was able to put the game out of reach with a powerful finish. German coach Louis van Gaal's side, meanwhile, were unable to find the net after the break and were forced to make do with only a handful of substitutions. That was not the case at all against the Wolfsburg squad, which had been the favorites to win the league for three seasons running. However, he did have a couple of key moments to show for it. Defensively, his presence was crucial in this match, especially in midfield, with his ability to get the ball into the box and finish off crosses. And he showed why he's such an important part of this Bayern team. Author: Matt Zuvela (dpa, sid) Editor: Sean Sinico"

        "target": "Slovaks accused of spying in Iran released Six Slovak paragliders detained in Iran since May on suspicion of spying have been released. They were originally arrested for taking photographs of restricted areas. Slovak citizens detained by the Iranian authorities on suspicion of taking photographs out of bounds have returned home, said Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico. Eight people in total were arrested in May after taking photographs of restricted areas. A Slovakian news website said the group was detained near the central city of Isfahan, where Iran has nuclear facilities. The six that have been freed attended a news conference held by Prime Minister Fico in the capital, Bratislava on Sunday. Fico told reporters that the government was working to secure the release of the remaining two paragliders who are stiil in custody. \"Negotiations were fair and their result is the release of six out of eight detainees,\" Fico was quoted as saying on the government's website. He added that Slovakia had not made any \"financial commitments\" in the negotiation process. Detainees 'unaware' of rule-breaking One of the released paragliders, Vladislav Frigo, said the group did not break any rules it was aware of. \"We had information that there was a ban on taking photographs below the height of 2,300 metres. We were taking pictures from higher (altitudes),\" said Frigo. He added that the detainees were well treated, had access to television, a refrigerator and could cook for themselves as well as getting regular meals. Foreign nationals accused of spying In recent years, Iran has levelled accusations of espionage against both foreign nationals and Iranians. Two U.S. citizens - Josh Fattal and Shane Bauer - were sentenced to eight years in jail for spying after being arrested while hiking along the Iraq-Iran border in 2009. They denied espionage - neighbouring Oman helped secure their release in 2011 by posting bail of 1-million US dollars (756,000 euros). Last year, Iranian-American Amir Hekmati was sentenced to death for spying for the CIA, but judges overturned the decision and ordered a retrial. lw/ipj (Reuters, dpa)",
        "generated_story": "Slovak paragliders released by Iranian authorities Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico has been released from prison on suspicion of spying in Iran. The move comes a day after the head of Slovakia's intelligence agency, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), was arrested in the Iranian city of Isfahan on Sunday. Slovaks have long been suspicious of Iranian officials, and the CIA said it was looking into whether they were involved in spying for the U.S. in Iraq. \"We are aware of the allegations made against the prime minister,\" the agency said in a statement, adding that it would not comment on specific cases. FICO, who was in Bratislava at the time of his arrest, had previously denied any involvement in Iranian spying. In May, he said he had been in contact with Iranian intelligence agents, but that he did not know if they had any information about his whereabouts. On Sunday, Slovakia announced the release of a total of seven Slovakers, including two Iranians, three Iranians and a paragulider. They were released on the condition that they do not reveal their identities or provide any other details about their activities, according to a source close to the investigation. Slovakia has also been accused of providing Iran with fake passports and other documents to cover up its spying activities. Last month, a US court in New York convicted a group of Iranians of espionage and sentenced them to life in prison without parole. A court also found them guilty of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering, which could amount to up to 1.5 million euros ($1.6 million). The charges stem from allegations that the Iranians had used the passports to travel to Iran in 2009 and 2010, when the country was still under Saddam Hussein's watch. At the end of last year, Iran agreed to extradite the men to face charges of conspiring to overthrow the government and commit crimes against humanity. But the charges were later dropped, with prosecutors saying they could not prove the accusations were politically motivated."

        "target": "French presidential debate does little to woo undecided voters This year's French presidential race is perhaps the most closely watched election in recent history. Many voters are still undecided, including those in the Paris caf\u00e9 where DW's Jake Cigainero saw the latest TV debate. Just over two weeks ahead of the first round of voting in France's presidential election, all 11 candidates met for the second televised debate of the campaign. It was the first time in the history of French elections that the entire official ballot shared a television stage. This race for the Elysee is perhaps the most closely watched election in the history of the Fifth Republic in view of conservative candidate Francois Fillon's embezzlement charges, the deterioration of the left, political amateur Emmanuel Macron's surprise surge to the top, and the rise of Marine Le Pen's National Front. With so much media attention on the five main candidates, Tuesday's debate felt almost like a consolation for the six other candidates rarely in the spotlight. For French voters watching the televised debate at Cafe des Phares on Place de la Bastille, the saturated stage kept the candidates from detailed discussion of pressing issues. For those who are still undecided, the debate did little to bring them closer to choosing their pick for president. Vincent Couronne, a researcher, said it was good to see candidates who don't get as much media attention. However, 11 candidates at once for the political spectator was overkill. \"It wasn't very interesting. It's just one position after another. There's no real debate. It's not like when it was just five candidates.\" Boredom all round Charlotte Theuvenin and her friends, all students in their early 20s, tuned out early on from boredom and exasperation. \"It was too flat and too hypocritical. Fillon and Le Pen play with our money, then say they did nothing and that they are good for our country,\" she said. As though addressing the candidates in front of her on the TV screen, she added, \"How dare you talk about being president when you use our money for your own interests.\" Le Pen had come under fire over accusations that she misused public funds to pay bodyguards as parliamentary assistants. Francois Fillon of Les Republicains, meanwhile, is under investigation for allegedly paying family members more than 1 million euros ($1.1 million) for government work they never carried out. Frequently casting a blank stare at his opponents, Fillon also seemed bored, or at least more subdued compared to the first debate. Couronne said, \"Fillon seems to be not there. Probably because he knows all the small candidates can attack him on the criminal offenses he's accused of.\" Debate watchers cited Europe as the most important issue of this election, with many fearing Le Pen's promise to tear France out of the European Union in a so-called Frexit. Though no one at the cafe vocally supported Le Pen's plan, several acknowledged the EU is a pressure point for France. \"France's place in Europe in relation to Germany is a very important issue,\" said student Thibault Cirier. \"The general problem is France has lost its influence at the European level over the years, and that needs to be remedied, because France is one of the founders of Europe and should have a strong place in the union. The EU is also important for cohesion and to have a strong position internationally.\" Caf\u00e9 viewers say no to Le Pen Cirier was initially excited by Macron when he launched his campaign, but ultimately decided there was no substance. Now he says he will probably vote for far-left candidate Jean-Luc Melenchon. Kevser Taspinar also said she liked Melenchon for his fighting spirit and that \"he throws barbs.\" As a practicing Muslim who wears a headscarf, she said the most important issue for her is laicite, France's state institution of secularism. \"For me Hamon has the best interpretation of this. Maybe Hamon,\" Taspinar said hesitating. \"I'm still undecided, because there's Melenchon.\" Another viewer, Marie Dubois, said that although she really liked Melenchon, she had definitively decided on Macron. \"Melenchon has a way of putting humanity in politics and giving hope,\" she said. \"But Macron is the only possible candidate.\" With polls putting Le Pen and Macron in the second round on May 7, the undecided voters at this Paris cafe said they were certain which candidate they would not for vote for in that scenario. \"Definitely Macron. There is no way I am going to vote for Le Pen,\" Theuvenin said. \"I will never vote for that woman or Front National, no matter who is running against them in the second round.\" Tuesday was the final debate for Macron and Melenchon, two of the crowd-pleasers among the candidates. Both have pulled out of the third debate on grounds that it cuts too close to the first vote just two days later on April 23.",
        "generated_story": "French political amateur takes aim at Macron, Le Pen In a video interview with DW's Jake Cigainero, French student Thibault Cirier talks about the far-right National Front (NFP) candidate, Emmanuel Macron. \"I don't think the NFP is going to be able to win the election,\" he says, referring to the right-wing party's candidate for the French presidency, Francois Fillon, who is seeking a second term in the presidential election. The election is expected to take place on May 7, with the first round of voting set to begin on April 23. In the second round, the candidates will face off against each other in front of a packed crowd of thousands of supporters. On the day of the vote, Macron will be facing a tough challenge from the left-of-center, which has traditionally been a strong supporter of his own party. He will have to fend off a conservative challenger, Jean-Luc Melenchon, for a majority of seats in parliament. His party, Les Republicains (Le Pen's party), is currently in second place in a field of five candidates. It is not clear who will win, but it is clear that Macron is the favorite of many voters, and that he has a good chance of winning the nomination. But he is far from being the only candidate who has made it clear he will not back down from his current position. At the same time, his campaign has been criticized by some quarters for its lack of transparency in its dealings with French politicians. Some of those critics accuse him of being a \"political amateur\" who doesn't know enough about French politics to make up his mind. Others say he should be allowed to stay in politics, as long as he does not commit to any kind of \"radical\" political agenda. However, others argue that the candidate should stay on the sidelines and focus on other issues, such as immigration and social justice. They say that if he were to step down as president, he would face a lot of criticism from within the party and from outside the political establishment. This is a view shared by students at the Ecole Polytechnique in Paris, where he works as a professor of political science and is also a member of France's Socialist Party (PSF). \"He is an amateur,\" one student told DW in an interview published on Tuesday. Another student, Kevser Taspinar, said he was \"very disappointed\" by Macron's victory, adding that it was not enough for him to stand for re-election."

        "target": "German Interior Ministry Claims Progress on Crime Interior Minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble released his department's official statistics concerning crime in 2006 in Berlin on Tuesday. And the news was good -- most of the numbers were down compared to the preceding year. Germany's streets were never particularly dangerous, but according to the Interior Ministry, they are now safer than at any time since statistics have been collected. Reported criminal offenses on the whole dropped by 1.4 percent over 2005 -- to a total of just over 6.3 million. \"The statistics show reductions in crime among children, adolescents and teenagers, as well as adults,\" said Sch\u00e4uble. He added that criminality among foreigners living in Germany also fell, saying that this development reflected Germany's efforts to integrate non-Germans. Drugs offenses were down 7.8 percent, followed by theft and street crime, which both declined by four percent or more. Youth violence Vandalism, on the other hand, was up 5.9 percent. Fraud rose slightly, as did violent crime -- among young people by an alarming 4.5 percent. Berlin Interior Minister Erhart K\u00f6rting said that was part of a decade-long trend in Germany. \"As many experts have pointed out,\" K\u00f6rting said, \"the potential for violence in society is increasing.\" The head of the German Police Officers' Union Konrad Freiberg also said those figures showed that German society was not truly getting safer. Frankfurt tops most-dangerous list Crime was down in Frankfurt am Main, but it's still the German city with the greatest number of criminal offenses person 100,000 people. Hanover was a close second, followed by D\u00fcsseldorf, Bremen and Berlin. The total percentage of criminal cases solved by German police also improved slightly from 55 to 55.4 percent. According to the study, Germany's safest place was Bergisch Gladbach, a city of 100,000 inhabitants in the west of the country -- coincidentally, model Heidi Klum's home town.",
        "generated_story": "German Police Union: State of Crime in Germany The German Police Officers' Union (DFU) has released a report on the state of crime in the country. The report, published on Tuesday, shows that the police force has become a \"state of the union.\" The police union, which represents police officers in Berlin, Frankfurt am Main and Bremen, has been calling for an end to the use of excessive force and the elimination of all forms of violence. \"The police forces are no longer able to carry out their duties without the help of a police officer,\" said German Interior Minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble at a press conference in Frankfurt, Germany. He added that \"there is a need for a change in our society and we have to make sure that this change is not a result of an increase in police violence.\" \"We are not going to allow this to happen again,\" he said, adding that he would like to see \"a change that will not only lead to a rise in crime, but also a shift in society's attitude towards the rule of law.\" Germany's highest crime rate in 2006 was 6.6 percent, down from 7.7 percent in 2005. In 2006, the rate of increase was 9.5 percent. Since then, it has risen to 12.4 percent and is expected to reach 15 percent by the end of this year, according to data from the Federal Statistics Office (FOSU). Police union leader Konrad Freiberg, who has led the fight against crime since 2005, said he was \"very happy\" with the results. However, he added, \"I am not happy that we are now at the point where we need to do something about it, because we don't have the resources to deal with it. We have a lot of work ahead of us, and I think we can do a better job than we did when we first came to this country.\" Police officers' union president Heidi Klum said she was concerned about the lack of cooperation between police, prosecutors and prosecutors. She also said that there was an \"unacceptable level of hostility\" between the two sides. Police unions have been fighting for years for the right to free and fair treatment of criminals, she said. They have also called for greater transparency and transparency in how police conduct their work and how they conduct themselves. Last week, Berlin police chief Erhart K\u00f6rting announced that they would be launching an investigation into the misuse of force in their city of D\u00fcsseldorf."

        "target": "All or nothing for Bayern in Champions final Bayern Munich have one last chance to salvage a season that has otherwise been marked by their inability to beat Borussia Dortmund: a win against Chelsea in the Champions League final at their home stadium. All season long, Bayern Munich have been consumed with achieving one goal: reaching the final of the Champions League, held at their own Allianz Arena in Munich, and raising the trophy in front of their home fans. After finishing a distant second place to Dortmund in the Bundesliga and dismally losing to them 5-2 in the German Cup final, Bayern Munich are in a must-win situation Saturday against Chelsea. A loss would be the final straw in a disappointing season for a team that can't stand second place. A win for Bayern would mean redemption, to some extent, for their shortcomings in the league. Key players were rested down the stretch in the Bundesliga, especially before the two legs of Bayern's European semifinal against Real Madrid. That was an indication that Bayern had given up on the league and put all their eggs in one basket, hoping for a big payoff with the Champions League title. The same can be said for the German Cup final against Dortmund: true, Bayern essentially beat themselves by making mistake after mistake, but Bayern could, if they win Saturday, wipe the slate clean. Saving the season Win this match, and all will be forgiven in Munich. Lose, and it will be Bayern's second straight season without a piece of hardware, not to mention the heartbreak of losing the biggest match at Allianz Arena since it opened in 2005. \"We must not even think about [losing],\" said Bayern's Franck Ribery on Thursday. \"If we win the Champions League, then we can forget about not winning the league or the cup, nobody will care about that.\" Bayern are a team that thrives under pressure, and the high stakes of this match will be good for them. Chelsea are a team that showed in their semifinal upset of Barcelona that they can rise to a challenge, even if that challenge is simply holding on against a superior opponent. \"We are not the favorites of the game, we are playing away,\" Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech said on Thursday. \"It is very rare when you have the home team playing in the home stadium, using the home dressing room, so I think the advantage goes to Bayern Munich because of that. But we know we have a chance and we will fight for it.\" But this match will come down to the team that can better take advantage of holes that have been blown in each team's defense due to injuries and suspensions. Filling the gaps Between the two sides, seven starting players will miss out on the final. Chelsea saw Raul Meireles, Ramires, and Branislav Ivanovic each get their third yellow card in the second leg against Barcelona, and captain John Terry was given a straight red. Terry and Ivanovic are fixtures on Chelsea's backline, which was already at half-strength due to hamstring injuries suffered by Gary Cahill and David Luiz. Chelsea coach Roberto di Matteo hopes those two are fit enough for the final, since Chelsea will need all the help they can get in the back. For Bayern, David Alaba and Holger Badstuber - both defenders - and Luiz Gustavo, a defensive midfielder, are also suspended for picking up three yellow cards. The impact of the suspensions will hit Chelsea the most. In addition to a weakened back line, Meireles and Ramires are mainstays on offense, supporting strikers Didier Drogba or Fernando Torres. With Ramires out, Drogba could start as striker, with Torres moving to the wing. At any rate, there is more uncertainty in The Blues' lineup than there is in Bayern's, who will be able to rely on striker Mario Gomez and the dynamic-duo of Arjen Robben and Ribery on the wings as they have all season. Most of the question marks will still be defensive for both teams, but to think that this is an indication of a high-scoring affair on Saturday would be a discredit to both team's last lines of defense. Between the posts Neither side would be competing in the final if it wasn't for the heroics of the teams' keepers. Cech defended against wave after wave of attacks from Barcelona in the semifinal for Chelsea, and Manuel Neuer showed nerves of steel in Bayern's penalty shootout in the final leg against Real Madrid, blocking penalties from Madrid stars Cristiano Ronaldo and Kaka. Chelsea's best shot will be to come out of the gate at a sprint and gain an early advantage against Bayern, who will be doing everything they can to keep their long-cultivated dream-final in their control. Otherwise, Bayern's determination to salvage their season may be enough to carry them through to the trophy ceremony - at home, just like they planned it.

        "generated_story": "Borussia Dortmund vs Bayern Munich Preview: The Blues vs. The Bavarians The German Cup final is set to be played in Munich on Saturday. It will be the first match between the two sides in the history of the club's history. Manchester United's David Luiz and Real Madrid's Franck Raul Meireles are among the favorites to win the Champions League this season. They are the only two teams who have yet to qualify for next year's competition, and they will have to wait until the end of next season for their chance to make it back to the top flight. That's a tough task for the Blues, who are hoping to avoid a repeat of last season's title-winners. But they have a good chance of doing just that. After all, they are only one point away from reaching the final. And that's not a bad result for a team that has been on the brink of relegation for some time now. \"We are in a position where we can't afford to lose,\" said coach Roberto di Matteo, referring to his side's last-gasp win over Barcelona in 2005. Bayern, meanwhile, are looking to get back on track with a win in their last two games. Coach Manuel Neuer's side have already clinched the Bundesliga title, but it's still a long way to go before they can reach the last four. In the group stage, Bayern are expected to face the likes of Real, Barcelona, Real and Bayern. At the Allianz Arena on Thursday night, the German champions will take on Bayern in an all-German final, with the goal difference between Bayern and Borussia set at 0-0. For the hosts, it was a dream come true, as they were able to take advantage of Bayern's superior quality in midfield and the fact that they had two top-notch goalkeepers on hand to help them win their second title in as many years. However, there is still the question of who will start and who is going to start. Who is the best goalkeeper in Germany? Author: Matt Zuvela Editor: Rina Goldenberg"

He allegedly possessed and exchanged \"a large quantity\" of child pornography. A high-ranking Vatican diplomat will face trial in the Holy See on charges of possessing child pornography in the US and Canada. Catholic priest Carlo Alberto Capella was indicted on Saturday after a Vatican investigation found he had allegedly possessed and exchanged \"a large quantity\" of child pornography during his diplomatic posting. His trial will start on June 22 in front of a Vatican magistrate. If convicted, he could be sentenced to between one and five years in prison and fined between \u20ac2,500 and \u20ac50,000 ($2,100 to $42,000). He is being held in the city's police barracks. Read more: Australian archbishop becomes most senior cleric convicted of hiding abuse Diplomatic immunity The monsignor was recalled from the Washington embassy after US authorities alerted the Vatican to his alleged crimes and requested his diplomatic immunity be stripped. The church rejected the request and withdrew him in September to face investigation at home. Shortly afterwards, Canadian authorities issued an arrest warrant for allegedly possessing and distributing child pornography while visiting a church in Canada. The Capella case has hampered the Catholic Church's attempts to move on from its myriad of pedophile priest scandals. There has been particular focus in recent months on the Chilean branch of the Catholic Church ignoring and covering up of child abuse by pedophile priest Fernando Karadima during the 1980s and 1990s. Pope Francis wrote a letter to Chileans last week expressing \"shame\" for the affair despite previously defending one of the main alleged offenders behind the cover-up. The Vatican's third-highest ranking official, Cardinal George Pell, is facing trial in Australia on abuse-related charges. aw/kms (AFP, Reuters, dpa)",

The charges stem from allegations that he sexually abused children under the age of 13. Cardinal Carlo Alberto Capell, who was arrested in Canada on June 22, faces charges of child abuse and child endangerment. He is accused of sexually abusing children between 1980 and 1990. In a letter to Pope Francis, the cardinal said he was \"deeply troubled\" by the allegations. \"I am deeply troubled by what I have seen in the media,\" the letter said, adding that the Vatican had asked him to step down from his position as archbishop of Chile and Australia, where he had been serving as a priest since 1980. It was not immediately clear whether the charges were related to the accusations against the priest, but Vatican spokesman George Pell said in a statement on Saturday that they were not related at the time of the alleged abuse. A Vatican official said the case was being investigated as part of an ongoing Vatican investigation into allegations of sex abuse by priests in Chile, Canada, Australia and the US. Vatican officials have said they are aware of allegations made by former archdiocesan priests of having sexual contact with minors, including those of a pedophile and a former priest who had sex with a minor. Last year, Vatican prosecutors announced they would seek to extradite the accused priest to a US court. Aw/kms (AFP, Reuters, dpa)"

The money is to come from the Russian pensions system. Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov unveiled a plan Monday aimed at creating a \"multi-billion-dollar\" funding vehicle for companies hit by Western sanctions. Moscow-based news agency RIA quoted Siluanov as saying that the emergency fund would be set up next year with money originally earmarked for the State Pension Fund and leftover funds from this year's budget. According to RIA, Moscow was planning to devote \"at least 100 billion roubles\" (2 billion euros) to the fund, which will mainly be aimed at helping cash-starved Russian banks and key oil companies. \"These 100 billion roubles will be added to the reserve next year, which will allow us to help companies,\" RIA quoted Siluanov as saying. \"We are planning to create a reserve of significant size.\" Just last week, the European Union and the United States imposed a third round of sanctions on Moscow for Russia's involvement in the Ukraine conflict. The latest sanctions target the Russian banking sector as well as key energy firms and arms manufacturers. As one of several companies that have asked for government help, Russia's oil giant Rosneft said it would need 1.5 trillion roubles ($39.70 billion) in aid to keep exploring for oil. Siluanov also told RIA news agency that the decision to stop transferring money to the Pension Fund would hand the budget an extra 309 billion roubles. It will be the second year running that Moscow has stopped transfers of funds from the budget to the Pension Fund, which provides benefits for Russia's pensioners, some invalids and families who have lost their breadwinners. uhe/nz (Reuters, RIA)",

        "target": "Heidi hits the Big Screen Heidi, the world famous girl from the Swiss Alps who first appeared in a novel 121 years ago, has hit the big screen in a fresh look. A century after the death of Heidi inventor Johanna Spyri, the lovable Alpine heroine is being portrayed in a new film which replaces grassy slopes and mountainous range with city skyscrapers and city streets. The $ 3.5 million \"Heidi\", funded by the Z\u00fcrich-based film company Vega and directed by German film maker Markus Imboden, is to be launched in Germany on Thursday. The making of the film was one of the highlights of a past year of events including exhibitions, lectures and fireworks celebrating the July 7 2001 centenary of the death of Spyri, whose novel \"Heidi\" sold 20 million copies and has been translated in 50 languages worldwide. It is thought to be one of the most successful books of all times. The book has inspired 17 films, including Shirley Temple\u2019s Oscar winning portrayal of Heidi in 1937 and a Japanese cartoon series. Imboden\u2019s remake is the 18th \"Heidi\" film. Blue hair in Berlin According to Vega, \"the film was transmitted to today\u2019s world without losing sight of the original novel\". But Imboden\u2019s new movie is far from the charming original, with its rosy-cheeked, curly-headed Heidi, delicate Clara and goat-tending shepherd Peter\u2019s frail old grandmother. In the first film, Heidi, who lives happily with her grandfather in a tiny hut in the Swiss Alps is plucked from her contented life by her Aunt Dete to live in a stiff, rich family in the bustling metropolis, Frankfurt. Heidi becomes so home-sick, she starts to sleepwalk and is eventually sent home. But not before she causes confusion in the otherwise prim household and brings laughter in the life of the disabled and homely, Clara. The Heidi in the latest film has blue hair, surfs the net and roams the streets of Berlin. Friend and shepherd Peter sheds his rustic pastimes and whizzes down streets on his mountainbike. Clara is not the weak, lame young girl of the Spyri novel, but a moody Britney Spears wannabe. Aunt Dete is a modern-day stylist living fashionably in the German capital. The new surroundings are a far cry from the tranquil days of cow milking, goat- tending and flower-plucking in the verdant meadows of the Swiss Alps. Transforming the Heidi myth According to a Berlin daily, the remake is a \"refreshing Heidi\", adding that the script writers had managed to transform the Heidi \"myth\" into an independent, self-assured girl and not into a \"transfigured mountain heroine\". However, it is just this portrait of a naive and charming alpine heroine that has made Heidi so popular all over the world. Heidi has become a well-known Swiss brand worldwide. Some 60,000 tourists \u2013 half from Japan \u2013 are said to visit the picturesque wine-growing village in Graubuenden, which boasts the original Heidi House and other Heidi related attractions such as winding mountain trails and pastures. Imboden\u2019s film, which is to be launched in Germany on Thursday, will also open elsewhere in Europe, and may reach fans in Japan and South Korea too. Whether Imboden\u2019s blue-haired, computer savvy Heidi will charm her Asian viewers, however, remains to be seen.",
        "generated_story": "The Remake of Heidi in the Swiss Alps The film \"Heidi\" is based on a novel by German writer Johanna Spyri. The novel is about a German shepherd named Heidi, who was born in 1937 in Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland. In the novel, Heidi is named after a Swiss inventor who invented the term \"heidi.\" The German film maker Markus Imboden created Heidi for his film company Vega, and the film is set in Switzerland's Alpine village of Graubuenden. Heidi's story is told through the eyes of her German-born father, Peter. Her father is the inventor of the German word for sheep, which means \"shepherd\" in German. She is also the mother of German actress Britney Spears, whose father Peter was killed in a plane crash while she was on vacation in South Korea in July 2001. \"Sheidi is a beautiful woman with a great sense of humor and a big heart,\" Markus said in an interview with German news agency Welt am Sonntag, referring to Heidi as \"the German version of a shepherd.\" Heidi has been in Germany since 1937, when her father died of cancer and she moved to Switzerland to live with her mother and stepfather. After the death of Peter, she returned to Germany, where she spent the next three years living with Peter and his sister, Joanna, until she died in 2009. Now she is back in her native Germany and working as a freelance writer for the newspaper \"Der Spiegel\" and \"The New York Times.\" She has also written a book about her life and career, as well as her love of music and her interest in making music. It is not known how long Heidi lived there, but it is believed that she had a very long time to get used to it. When she finally moved back to the US in 2001, it was because she wanted to be closer to her family and friends. Since then she has lived in various states of undress, including Berlin, Frankfurt, Zurich and Frankfurt. But she's not the only one who's been inspired by Heidi. On the other hand, the author of \"Shirley Temple\" (1939-2001) has always been fascinated by the idea of making a film about an Asian woman who has become famous for her work on the cover of Shirley Temple's novel \"Aunt Clara,\" which she wrote and published in 2002. However, her new book, \"Himself,\" was not as popular with critics as its predecessor. Instead, critics and film makers have been calling for a movie about the Japanese woman's journey to find a cure for Alzheimer's disease, a disease that can be cured with medication. Critics have also called for more research into the disease and treatment of people with dementia, such as Parkinson's, stroke, dementia and cancer."

        "target": "Rethinking the term 'honor killing' The murder of 28-year-old Samia Shahid comes less than two weeks after Qandeel Baloch was killed by her brother. The media was quick to report them as \"honor killings.\" We have to rethink that term, writes Gouri Sharma. When news broke that Samia Shahid, a British-Pakistani woman, had been found dead while visiting relatives in Pakistan at the end of July, mainstream media outlets were quick to report it as an honor killing. It was the second time in two weeks that the media had reported a killing of a woman this way - the first being the murder of Pakistani social media star Qandeel Baloch. There are strong similarities between the cases. Both were murdered in places where they would have felt they were at their safest - in their family homes. It's likely they knew their killers - in Baloch's case, her brother has admitted to strangling her, and Shahid's father and cousin have already been questioned. And as more reports emerge about Shahid's death, it's clear that both were killed because they didn't behave in a way deemed acceptable in a conservative, patriarchal society. 'Deeply offensive' term The debate around terminology in \"honor killings\" isn't new, and after Baloch's murder there were members of the media - such as ABC Australia journalist Juanita Phillips - who decided against using the term, calling it \"deeply offensive\" and referring to it as a \"family killing\" instead. And there are outlets, like the Guardian, that already use inverted commas with the word honor. But some commentators argue that more needs to happen if media consumers are to gain a better understanding of the problem. \"I think an important step for the media would be to refuse to give weight to the term 'honor crimes,'\" said UK-based freelance journalist Shehnaz Khan. \"While it is imperative to highlight that these crimes and murders stem from the roots of misogyny and therefore a false sense of 'honor,' there is absolutely nothing but'shame' within them, as murder is nothing but dishonorable.\" \"The word 'honor' can sometimes carry an almost positive connotation that we are inclined to automatically accept just because it's not happening to us, when the reality is, this a huge problem affecting thousands of girls and women across the world,\" she added. Naming the issue But this isn't a view shared by all journalists. Ruby Hamad, a writer at Australia's Daily Life newspaper, said that the first step in dealing with the issue is naming it. \"There are some deeply patriarchal societies that still limit women's freedom according to old tribal concepts of honor, where, unfairly, the behavior of women reflect on their entire family,\" Hamad said. \"By naming these 'honor killings,' we are acknowledging the role that this misogynistic concept of honor plays, not only in the murders themselves but in these entire societies, and how it entraps both men and women.\" Through the eyes of the perpetrator? There are other issues with the term though. Some have argued that by framing it as such, media outlets are showing the crime through the eyes of the perpetrator - and not through the victim - as they should. And with such cases regularly hitting the headlines, framing is important. The United Nations estimates that around 5,000 women - predominantly from Asia and the Middle East - are killed annually in honor-related crimes, a figure that women's advocacy groups say is closer to 20,000 worldwide. This raises an important cultural element for the media to consider - how far does the term play into cultural stereotypes? \"When honor is considered the most important thing in life, then all family members become expendable,\" Hamad said. \"The collective outweighs the rights of the individual. Does this feed into cultural stereotypes? Perhaps. But that doesn't mean we should pretend that this cultural context isn't there.\" Looking for answers - and alternatives There have been many alternatives put forward by women's advocacy groups, including hate crime, misogynistic murder, femicide and shame killings. But which one should we pick? Al Jazeera for one has decided which one they won't use. \"We are always updating our style guidelines to convey a deeper and more authentic understanding of world affairs. Recent events in Pakistan ignited a healthy debate in Al Jazeera on the term 'honor killings' in particular. Our editors are currently studying alternatives to the term, but'misogynistic murder' is not one of them,\" said an Al Jazeera spokesperson. Terminology in the media matters, and for murders as complex as these, it's the media's responsibility to find a name that better fits the crime. Only then will it become easier to work towards a solution.",
        "generated_story": "Rethinking Honor Killings: A Cultural Perspective A social media star from the UK has written a book on the subject. Shehnaz Khan, a freelance journalist from Pakistan, was murdered in July in a house fire in the Pakistani city of Lahore. Her death shocked the world and sparked outrage across the globe. In her book, \"Honor Killers,\" the author describes her experience as a victim of \"honor killings\" in Pakistan. The book is set to be published by the United Nations in September. Read more: 'Honour killings' are a cultural phenomenon in Asia, says journalist Samia Shahid \"It's not just about the names of the victims, it's about how they're treated,\" she says. \"They're all victims of honor killings. They're people who have been killed by their own people, and they have to live with the consequences of their actions.\" In the case of Qandeel Baloch, who was killed in an apartment fire on July 24, the British-Pakistani journalist, Juanita Phillips, told the Daily Life newspaper that she and her family had been living in London for a year and a half, when she was attacked by a group of men who were trying to kill her. According to the report, she died of a heart attack and was rushed to hospital, where she later died. As well as the murder of her son, her sister and brother-in-law were also killed, according to a report by journalist Gouri Sharma. A 'cultural perspective' The report said that while the perpetrators were \"very well-known and respected, they also had a lot to learn from their victims,\" and that they had \"a lot of experience in dealing with these kinds of cases.\" But it also pointed out that it was not the first time that such a tragedy had taken place. It was the second time in as many years that a family member of one of Pakistan's most famous victims had died at the hands of an assailant. That's because the perpetrator was a Pakistani-born British citizen, but the victim was also a British Pakistani citizen. After all, he was born in England, so his father was an English-speaker. His mother was Pakistani and his grandmother was British. He was of Pakistani origin. When his family moved to Australia after his death, his mother and sister were born there. Their father died when they were just two years old. Since then, family members and friends have come to know each other in different ways, including through Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and other platforms."

        "target": "Myanmar Junta Announces Amnesty The junta in Myanmar, also known as Burma, announced an amnesty for more than 7,000 prisoners on Friday, including a few political detainees. The amnesty came on the 21st anniversary of the brutal crackdown of a student-led pro-democracy movement in 1988 and the subsequent seizure of power by the current junta. Journalists were invited to Yangon\u2019s notorious Insein prison on Friday as the authorities released the first batch of prisoners. At least 600 inmates were freed as part of an amnesty for over 7,000 inmates nationwide. Among those released in Yangon were two journalists and 25 political prisoners -- rights groups say this is only 1 percent of the total number of political prisoners held by the military regime. Maung Zarni, a research fellow at the London School of Economics, was \u201chappy for the prisoners who were part of the release\u201d. \u201cThis is a very positive personal development and I am happy they have been released but we need to understand that the junta is using the prisoners\u2019 release as a public relations exercise. It is the 21st anniversary of the military coup so they are using this as a way to pacify political discontent in the country.\u201d Amnesty comes ahead of next year\u2019s polls Myanmar's director general of prisons, Zaw Win, said that the prisoners had been freed so they could take part in next year's polls. In recent months, rights activists, pro-democracy activists and Western countries have cast doubt on the credibility of the planned elections as many key political activists are still in detention. This includes pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who recently began a new 18-month period of house arrest after being found guilty of violating her house arrest order in a widely condemned trial. \u201cThe whole Suu kyi trial is rather unlawful,\u201d said Zarni. \u201cBecause the country does not have an independent judiciary, the judges are just puppets who dance to the tune of the top leadership.\u201d Junta is holding on tightly In 1990, Suu Kyi\u2019s National League for Democracy won Myanmar\u2019s last general election by a landslide. But the junta never recognised the results and has since tightened its control over the country. The 2008 constitution, which was drafted and approved by the military generals, which guarantees the army 25 percent of parliamentary seats, is yet another sign of its desire to consolidate power. \u201cThe military is going to be in power for a long time,\u201d warns Zarni, \u201cbecause they have got control of all the political and economic institutions in the country as well as the entire state of Burma. So with or without elections, this is likely to remain the same.\u201d New Democratic Party formed Meanwhile, a new political party has been formed in Myanmar. The Democratic Party is headed by Mya Than Than Nu, who is the daughter of the country\u2019s first democratically-elected prime minister, U Nu. The party has proposed a power-sharing deal with the military, which would give 40 percent of power to politicians and 60 percent to the military rulers. Harn Yawnghwe, the director of the Brussels-based Euro-Burma Office, doubts the new party stands a chance: \u201cIt is possible that they they would be able to get some votes. But it is not likely, even if they were able to contest the elections freely, that they will be able to form a new government because the military is not prepared to let any party rule.\u201d Democrats should exploit elections He thinks the only way out for the democratic forces in Myanmar is to use the upcoming elections wisely and \u201cto take part in them even if they are against them. I think we have to look at the elections as a process which will lead to democracy -- maybe in few more years.\u201d The National League for Democracy has indicated that it will not take part in the polls unless all Myanmar\u2019s political prisoners, including Suu Kyi, are released. Suu Kyi\u2019s lawyers have filed an appeal against the extension of her house arrest and the court is expected to give a ruling on October 2. But few are hopeful that the junta will amnesty her anytime soon. Author: Disha Uppal Editor: Anne Thomas",
        "generated_story": "Amnesty for political prisoners in Myanmar's New Junta Author: Disha Uppal Editor: Anne Thomas Myanmar is calling for an end to the persecution of political detainees in the country's new junta. Maung Zarni, a member of the Euro-Burma Office in Brussels, has called on the government of Myanmar to abolish the death penalty. \"Myanmar is facing a new era of persecution,\" said Zaw Win, who heads the EU's Office for International Development (OIDA). \"It is time for a return to democracy and for the rule of law to be respected by the international community.\" The new regime, which has ruled Myanmar since the end of a five-decade military dictatorship in 1988, is expected to take power on October 2. The country has long been ruled by a military-backed civilian government, but the military has been unable to impose its own constitution. In the past few years, the army has imposed martial law and banned all political gatherings, including gatherings of journalists and political parties. But the new government has also banned the use of torture and other forms of violence against political opponents. On Friday, it announced that it would no longer allow the release of prisoners who have been convicted of crimes against humanity, such as murder, rape, torture, sexual abuse, and murder. It also announced plans to ban the sale of weapons of mass destruction (MMOs) to political groups and individuals with links to armed groups. Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) party said in a statement on Friday that the party would continue to use the term \"insane\" to refer to people who commit crimes committed during the regime's rule. According to U Nu, \"I don't see any reason why it shouldn't be used as a weapon of war against the Rohingya people.\" \"There is no justification for this,\" he said, adding that \"it is not the first time that a political prisoner is being held in jail.\" He added that he hoped the move would lead to a \"new normal\" for Myanmar, as it had been for many years. However, he also said that there was no evidence that Myanmar was ready to give up the right to self-determination and the rights of all people to live and work in accordance with their own rights and freedoms.\" A recent UN report found that more than 1.5 million people had died of hunger, disease and drug-related illnesses since 1990, compared to just 2 percent for all other ethnic groups, according to figures from the International Organization for Migration (IOM), a non-governmental organization that monitors the affairs of state and is part of an international network of human rights lawyers and lawyers working to fight for rights for millions of Rohingya. He also pointed out that many of those who died were women, children and even the elderly."

        "target": "A quarter of deaths caused by environmental degradation, says UN A new United Nations report warns that pollution and global warming are causing millions more deaths than conflicts. The UN's environment agency has called for an urgent roll-back on harmful substances and fossil fuels. In its report \"Healthy Environment, Health People,\" the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), the World Health Organization and several other environment organizations said that, in 2012, an estimated 12.6 million deaths were attributable to deteriorating environment conditions. The largest numbers of deaths took place in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific regions, followed by sub-Saharan Africa, where around a quarter of deaths were likely caused byair pollution, chemicals, climate change and a lack of access to sanitation. \"By depleting the ecological infrastructure of our planet and increasing our pollution footprint, we incur an ever-growing cost in terms of human health and well-being,\" said UNEP Executive Director Achim Steiner. He added that humanity's life support systems had been compromised by globalization and powerful economic interests. The report was released during UN climate talks in the German city of Bonn which are drawing up rules pertaining to the Paris agreement, which seeks to lower carbon emissions. The document suggested that several drivers were responsible for the threat to human health, including ecosystem disruption, climate change, inequality, unhealthy and wasteful lifestyles, along with unsustainable consumption and production. Worsening effects UNEP estimated that an extra 250,000 deaths could occur each year between 2030 and 2050 as a result of climate change, leading to malnutrition, malaria, diarrhea and heat stress. Between them air pollution and a lack of access to clean water and sanitation cause almost 8 million premature deaths each year. Environmental impacts are responsible for the deaths of more than one quarter of all children under the age of five, the report states. UNEP called for governments to act to remove harmful substances from working environments, reduce the use of carbon fuels and rely instead on renewable energy, and change lifestyles to allow a more sustainable use of the world's resources. The report also called for a bigger investment to protect the planet's natural ecosystem. UNEP predicted a further increase in emerging zoonotic diseases (spread between animals and humans), and called on developing countries, in particular, to prioritize prevention methods. \"Never before have so many animals been kept by so many people - and never before have so many opportunities existed for pathogens to pass through the biophysical environment and wild animals to livestock and people,\" the report warned.",
        "generated_story": "A quarter of deaths due to environmental degradation are linked to climate change, says UNEP The World Health Organization (WHO) has released a new report on the health of people living in developing countries. The report, published in the journal \"Healthy Environment, Health People\" (HEP), finds that more than half of the world's people are suffering from chronic diseases. According to a report released by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) in Bonn, Germany, the number has risen by a quarter since the Paris agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels was agreed to in Paris in 2012. \"We are seeing a dramatic increase in deaths from climate-related diseases, particularly in low-income countries,\" the report said. It also found that almost one-quarter of all deaths are attributable to high levels of greenhouse gases (GHG), which can be attributed to human activities such as deforestation, rising sea levels and the spread of infectious diseases like cancer and heart disease. This is the highest level of human-caused mortality since at least 1990, according to the WHO, and is expected to rise by 20 percent by 2050. However, it is not clear how many of these deaths will be linked directly to global warming, which is estimated to be around 1.5 to 2.6 billion people. In addition, there is a rise in mortality from people who live in high-traffic areas and who are unable to access clean drinking water. More than one in five people die from these diseases every year, with the most severe cases in sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, Africa and South Asia. A third of those deaths occur in extreme heat waves and floods, while the rest are caused by extreme weather events. Climate change is also a major cause of extreme poverty in many developing nations, including the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, South Korea, Taiwan and China. Environmental degradation also affects people's health and well-being. Global warming is predicted to increase by 2 to 3 degrees Celsius (4 to 6 degrees Fahrenheit) by 2030, compared with 2 degrees C for the same period last year. Experts warn that rising temperatures will lead to higher mortality rates and higher birth rates, leading to more deaths than ever before. But experts say that is unlikely to change as long as the global average temperature continues to fall and that the effects of climate changes are not as dramatic as they might have been in a few decades ago. So, what do you think? What are you going to do about it? Do you have any recommendations for how to deal with this problem? Are you prepared to take action? I don't think so. I think we will have to wait and see,\" said Achim Steiner, Executive Director at the UNDP."

Minister wants ban on meat names for plant-based foods Terms like \"vegan sausage\" and \"vegetarian schnitzel\" confuse consumers and need to be replaced, according to German Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt. He wants new names for plant-based dishes. Germans shouldn't be biting into a \"vegan sausage\" or cutting a slice of \"vegetarian schnitzel,\" German Minister for Food and Agriculture Christian Schmidt told the daily \"Bild\" newspaper on Wednesday, adding that names traditionally used for meat-based dishes should not be applied to plant-based foods. \"I don't want anyone to pretend that these pseudo-meat dishes are actual meat dishes,\" Schmidt said. The minister said manufacturers should come up with distinct names for plant-based meat-substitutes. Schmidt also said meat was part of a healthy and balanced diet and belonged on the menu in schools and kindergartens. Soy? Steak? Soy-steak? Schmidt's statements echo demands from the German Farmers Association and German Butchers Association. Both lobbying groups have asked for a ban on terms such as \"vegetarian ham\" or \"soy steak.\" Schmidt's call for plant-based foods to have their own name was also made in October in the state of Lower Saxony, a state with many large livestock farms. The German Vegetarian Association, however, argued against the proposal. A spokesperson for the organization said that \"names that are used for animal-based products should without a doubt also be legal to use for vegetarian substitute products.\" More meatless 'whatever-you-want-to-call-thems' The market for vegetarian and vegan dishes has grown steadily in the past few years in Germany, partly at the expense of the meat industry. According to a research paper by the Institute for the Study of Trade (IfH), revenue for vegetarian and vegan products in Germany was 454 million euros ($474 million) in 2015 and grew by more than 100 percent between 2010 and 2015.

According to the newspaper, the decision came after farmers in Lower Saxony, which is home to many of Germany\u2019s largest meat producers, complained that their products were not being used in the way they were supposed to be.

        "target": "Trudeau declares victory in Canada as Harper resigns Justin Trudeau of the Liberal Party has been elected Canada's new prime minister. Stephen Harper has stepped down as leader of the Conservatives after nine years in the top job. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper resigned as Conservative Party leader on Tuesday after the Liberals, led by Justin Trudeau, emerged victorious in legislative elections. \"I have spoken to Prime Minister Stephen Harper, and he has instructed me to reach out to the newly elected parliamentary caucus to appoint an interim leader,\" Conservative Party president John Walsh said in a statement. \"The people are never wrong,\" Harper said of his defeat. \"The disappointment is my responsibility and mine alone,\" Harper said, adding that he had called Trudeau to congratulate him. Trudeau calls for hopeful, diverse future In electing Trudeau, the charismatic son of a former popular prime minister, Canadian voters illustrated the growing discontent with nine years of Conservative rule that saw lowering of corporate taxes, avoidance of climate change legislation and disagreement with the Obama administration over the controversial Keystone XL pipeline. \"Canadians have spoken,\" Trudeau said, adding that he would be the man to lead the \"hopeful, positive\" country \"with a vision\" that they had asked for. In his victory speech, Trudeau said his government \"believed deeply in the diversity of our country,\" striking a contrast with the strain of nativism that had become apparent under Conservative rule. \"We beat fear with hope,\" said Trudeau, a 43-year-old former teacher. Liberals blow past projected results Projections ahead of the elections had Harper and Trudeau in a dead heat, but as polls closed on Monday night it became clear that the Liberals had won an outright majority, with a projected 175 of parliament's 338 seats. This represented a huge leap from four years ago when Liberals were handed their most crushing defeat in history with a mere 34 seats. Harper will stay on as a member of Parliament for his constituency, public broadcaster CBC reported, as he was re-elected to his seat. The left-leaning New Democratic Party had hoped to capitalize on its second-place finish in 2011, but only managed to come in third with CBC estimating that the party had garnered 32 seats. es/cmk (AP, Reuters) Have something to say?

Harper, who has been in office since 2011, announced on Monday that he would not seek re-election next year. The announcement came a day after Harper's Liberal Party announced that it would no longer nominate a candidate for the party's leadership in the upcoming federal election. \"I have decided that I will not run for another term,\" Harper said at a news conference in Ottawa, adding that his decision was \"not in my best interest.\" Harper had been a strong critic of President Barack Obama's controversial Keystone XL pipeline, which would have allowed the oil pipeline to cross the Canadian border into the United States. In a statement released on Tuesday, Harper also said he had no plans to seek a second term in Parliament. He said his party would continue to work with the federal government on the controversial project, but he did not rule out the possibility of a third term. His resignation comes as Canada prepares to elect a new leader in a parliamentary election due by the end of 2011. Obama has promised to introduce legislation to allow the construction of new pipelines in Canada. But Harper has repeatedly said that the pipeline is not a priority for his government, and he has not ruled out a possible run-off election in 2012. es/cmk (AP, Reuters)"

Meanwhile, US Secretary of State John Kerry has urged all parties to find a political solution to the conflict. \"We have made a decision that the cease-fire will begin this Tuesday, May 12, at 11.00 pm and will last for five days subject to renewal if it works out,\" Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir told a meeting of Gulf ministers in Paris on Friday alongside US Secretary of State John Kerry. The minister added that the cease-fire could be extended depending on the response from Yemen's Shiite Houthi rebels. Al-Jubeir said he hoped the Iran-backed rebels would \"come to their senses\" and agree to the truce. He urged them to stop fighting. \"We hope the Houthis will come to their senses and realize the interests of Yemen and the Yemeni people should be the top priority for everyone,\" he said. It is unclear whether the Houthis would reciprocate the Saudi gesture. \"The cease-fire will end should Houthis or their allies not live up to the agreement - this is a chance for the Houthis to show that they care about their people and they care about the Yemen people,\" the Saudi foreign minister emphasized. At this point, US Secretary of State John Kerry said anyone who cared about Yemeni people \"should take clear notice of the fact that a human catastrophe is building,\" adding that a cease-fire was \"not peace\" and that all parties must find a political solution to end the conflict. Kerry urged all sides to hold talks immediately. Saudi ultimatum Hours before the cease-fire announcement, Saudi Arabia declared a Houthi stronghold along its southern border a \"military target,\" giving an ultimatum to the residents to leave the area, Saudi state-run TV reported. Lately, the northern Yemeni province of Saada has become a battleground for the Shiite rebels and the Saud-led coalition forces as the Houthis carried out border attacks on nearby Saudi cities. More than 50 airstrikes hit Saada overnight and in the early hours of Friday morning, Yemeni officials said. A Saudi-led coalition of Arab states launched an air campaign against the Houthis on March 26. Riyadh accuses Tehran of backing the rebels, who have made significant territorial gains in the impoverished Middle Eastern country, capturing the capital Sanaa and ousting internationally recognized President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, who fled Yemen back in March. The Sunni Gulf states are wary of Iran's increasing influence in the region, and they see the Houthis' advance in Yemen as a move that threatens their regional and geopolitical interests. Over 1,200 people have been killed in Yemen since the start of the Saudi campaign, according to the United Nations. shs/bw (AFP, dpa, Reuters, AP)",

It was the first step in a six-month-long effort to reach an end to a conflict that has killed more than 2,000 people since the beginning of March, according to UN figures. A UN report released on Tuesday said that Yemen's war against Shiite rebels had killed at least 1,500 people and displaced thousands more.

The 71-year old can now leave the country for medical treatment. Brazilian judge Juliana Leal de Melo - who serves on a court overseeing amateur and professional sports - authorized the release of Hickey's passport upon payment of 1.5 million real ($435,000) bail. Hickey could now have medical treatment, the Rio state court system said in a statement. Reported to have a heart condition, Hickey was arrested three months ago during the Rio de Janeiro Olympics on ticket scalping charges. He is awaiting trial, though has not been imprisoned. Hickey has denied any wrongdoing. He is one of 10 people facing charges of ticket scalping, conspiracy and ambush marketing related to the Olympics. Hickey said he would fight \"each and every one\u201d of the Rio Games ticket-touting charges he faces. Hickey, who was also the head of the Olympic Council of Ireland, was released from custody last month, but must remain in Brazil until the case is heard. \"For clarity, I am not under house arrest as, like with so many things with this case, has been misreported by the media,\u201d Hickey said in a statement on Monday. Hickey was arrested on 10 August at a luxury beachfront hotel during the games. The authorities told Reuters last week that they believe the ring had operated for around eight years and was preparing for other Olympic events such as the 2020 Tokyo Games. jbh/bw (AP, AFP)",

The Brazilian president, Juliana Leal de Melo, said on Monday that she had been freed from jail after the trial. \"I was freed by the European Olympic Committee (EOC) on the condition that I cooperate fully with the investigation,\" said the head of the EOC, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the case. He added that he had no further comment at the time of his release. In a statement released Monday, Rio's president said he was \"very happy\" to have the charges dropped against him, adding that \"it was a great honor\" for him to be freed. A Brazilian court had earlier ruled that prosecutors had failed to prove that the defendant was guilty of a crime committed during the 2016 Rio Olympics, which took place in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff has called for an end to the trials of athletes who have been convicted of crimes against humanity (OOC). \"We are very happy that we are able to proceed with this trial,\" she said in a video posted on her official Twitter account.

        "target": "The Shift in Libya's Relations to the West The La Belle disco bombing in Berlin on April 5, 1986 was ruled to be Libya's doing. Twenty years later, relations between Libya and Europe have done an about-face. The Berlin disco \"La Belle\" was packed as usual on the night of April 5, 1986. Among its guests were many US soldiers, who were certainly not thinking of politics, the Middle East or strained relations between the United States and Libya. But reality caught up with them: a bomb detonated near the dance floor that night, killing two Americans and a Turkish woman. Over 200 people were injured. A Berlin court ruled that Libya and its intelligence services were responsible for the bombing. In 2001, following a nearly four-year long trial, the judges convicted a Libyan diplomat and three others to prison sentences between 12 and 14 years. The big oil-exporting country in the meantime was busy working on its reputation. Already in the 1990s, Tripoli began striving to improve its relations to the European Union. Financial reparation opened the door to Europe In 2004, the Gaddafi International Foundation for Charity Associations and the legal representatives of the German La Belle victims settled on $35 million in compensation. This opened the door to Europe. Just a few weeks later, Germany's chancellor at the time, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, visited Moammar Gadhafi in a traditional Bedouin tent outside of Tripoli. Britain's Prime Minister Tony Blair also paid Gadhafi a visit. A few months earlier, in April 2004, the European Union had welcomed the Libyan leader to Brussels. It was Gadhafi's first official visit to Europe in 15 years. Bernd Westphal, the German ambassador to Libya, said bilateral relations had been through difficult times. \"The German Embassy in Tripoli today is working for a quick return to the liveliness of close relations between Germany and Libya,\" Westphal said. \"We want to build on our traditional friendship with Libya and we want to strengthen the political, economic and cultural cooperation between our two countries and peoples.\" Business interests booming in Libya In the past few years, Libya has moved from being the supporter of international terrorism to an attractive economic partner for the West. European business representatives have been increasingly knocking on Libya's door. Even the United States is showing increased interest in the northern African nation. Washington is pleased that Libya announced at the end of 2003 that it would discontinue its efforts to develop and produce weapons of mass destruction. Libya's ambassador to Germany, Said Abdulaati, said political and economic relations between Libya and Germany were \"excellent.\" Libya is one of Germany's strongest trading partners in northern Africa. Last year, Germany exported goods to Libya worth 657.7 million euros ($805.7 million), according to the German Federal Statistics Office. \"The economy is the driving power in German-Libyan relations,\" said Abdulaati in an interview with the Arab-German association for trade and industry. But Germany isn't the only European country making deals in Libya. France last month signed an accord with Libya on peaceful nuclear research. \"This accord represents a qualitative leap in relations between the two countries and proves that Libya has transformed its weapons of mass destruction into constructive weapons,\" Public Works Minister Maatuk Maatuk said at the signing ceremony in March. \"We are telling the world that we are moving towards the development of Libyan nuclear technology for peaceful purposes.\" This week, the Netherlands' Economics Minister Laurens Jan Brinkhorst will visit Libya to negotiate gas and oil agreements. It will be the first high-level visit by a Dutch official since Gadhafi took power in 1969.",
        "generated_story": "The Shift in Libya's Relations to Europe The shift in the relationship between Libya and Europe has been marked by a sharp increase in tensions between the two countries. In April 2004, the German Federal Statistics Office (GFSO) announced that the country's relations with the European Union had reached an all-time high. The German government, which had been in power since the fall of dictator Moammar Gadhafi in April 1990, said it was \"deeply concerned\" by the new developments. \"We are deeply concerned,\" German Foreign Minister Bernd Westphal said in an interview with German newspaper La Belle in Berlin on April 5, 2004. He added that \"we are very concerned about the deterioration of relations between Germany and the EU,\" adding that Germany had \"no choice but to support the Libyan government in its fight against terrorism and extremism.\" The change in Germany's relationship with Libya comes as the United States and its European allies have been at loggerheads over the past few years. German Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, who was in office at the time of the coup, has called for a \"new era\" of cooperation between Europe and Libya. Germany, he said, \"is the only country that is willing and able to work together in this way.\" Germany has long been a staunch ally of Libya, and has always supported the government's efforts to end the conflict there. But in March, German Public Works Minister Maatuk Maatsuk announced the end of his tenure as prime minister and that he would be stepping down as soon as possible. According to a statement released by his office, his decision to step down came as a result of disagreements over how to deal with terrorism. It was the first time in more than 30 years that German public works ministers had agreed to take a leave of absence from the job of running the state of emergency in Tripoli. Since then, however, it has become increasingly difficult for German officials to explain the reasons for their absence. For example, Germany is not a member of NATO, nor is it a NATO member. There are also differences in how much money the US pays for the security of its citizens, such as salaries, pensions, health care, education and other services, as well as on the cost of living for people who are not citizens of Germany. This is because Germany pays more for its own citizens than the U.S. government does for other countries, including France, Britain, Italy, Spain, Portugal, France and Spain."

        "target": "Bremen Election Results Could Have National Repercussions It might be Germany's smallest state with a population of less than 700,000, but the make-up of Bremen's new government could curb the ability of Angela Merkel's coalition to continue with planned reforms. The Social Democrats (SPD) and Christian Democrats (CDU) have ruled the small northern city-state of Bremen in a coalition for the past 12 years. But after winning state elections on Sunday with 36.8 percent, the SPD is now flirting with the idea of ditching their previous coalition partners to rule together with the Greens, who made their best-ever showing in a German state poll with 16.4 percent. Bremen's state SPD leadership is to hold talks later on Wednesday with the CDU, which polled 25.7 percent. After an SPD meeting in Bremen, Mayor Jens B\u00f6hrnsen made the first signal he could be favoring the Greens. He said that during the campaign he had deliberately abstained from mentioning the possibility of a renewed CDU coalition because \"after 12 years it shouldn't automatically be continued.\" Bremen's acting head of government and CDU member Thomas R\u00f6wekamp, however, warned against an SPD-Green coalition. \"The majority of people don't want a red-green experiment, but a continuation of the grand coalition,\" he said. Both the SPD and CDU conceded heavy losses in the election, which showed a swing towards the Greens and the Left Party, which scored an unexpected 8.4 percent to win representation in a western German state legislature for the first time in its brief history. Block reforms? If Bremen's SPD decide in favor of the Greens, this would affect the ability of Chancellor Angela Merkel's grand coalition of CDU and SPD to push ahead with reforms requiring constitutional changes, such as stage two of Germany's urgently needed federalism reform. The federal Bundesrat, which is made up of state cabinet members, has to approve the majority of legislative bills passed by the lower chamber, the Bundestag, before they become law. Also, any proposed constitutional changes require two-thirds of all votes in order to be passed by the Bundesrat. The CDU and SPD currently hold 47 of the Bundesrat's 69 seats, which is one seat more than the necessary two-thirds majority. But without Bremen, the number held by the grand coalition would fall to 44 seats, meaning they would need the cooperation of one of the small opposition parties for any constitutional changes. Internal strife Earlier in the week, Chancellor Merkel called for unity within her ruling left-right coalition after the losses in Bremen set the stage for more infighting between the two parties. Merkel also warned the SPD against moving to the left after it lost some five percent points. The chancellor said the outcome showed the SPD had made a mistake by attacking the coalition and campaigning on promises of a minimum wage, which she believes will hamper efforts to fight unemployment of just under 10 percent. \"The result showed that this strategy did not pay off,\" Merkel told a press conference.",
        "generated_story": "Merkel's coalition of Social Democrats and Greens could block reforms German Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives are set to form a coalition government in the conservative state of Bremen on Wednesday. The SPD, the Greens and the Left Party are expected to join the coalition, which would form the Bundestag's governing coalition. Chancellor Merkel and her conservatives have already agreed on a number of controversial reforms, including tax cuts for the wealthy and a tax on the middle class. On Wednesday, German media reported that the SPD had agreed to introduce tax breaks for middle-income earners, a move that would allow them to spend more on education and health care. A spokesman for Merkel said she would not comment on whether or not the new coalition would be able to pass the tax reform. \"We have a lot of work ahead of us,\" said Jens B\u00f6hrnsen, who heads the center-left Left party. He added that his party would work closely with the federal government to make sure that all taxes paid by middle income earners were kept in line with German law. But he also pointed out that there was a \"very high probability\" that a new tax break would lead to higher taxes on middle earners and lower wages for low-wage workers. Merkel has also said that she is open to the idea of tax credits for lower earners. She has promised to push through tax increases on high earners in a bid to reduce the deficit and cut spending on public services. Her conservative coalition has been criticized by the opposition Greens party and its leader, Thomas R\u00f6wekamp, for its opposition to tax hikes and other social welfare reforms. B\u00fchrnen is one of Germany's most conservative cities, with a population of around 1.5 million people, according to a poll released on Sunday by Bundesrat, an agency of the German government. It is not clear how Merkel will fare in her coalition with her conservative Christian Democrats (CDU), which has governed the country for more than a decade. In the past, Merkel had ruled out the possibility of such a deal, arguing that it would only be possible if the CDU were to win the upper house of parliament. However, in recent weeks, she has made it clear that her party is willing to work with other parties to reach a compromise on taxes and regulations. This week, however, it is unclear whether she will agree to such an agreement."

        "target": "Top NATO commander says Ukraine ceasefire is 'in name only' NATO's top military commander has called the truce between Ukraine's military and pro-Russia separatists a 'ceasefire in name only.' US General Philip Breedlove said Russian forces were still operating inside Ukraine. Speaking to reporters after a meeting with NATO military chiefs in Lithuania's capital Vilnius on Saturday, US General Philip Breedlove expressed \"sincere hope\" about a renewed peace plan, agreed to earlier in the day in the Belarusian capital Minsk, by separatists and representatives from Ukraine's and Russia's governments. The new pact, including an artillery buffer zone, was a move to strengthen a peace plan signed earlier this month, also in Minsk. However, Breedlove said violence levels in Ukraine in recent days were as high as prior to the earlier ceasefire. \"The ceasefire is still there in name, but what is happening on the ground is quite a different story,\" Breedlove said, adding that Russian forces were still operating in Ukraine, although he could not pinpoint how many. \"The fluidity of movement of Russian forces and Russian-backed forces back and forth across that border makes it almost impossible to understand the numbers,\" he said. A convoy from Russia consisting of about 170 trucks arrived in Ukraine on Saturday, with a reported cargo of humanitarian aid. Previous aid convoys sent from Russia were met with outrage in Kyiv, as it was suspected they may have been used to provide support to the pro-Moscow separatists in eastern Ukraine. Russia has repeatedly denied such accusations. The separatists have said they want to break from Kyiv and have already declared \"people's republics'\" in Donetsk and Luhansk. This week Ukraine's parliament passed a bill which paves the way for more autonomy for those areas. While neither Russia nor Ukraine are members of NATO, both share borders with NATO countries. se/ksb (AP, AFP)",

He added that the ceasefire was in \"name only.\" \"It is an agreement between the two sides,\" he said, referring to a ceasefire that was brokered in Minsk last week. Russia and Ukraine have been at loggerheads over Ukraine's eastern regions since the end of the war in March. Moscow and Kyiv have called for an end to the fighting, but Moscow has so far refused to budge on the question of whether the truce is binding or not. Russian President Vladimir Putin has called on Ukraine to respect the terms of its ceasefire, which was agreed to by the EU, NATO and the International Criminal Court (ICC) earlier this month. The Russian military said it would continue to monitor the situation in Donetsk and Luhansk, with the aim of establishing a \"framework\" for talks between Moscow, Kiev and Moscow over the next few weeks. NATO Secretary-General, however, did not rule out the possibility of a new round of talks, saying it was unlikely that Moscow would agree to any kind of ceasefire at the moment. Ukraine has repeatedly rejected calls from Moscow to end the violence, and has rejected the idea that it could be used as a weapon of mass destruction."

In a statement released on Friday, the German football association (DFB) announced that the games would be rescheduled for 2018 and that talks would take place between them and their Chinese counterparts in order explore how to move forward. \"To the regret of all parties involved, the project has not received the broad approval that had been expected,\" the DFB said. \"In fact, the project was used by a handful of spectators to send messages that were considered hurtful by the Chinese team, officials, the Chinese Football Association's support staff and Chinese spectators.\" Protests in opening match The first of the arranged matches, against TSV Schott Mainz of the fourth-tier Regionalliga S\u00fcdwest was interrupted midway through the first half when the Chinese players left the field because a small group of activists had unfurled Tibetan flags. The team later returned to the field after the flags had been taken down, before succumbing to a 3-0 defeat. On Monday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry strongly criticized the protest. Initially, it had been thought that the Chinese side would play in the Regionalliga S\u00fcdwest - a regional division of Germany's fourth tier which has only 19 teams but the plan was revised so the matches would just be friendlies. This followed an agreement signed in 2016 between the German FA and the Chinese government to help boost the sport in the Asian country, where the Bundesliga is increasingly popular. Financial boost not enough to soothe concerns Despite the financial boost for the clubs \u2013 TSV Schott Mainz were reportedly paid a fee of \u20ac15,000 ($17.800) for last weekend's game \u2013 the move hasn't proved entirely popular with German fans, many of whom see it as just another example of commercial interests trumping sporting concerns. But the protests, and potential for further disruption, seem to be behind the cancellations - the DFB said both federations were aware of \"substantial evidence of further escalation,\" FSV Frankfurt, who were due to host the Chinese side on Saturday, said earlier this week that they would not ban protests despite an angry response to last week's incident from Beijing. \"We will not back a single centimeter off the basic rights our our democracy, including those relating to freedom of speech,\" FSV Frankfurt President Michael G\u00f6rner said in an interview with the Stuttgarter Nachrichten and Stuttgarter Zeitung newspapers. His words echoed those of DFB vice-president Ronny Zimmerman, who said that the games should be played \"within the framework of freedom of expression.\" The fixtures that have been abandoned include games against Wormatia Worms and Bundesliga club Hoffenheim's reserves. mp/pfd (dpa, SID)",

The Bundesliga club, which is part of the Chinese Football Association (CFA), said on Saturday that it had canceled the team's participation. \"We regret to inform you that we will not be able to take part in this tournament,\" CFA vice-president Michael G\u00f6rner told the Stuttgarter Zeitung, adding that the club's decision to cancel the event was \"not in our best interests.\" The German association said it would not comment on the cancellation, but said the decision was made \"in the best interest of all German football associations.\" \"It is a sad day for our association and for all the fans who have come to the regionalliga S\u00fcdwest to cheer on our club,\" said German soccer association president Ronny Zimmerman in a statement posted on his Twitter account. He added that his association would continue to work closely with the German government to ensure the safety of its players and staff, and that \"we will continue our efforts to protect the interests of our players, our fans and our supporters.\" German media reported that German club TSV Schott Mainz had cancelled the tournament, citing \"technical reasons.\" According to local media reports, the cancellations were the result of a dispute between German and Chinese officials over who should be allowed to participate in next year's world cup in Beijing. Germany and China have been at loggerheads over the issue since last year, when a group of Chinese players were invited to Germany to play for the country's national football team. In the end, Germany agreed to allow the players to stay in Germany for a longer period of time. However, it is not clear how long the ban will last, as it was announced on Friday that Germany would no longer allow Chinese football to be used as a training ground for Chinese national teams. mp/pfd (dpa, SID)"

        "target": "For drivers in Germany, 2010 was the most expensive year ever Owning and operating a car in Germany has never been cheap, but it's never been more expensive than in 2010. German auto club ADAC says costs associated with owning a car have risen more than 40 percent since 1995. In 2010, German car owners had to pay a high price for their mobility, according to ADAC, which cited record-high fuel prices as the major cost factor. \"For drivers, 2010 will go down in history as the most costly year ever,\" ADAC said in a statement. High taxes The cost of acquiring and operating a car has risen 42 percent since 1995, compared to a 24 percent increase in the general cost of living. Due to tax increases and higher production costs, fuel prices soared 86 percent over the 15-year period. In 2010 alone, the average price for a liter of super gasoline was more than 1.40 euros ($1.84) - the highest the average price ever. According to ADAC, urban singles spent an average of 3,340 euros on their cars in 2000. Five years later, that figure had jumped to 3,900 euros. By the end of 2010, their expenses reached 4,380 euros, or 1,000 euros more than a decade earlier. Driving is also pricey for four-person families with two cars. According to the automobile club, their annual costs have risen 30 percent over the past 10 years from 5,940 euros to 7,740 euros. Taxes account for the lion's share of gasoline and diesel prices. The German government's mineral oil and value added taxes account for nearly 88 cents of the 1.35-euro price of a liter of fuel. Low toll revenue While the German government reaps more revenue year for year from vehicle-related taxes, income generated by its highway toll for trucks is expected to fall this year for the first time since the haulage charges were introduced in 2005. The government predicts this year's toll revenues will amount to 4.2 billion euros, down from 4.3 billion euros in 2009. Author: John Blau Editor: Sam Edmonds",
        "generated_story": "The Most Costly Year in History for German Auto Clubs The most expensive year in German auto clubs' history has been 2010, according to figures released by the German Automobile Clubs Association (ADAC). According to the ADAC, 2010 was the most costly year ever recorded by an auto club in Germany. The average German car club costs 4.2 billion euros ($4.3 billion) a year to operate, compared to 3,340 euros for the same year last year. That's a staggering amount of money for a club to spend on a car. It's not just the cost of a new car, it's the fact that it costs a lot more to run a vehicle than it does to buy one. This is because the average car costs an average of 4,380 euros, which is the equivalent of 1.35-euro for an existing model. In addition, the costs of running a model car range from 1,000 euros to 5,940 euros (4,740 euros). This means that for every car that is sold, there are a total of 7,730 euros spent on the vehicle. And that's on top of the annual costs for new models. Compared to 2005, this is a record year for car sales, with sales of more than 3.5 million euros. But that doesn't mean that the prices of new cars are going to go down. For example, in the first half of 2009, car registrations dropped by 3 percent, to just under 4 percent. What's more, auto sales fell by 7 percent year-on-year from the previous year, when they were at their lowest level since 1995. Author: John Blau Editor: Sam Edmonds"

The move shows Madrid's support of US efforts to close the controversial prison. Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said the first inmate from the US prison at Guantanamo Bay had arrived in his country. Madrid has agreed to host five prisoners, the largest commitment yet from a European country. Citing privacy concerns, Rubalcaba refused to give the prisoner's name or any identifying information, except to say he was a Palestinian. The new arrival will be able to work and move around Spain as he wishes, but will not be able to leave the country. \"He is a Palestinian, he has already arrived in our country. We do not want to give out further details because we want everyone who comes to live in our country to be able to live their lives normally,\" he told a news conference. Spain urges others to 'do the utmost' Spain's decision to take five Guantanamo detainees is part of an effort to help US President Barack Obama with his plans to shut down the jail. The prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, was set up at a US navy base by former President George W. Bush in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos has urged other European countries \"to do their utmost\" to take in former Guantanamo detainees as well. Third countries are being asked to take in detainees who are cleared of any charges, but who can't be sent back to their homelands for fear of persecution. Obama had said he would close the prison by January 22, 2010, yet the deadline passed unmet. Some 200 detainees remain there, but finding places to take in the prisoners - even the dozens already cleared for release - has proved controversial. jen/AFP/AP Editor: Andreas Illmer",

He also said that Spain would continue to work closely with the European Union in its fight against terrorism, which has led to the deaths of more than 1,000 people worldwide since Sept. 11, 2001, when the attacks on US soil killed 9,977 people and injured thousands more. Obama has also called on Spain to continue its work toward ending the war on terror, as well as to end the use of torture and other forms of violence at the hands of US and European prison authorities. On the other hand, he has called for an end to torture in Guantanamo, where prisoners are held for up to five years without trial or parole. A spokesman for Obama's administration, Miguel Angel Moratinos, said in an interview with Spanish news agency dpa that the detainees would be released \"in due course.\" \"This is a positive step for Spain,\" the spokesman added, referring to President Bush's decision to close the Guantanamo prison in September 2001 to allow more time for prisoners to return to their countries of origin, including Israel, the Palestinian Territories and the Gaza Strip. jen/AFP/AP Editor: Andreas Illmer"

        "target": "Opinion: A decision against heart and mind The House of Commons has passed the Brexit bill - despite most parliamentarians being against it. But now they should take care that Great Britain does not move further away from Europe, writes Birgit Maass. If only they had done it out of full conviction. If they at least believed that they could really benefit their country by withdrawing from the EU. But many of the parliamentarians whose vote will finally set Brexit on its wayhave voted against their hearts, as well as their minds. It was a vote against their minds, because the withdrawal from the EU will almost certainly, at least on a short to medium term basis, have negative repercussions for the British economy. And it was a vote against their hearts, because for many, a view of the future, divorced from Brussels and increasingly reliant on an unpredictable US President Donald Trump, is somewhat alarming. In recent days, many members of parliament have described it as \"a catastrophe.\" No vote \"against the will of the people.\" Of course there are \"Brexiteers\" who believe that a Britain independent of Brussels will be able to return to its former greatness, once it is no longer held back by the \"Little Europeans.\" But they are in the minority - the majority of parliamentarians already declared their support for remaining in the EU during the referendum campaign. Yet despite this, Theresa May's government was able to push its legislative proposal through the House of Commons without any great difficulty. The predominant view, also amongst members of the two leading parties, is that to hinder Brexit and to fail to support the government in its endeavors to do so, would be to go \"against the will of the people.\" Anti-EU newspapers have targeted Brexit opponents. And those who have publically come out in support of the EU have had to reckon with death threats. The at times passionate debate in the lower house, that went on over several days, was a temporary highlight in this European tragedy, which in the worst case could contribute to the continent disintegrating into individual sovereign states. Don't be intimidated The British public supports the hard-line position taken by Prime Minister May in withdrawing from the common market. Polls are showing that her strategy is gaining increased support. There is no turning back now. The British are now looking for clarity on the repercussions of their withdrawal from the EU. They want the negotiations with the EU to start as soon as possible. It was an historical misjudgement by David Cameron that he could win the referendum. Most of the members of the lower house believed the then-prime minister and voted to hold a referendum. But now they can no longer stop Brexit.

        "generated_story": "Brexit vote is not a referendum against the will of the British people The British parliament has voted to leave the European Union. The result is a no-confidence vote in the government of Prime Minister Theresa May. This is the result of a vote by the people of Great Britain. There is no doubt that the referendum will result in a \"no-deal\" Brexit. That is why the vote has been called. It will be voted on by a majority of members of parliament, the House of Commons and the public. But it will not be the first time that this has happened. In the past, there have been a number of referendums, but this time, it was the second time the UK voted in favor of leaving the EU without a deal. And that is what happened with the Brexit referendum, which was held on the same day as the 2016 referendum. What happened in this referendum was not the outcome of an election, nor was it an outcome that would have changed the course of this country's political course. Instead, this vote was a consequence of Brexit, and a result that will have a negative impact on British society. \"The referendum is an opportunity for Britain to move forward with its plans for the future,\" said Birgit Maass, a political analyst at the University of Manchester. She added that there was \"a lot of pressure\" on May to make the case that she should stick to her Brexit plan. However, she said, \"I don't think there is any reason why we should have to go through with this.\" The referendum result, if it were to be called, would not have taken place at all. A referendum on Brexit would mean that Britain would no longer be able to vote on whether or not it wanted to exit the single market or the customs union. Britain's EU membership is now up for renegotiation and negotiations are expected to begin in earnest on March 29, 2019. If the two sides agree on a withdrawal agreement, then Britain will remain a member of EU customs and passport-free trade with other EU member states, including the US, Canada, France and Germany. Brexit vote 'no' or 'yes' The UK government has announced that it is ready to accept the terms and conditions of its withdrawal from the bloc, with a view to setting up a transitional government in place after the end of next year's referendum in March."

        "generated_story": "Klaus Staeck Artist and Publisher of \"No Detox Water\" Author of no-detox water book and a frequent guest on the show, Klaus Stadeck, is one of the most well-known artists and publishers in the country. He is also the author of a number of books and short stories, including a collection of essays, a book on water conservation, and more. His most recent book, \"The Art of Water,\" was published in 2014. It was the first book in a series of short story collections by the artist and publisher. The title is a reference to the German word for \"water.\" \"Water is not water, it is water,\" says Klaus. \"It is the opposite of water. Water is something that can be absorbed by your body, but it cannot be consumed by a person.\" The name is derived from the fact that the water is absorbed through the skin, not the pores. This means that it has to be treated with a certain amount of salt, which is then absorbed into the body. In other words, there is no water in water that you can drink. You can't drink without it. That's why you have to use a lot of chemicals. And that's the main reason why people drink more water than you do. But that doesn't mean you're not going to drink it, because you don't want to contaminate your water with chemicals that are harmful to your health and your environment. So, you've got to do something about that, right? Well, I think it's a good idea to try and do that. I've been doing it for a long time and I'm really happy with the results so far. There's no harm in doing that.\" But there are a few problems. First of all, people are not drinking enough water and secondly, they're drinking too much. What do you think about this? Do you agree with me on this one? What does it mean for you? Is it good for the environment? Does it make you feel better about yourself? I don\u2019t think so. If I had to choose one thing, then I would choose the one that I like the best: clean, clean water.\" And then, of course, the question of whether or not that water should be used for drinking or for bathing? The answer is \"yes\" and \"no.\" There are many reasons why it shouldn't be. One of them is that people have a tendency to think that they should have more control over what they drink and how they use their bodies. Another reason is because they think they can control their body temperature. Then, if they have enough toxins in their system, that means they are more likely to get sick and die."

        "target": "A Brief History of the Seaside Holiday These days, millions take seaside holidays for granted as one of life's pleasures. But 200 years ago, a dip in the sea was more a test of courage. Hardly anyone could swim. As late as the 18th century, many Europeans still thought of the sea as the realm of Satan: storm-tossed and inhabited by terrifying monsters. \"Unlike the mountains, the coasts were terra incognita as a holiday spot,\" says Manfred B\u00e4tje, director of the Bade-Museum on the North Sea island of Norderney. Anyone who set foot in the water was \"stepping into the unknown\". Brighton showed the way That only began to change after the British aristocracy discovered the healing power of salt water. As early as 1780, Brighton, England's biggest and oldest seaside resort, was a bustling spa. Philosopher and physicist Georg Christoph Lichtenberg (1742-1799) of G\u00f6ttingen gave Germans the starting signal with his 1793 essay \"Why doesn't Germany have any large public seaside resorts?\" In it, he called for the creation of a resort in Cuxhaven on the North Sea. He received support from the most notable German physician of the time, the Prussian king's court physician, Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland. But things turned out somewhat differently. Germany's first seaside resort was indeed built in September, 1793, but in Heiligendamm on the Baltic Sea. Four years later, permission was granted for construction of Germany's first resort on the North Sea, on Norderney. \"For the first bathing season on July and August of 1800, only around 250 guests turned up. Now, the nearly 6000 residents host a good 530,000 bathers annually, plus around 230,000 day-trippers,\" B\u00e4tje reels off the figures. Romanticist inspiration In the 19th century, the landscapes of Caspar David Friedrich, such as his famous Chalk Cliffs on R\u00fcgen (1818), gave seaside holidays added impetus. From then on, the sea was no longer a voracious beast. From the shore, the cultivated, modern European contemplated the vast melancholy of the deep. \"The calm sea became an embodiment of unspecified yearning, the waves an expression of vitality and dynamism,\" soliloquizes museum director B\u00e4tje. But the journey to the sea long remained an arduous, time-consuming one. It took the mail coach a good thirty hours to cover the distance from Hamburg to the North Frisian town of Aurich over bumpy, muddy roads. The express cab from Bremen only took about 16 hours to reach the East Frisian town of Norden - including six changes of horses along the way. \"It wasn't comfortable,\" explains B\u00e4tje. Not until the introduction of seaside tourist steamers out of Hamburg and Bremen to the islands and the expansion of the railways did the journey become easier. Strict bathing rules At first, it was primarily the well-to-do bourgeois and nobility who were able to afford a seaside holiday. Victorian-era society is known for its extreme prudishness, and the beach was not exempt. Bathing machines were essentially changing cabins on wheels that could be rolled into the surf. The sexes were kept strictly separated. Wet swimsuits could not be allowed to cling, thus revealing the body's contours. Women sported baggy flannel garments with bloomers underneath that swiftly became waterlogged to where the bather was risking her life. Hardly anyone really knew how to swim anyway. \"Most bathers wouldn't stay in the water any more than two minutes, often just seconds at a time. The English had a rule: 'Three dips and out',\" quips archivist Manfred B\u00e4tje, whose Bade-Museum is housed in a building for a former wave pool, just a few steps from Norderney's Weststrand, where, during the summer months, vacationers sunbathe in wicker beach chairs and on blankets, cooled by a salty sea breeze. Sunbathing first came in style early in the 20th century, and the first true swimsuits were produced in the United States. \"Starting in 1919, today's bathing culture gradually began to take shape,\" B\u00e4tje looks back. At the same time, ideals of beauty were in flux - such as the attitude towards tan skin, which had long been regarded as a mark of farmers and manual laborers. B\u00e4tje: \"People were still cultivating their genteel pallors.\" Water, Waves, Wellness Today, the sun worshipers are the devout masses, and seaside holidays are their pilgrimages. The North Sea resorts alone count some 12.9 million overnight stays annually. Health is once again a primary concern: sea air, sea water, sea salts and the algaes and mud used in",
        "generated_story": "A Brief History of the Seaside Holiday in Germany The Bade-Museum in Norderney in the German city of G\u00f6ttingen is home to the world's most famous seaside holiday, the Chalk Cliffs on R\u00fcgen. The museum's director, Manfred B\u00e4tje, has spent the past 20 years exploring the North Frisian region of Germany. In the 18th century, he was fascinated by the sea and its beauty. He spent a lot of time on the coast, visiting places such as Cuxhaven, Aurich and Bremen. \"I've always wanted to go back to Germany,\" he said, adding that it was \"the most beautiful place on earth.\" He also said that he would like to return to his home state of Hesse, where he spent most of his time as a child, to visit his family and friends in his native town. His first trip to England was in 1818, when he went to see his father, who had died in a shipwreck off the Baltic Sea. During that time, his wife and two children were living on a small island near the town of Heiligendamm. After the war, they returned to their home country of Cologne, which they called \"Hermann\" in honor of their father's death. They then moved to H\u00fcttenheim, a coastal town about 30 kilometers (25 miles) north of Hamburg. There they stayed for a year, living in an old house with a garden and a swimming pool. It was there that they first began to explore the area and discovered the \"chalk cliffs.\" They became famous for being the first German ship to cross the Rhine in 1799. Since then they have been visited by more than 1.5 million people, and have become well-known in England and the United States as well as in other European countries. But they are not the only Europeans who have come to enjoy the region's beauty and culture. For example, there is the Hufeland family who spent their summers in H\u00f6tenheim. And then there are the people who came to live there, like Caspar David Friedrich and his son, Dieter Sell (epd) and their daughter, Christoph Wilhelm. These people are still alive and well, but they don't have the same sense of humor as they used to when they were younger. This is because they didn't know that there was a sea in their own country. That's because there were so many Europeans living there at the time. Some of them were German, others were from England, some from Germany and others from the Netherlands. Many of these people were born and brought up here by their parents and grandparents. Their parents were also German and German-speakers, so they had a great influence on their children's lives. When they moved here, their mother was German. Her father was born in Hamburg and her mother came from a German family. She was the daughter of a merchant ship owner who worked as an innkeeper and was married to a doctor who died of typhoid fever in 1692. A few years later, her father died and she was buried in her native village of Cuyhaven in northern England. At the end of her life, she had to give birth to her first son."

The base hosts Air Force One, used by President Obama. An active shooter exercise at Joint Base Andrews was mistaken for a real shooting situation on Thursday morning, triggering a lockdown at the military base that houses the president's aircraft. Joint Base Andrews outside Washington, D.C., issued a \"shelter in place\" order after an active shooter incident was reported at the Malcolm Grow Medical Facility at approximately 9 am local time. The base said on Twitter that there was an active shooter exercise scheduled, but a real active shooter situation was reported. It later cleared the facility. The lockdown delayed the travel of Vice President Joe Biden, who was scheduled to fly to Ohio for a campaign event. The Joint Base Andrews is located in Camp Springs, Maryland, just outside the US capital. The base serves as the home of Air Force One, the US president's aircraft, and is used by other senior government officials.",

Obama said he was not aware of any injuries, but that he did not know the extent of the injuries. He also said that there was no danger to the public and that the situation was under control. In a tweet, Obama called for a \"total and complete shutdown\" of all military bases in and around the country, saying that it was \"a total and total shutdown.\" \"We will not allow any further disruption to our military operations,\" Obama wrote on Twitter. A statement from the White House said, however, that \"we will continue to monitor this situation closely and closely.\" The statement came a day after a gunman opened fire at an Air Force base near the Maryland border, killing at least one person and injuring more than 100 others, according to a Pentagon spokesman. Military spokesman Col. John Kirby said there were no immediate reports of injuries or fatalities."

        "target": "Threat of the Punjabi Taliban is growing Deutsche Welle talks to Pakistani political expert Hasan Askari Rizvi about the growing ties between militants in northwest Pakistan and Punjab province. At least four gunmen disguised in police uniforms raided a hospital in Pakistan's eastern city of Lahore on Monday night, claiming at least five lives. Local officials said the gunmen were trying to free a militant, who was being treated there after being captured during attacks on two mosques last Friday. The police said the gunfight at Jinnah Hospital had lasted around 45 minutes but the gunmen had managed to flee. Friday's twin attacks on the minority Ahmadi community left more than 90 people dead. They were claimed by a group, which identified itself as the Punjabi wing of the Taliban. Deutsche Welle spoke to political expert Hasan Askari Rizvi in Lahore, where there has been a wave of violence in recent days. DW: Who are the \"Punjabi Taliban\"? It is a kind of a pejorative term, which includes a host of groups. Initially in Punjab, you had two types of militancy: One, the groups that focussed mainly on Indian-administered Kashmir and there were other types of groups that focussed on Pakistan. Those were the sectarian groups targeting mainly the Shias, and there were some Shia groups targeting the Sunni leadership. Over the years a lot of factions have broken away from these groups and these small entities are functioning more or less autonomously. They have trainings in the tribal areas because these are secured for them and certain parts are not under Pakistani control so these groups go there. They operate with the Pakistani Taliban based in tribal areas against the Pakistani troops in the region. They also have an autonomous agenda, which they pursue in Punjab, as they have been doing in the past days. These groups also play host or are a kind of a local link to Taliban suicide bombers who come into the main part of Pakistan from the tribal areas (let's say to Punjab). If they have to target some place, they park themselves with these Punjab groups, and then do it. All these factions and groups that have broken away from traditional militant groups and are functioning in close collaboration with tribal area Taliban are often described as the \"Punjabi Taliban\". Why do you think these militants are resurfacing now? They have always existed here and there and generally the trend is that they undertake a couple of operations, one after the other. Then the government comes in and takes action against them. Then they just disappear or become sleeping groups and suddenly after a couple of months they resurface. That's the standard pattern. The last major incident in Lahore was in the first week of March. Then there was nothing in April and now towards the end of May you have this kind of incident. Do you think the government should have taken stronger action against them? They should have but the problem is that the Punjab government has a kind of ambiguous approach and I think there is some element of denial within the leadership also. These groups also have some sympathy if not support at the societal level and that makes it difficult for the government to go against them openly. They need to work together and to emphasise to the people that they are terrorists. They use different names and Islam but actually their agenda is terrorism. Somehow the government of Punjab has been rather confused and ambiguous regarding these groups. Interview: Disha Uppal Editor: Anne Thomas",
        "generated_story": "Pakistani political expert: Punjabi Taliban in northwest Pakistan growing The threat of the Pakistani Taliban is growing in the northwest, according to a report in Deutsche Welle. Political expert Hasan Askari Rizvi told the German news agency on Monday night that the threat posed by the militant group was growing. \"It is becoming more and more apparent that there is a growing threat to the stability of Pakistan,\" he said, adding that it was \"increasingly important for Pakistan's political establishment to act decisively against the Taliban.\" The report, which was published in a German newspaper, said that Pakistani political experts had warned of a \"new wave of violence\" that could be unleashed in Pakistan. The Pakistani government has said it will not allow the militants to enter the country without the help of Pakistani security forces, the report said. In the past few months, Pakistan has seen a rise in militant attacks on hospitals, schools and other public institutions. Last week, a suicide bomber struck a hospital in Lahore, killing at least 10 people and injuring more than 100 others. According to an expert at the political think-tank Disha Uppal, there was also a surge in attacks in April and May, as well as an increase in suicide attacks. But the attacks were not limited to hospitals and schools, she added, saying that \"it is not just the hospitals that are being attacked, it is also the schools that have been attacked.\" In a statement released Monday, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said the attack on the Jinnah Hospital was the result of an \"unprecedented\" number of attacks by militants in recent months. He called for the government to step up security measures against militant groups, including the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and the Balochistan Liberation Front (LKF). \"We need to take action against these groups,\" the spokesman said in an interview with the newspaper.
