        "target": "Opinion: Obama's Cuban revolution President Barack Obama has made a very special declaration of love to Cuba. It's as revolutionary as the Cuban revolution, and as peaceful as the biblical Sermon on the Mount, says DW's Astrid Prange. US President Barack Obama has lost his old communist \"enemy,\" and Cuban President Raul Castro has lost his hatred of capitalism. In the first phone call from president to president since 1961 the two heads of state came to a surprisingly swift agreement. They want to renew diplomatic relations, which have been on ice for more than 50 years, and exchange ambassadors. It's only a matter of time before the US lifts its trade embargo against Cuba. All the word \"embargo\" is really good for - at this stage - is as an ideological soapbox for political hardliners, especially Republicans in Congress who believe lifting sanctions would constitute defeat for the US. Yet the lifting of the embargo has already begun. In addition to medication, it has been possible since 2000 to export agricultural produce such as maize, cereal crops, and poultry to Cuba. Flirting with the rogue state Furthermore, 100,000 US citizens have travelled to Cuba since 2011 for cultural and scientific exchanges. Travel restrictions on Cubans living in exile in the US who wanted to visit their relatives on the island were also lifted. According to press reports, the two countries' military forces are even said to be cooperating, as are their coastguards, and military on the border of the US marine base in Guantanamo. Now Obama wants to officially open a \"new chapter\" in relations with the communist Caribbean island and remove Cuba from the US list of so-called \"rogue states\" that support terrorism. The travel ban on American tourists visiting the island will also largely be lifted. That's as far as things will go for the time being, as Obama would require a majority in Congress in Washington to lift the embargo entirely. But even if these are only small steps, the fall of the American-Cuban wall has begun. The easing of the sanctions and the resumption of diplomatic relations are setting the scene for an end to the embargo. Embargo as scapegoat The tearing down of this \"wall in the mind\" is long overdue. The blockade is obsolete, and has proved to be entirely ineffective. More than this, its advocates have achieved the opposite of what they actually wanted. The blockade has provided the leaders in Havana with an easy excuse for their economic failure. Raul Castro realized long ago that Cuba's economic problems can no longer be justified simply by citing the US embargo. It looks as though he was counting on the blockade being lifted: There is no other explanation for the completion of the Mariel container port in January this year. Cuba's biggest infrastructure project was, incidentally, financed by Brazil. The Brazilians also sent a declaration of love to Cuba. Raul Castro opened the door to them. He loves anyone who helps him - his friends even more than his enemies.",
        "generated_story": "Cuba: The Fall of the Wall in the Mind of US President Barack Obama In a speech delivered in Brasilia on January this year, President Obama said that the US should stop building walls in Cuba. \"We should not build walls,\" he said, referring to the Cuban government's attempts to build a wall on the island. The Cuban president has been criticized by many in his own country for the construction of a new prison in Havana. He has also faced criticism from Brazilians, who accuse him of being too lenient with Cuba's communist regime. In his speech, Obama referred to Cuba as a \"dictatorship\" and said \"the Cuban people deserve better than this.\" But he also pointed out that Cuba was not the only country that was in a state of crisis, and that there were other countries that were also at the center of this crisis: Brazil, Cuba, Brazil. Brazil is one of them. It is Cuba that is the most important country in Latin America, but it is also the least important. There are many other places that are not as important as Cuba in terms of human rights, such as Guantanamo Bay, which is a US prison for Cuban dissidents. And there are still many more places where Cuba is at a crisis point. For example, in 2011, when President Raul Castro was overthrown by a military coup, he was able to secure the release of thousands of dissidents from the prison. But in 2012, the government announced that it would no longer allow dissidents to enter the country without a court order. That was the first time in US history that a democratically elected president had been allowed to do so. Since then, however, there have been a number of developments, including the closure of Guantanamo and the re-establishment of diplomatic relations between Washington and Havana, as well as the opening of new diplomatic missions in Brazil and in South America. This has led to a lot of speculation about whether Obama's Cuba policy will be a success or a failure. Astrid Prange, a member of Brazil's Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in an interview with DW that Obama was \"very optimistic\" about the future of his country. However, she added, \"I'm not convinced that he's going to change his mind about Cuba at all. I think he'll be more optimistic about his chances of becoming president.\" \"He's very optimistic,\" Mariel said of Obama, adding that \"he's got a great deal of confidence in himself and his ability to deal with the challenges that come with being president of Cuba.\""

Renzi faces a political challenge in organizing a replacement for Napolitano, dubbed by Italian media as \"King George.\" The president has served as a key intermediary between political parties through numerous changes in government and other tricky political situations. Napolitano, a former communist respected by Europe and Washington, took office in 2006. At the end of his seven-year mandate in 2013, he was asked to stay on because parliament could not agree on his successor. At the time he warned he may not serve out the full term, given his age. In Italy, presidents have loosely-defined powers including the ability to nominate prime ministers, dissolve parliament and veto legislation, as well as use the moral authority of the office to influence politics. se/cmk (dpa, Reuters)",

Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi announced on Wednesday that he would step down from his post as the country's next president, effective immediately. The announcement came after a meeting between the two leaders of the Council of European Union (CEU) and the Italian government on the sidelines of a summit of EU leaders in Washington, Washington and Brussels. \"I regret to inform you that I have accepted the resignation of my successor,\" Renz said in a statement released by the EU's executive arm, the Commission for European Affairs (CeEU), which is responsible for overseeing the bloc's enlargement from the 28-member bloc to the 27-nation bloc, according to Italian media reports. It was not immediately clear whether the president's resignation would be accepted by other EU member states, but it was widely reported that the move was made in response to a request for an extension of his term, which had been set to expire in 2013. A spokesman for the European Commission (ECE) said that it had not yet decided whether to extend the deadline for extending the term to 2013, when it would have been up for renewal. In his resignation speech, President Nicolas Sarkozy said he was \"deeply disappointed\" with the way the outgoing president had handled the situation in Italy, adding that there was a \"serious lack of trust\" in the new government and that \"it is time for a change in leadership.\" \"We are deeply disappointed,\" said the French Foreign Minister, Laurent Fabius, who has been in office since 2006 and is currently in charge of Europe's largest economy, France, Germany, Spain and Italy. France and Washington have also expressed concern over the state of affairs in Europe, with French President Francois Hollande saying that Italy was in \"very bad shape\" after the financial crisis. Washington has also voiced concern about the government's handling of economic and social issues, saying it is \"inappropriate\" to have a president who does not share the same values as a prime minister and who is not a member of NATO."

In the latest incident, seats were ripped out and a goal post wrenched from the ground after St. Gallen faced the prospect of relegation following a 2-0 defeat to Bellinzona on May 20. St. Gallen was the third incident in a month that saw violent clashes with police who twice resorted to rubber bullets and tear gas. While Switzerland is seen as a low risk country in terms of hooliganism, violence has been on the increase in recent years and estimates claim there are around 400 hooligans and 600 sympathizers. Swiss Sports Minister Samuel Schmid said that hooliganism cannot be ruled out, reported German news agency DPA. But he expressed his belief that extra measures such as more policing, restrictions on alcohol -- which he has called \"a catalyst for violence\" -- and video surveillance will help keep trouble at bay. Private firms to boost European police The private security companies will be responsible for patrolling the stadiums and their surroundings, as well as the public viewing areas, team hotels and trainings areas. An international police force will manage the rest. Switzerland has committed some 31,200 police officers and soldiers.

Conservative members of Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition put forward a united front at the weekend against recent developments in the city of Wuppertal. Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said civilians wearing uniforms bearing the logo \"Shariah police\" could not simply start patrolling German streets. The groups reportedly hovered around sites like discotheques and gambling houses, telling passers-by to refrain from gambling and alcohol. Wuppertal's police have begun pressing charges. \"Sharia law is not tolerated on German soil,\" de Maiziere told mass-circulation daily Bild on Saturday. \"Nobody can take it upon themselves to abuse the good name of the German police.\" Justice Minister Heiko Maas, meanwhile, told Bild that \"the state alone\" was responsible for the administration of justice in Germany. It was obvious, Maas said, that any illegal parallel system of law enforcement would not be tolerated. Christian Democrat party whip Volker Kauder was similarly emphatic in an interview to be published in this week's Welt am Sonntag newspaper. \"Under absolutely no circumstances can we tolerate self-styled 'Sharia police officers' patrolling our streets and dictating what people should or should not do,\" Kauder said. Ringleader: goal was attention The 33-year-old behind the Wuppertal patrols, former fireman Sven Lau, published a video on his website on Saturday. Lau said that a \"Sharia police\" never existed, and that a group of men had simply worn the mock uniforms for a few hours. \"We knew that this would raise attention,\" Lau said, claiming that his goal was to spark a debate about Sharia law in Germany. Lau is a leading member of Germany's Salafist movement, advocates of a strict Sunni interpretation of political Islam. He works with a mosque in his native M\u00f6nchengladbach, not far west of Wuppertal, and used to head the fundamentalist group \"Invitation to Paradise.\" (Einladung zum Paradies, in German.) The central council of Muslims in Germany (ZMD) condemned the activities. \"These few teen yobs do not speak in our name,\" chairman Ayman A. Mazyek told the Tagesspiegel am Sonntag newspaper. \"These people are perverting the name of our religion. With this shrill and foolish action, they are really hurting Muslims.\" Sharia law is the Arabic term for a legal system based on the Koran. Saudi Arabia and Iran are examples of countries where such a system officially applies. Wearing a veil is obligatory for women and corporal punishment such as stoning is legally tolerated. Human Rights Watch reported last month that Saudi Arabia had beheaded 19 people in just 16 days in August, for convictions on charges ranging from cannabis smuggling to \"sorcery.\" msh/rc (AFP, dpa, Reuters)",

He said the police would not be allowed to carry out their duties without the approval of the state, which has been criticized by human rights groups for its strict adherence to the Koran. The police chief, who is also a member of Germany's Christian Democrat Party (CDU), told the paper that he was \"very concerned\" about the \"Islamization of our society.\" \"I am very concerned that we are going to have to deal with this situation,\" he said, adding that \"it is not acceptable for us to allow this kind of law to be imposed on our citizens.\" The Interior Ministry said it would take a \"strong and thorough investigation\" into the case, but did not comment on whether or not the investigation would be carried out in accordance with the German constitution. In a statement released Saturday, the ministry said that it was not aware of any plans to impose the law on Muslims. However, it added that the government would continue to cooperate with police in the fight against terrorism and extremism in Germany. Lawmakers have already approved a bill that would allow police to enforce the country's anti-terror laws, including the so-called \"Islamic State\" (IS) and \"ZMD\" laws. A spokesman for the interior ministry, Thomas de Maiziere, said in an interview published Saturday that Germany would no longer tolerate such laws in its state of emergency. On the other hand, he added, \"we will continue our cooperation with law enforcement agencies to ensure that they do not violate the rights of people who are not citizens of this country.\" In response to criticism from Human Rights Watch, German Chancellor Angela Merkel called for a ban on the practice, saying it \"violated the constitution and the values of freedom of speech and expression of religion.\" Merkel has also called on Germany to take action against \"radical Islamic terrorism\" and other forms of extremism, such as the spread of terrorism in Iran and in countries like Saudi Arabia and Iran."

WHO - 'vastly underestimated' On Thursday, the World Health Organization (WHO) said the scale of the epidemic had been \"vastly underestimated\" and that \"extraordinary measures\" were needed to contain the contagious virus. The UN health agency said the death toll had climbed to 1,069 in four afflicted countries, spanning Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia and more recently Nigeria.

WHO spokesman Brima Kargbo told Reuters the agency was working closely with the UN and WHO to prevent the spread of deadly Ebola in Africa. He added that \"it is important for the world to be aware of what is happening and how it can be prevented.\" The UN has called for an end to Ebola's spread to all countries by August 8, a move that could have a negative impact on human health, particularly in developing countries. Ebola is a highly contagious virus that can spread rapidly and can cause serious health problems, such as death and even serious physical and mental illness. It is not yet known how Ebola will spread, but experts say it is likely to spread as quickly as possible. On Thursday, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he was optimistic that Ebola would be contained within the next six months. But he also warned that if it spread quickly enough, it will be difficult to stop it from spreading quickly, as it has been in other African countries for some time. A UN report on Ebola, which is due out in early August, said there were \"a number of cases\" in Guinea, Liberia and Guinea that have been confirmed to have died from the hemorrhagic fever."

Mission manager Jennifer Tropser told reporters in a conference call on Wednesday evening that the plan, once the final checks were completed, was to \"drive, drive, drive\" until Curiosity discovers a rock suitable for analysis. She added that the instrument checks have delivered positive results. \"Through every phase of the check-out, Curiosity has performed almost flawlessly,\" Tropser said. \"The success so far of these activities has been outstanding.\" Many of the tests have concerned Curiosity's robotic arm. The 2.1-meter (7-feet) appendage will be used to pick out and sample rocks and soil. NASA is investigating whether Mars can sustain life, or whether it could in the past. The tests were designed to identify any damage sustained during its interplanetary flight and also to ensure that the arm still functioned properly on Mars, with its different temperatures and gravity. The Mars rover landed in the giant Gale Crater, near the Martian equator, on August 5; it has so far moved about 109 meters within the crater. The rover is traveling east, heading first to an intersection called Glenelg, where three types of terrain meet. This is likely to be the location for the first rock and soil samples, though NASA said Curiosity was unlikely to arrive there for several weeks.

However, a lack of data is not a good sign for Curiosity.

People worldwide are living longer, says the World Health Organization in its World Report on Aging and Health. This is both good and bad. It gives us the chance to \"pursue new activities\" as we get older, such as in education and family life. But it all depends on our health. And for that the WHO says world governments need to act now to make sure our societies worldwide are ready. What are the take home facts from the World Health Organization's 2015 report on Aging and Health? The WHO says that in the next 35 years, the global number of people aged 60 years and over will almost double from 12 percent to 22 percent. By 2020, there will be more people over the age of 60 than 5 year olds. And a majority of older people (80 percent) will live in \"low and middle income\" countries. It's estimated that the world's population aged 60 years and older will total about 2 billion in 2050, which is more than twice as much as now. Furthermore, worldwide, about 125 million people are aged 80 years or older. But by 2050, it is expected that this number of people - aged 80 and over - will live in China alone. But I'm not old, so why should I care? Well, all this is happening at a faster rate than ever before. And the WHO says \"all countries face major challenges to ensure that their health and social systems are ready\" for this major demographic shift. It will cost a lot of money to improve health and social infrastructures, especially in more developed countries where traditional families structures have changed dramatically. Surely, there's \"no typical older person,\" though. How does the WHO define aging? We tend to think of older people as physically and mentally frail. But that's not necessarily the case, not everywhere in the world. Old is a relative concept - especially in middle income to rich countries. For instance, some 70 year olds are as fit as some 20 year olds. Just think how many older folk are at your gym, and ask yourself whether you can keep up with all of them. But that still doesn't explain aging. What is it exactly? The WHO says that at a biological level, \"aging results from the impact of the accumulation of a wide variety of molecular and cellular damage over time.\" Basically, this puts people at a higher risk of disease and, of course, death. But aging can also be associated with \"life transitions,\" such as retirement or witnessing other people, such as friends and family, die around you. This can affect you psychologically and sometimes, as a result, physically. What sort of diseases come with old age? Some of the most common non-fatal conditions include hearing loss, cataracts, back and neck pain and osteoarthritis. Other conditions include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - which affects the lungs - diabetes, depression, and dementia. What needs to be done? The WHO is proposing a five-step plan of action, which includes: Committing to healthy aging and \"evidence-based policies to strengthen the abilities of older persons.\" Aligning health systems with the needs of older populations Developing systems for providing long-term care Creating \"age-friendly cities and communities Improving measurement, monitoring and understanding of \"aging issues\" worldwide. But don't forget: \"a longer life brings with it opportunities, not only for older people and their families, but also for societies as a whole.\"",
        "generated_story": "WHO's Population Aging Plan: Actions Now The World Health Organization (WHO) has announced plans to reduce the number of people living in poverty by 80 percent by 2050. The plan is aimed at reducing the country's population by some 20 year olds by the age of 60. In a report published in the World Report on Aging and Health (WDRH), the WHO said that by 2020, some 70 percent of the world's people will be old enough to be in their 60s. \"This is an important milestone for the global health system,\" the report said, adding that it would be a \"significant milestone\" in terms of reducing people's risk of dying from old age. However, it added that the plan would not be enough for all people to live past 60 years of age in order to meet the 2050 target of a world population of 5.5 billion people. According to WHO, the goal is to reach a level of life expectancy of 80 to 80 years in 2050, which would make it possible for some 30 million people in China to retire by 2035. This is the first step in a long-term plan to tackle the problem of increasing the amount of death and disability in older people, according to a WHO report released in 2015. It also called for an end to the death penalty for those who die before reaching 60, and a ban on the use of contraceptives for people with pre-existing conditions such as cancer, heart disease, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. These changes are expected to take place as a result of an ageing population and an aging population that is now more than twice as old as it was at the end of its lifespans. As a consequence, more people are likely to die prematurely than in previous generations. That's because the average age at which a person dies is 60 and that's when they are most vulnerable to disease and death. So it's not just the elderly who are at risk, but also the children and young people who can't get enough of their own health care. There's also a whole range of other age groups that can be affected. Some 70 year old children, for example, have already reached 60 or 70 years old, while others have reached 80 or 90 years. What's next for them? The WHO says that they will have to deal with the effects of aging, particularly in developing countries, where the aging rate is much higher than it is in other developed countries. They will need to make sure that their children are well-educated and well cared for, as well as their parents and grandparents, so they can continue to help them with their health. But they must also take into account the many factors that contribute to their longevity. One of those factors is their age and their ability to cope with life's challenges. If they don't have enough time to get well, then they'll have a harder time getting well. And this is a problem that will only get worse as they get older. At the same time, there's a lot of pressure on them to adapt to new technologies and lifestyles that are becoming more and more difficult to implement. For instance, if they're going to stay in school for longer, they should be able to learn to drive a car and get a good education and become a better driver for their family and friends."

It is a reflection of his current inauspicious Formula One campaign that World Champion Michael Schumacher is only featuring in reports on this weekend's German Grand Prix at Hockenheim dues to his nationality. The home grown champion equaled his own record of 11 wins in a season at last year's race but this year he will be hoping to just get on the podium at the end. Schumi lies in third place some 34 points off the top spot and has a lot to do if he is to record his 85th career win. Ferrari's poor season to date is unlikely to get better with hopes dwindling that the 36-year-old will add to his sole victory of the season although the seven-time world champion characteristically refuses to rule it out. Schumi and Ferrari still in the fight \"Contrary to many other people's opinions, we have in no means written ourselves off, even though we have to admit that the situation has worsened recently, rather than improved,\" said the German, referring to the problems with this season's car. \"But that doesn't mean that it can't be improved again, and that's exactly what we're working on.\" The limelight is falling on two young pretenders to Schumacher's throne as Sunday's race approaches. The battle between McLaren's flying Finn Kimi Raikkonen and championship leader Renault's speedy Spaniard Fernando Alonso is diverting eyes from the world record holding German on his own turf. Kimi aims to keep heat on leader Alonso Raikkonen must finish the German Grand Prix for the first time in five attempts to close the gap on Alonso if he is to keep his own championship hopes alive. The Finn retired from last year's race because of a rear wing failure and this season has been plagued by technical problems which most recently cost him 10 places on the starting grid in each of the last two rounds. Despite those penalties for engine failure, the 25-year-old managed to finish second and third but he will have to increase his total of three race wins if he is to make a significant impression on the 26-point chasm that separates him from Alonso. \"The battle for the championship is still on and I am determined to get a good result and work on closing the gap,\" said the Finn. \"The (car) has good speed and we need to make the most of it this weekend.\" Montoya doing McLaren team mate no favors Raikkonen's car is obviously a fast one this season but he's not the only driver in a McLaren hot seat. Colombia's Juan Pablo Montoya is not to going to make way for his team mate while his own hopes of the title, however small, remain alive. \"I am really looking forward to racing again this weekend in Germany,\" said Montoya, who won at Hockenheim for Williams two years ago and got his first victory for McLaren in Britain two weeks ago. \"I enjoy racing at Hockenheim, I have performed well here and won in the past and I am aiming for a strong result like at Silverstone.\" Consistent Ferdy the man to beat at Hockenheim Championship leader Alonso, meanwhile, has been impressively consistent for Renault so far this season, winning five times and failing to score points only at the Canadian Grand Prix, where he crashed, and in Indianapolis. The Spaniard is setting the pace and the standard this season so, problems aside, Alonso will again be the man to beat at Hockenheim.",

The two-time world champion will be looking to extend his winning streak to five races this year. Alonso, who has been battling with a broken collarbone and a sprained ankle for the last two races of the season, is looking for his first win since he retired from the sport two weeks ago. \"I'm really looking forward to this weekend,\" Alonso told reporters after his victory at Silverstone, adding that he was \"very happy\" with his performance this season. But the Spaniard will have to work hard to stay in contention in his home country of Germany, where he has already secured a place in F1's top 10. He will also have a chance to challenge for a spot in next year's World Championship, which he won with McLaren last year in Indianapolis. Ferrari, however, have yet to win a race in Germany since Alonso's return to the series two years ago, and will not be able to do so this time around. McLaren's Michael Schumacher, meanwhile, has a tough task ahead of him as he looks to build on his title success in Canada and the United States. Hamilton, Ferrari and Williams have already clinched the championship with victories in Britain, Canada, Colombia and Colombia, respectively, but Hamilton and Ferrari are still on course for their first title since the Canadian Grand prix in 2015. Williams and McLaren are also in a strong position to claim the top three spots in their respective constructors' championship groups, with Hamilton leading the way with four races to go and Alonso leading Ferrari by a wide margin with seven races remaining. Both Williams drivers have been on a collision course with Ferrari for two of their last three races, while Ferrari have struggled to keep up with the pace on the grid. In the end, the two drivers will go head-to-head with each other in terms of pace and power. Schumi, a former Formula 1 driver, was the only other driver to have won a title with Williams last season and is now in pole position for next weekend's British GP. His team-mate Alonso is the reigning world championship champion, having won the Australian and British races in 2013 and 2014."

She will share the prestigious award with US compatriot Oliver Williamson. The jury from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said the Americans' research had shown how \"economic analysis can shed light on most forms of social organization.\" Ostrom, a professor at Indiana University, was honored for her \"analysis of economic governance,\" especially in relation to the management of common property or property under common control. The political scientist's work challenges the widely accepted belief that common property is poorly managed and should be either regulated by central authorities or privatized, it added. She carried out numerous studies showing how self-organization and local-level management work to keep common resources viable. Her studies included both natural resources, such as forests, and artificial structures, for example police forces. Ostrom told Swedish television that she felt \"great surprise and appreciation\" and was \"in shock\" about being the first woman to win the prize. The pros and cons of big firms In his work, co-prizewinner Oliver Williamson, of University of California, Berkeley, examines why large corporations tend to arise - and why they do not - based on the cost and complexity of transactions, according to the Nobel committee. \"He has taught us to regard markets, firms, associations, agencies, and even households from the perspective of their contribution to the resolution of conflict,\" the jury said. Williamson authored 'The Economic Institutions of Capitalism' in 1975, a landmark text of the 'new institutional economics' movement that questioned the idea of firms as simple profit-making machines. Last but not least The Nobel prize for economics is the only Nobel award that was not created by the will of Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel in 1896. It was actually founded by the Swedish central bank, the Sverige Riksbank, to celebrate its tri-centenary a year earlier. It was awarded for the first time in 1969 under its official name: the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel. But although it was the last \"Nobel prize\" to be created and the last to be announced each year, the prize is not a poor relation in monetary terms. Winners of the awards for peace, literature, medicine, physiology, chemistry and physics all receive 10 million Swedish crowns (969,000 euros). A good year for women This year was a record year for women laureates. German-Romanian writer Herta Mueller won the Nobel Prize for Literature. Australian-American Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider of the United States were awarded the prize for medicine. And Ada Yonath of Israel was one of three scientists recognized for her work in chemistry. Americans more or less swept the board this year. Nine of the 11 laureates were US citizens.

        "target": "The Sun Sets Slowly Over Brandenburg's Tropical Dream Having suffered many disappointments concerning publically funded projects, the state of Brandenburg hoped a tropical leisure center would offer a ray of hope. Instead the ailing concern is just bringing more gloom. The economically depressed eastern German state of Brandenburg has seen its fair share of bitter experiences when it comes to huge public investment projects since German unification in 1990. Against this background, state authorities were pleased when Malaysian businessman Colin Au built a huge tropical-feeling leisure center in Brandenburg without any subsidies. The center, which opened about a year ago, was to become a symbol of economic success in a region where unemployment still hovers around the 20 percent mark. But the leisure time park, which has already swallowed a little under 100 million euros ($120 million) in private investment, is now going to have to depend on public funding to avoid another economic fiasco in Brandenburg. State authorities in Brandenburg haven't been too successful in their public investment policy in the past 10 years, to put it mildly. A grand plan to build one of the world's most modern chip-producing factories there burst like a bubble in 2003. The much-talked about Brandenburg-Berlin International airport still seems light years away from being built. Line of failures looked to be ended by Au's vision Another beacon of economic hope disappeared in 2002 when a company planning to build gas-filled transport airships went bust despite considerable subsidies. But Au's vision for the abandoned dome which the airship company needed as a hangar offered Brandenburg another chance. In the middle of nowhere, he created what he named his \"Tropical Islands\" wonderland, sporting everything from sandy beaches, lakes and a Laguna to a Caribbean-style village. The economics ministry in Brandenburg was over the moon to see Au originally agreeing to build the facility without any state subsidies. And Au himself had no doubt at the time that he could well do without them. Overestimated visitor numbers tell sorry story But the center's first year in operation tells a different story. Colin Au, who has meanwhile left Brandenburg and transferred matters to a German management company, had expected some 1.5 million visitors to come to Tropical Islands within the first year, but only some 950,000 will have turned up by the end of 2005. It seems highly unlikely that visitor numbers will increase considerably in future, placing a question mark on the viability of the whole centre. But Brandenburg's economics ministry is certain that the park will be in the black as of 2008. To make the place more attractive, it has agreed to shell out 15 million euros in subsidies for yet another reconstruction and marketing effort. After all, the leisure time center has a workforce of about 500 and is thus the biggest employer in an otherwise depressed region marked by a high jobless rate. Tropical center down but not out...not yet \"We hope the money will help make the Tropical Islands resort better known throughout Europe according to the new marketing concept hammered out the management,\" ministry spokesman Steffen Kammrath said. \"This leisure time center is unique and has to be marketed as such. What you have there is a tropical and water world 12 months a year with a lot of attractive offers to spend a whale of a time there.\" Some commentators believe that state subsidies may prolong the center's life span, but will not be able to avoid its demise in the long run. But the idea of also making it more attractive for tourists from all over Europe seems unrealistic to them if the resort's management can't even get enough visitors from home to ensure a profitable operation.",
        "generated_story": "The Sun Sets Slowly Over Brandenburg's Tropical Islands Resort The sun sets slowly over the tropical islands resort in the German resort town of the same name. It's the first time the resort has been open to the public since the end of 2005. The resort opened its doors in 2003 with a total budget of 120 million euros ($120 million). The first year was a success, with more than 1,000 guests staying for 12 months. In the second year, it was open for business. \"We have a lot of work to do,\" said Colin Au, chief operating officer at the hotel, which is located on the island of Laguna, about a half-mile (1.6 kilometers) from the city center. He said that the company was \"very happy\" with the results, adding that \"it's been a great success so far, and we are very excited about the prospects for the future.\" The hotel is part of a chain of resorts in Germany and the Netherlands, where it opened in 1990. Since then, the business has grown by about 30 percent, according to a report by Steffen Kammrath, a partner at a consultancy firm in Berlin. A lot has happened since then. There have been many changes, but the most significant one is the opening of Tropical Island Resort in 2006. That's where the sun set slowly, as it did in 2002, when it began to set in a tropical-style setting. At the time of opening, there were just a handful of hotels in Europe and Asia, including the one that opened last year. But that's all changed in 2008. Now there are a few more hotels opening up. One of them is a resort called Tropical islands, located off the coast of Cape Verde, near the southern tip of Germany. This resort is one of Europe's most popular vacation spots. And it's not just the Caribbean islands that are attracting the attention of tourists. Some of these resorts are located in other European countries, such as Spain, Portugal, Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal. They're also popular with tourists, who come from all over Europe to visit the islands. For the past 10 years, they've been opening their doors to tourists from around the world. Their main attraction is their resort, called the \"Tropical Islands,\" which has become a popular tourist destination in recent years. However, this is not the case for all the other resorts that have opened up to visitors. On the contrary, some of those resorts have had to adapt to changing climates and changing lifestyles in order to keep up with changing tourist demand. So, for example, in 2005, one resort decided to open up a new resort on a Caribbean island."

Bayern's coach Juergen Klinsmann says Hoffenheim are legitimate contenders, but commercial manager Uli Hoeness disagrees. When the Bundesliga scheduled Bayern's home match against Hoffenheim in the league's unloved Friday night slot, they probably didn't imagine that it would turn out to be the match of the first half of the season. Indeed, few experts or fans thought that Hoffenheim, a first-division debutante located in a southern German village with 3,000 inhabitants, would give mighty Munich a run for its money. But it's the first week of December, and Hoffenheim top the table by three points. They also have a much better goal difference than their second-placed rivals -- and that has drawn praise from Bayern's coach, Juergen Klinsmann. \"I have the highest estimation of Hoffenheim because they've built the squad very ambitiously, rationally and with very good players,\" Klinsmann told DPA news agency. \"They can be proud of that.\" Klinsmann said he thought that the club could establish itself among the top three or four sides in Germany in the years to come and qualify for international competition next season. He also had words of praise for Hoffenheim's software billionaire patron, Dietmar Hopp, whose money has funded the club's ascent. \"There's nothing negative about it,\" Klinsmann said. \"He used to play for the club, is a soccer man through and through and helped the team get on its feet.\" Some fans have criticized Hopp and Hoffenheim for paying inflating salaries and luring talent away from other clubs instead of developing homegrown players. In fact, Hoffenheim's official salary budget is about average for the Bundesliga. Hoeness sounds his horn But while Bayern's coach was praising his opponents to the skies, Munich's commercial manager Uli Hoeness has been trying to play with their heads. On the heels of Bayern's convincing win over Leverkusen last weekend, Hoeness is back to taunting rivals. \"The performance we showed in the second half against Leverkusen will be enough against Hoffenheim,\" Hoeness told the German soccer magazine kicker. Hoeness also dropped a none-too-thinly-veiled hint that Hoffenheim's personnel expenditures were far higher than the officially released figures and scoffed at the idea that strategy would determine the outcome of Friday's match. \"Games are decided by the better players, not by tactics,\" Hoeness said. \"And of course, we've got better players than Hoffenheim.\" But that particular verbal attack may represent some wishful thinking of the manager's part. Hoffenheim coach Ralf Rangnick is one of only two current Bundesliga skippers with a winning record against Munich. Rangnick, whose team cruised past Bielefeld last weekend to keep Bayern three points back, reacted to Hoeness' remarks with a shrug. \"We're preparing for Munich exactly the same way we did against Bielefeld,\" Rangnick said. In any case, soccer fans in Germany know what they'll be doing Friday evening -- finding a bar with cable sports television to watch a top match that no one, before the start of the season, would have considered possible.",

But, he added, \"we're going to have to work very hard to make sure that we get the best out of our players and our fans.\" \"We have a lot to learn from Leverkusen and we're looking forward to the second half,\" said Ralf Rangnick, head of marketing at Hoffenerheim, adding that \"there's a good chance we'll be able to improve on the results we have had so far this season.\" The former Bayern Munich striker, who has been in charge of Bayern since the end of last season, was also quoted as saying: \"It's not just about the players, it's about how they're playing. It's also about our culture and how we want them to be successful in their own way. We want to give them a chance to show that they can compete in a very difficult league.\" Ranging up on his comments, the German coach also said that his players were \"doing a great job\" and \"they're doing a really good job.\" He also stressed the importance of having a strong squad, which has seen a number of key players step up in recent weeks. Racking up his praise for the team's performances and the manner in which they've performed, Ranger said the squad was in \"great shape\" as a result of their efforts to build up their squad and improve their chances of qualifying for next year's Champions League group stage.

Although the number of farms has declined over the decades, production has actually increased -- especially at dairy farms. Modern automation technology and robotics are helping to keep both cows and farmers happy, but at the cost of jobs.",
        "generated_story": "Automation in the Dairy Cow Industry In the decades since the invention of the milk cow, the dairy cow industry has been transformed into a whole new industry. Automation is the key to the success of dairy products. Dairy products are no longer just a commodity, they are also an integral part of our daily lives. The dairy industry is now the world's largest dairy market, with more than 1.5 billion cows produced every year. Today, milk production is growing at a rate of 3.6 million cows a year, according to a new report from the National Dairy Farmers Association (NDFA). The report said that milk products were becoming more and more expensive to produce, and that the cost of producing milk had risen to $1,000 a cow by the end of 2016. \"We are now at the point where we can produce milk that is ready to be used for human consumption,\" said the report, which is based on a study conducted in conjunction with the World Dairy Council (WDC). \"But milk is not the only dairy product that can be made from milk. Milk is also used to make milk for dairy cows.\" Dairy cows are becoming increasingly important to dairy farmers, who are increasingly turning to automated production methods to meet the growing demand for milk and eggs. In addition to this, there is a growing number of cows that are being slaughtered by automated processes, such as machine learning, artificial intelligence and robotics. This has led to an increase in production of milk in recent years, as well as a rise in milk prices. However, it is still not enough to overcome the challenges of growing milk from cow to cow. As a result, cows have become increasingly dependent on automated machinery to keep milk fresh and ready for consumption. That is, until recently, when the cow's milk was frozen and stored in a refrigerated container. Since then, cow milk has become the main source of protein for cows and calves, but the process has also become more complex and time-consuming. For example, in order to grow milk cows, farmers have to develop new methods of processing milk, a process that takes about three to four hours to complete. These methods are not only more efficient but also more cost-effective in terms of reducing the time it takes to process milk; they can also be more environmentally friendly and reduce the risk of spoilage and disease. It is therefore no surprise that cows in particular are more sensitive to changes in temperature and humidity than cows. They are therefore more likely to eat milk without the need for refrigeration. And this is especially true when it comes to beef products, especially when compared to milk produced by cow-fed cows or dairy cattle. There is no doubt about the importance of this technology in dairy production, however, that it will have a positive impact on cows' health and well-being over the long term."

At #Geneva2, they tweeted: \"Forming a transitional body is our major priority,\" leaving people in no doubt that the Syrian National Council would not want to include Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Assad's government, on the other hand, is relying on classic propaganda and loyal state media representatives in Geneva. An impressive entourage of dominant journalists from state-run media outlets is constantly at hand, accompanying the government delegation and making sure they get their point across at press conferences. Lakhdar Brahimi even had a small altercation with a journalist from a Syrian state news agency, who made a political statement under the pretense of asking the UN mediator a question. \"Are there any signs that Saudi Arabia, Turkey and other countries would stop the support of terrorism in Syria?,\" she asked in somewhat shaky English, before Brahimi interrupted her. \"Please, please, there is no point in asking such questions!\" Such exchanges hint at the type of negotiating style the experienced diplomat and mediator Brahimi must have behind the scenes. 'Wish us luck' Lakhdar Brahimi described the preliminary talks that took place in Geneva as encouraging and asked for patience. He said that because the peace conference had come about at the last minute and the delegations had therefore only been appointed very recently, there hadn't been enough time to hold preliminary discussions - a task that the delegations were now catching up on. \"We never expected it to be easy and I'm sure it's not going to be,\" he said. \"But I think the two parties understand what is at stake. Their country is in very, very bad shape.\" He added: \"The huge ambition of this process is to save Syria. Nothing less than that.\" After appealing to the willingness of both parties to negotiate, he simply added: \"So wish us luck!\" Fight for freedom As the official delegations held talks with UN mediator Brahimi in the Palais des Nations, the European headquarters of the United Nations, hundreds of Syrian expatriates who had come from all over Europe protested outside, forming a sea of red, white and black Syrian flags on the Place des Nations. With their presence outside the UN gates they wanted to show that despite all the government propaganda, the Syrian National coalition has a lot of support from the Syrian people. Thirty-two-year-old Ziad Malki came to Geneva from Zurich to show his solidarity. Ziad knows how it feels to be deprived of his freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. In 2005, he was arrested at a demonstration in Damascus and says he was tortured during his time in prison. Now he is fighting for a new Syria from outside the country's borders. Ziad is sure that with Bashar al-Assad and his family, there will be nothing new. \"We don't want this man to be in",

He is one of the few opposition figures who has managed to make it to the negotiating table. On Friday (24.01.2014) he met with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in the Swiss resort city of Zurich. The Syrian leader, who is also a member of Syria's National Council, was the first opposition figure to arrive at Geneva in just about an hour, according to his spokesman, Lahkkdar Brahimi. \"The Syrian regime is in a state of crisis,\" he told reporters in Zurich, Switzerland, adding that he was \"very happy\" to meet with Assad. However, he added, \"the Syrian government is not going to give up on the fight against terrorism. It is a war against the regime, and it is against this regime that we have to fight terrorism.\" \"It is the people who are fighting for the lives of our people, not the other way around. We are the victims of this war,\" said Faisal Mekdad, a spokesman for Assad's political party, the Free Syrian Army (FSA). \"We have a responsibility to protect our own people and to ensure that they have the right to live and work in peace and security in their own country.\" He added that the United Nations would continue to monitor the situation in Syria as it was in 2005, when the war broke out between rebels and government forces. In the end, Assad was forced to flee the country and fled to Turkey, where he is now living with his wife and two children. At the same time, his regime has not been able to form a transitional government in Damascus, which is governed by a pro-regime constitution. His government has refused to recognize him as president, saying he has no power to impose his will on his people. This has led to tensions between the opposition and the government, as well as a lack of trust in his ability to carry out his own agenda. 'I don't know what I would do if I had to do it again' \"Brahimi said in an interview with DW."

        "target": "Italy's navy to patrol with Libyan ships to curb human trafficking Italy wants to work more closely with Libya to limit the number of sea crossings by migrants and potential asylum seekers. But what are the consequences? Italy's prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni, does not want to wait any longer for EU countries to show solidarity in distributing asylum seekers throughout the bloc. On Thursday he announced in Rome that the Italian navy would be patrolling with Libyan ships just off the Libyan coastline. The aim, Gentiloni says, is to curb human trafficking and bring migrants back from the smugglers' boats to Libya. According to the Italian government's figures, 93,000 migrants have arrived in Italy so far this year. At least 2,000 have drowned in the attempt to cross the Mediterranean - the true figure is unknown. Italy has already threatened to stop allowing boats carrying rescued migrants to dock in Italian ports, or that it may issue migrants with documents that would allow them to travel on to other European countries. Rome has not yet implemented either policy, but the government has made clear that Italy will soon run out of options. The EU Commissioner for Migration Dimitris Avramopoulos acknowledged, again, in Brussels on Thursday that \"Europe continues to face high migratory pressures. And Italy more than (almost) any others.\" The European Commission issued a letter offering more aid and personnel to help manage migration better. Accommodation will soon be full The office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, wrote at the beginning of July that \"Close to 200,000 accommodation places are available for refugees and migrants across [Italy], but are nearly all full.\" The High Commissioner referred particularly to the numbers of people dying when he warned, \"What is happening in front of our eyes in Italy is an unfolding tragedy.\" The United Nations anticipates that another 100,000 migrants will come to Italy via Libya before the end of this year. The number of arrivals is already 20 percent higher than last year; and the number of dead, those who could not be saved, would rise accordingly. According to UN estimates, the Mediterranean remains the \"deadliest\" refugee route in the world. Italian government statistics say that around 600,000 people have arrived in Italian ports since the start of the crisis in 2014. It is unclear how many have since traveled on to Austria, France or Switzerland. Once migrants are registered in Italy and accommodated in camps, they are not held there. If, however, they leave the accommodation without giving notice, they forfeit their claim to subsistence and social services. Most of the migrants are from African countries, and many try to travel on to France, for example. 300 people are currently sleeping on the beach in Ventimiglia, on the French border, hoping to take a bus or train to France. However, the border is being policed by French officials. Migrants who are caught are sent back to Italy. Austria has announced that it too will close its border with Italy if the number of migrants starts to rise. Repatriation and distribution are difficult Last year 120,000 new asylum applications were made in Italy. Around 50 percent of these are rejected. The asylum seekers are then supposed to leave the country. However, the process of people either returning voluntarily or being deported is very slow. The interior ministry has therefore announced that it will reinforce repatriation programs. The redistribution of asylum seekers from Italy, as agreed by the European Union, is well behind target. Two years ago the aim was to resettle 120,000 people. So far, only 24,676 people have been redistributed, the EU Commission said on Thursday: 7,873 from Italy, and 16,803 from Greece. The numbers are low not just because of the reluctance of other EU countries to take the refugees in, but also because of Italian delays in the registration of possible candidates. Asylum seekers from Eritrea are the most likely to fulfill the criteria for redistribution. Around 25,000 are currently living in Italy, but only 10,000 have been registered with the EU Commission and the European Asylum Support Office as possible candidates. Migration Commissioner Avramopoulos has announced that Italy will be given more help and logistical support in this area.",
        "generated_story": "EU Migration Commissioner Avramopoulos: Italy facing 'an unfolding tragedy' The European Union's migration commissioner has warned that Italy is facing an \"unprecedented tragedy\" in the Mediterranean region. The EU Commission said on Thursday it was \"deeply concerned\" by Italy's handling of the migrant crisis. \"We are deeply concerned about the situation in Italy,\" the EU Commissioner for Migration said in a statement released by the European Commission. He said Italy was facing \"an unprecedented tragedy,\" adding that \"it is not the first time Italy has faced this kind of crisis.\" \"It is the second time in two years that we have had to deal with such a crisis,\" he said, referring to Greece, Libya and Eritrea. Italy, which is currently the largest EU member state, is also facing a \"serious humanitarian crisis\" due to the influx of migrants from the Middle East and North Africa, according to a UN report released Thursday. Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni said Thursday that the country's refugee crisis was the result of a lack of cooperation between Italy and other member states in order to cope with the crisis, and that it would be \"very, very difficult\" for Italy to meet its obligations under international humanitarian law, the report said. It did not say whether Italy would continue to cooperate with other EU countries in its efforts to stem the flow of asylum seekers, but it did say that Italian authorities were working closely with Greece and Italy on a plan to provide asylum to migrants seeking asylum in Europe. According to Italian media reports, Italian officials said they were aware of \"a number of reports\" that migrants were being sent to Italy from other European countries, including Greece. But Italian Foreign Minister Filippo Grandi, who has been in Rome since the beginning of July, said he had no information on how many people had entered Italy in 2014, saying that there were \"no indications that they had crossed the border.\" The Italian government has also said it will not allow migrants to enter Italy unless they are accompanied by family members or relatives who have fled persecution in their home countries. In a letter to EU foreign ministers, Italy said that if migrants had not been allowed to reach Italy by this year, they would not have been able to apply for asylum at the end of that year."

        "target": "Is China seeking regime-change in North Korea? The sudden reduction in aggressive rhetoric and actions by North Korea has led to suggestions that Pyongyang has realized it has pushed its only ally in the region to the brink of severing its friendship. The announcement in Pyongyang on May 13 of the promotion of Jang Jong-nam to \"minister of the People's Armed Forces\" came out of the blue. Until recently, the little-known commander of an army corps in coastal Kangwon Province, Jang has replaced Kim Kyok-sik, a four-star general with a long track record of loyal service to the regime. The reasons for 70-year-old Kim's replacement are not clear - as with most of the political maneuvers in North Korea - but it may have been his loyalty that cost him his position in the politburo. Kim was widely seen as a hawk in the regime and is believed to have been in command of the operation to shell the South Korean island of Yeonpyeongdo in November 2010, an incident that killed four people, destroyed civilians' homes and infrastructure and dramatically worsened the already strained relationship between Pyongyang and Seoul. By sacrificing Kim, analysts believe, North Korea is signaling that it is backing away from the confrontational stance it adopted after the United Nations imposed new sanctions in the wake of the nation's third underground nuclear test in February. And there are other indicators that Pyongyang is seeking to return to the status quo. The North's troops have been permitted to step down from the highest state of preparedness for war that was initially ordered when South Korea and the US began a series of annual military exercises. Missiles withdrawn Similarly, two Musudan intermediate-range missiles that were identified as being on mobile launchers being operated in eastern areas of the country have apparently been ordered to return to base. In late April, there was concern that test-launches of the missiles would be a further escalation by Kim Jong-un's government and a message that it would not bow to international pressure to halt its nuclear and missile development programs. But the analysts believe the tokens of Pyongyang's goodwill have come too late. \"For the North Korean leader, this is a very difficult time,\" Toshimitsu Shigemura, a professor at Tokyo's Waseda University and an authority on North Korean affairs, told DW. \"Timing is very important here and it is possible that China is moving to abandon Kim Jong-un. The atmosphere between the two nations is changing. China may have decided that it is time for a regime-change in the North, they will not permit the collapse of the country because they do not want chaos on their own borders.\" Further evidence that Beijing is slowly tightening the screw on its erstwhile ally comes as more state-run financial institutions sever their links with banks in North Korea. The latest institution to adhere to the government's orders to halt transactions across the border is the Bank of China, one of the four major banks in the country, which announced on May 7 that it would cease dealings with the Foreign Trade Bank of North Korea, which has been identified as being involved in Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs. Contingency plan in place Intelligence sources have passed on to DW information that Beijing has a contingency plan in place for when Kim Jong-un's control over the country crumbles. The reports confirm that China is indeed quietly encouraging regime change and is grooming Kim's brother, Kim Jong-nam to take over his role. At 42, Kim Jong-nam is the oldest son of Kim Jong-il, the dictator who ruled North Korea with an iron fist for 17 years until his sudden death in December 2011. Kim Jong-nam had been expected to assume the leadership after his father's death, but fell from favor spectacularly in 2001 when he was detained with two women and a boy aged 4 at Tokyo's Narita International Airport travelling on a forged Dominican Republic passport. He later admitted that he had wanted to visit Disneyland. He subsequently lived in Macau and Beijing, under the close watch of the Chinese authorities. The reports suggest that after Kim Jong-nam is installed in Pyongyang, his brother will be permitted to go into exile, probably in China. The tactic is not without its pitfalls, however, in part due to the efficiency of the campaign to deify their young leader as the future of the nation. Kim Jong-nam as 'new king' \"China may be dreaming of appointing Kim Jong-nam as the new king - and he is more preferable to the West than Kim Jong Un - but the problem is that he is not known in North Korea,\" said Ken Kato, director of Tokyo-based Human Rights in Asia. \"Many people in Japan know much about the North Korean 'Royal Family,' but this information is hidden in North Korea,\" he said. \"Even residents of Pyongyang know very little about Kim Jong-nam.\" Yet the reports are gaining credence among North Korea-watchers. Jun Okumura, a political analyst with the Eurasia Group, told DW that North Korea withdrawing",

The report said that the North's leader, Kim Kyok-sik, was born in the People's Armed Forces in Pyongyang in December 2011, and that he had been living in exile in Macau for 17 years. In a statement released on May 13, the Chinese Foreign Minister Jun Okumura told DW that Kim had become \"the new king\" of the country. \"He is the leader of all the people in this country,\" he said, adding that \"he is also the father of our country.\" Kim is believed to be the son of Kim Jong Un, who has been in power since the end of his father's reign in November 2010. On May 7, a delegation from the Foreign Trade Bank of China arrived in Seoul to meet with Kim's wife Jang, his son-in-law and other family members. According to the report, it was Kim who had the most influence on the family's decision to move to Seoul. Kim was also known as the \"father of peace\" and \"grandfather\" to many North Koreans. He was the first person to hold the office of head of state in a foreign country, which was opened by Kim in 2001. Since then, he has held the position of vice-president, chief of staff and general manager of a state-owned bank in Musudan province in western China, as well as a number of other high-ranking positions in his family and close confidants, including his wife and two children. During his time in office, there was a lot of speculation about whether or not he would be re-elected as president. But it is not clear whether he will be able to do that. It is unclear, for example, if he'll be allowed to run a business in China or in Japan, but it seems unlikely. If he is to become president, then he's going to have to step down from his post as leader and take a leave of absence. That's not a good sign for Kim, because it means he could be replaced by someone else. And it's hard to say for sure. After all, what kind of person would want to take over the reins of power? It's very difficult to know for certain. There's a long list of people who are not willing to give up their lives for the sake of dynasties. What do you think? Do you agree with me? I don't know. I'm not sure what I think about it at all. Maybe I'll just say that I like the idea of having a family in my own country and not having to worry about the consequences of my actions. Do I have a son? Absolutely not. You can't have one of those things.\" But I do think that if I had to choose between the two, I'd choose the latter. As it stands now, my son would probably be Kim. His father is a former military leader who is now a professor at Waseda University in Busan Province in South Korea, where he studied political science at the University of Tokyo. At the same time, when he was still a student at Narita International Airport in September 2010, one can only imagine what Kim would have done if it wasn't for his regime."

Prosecutors said the remote town of Las Varas in Chihuahua state was the scene of Wednesday's battle between affiliates of the Ciudad Juarez cartel and a gang from the state of Sinaloa. Police said fighting escalated when patrols arrived. Fourteen people were found dead; 12 others were hospitalized. Grenades, launchers and rifles were found. The mountainous region is used as a corridor for smuggling into the US. El Chapo effect Chihuahua security commissioner Oscar Alberto Aparicio said a Black Hawk helicopter was called in as police chased surviving gang members through the area known for marijuana and opium poppy production. Two police officers had been killed in a \"cowardly\" way in the area a week ago, he said. In a similar incident last Friday, 17 gunmen were killed during a shootout with police on a highway in Sinaloa, Mexico's northwestern state. Sinaloa was the home base of Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, whose extradition to the US in January apparently left gangsters in a struggle for control of criminal syndicates. Homicides have surged in recent months, with the number of persons killed in May put at 2,186, the highest since the collection of such statistics began 20 years ago.

Narcotics smuggling into the US has become a multibillion-dollar (multibillion-euro) business for Mexican drug cartels.

US President Donald Trump and Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto are expected to meet in Hamburg on Friday to discuss the latest developments in Mexico's drug war, which has killed more than 1,000 people since the start of the conflict. The Mexican military said on Wednesday that it had launched an investigation into the incident, but that the investigation was still ongoing. \"The investigation is ongoing and we are hopeful that we will be able to provide the necessary information to the Mexican authorities,\" Trump said at a joint news conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel at the G20 summit. Mexico has been battling drug cartels for the past 20 years, with the country's largest drug trafficking organization, the Guyanese cartel, known as the \"Black Hawk,\" responsible for trafficking millions of dollars worth of drugs and human rights abuses. On Wednesday, Mexican Prime Minister Oscar Alberto Aparicio announced that he would be sending a team of US and German troops to Mexico to investigate the case. He also said that Mexico would cooperate with international law enforcement agencies in their efforts to crack down on drug traffickers. Trump, who campaigned on a promise to end the drug trade with Mexico, has called for a \"zero tolerance\" approach to drug dealing. In a statement on Thursday, US Secretary of State John Kerry said the Trump administration was \"deeply concerned\" about the violence and urged Mexico \"to act decisively\" in its fight against organized crime. Mexican officials have said they are working closely with federal prosecutors to try to extradite the alleged drug trafficker and his family to face charges of murder and other charges. Last month, a federal court in Chihuahua ordered the extradition of two men suspected of financing the cartel's operations in southern Mexico. A federal prosecutor said in January that Mexican prosecutors had opened a criminal case against the men, and that they were cooperating with authorities in an attempt to stop them from carrying out the operation. President Trump has said he wants to make Mexico the world's most drug-free country."

The men sentenced to death on Wednesday were part of the special forces division ordered in August to retake three towns in Borno state, which had been taken over by the Islamist Boko Haram insurgents. Their lawyer, Femi Falana, said the 54 men were sentenced to death by firing squad and five had been acquitted. They were accused of conspiring to commit mutiny against the authorities of the 7th Division of the Nigerian army, which is on the frontline.

It is subject to approval by top military officials, but there has so far been no indication that senior officers oppose the court martial. They were not available for comment afterwards. There was a similar case in Nigeria in September, when 12 soldiers were sentenced to death for mutiny after firing on their commanding officer in the northeast city of Maiduguri. The 7th Division, based in Maiduguri, leads the offensive but there are numerous reports of troops refusing to deploy. Soldiers have regularly complained that they lack weapons, food, and other basic supplies to fight the Islamists, who are reported to have tanks, rocket-propelled-grenade launchers, and other heavy weaponry.

The 53-year-old will be leading Germany's second biggest lender. After successfully weathering the Great Recession, Commerzbank's board of directors appears to want to signal a continuation in its growth trend with Martin Zielke's appointment as the new CEO as of May 1. Outgoing head Martin Blessing announced last year he would not renew his contract. Zielke had previously been put in charge of implementing reforms in the company's private banking sector following the recession. His restructuring measures attracted 800,000 new customers to the bank and changed the image of the 146-year-old financial institution. The 53-year-old has an illustrious career across several German financial institutions to look back on, having started at the teller of a local branch in 1983. Zielke's crowning achievement The beleaguered German financial institution recorded a profit of more than a billion euros (more than $1.1 billion) last year. It was the first time in five years that Commerzbank had made such profitable gains, which it said would translate into paid dividends for shareholders. A good portion of the yields were achieved by a restructuring and expansion drive of Commerzbank's private banking arm under Zielke's leadership. However, some of that money will go to the German government, as it had to step in and rescue the bank in 2009 to the tune of 18 billion euros ($25 billion at the time) by chiefly acquiring more than 15 percent of the shares, effectively nationalizing part of Commerzbank's operations. ss/jlw (dpa, Reuters)",

In a statement on May 1, the bank said the new CEO would take over from Martin Blessing, who stepped down after five years as CEO in 2009. \"We are very happy with the appointment of Martin as our new head of finance,\" the statement said, adding that \"the board will continue to work closely with Martin to ensure that he is the right person for the job at the appropriate time.\" \"Martin will be the first person to lead a bank in the history of the German financial industry to have a CEO who is well-known for his ability to steer a company through difficult times and for being a strong leader in a difficult economic environment,\" Commerz said. It did not say how long Martin would be in charge, however, and said he would stick around until the end of 2009, when the company's share price would rise to 25 billion euros ($25 billion). \"The board is going to take a look at all the things that are important to us,\" Martin said at a news conference in Berlin. He added that the board would also look into the possibility of merging the two companies into a single bank, which has been struggling with high debt levels and high operating costs.   The announcement came just days after a German newspaper reported that a new chairman had been named to replace Martin, a former chief financial officer who had resigned in protest over the financial crisis. dpa/jm (Reuters, Reuters)"

In a document on combating AIDS, the Commission said that as of 2007, around 2.2 million people carried the virus in the EU and nearby countries, an increase of 700,000 from 2001. According to Commission figures, around 730,000 of these live within the EU's 27 member states. France, Italy, Spain and Portugal have relatively high infection rates - ranging from 0.4 percent to 0.5 percent. In the Baltic country of Estonia, the infection rate stands at around 1.3 percent. In neighboring Ukraine, around 1.6 percent of the population has been diagnosed with HIV, while in Russia around 1.1 percent are HIV positive. The Commission warned that now was not the time for Europe to drop its guard on preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS, adding that in some neighboring countries the number of people carrying the virus had doubled. EU Health Commissioner Androulla Vassiliou said political momentum in the fight against HIV/AIDS needed to be maintained, adding that people must \"take responsibility for themselves and their partners by talking about and practicing safe sex and going for HIV testing.\" A cure for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has yet to be found more than a quarter century after it was brought to public attention. However, efficient treatments exist to slow the evolution of the virus. dfm/AFP Editor: Chuck Penfold",

According to a survey by the European Commission, more than half of those who live in EU countries do not know they have the disease. In addition to the figures, the Commission also said that the number of cases of HIV and AIDS in their respective countries is much higher. \"We are aware of this, but we are not aware that it is happening in our own countries,\" said Androulla Vassiliou, commissioner for health and human rights at the commission, in a statement released on Monday. He added that a third of all HIV cases are reported to be linked to AIDS, which can be transmitted through contact with bodily fluids, such as blood, urine, saliva or saliva. This is a significant increase from 2001, when the first HIV test was carried out on a person who had been diagnosed with AIDS. Since then, there has been a rise in cases where the virus has spread to other people, including those living in countries with high rates of AIDS and those with low levels of immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In 2007, Spain, Portugal, Italy and Spain were among the countries that reported the most cases, with a total of 1.6 million cases reported in 2007. Spain and Italy were the only countries to report the highest rate of HIV cases. France and Germany, for example, reported an average of 2.4 cases a year, while Spain reported a figure of 3.5 cases in 2001. Both countries have high HIV rates, according to figures compiled by The Lancet medical journal. One in five of these cases have been reported as having HIV, and another one-third are suspected of being HIV positive.

UN leader Ban Ki-moon expressed \"deep regret\" on Monday that political leaders had failed to make progress on a constitution in Nepal, expressing concern about instability within the country. Security forces were put on high alert, with riot police patrolling streets after calls by the opposition for the resignation of Maoist Prime Minister Baburam Bhattarai. \"Nepal has entered an uncertain constitutional and political period,\" Ban warned in a statement read by his spokesman Martin Nesirky. \"The government and the political leaders, as well as leaders of various communities, need to demonstrate the courage and wisdom to come together to address the challenges the nation faces,\" the statement added. Repeated deadlines expired Politicians were to have agreed upon a new framework for the country's political future by Sunday. However, the representation of ethnic minorities and castes within a federal structure has proved a major sticking point in efforts to draw up a secular constitution. Bhattarai on Sunday said that parliament, elected in 2008 after a decade of civil war, would be disbanded after repeated deadlines had been broken. New elections are due to be held in November, but the opposition has criticized the premier's unilateral decision to call the poll.

Opposition parties have called for the postponement of the polls in a bid to prevent a repeat of a 2008 earthquake that killed more than 1,000 people. Nepal's president, Ban Ki-moon, said on Sunday that the country would hold an election next year. \"We have to make sure that elections are held in accordance with the constitution,\" Ban said at a news conference in Kathmandu. He said the election would be held \"in the best interest of democracy and human rights,\" adding that he was \"deeply concerned\" about the situation. Bhattarai, who has been in power for a decade, called on the government of Nepal to conduct an \"immediate and transparent\" election, saying that it would not be possible to do so without the help of political parties, including the Nepalese National Party (NPN), which has ruled since 1996 and 2006. In the past, elections have been held on a number of occasions, most recently in 2008, when the NPN government was forced to step down over a corruption scandal that led to the resignation of then prime minister Bimal Gurung. Since then, the opposition has staged a series of street protests, which have resulted in thousands of people being killed and hundreds of thousands displaced. On Sunday, a group of protesters blocked a highway in front of government buildings, demanding the release of jailed former Prime Minister Baburam Bhendra, accusing him of being a \"traitor\" and \"a traitor.\" The protesters have also blocked roads leading to government offices and other public places. They are also blocking access to schools, hospitals, schools and colleges, according to a UN report. UN envoy Martin Nesirky said that while the protests were peaceful, they were \"unacceptable\" because they did not represent the interests of ordinary people and were not representative of all Nepalis. Ban's comments came a day after the UN's special envoy for Nepali affairs, Biju Janjua, visited Nepal and said he expected the elections to go ahead as scheduled."

        "target": "A Delicious Accompaniment for Wine A regular companion of the fall season's wines is a treat called Zwiebelkuchen, literally, onion cake. It is a one-crust pie, eaten in most German wine regions during the fall wine season. Zwiebelkuchen is traditionally eaten with Federweisser, a young wine available in Germany in the fall. The link between the two is so strong that many Federweisser wines have a recipe for the onion cake on their labels. Here's a recipe for it: Ingredients: 1 packet yeast, active dry 1 teaspoon sugar 1 1/2 teaspoon salt 3 cups unbleached flour 1 tablespoon shortening 1 cup water (49 to 54 C / 120 to 130 F) 6 slices bacon -- diced 2 medium onions -- sliced 1/4 teaspoon cumin 1/2 teaspoon salt Pepper 1 egg yolk 1 cup sour cream Mix the yeast with the sugar, a teaspoon of salt and half a cup of flour. Blend in the shortening and warm water, then beat for two minutes. Add enough flour to make a soft dough, and then knead the dough until smooth and elastic, about five minutes. Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, then cover it and let it rise in a warm place for 30 minutes. Pat the dough into a lightly greased 12-inch pizza pan or onto a lightly greased baking sheet. Press up the edges to make a slight rim. Fry the bacon until crisp and drain it on absorbent paper. Add onions to the bacon grease, and cook slowly until tender, but not brown. Sprinkle the onions, bacon, cumin, half a teaspoon of salt and pepper over the dough. Bake the cake at 204 C (400 F) for 20 minutes. Blend the egg yolk and sour cream and pour the mixture over the Zwiebelkuchen. Bake it for another 10 to 15 minutes, until the cake is golden brown and the sour cream has set. Serve warm or at room temperature with white wine.",

It's easy to make, but it's also a great way to enjoy a good wine. Onion cake is one of the most popular dishes in Germany, and it takes about five minutes to prepare. The best part is that you don't have to wait too long for it to get to you. You can make it in two minutes and you'll be ready to go. There's a lot of variety to choose from, so I thought I'd share a few of my favorites with you in the comments section of this article. I'm going to start with the onion cake, because I think it will be the best dessert I've ever had in my life. And then there's the wine, which I love to drink. But I also like to serve it with a glass of sparkling wine and a bottle of wine that I can't wait to share with my family and friends. What do you think? What does it taste like? It tastes like wine? Well, it doesn't taste as good as it looks. That's because it has to be prepared in a way that's not just for you and your family but also for your friends and neighbors. This is what I like about onion cakes. They're really good for people who have never been to Germany before and who want to try something new every time they go there. \"I like the taste of it,\" I say, \"but it tastes a bit different than wine.\" Onion cakes are a popular dessert in German wine circles, especially when you're trying to find the right wine to pair with your favorite beer. If you've never tried them before, you know that they're not as tasty as they sound. So, if you have the time, go ahead and try them out. Do you like them? If not, I recommend them to anyone who likes to experiment with different kinds of wines. In the end, the result is a very good dessert that will last for at least another 10 to 15 minutes. For those who prefer to stick to a simple, easy-to-make dessert, this is an easy dessert to pass on to your next guest. We recommend it for those of you who are looking for something easy on the tongue, like a sponge cake or a chocolate cake with cream cheese frosting on top. Don't forget to take a look at the recipe and see what you can do with it."

        "target": "Bayern blast five as Schalke draw Bayern Munich stamped their authority over the Bundesliga on Saturday, with a ruthless 5-0 drubbing of Hannover at home. Meanwhile, second-placed Schalke and third-placed Frankfurt were forced to share the points. With many critics saying Bayern might as well be given the giant Bundesliga dish already, perhaps the struggle for second is shaping up to be the more compelling battle. But Saturday afternoon's clash between second-placed Schalke and third-placed Frankfurt did not take a decisive turn, with the game ending in a 1-1 draw. Schalke drew first blood in the 11th minute, when Frankfurt's Stefan Aigner was dispossessed in midfield, and Lewis Holtby released Klaas-Jan Huntelaar in front of goal - the Dutchman's first in the Bundesliga since September. But the hapless Aigner waited just over 100 seconds to make amends for his error, when the Royal Blues allowed him a free header that left goalkeeper Lars Unnerstall with no chance. But neither side could make inroads in the second half, which allowed Dortmund to leap-frog both sides and claim second place. Bayern take command Meanwhile the imperious Bayern Munich dispelled any talk of winter form-dip - following last week's draw to Nuremberg - with a brutally efficient 5-0 win at home to Hannover. The Bavarians stormed to a 3-0 lead in just 37 minutes, celebrating a nifty overhead kick for star signing Javi Martinez in the fourth minute. Toni Kroos and Franck Ribery scored the next two against a Hannover side that were torn open at will. The overhead kick was the first for the 40-million-euro ($52-million) signing Martinez, and in the second half new defender Dante also opened his account with a straightforward header from a Kroos free-kick. The festival of football continued just four minutes later, when Mario Gomez - making first Bundesliga appearance of the season - slammed the ball into the net from a tight angle just 30 seconds after replacing Mario Mandzukic. Dortmund win The champions Dortmund, meanwhile, are still nine points behind Bayern after beating Mainz 2-1 away. It was a potentially tricky fixture in the town where J\u00fcrgen Klopp began his coaching career, and Mainz showed their brilliance in the fourth minute, when Elkin Soto knocked a dream ball into the path of Marco Caligiuri, whose volley fairly screamed into the top right corner. Dortmund's own star-Marco - national team player Marco Reus - leveled the scores just eight minutes later. Reus worked himself some room at the outer edge of the penalty area, and slotted a beautiful 17-meter effort into the far corner. And Dortmund's second goal, just before half-time, was equally aesthetic - a vertical ball bisected the Mainz defense perfectly down the middle, where Polish predator Robert Lewandowski got his eighth league goal of the season with a deft lob over the onrushing Christian Wetklo in goal. Allofs' homecoming Bremen's 1-1 draw at Wolfsburg had a special frisson of its own, as Wolfsburg's newly-minted sporting director Klaus Allofs faced the club he had served as general manager for over a decade. And there was some gesticulating from the Bremen bench in the general direction of the Wolfsburg management when the guests took the lead in the 35th minute. Just seconds after Wolfsburg missed several chances, Marko Arnautovic was left free in the box after Eljero Elia found space on the left and cut the ball back for the Austrian to finish. But Wolfsburg got their own back in the second half. In the 62th minute, Bremen were reduced to ten men when Lukas Schmitz was given second yellow card for a hard tackle on Adelino Vieirinha. Just two minutes later, Bas Dost took advantage of their guests' disorgnaization and smashed the ball into the goal after neat piece of play from Vieirinha. Dirty derby The Franconian derby between Greuther F\u00fcrth and Nuremberg was a cagey affair that ended in a frustrating 0-0 draw. The first half was marked mainly by a straight red card for Nuremberg's Markus Feulner after an ugly, flying lunge on Stephan F\u00fcrstner. But the home side's numerical advantage was short-lived - Sercan Sararer was also sent for an early ice bath after his high elbow on Javier Pinola was adjudged worthy of a second yellow card in the 61st minute. But the aggression in the tackles was not matched by ruthlessness in front of goal, and neither side could eke out any clear chances.",

But it was not to be. Bayern, who have been on a tear in recent weeks, were the clear favorites to win the league title, and they were able to take advantage of a lack of quality at the back. Aigner, however, was unable to find the net as the match went on. He was substituted off in just over 100 seconds, just two minutes after the break. Schalke, on the other hand, managed to hold on to the ball for just under 30 seconds. Their only real chance came from the penalty spot, where they took a 1-0 lead after just four minutes of play. Javi Martinez, meanwhile, made his first Bundesliga start in over a decade, scoring the first goal in his return to Bremen. It was his second in as many games for the Royal Blues. His first came in September, when he scored a goal for Mainz against Nuremberg. In the fourth minute, he added a second, this time a free-kick, which he converted in front of goal. That was the end of an 11-minute span that saw the hosts take a 3-2 lead into halftime. And that was just the start for Wolfs' new coach, Klaus Allofs, as he took over the reins of Borussia Dortmund's top-flight side. Just over 40 minutes later, the Dutchman was on his way to scoring a brace for his new club. After that, it would be all over for Bayern as they looked to build on their first-half lead. Then came the crucial moment when they scored their second goal, a header that gave them the lead for good. On the counterattack, they had to settle for a penalty kick and a corner kick, before the game went to extra time. Wolf's goal came off a set piece by the former Bayern defender, whose side had already won the title last season and are now on course to qualify for next year's European competition."

Buenos Aires-based Porsche importer Grupo Pulenta has signed an agreement obligating it to export several hundred bottles of red wine for each car it imports, the Argentine government announced Wednesday. Grupo Pulenta declined to comment when contacted by Deutsche Welle. Job creation During the past year, Argentina has held thousands of high-end vehicles in customs until companies agreed to export goods valued at the same amount. Most of those vehicles came from Germany. According to a spokeswoman for the Argentine embassy in Berlin, the country has been trying to safeguard domestic employment with a positive trade balance. \"Our government has negotiated with automakers to balance their imports of cars with an equivalent amount of exports,\" she told Deutsche Welle in a statement. \"Since March 2010 we have been working with the automakers and importers in order to increase local integration and reduce the trade deficit in this sector.\" Small market A Porsche spokesman said the company sells just short of 100 vehicles into Argentina each year. That compares to more than 40,000 sold worldwide during five months in 2010. \"For Porsche, Argentina is a rather small market,\" the spokesman told Deutsche Welle. \"Our importer, the Pulenta Group, also deals in wine. They have their own vineyards and export that wine. It has nothing to do with Porsche - we just have an import contract with them, and it seems they've found an individual solution with the Argentine government.\" Domestic production Volkswagen, which has an Argentine subsidiary producing the new \"Amarok\" pickup truck and transmissions, has thus far avoided mandatory exports. The company had reported an export surplus of 384 million euros ($545 million) for this year. Porsche's holding company owns 32.2 percent of Volkswagen, and the Porsche brand is intended to become integrated into Volkswagen's lineup. Daimler and BMW also have subsidiaries in Argentina.

The opposition Law and Justice party failed in its bid to oust Prime Minister Donald Tusk on Friday through a vote confidence, the second such vote since the publication of private conversations between high-ranking officials, referred to by some in Poland as \"Waitergate.\" Tusk withstood the opposition challenge by a wide margin of 236-155. The prime minister's Civic Platform party governs Poland in a center-right coalition with the Polish People's party. Last month, recordings of a private conversation between Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski and then-Finance Minister Jacek Rostowski were published by the weekly magazine Wprost. During the conversation, Sikorski said the US-Polish alliance was \"worthless\" and British Prime Minister David Cameron's concessions to euroskeptics had shown his \"incompetence in EU affairs.\" Prior to the leak of the Sikorski recording, Wprost also published a tape in which central bank chief Marek Belka told Interior Minister Bartlomiej Sienkiewicz that he would only support the government's economic policy if Finance Minister Rostowski left his post. The secret recordings were reportedly made over several months, including at high end restaurants in Warsaw. Wprost says it received the tapes from a businessman. Immediately after the conversations were published, Tusk called his own vote of no confidence. His government survived that vote 237-203. slk/rc (AP, AFP, dpa)",

        "target": "Beekeepers battle mites with technology Bees are useful, hard-working and vital for our ecosystem. Aside from making honey, bees pollinate most of our food crops. But summertime is also the season for one of the biggest threats to honey bees \u2013 the varroa mite. Dete Papendieck puts on a white veiled protective hat and takes out a metal jug with a beak-shaped spout. He sets fire to the container's contents \u2013 formic acid \u2013 and starts directing the smoke that is wafting at the beehives lined up in front of him in his garden on the outskirts of Bonn. The acid doesn't harm the bees, but it does kill the varroa mites, he says. And July, after most of the honey has been harvested, is the best time to treat his hives. The one millimeter-large varroa mite is a parasite that infests beehives and lays its eggs in the honeycombs, alongside the bees' larvae. \"It feeds on the bees' and the bee brood's blood, the so-called haemolymph,\" Papendieck explains. A third of bees killed in Germany Papendieck is an apiarist at the Bee Research Institute at the University of Bonn and he knows that the threat of mites is serious. If left untreated, varroa-infested colonies rarely survive a winter. In 2010, German beekeepers lost about 200,000 hives to the mite \u2013 one third of Germany's total bee population. And it is not just the honey and beeswax production that are affected by the mite. Many of our food crops depend on bees: Some 80 percent of all agricultural plants and 90 percent of fruit trees in Europe are pollinated by Apis mellifera, the European honeybee. Varroa introduced from Asia Had Dete Papendieck been a beekeeper forty years ago he would not have had to worry about mites. He says the varroa mite that was originally native to Asia, was introduced to Europe in the 1970s. \"It happened during a research project in which it was attempted to crossbreed the European honeybee with the Asian honeybee. The researchers were exchanging bee colonies between Europe and India, and that is how the mites came to Germany,\" Papendieck said. Unlike Asian bee species, the European honeybee cannot fight off the varoa mite by itself. According to Papendieck, bees easily transmit the mite to other beekeepers' hives in what apiarists call robbery. \"It happens when certain colonies are being robbed by other bees. Large numbers of bees from different colonies attack weak hives and steal their stocks. At the same time, parasites and diseases are exchanged\", he says. Researchers have been trying to breed varroa-resistant mites, but so far they haven't had much success. High-tech tools help fight the mite Klaus Maresch is also worried about his bees. He is an organic beekeeper from Bonn and he has been passionate about bees since he was a little boy. \"They are part of my family. When I open my hives and smell the honey and hear the buzzing of the bees it's like being in another world,\" he told Deutsche Welle. In addition to using formic acid to fight the mite, Klaus Maresch employs a high-tech tool \u2013 a special cylindrical scale that helps him determine when it is best to start the varroa treatment. \"Every day this hive scale sends data about the colonies to our server. The data, such as the temperature in the hive and the amounts of nectar and pollen collected, help me to find a good day to treat varroa,\" Maresch says. Maresch also makes the data about the activities in his hives available to fellow beekeepers who can treat their colonies accordingly. A driver's license for beekeepers? But it is not the mite that angers Maresch most. \"That's nature,\" he says, \"I feel angry about beekeepers who don't fight varroa. If the bees of neighboring beekeepers are infested, I also have a problem.\" The existing German pest regulation obliges beekeepers to treat their bees against varroa, but there are no strict controls. The majority of Germany's more-than-80,000 beekeepers are amateurs who keep between one and 20 colonies. This makes it difficult to impose and survey certain quality standards. Maresch, who sees himself as a kind of 'bee activist', would like to see the government introduce stricter rules. \"There should be a law that obliges every new beekeeper to learn about beekeeping before they are allowed to keep bees. They should get an education and there should be something like a driver's license for beekeepers,\" he says. In the mean time, Europe's bees are going to have to",
        "generated_story": "German beekeepers fight varoa mite with high-tech hive scale A German beekeeper has successfully fought a pest that has become one of the most popular pests in the world. Klaus Maresch, a professor of beekeeping at the University of Bonn in Germany, has been fighting the pest for over two decades. \"I've fought it for forty years,\" he told Deutsche Welle in an interview published in July, adding that he was \"very happy\" with the results. The pest, which he calls the \"Vaccine Mite,\" is a common pest in India, China and the Middle East, where it can be easily spread across the globe. It has also been found in China, India and China. According to the Bee Research Institute (BRI), it is spread throughout Asia, Africa, Asia and Europe, with a population of more than 1.5 million people living on the continent. In the US, it has spread to over 2.2 million square kilometers (1.6 million sq. miles) of land, making it the largest single-family bee farm in Europe. Germany is the only country in Asia to have such a large hive, and Germany has the highest concentration of honey bee bees. But it's not just Germany that's fighting this pest. There are many other countries, too, that are suffering from the same problem. One of them is India. For the first time, the country's honey bees have been able to compete in a competition with other honeybee species. This is because the honeybees are so well-adapted to different climates and climates. They are also more adaptable to harsh climates, such as the temperate climate of India where the bees are more tolerant of harsh conditions and are less sensitive to pests. That's why they're so successful in their fight against pests, says the bee expert. He adds that the competition is fierce and that there's a lot of competition for the best honey-bees, so the winner will have to settle for a lower-cost honeycomb. And that will be the case for all the other bees, he says. A new bee hive is being developed in Bremen, Germany. Author: Nathan Witkop Editor: G\u00f6nna Ketels"

In a report commissioned by the European Commission, the London Institute for Alcohol Studies recommended raising the legal age to buy alcohol to 18 (in some countries, such as Germany, 16-year-olds can buy beer), lowering the permitted blood alcohol level while driving to 0.5, banning alcohol advertising on TV and in movies as well as adding warning labels to bottles as ways of preventing alcohol abuse across the bloc. Which of the methods EU Health Commissioner Markos Kyprianou actually introduces will be announced \"sometime in the autumn,\" according to a spokesperson. Other options include a 10 percent increase in the price of alcohol. Kyprianou has, however, hinted that he favors warning labels -- similar to those that appear on packs of cigarettes -- that make the dangers of alcohol clear. \"Drinking harms your unborn baby\" on bottles? Brewers and wine makers across Europe, however, have come out against placing \"Drinking Kills\" or other labels on bottles of beer. \"Warning labels are the completely wrong way to go,\" Peter Hahn, head of the German Brewers Association told Germany's Express newspaper. \"The do not deter people who have lost a sense of how much to drink and unsettle the people who enjoy a beer after work.\" Industry groups also opposed implementing EU-wide guidelines in countries with traditionally different ways of approaching drinking and drinking problems. \"Policies that do not consider cultural and regional differences, will fail to deal with the social problems, while at the same time generate a rising level of political objections,\" said Rodolphe de Looz-Corswarem of Brewers of Europe. Keeping social vices separate Green party EU parliamentarian Hiltrud Breyer meanwhile called on the alcohol industry to stop \"saber rattling\" before it sees the a final version of the EU's strategy to prevent alcohol abuse. German Consumer Affairs Minister Horst Seehofer said he would wait to see what Kyprianou's actual suggestions are before commenting. Other German politicians, however, were more willing to voice the opposition to putting a sip of wine on the same footing with a puff of a cigarette. \"People should not expect that a skull and crossbones end up on every bottle of beer and wine,\" German EU representative Karl-Heinz Florenz told Der Tagesspiegel newspaper, adding that when it comes to alcohol, each member state should be responsible for how it deals with alcohol abuse. The harm of \"passive drinking\" While cigarettes are a health risk from the first puff, moderate drinking can actually be healthy and there is no danger from \"passive drinking,\" Peter Liese, a German EU representative, told the paper. The commission's report disagreed with Liese's conclusion, saying alcohol abuse had a major role in as many as 200,000 deaths in Europe due to car accidents and disease and played a role in some 60,000 underweight births. The report also estimated the effects of alcohol abuse of costing the EU 125 billion euros ($161 billion) in 2003. Some 25 percent of men and 10 percent of women in Europe drink what the EU considers to be more than healthy amounts of alcohol and between 3 percent and 5 percent are suffering from alcoholism, according to EU statistics.",
        "generated_story": "German Brewers Association warns against 'passive drinking' The European Commission has warned against the use of alcohol on bottles of beer, warning that it could lead to \"harmful\" drinking. The warning comes as the European Union prepares to impose 125 billion euros ($161 billion) of tax on beer sales in the autumn. According to a report published in Der Tagesspiegel in 2003, the average age of a beer sold in Germany is 18 years old. \"This is a very serious problem,\" said Peter Liese, head of Germany's Brewers of Europe, a trade association that represents the German beer industry. Kyprianou, who is also a member of the EU's executive committee on alcohol, said it was \"very concerning\" that he was drinking beer on a regular basis. He said he had no idea how much alcohol was being sold on the market, but he did know that there was a limit to the number of bottles that could be sold at a given price. In addition, he said, \"it is very difficult to tell the difference between beer and wine when you're drinking wine.\" \"It's not just about the price, it's the quality,\" he added, adding that \"the quality of wine is not the same as it is in other European countries.\" The report also warned that alcohol consumption could increase by up to 10 percent in countries with the highest alcohol content. But the report did not mention the potential for a rise in alcohol-related crime. It also said that, for example, alcohol abuse among young people can be reduced by 25 percent if alcohol is consumed in a high-calorie way. However, there is no evidence to suggest that this is the case in any other EU country. There is, however, evidence that the problem is much more widespread than it appears to be in many other countries, such as Germany, France, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom. This is despite the fact that many of these countries have strict alcohol laws, which are meant to protect the health of their citizens from the dangers of binge drinking and other forms of drug abuse. These laws have been in place for more than a decade, and they are still in effect in most of those countries where alcohol has been banned. They have also been used to regulate the consumption of certain types of alcoholic beverages, including wine, spirits and beer. And, of course, in some cases, beer can still be consumed by teenagers and young adults, even if they don't have any alcohol in them at the time of purchase."

A lack of dialogue is not an option for the future,\" he said after meeting with his Georgian counterpart Eka Tkeshelashvili. Steinmeier, who chairs the so-called Group of Friends of the United Nations' Secretary on Georgia, is proposing a three-phase peace plan based on a mutual declaration of non-violence and repatriation of about 25,000 ethnic Georgians expelled from Abkhazia in the 1990s. Negotiations over the status of the two rebel regions, which have enjoyed de facto autonomy since the end of a civil war in 1994, was reserved for the final phase of negotiations. Tkeshelashvili said, \"The plan has great potential for success,\" but added that the most difficult thing would be to convince Russia. Peace talks remain distant The threat of armed conflict in the region last month has given urgency to international pressure for renewed peace talks, but Tbilisi, Moscow and the Russian-backed regions remain far apart on the basic premises for restarting peace talks. Officials in Tbilisi oppose a treaty on the non-use of force without guarantees on the return of refugees and the withdrawal of Russian peacekeeping forces base in the region. Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was skeptical of peace efforts Thursday. \"Signing of a treaty on the return of Georgian refugees to Abkhazia is unreal now, because such a return requires a calm situation,\" Lavrov was quoted as saying by news agency RIA-Novosti. \"We think that signing a treaty on the non-use of force without any preconditions is an absolutely unavoidable first step,\" he added. Experts see little hope for Steinmeier's plan Analysts do not expect anything conclusive from Steinmeier's trip, pointing to intransigence on the part of the Abkhaz President Sergei Bagapsh, who said he would \"not consider the plan.\" \"We are not going to discuss Abkhazia's status with anyone. We are building an independent, democratic state,\" Bagapsh was quoted by Georgian news agencies as saying. Speaking to journalists ahead of the meetings Thursday, Steinmeier admitted: \"We don't have any illusions about simple answers, but we cannot stand by without acting on this conflict. That would be irresponsible.\" From Tbilisi, the German minister is to travel to the Black Sea city of Batumi for talks with Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili and then to Abkhazia on Friday before ending his three-day tour in Moscow. Most citizens of the breakaway republics have been issued Russian passports and over 2,500 Russian peacekeeping troops patrol the region under a UN ceasefire agreement.

According to the GOF, the plan is to create a new \"state of peace\" in the region, which is now part of Russia's sphere of influence. \"We are going to establish a state of tranquillity in this region,\" said Eka Tkeshelashvili, a Georgian parliamentarian and a member of parliament. She added that the idea of establishing a \"new peace zone\" would be \"very, very difficult to achieve.\" \"It will be a process of negotiation,\" she said, adding that she would like to see an \"immediate end to this conflict.\" The plan would also include the establishment of an independent state in South Caucasus, where the Soviet-backed government has ruled since 1994, as well as the creation of a regional government in Georgia. Tensions between Georgia and Russia have been on the rise since the 1990s, when Russian President Vladimir Putin's regime seized power in a coup attempt in 1994. Since then, tensions have risen between Russia and Georgia, with the latter accusing the former regime of meddling in its internal affairs. On Friday, Russia announced that it had agreed to allow Georgia to continue its military occupation of its territory, and that Georgia would have the right to self-defense if it wanted to do so.

The government says the measures are no longer necessary because the security threat has subsided. The government said Tuesday it had rescinded the emergency measures \"with immediate effect\" and that \"all fundamental rights that were suspended have been restored.\" President Yameen Abdul Gayoom declared the state of emergency one week ago after the discovery of a homemade bomb and a stash of weapons near his official residence. The finding followed an explosion on Gayoom's speedboat in September - an incident the government labeled an assassination attempt. The president was not hurt in the blast, but his wife, an aide and a bodyguard were injured. The emergency regulations, intended to be in place for 30 days, gave security forces wide-ranging search and arrest powers, and suspended citizens' basic rights. They drew criticism from former colonial power Britain as well as the United States, the European Union and neighboring Sri Lanka. Reading out a presidential decree revoking the emergency, Attorney General Mohamed Anil said there was no longer a threat to the Indian Ocean atoll nation. He said investigations into the September blast and the recovery of weapons had made good progress. The foreign ministry said a number of people had been arrested. Lawmakers also used the security regulations to fast-track the impeachment of Vice President Ahmed Adeeb, who stands accused of plotting the alleged attempts on the president's life. Impact on tourism Attorney General Anil said pressure from the international community, as well as \"the possible adverse impact on Maldives tourism and the economy,\" had also played a role in ending the state of emergency. Foreign tourists visiting the tropical nation, known for its luxury tourist resorts, palm-fringed beaches and coral reefs, contribute close to a third of the country's gross domestic product. The Maldives has had a rocky road to democracy since holding its first multiparty election in 2008. The country's first democratically elected leader, current opposition chief Mohamed Nasheed, was forced to step down in 2012 after a mutiny by security forces. In March, he was jailed for 13 years on terrorism charges in a trial the United Nations said was illegal. President Gayoom is under intense international pressure to release him. Nasheed's opposition Maldivian Democratic Party welcomed Tuesday's announcement. But said declaring the state of emergency in the first place was a political move designed to stop a rally planned for last week calling for Nasheed's freedom. \"It appears that Yameen is willing to make up threats about the nation's security in order to settle political scores,\" the party said in a statement, referring to the president. nm/kms (AP, AF, Reuters, dpa)",

Nasheed, who was ousted in a military coup in March, said on Tuesday that his government would not be allowed to return to office until 30 days after his term ends. He added that the move was \"in accordance with international law.\" The United States, Britain, Sri Lanka and Britain have all called for an immediate end to the government's power-sharing agreement with the opposition, which was signed on March 1, 2012, by a vote of no confidence in the new president.

Amid widening criticism from residents in British territories that not enough was done to safeguard people from the storm, British Foreign Office Minister Alana Duncan said London has sent tents, vehicles and other relief equipment. \"Anguilla received the hurricane's full blast. The initial assessment is that the damage has been severe and in places critical,\" Duncan told the British Parliament.

The storm is forecast to bring winds of up to 130 miles (209 kilometers) per hour (130 kph) to the island of St. Martin, which is home to more than 1 million people. Hurricane Jose, a Category 4 storm, has already caused widespread damage to homes, businesses and homes in Florida and Puerto Rico. US President Donald Trump said on Twitter that the storm was \"a truly devastating\" storm and urged the public to prepare for the worst. \"This is a storm that is going to devastate the entire Caribbean,\" he said, adding that \"it will be a very, very difficult and very dangerous storm to deal with.\" The US government said it would provide $15 billion (13.5 billion euro) in emergency aid to islands affected by Irma, including the British Virgin Islands, Antigua and Barbuda, as well as other Caribbean islands. In the Bahamas, President Ricardo Rossello called for a \"total and complete shutdown\" of all US ports, airports and rail lines to be shut down for at least four days as a result of Irma's path. On Thursday, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the United States would continue to monitor and monitor the situation in its Caribbean territories. He also warned of a possible \"potential catastrophe\" if the weather conditions worsen. Meanwhile, British Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said he was confident the government would be able to cope with the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey. Speaking to a news conference in London, he added that he had \"no doubt\" that Irma would cause \"significant damage.\" \"We are very concerned about the long-term effects of this storm,\" the prime minister said in a statement. 'We have a lot of work ahead of us' The British government, meanwhile, warned that Hurricane Katia could cause major disruptions to life and property across the country."

        "target": "Opinion: Yet another crisis for Merkel A summery turquoise blazer and fresh makeup could not hide the fact that Angela Merkel was \"not amused.\" Now she is needed as a champion in the fight against populist forces, DW's Kay-Alexander Scholz writes. Britain-EU divorce proceedings will probably last about two years. Until then, the status quo must be maintained, German Chancellor Angela Merkel emphasized in her press statement. If she is no longer chancellor after the upcoming parliamentary elections in 2017, then others will have to live with the consequences of Brexit. But that is not what she is actually thinking. It is not coincidental that foreign ministers and government leaders are visiting Berlin in the coming days. They want to discuss how things will continue. Berlin, under Merkel's chancellorship, has become a center of power outside of Brussels. Difficult international politics The Brexit decision has disrupted Europe's equilibrium. Germany has lost an important ally on European issues related to economic growth and budgetary discipline. Now, France presumably will be the next to raise its voice against Maastricht Treaty criteria. If the Netherlands and Denmark also decide to leave the EU, Germany will become isolated, as Eastern Europe is not as tight with Germany as it once was. Poland now plays a key role for the Balkan nations and the Visegrad Group (Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic and Slovakia). And Poland is still annoyed about Merkel's refugee policy. What about Germany's populists? They're giddy with glee as they feel that their anti-establishment policies have been validated. They are teaching potential AfD (Alternative for Germany) voters a lesson: \"Here, have a look: it's possible. There is always an alternative. Vote for us!\" Those are exactly the words that protest voters want to hear. Germany's AfD has forged ties with other right-wing parties in Vienna, Paris, The Hague and London. They are all pursuing a \"European\" plan to gain power. The recent Austrian presidential election was significant, as the populist candidate lost by a very narrow margin; in fact, the final election results are still undecided as they are being contested. The Brexit vote was also triggered by populist powers. Domestically difficult Many populists believe that the stronger populism becomes - no matter where - the more advantages there would be for individual parties of their persuasion. Many would also like to see Donald Trump as US president. That is how AfD may become even stronger in Germany, which also means that political majorities would fluctuate even more. Will there be enough seats after the next election for a Christian Democrat and Green coalition, or will yet another grand coalition made up of Christian Democrats and Social Democrats be formed? Can Angela Merkel change course? Can she counter the trend with a new political model in Europe and Germany? Or do we stand on the edge of a new era, a \"political revolution,\" as the AfD calls it? Until now, Europe has survived attacks on its currency (euro crisis), the principle of peaceful coexistence (Crimea crisis) and its open borders policy (refugee crisis). Merkel deserves credit for defending these values, despite mistakes that have been made along the way. The outcome of the Brexit crisis is, however, still open. Have something to say? Add your comments below.",

        "target": "Reports: Merkel to run for fourth term as German chancellor German Chancellor Angela Merkel has confirmed that she will stand for the chancellery in the 2017 election, German media reports. The Christian Democrat Leader (CDU) first took office in 2005. After months of speculation, German Chancellor Angela Merkel reportedly told her fellow Christian Democrats (CDU) in Berlin on Sunday that she is prepared to lead the party into next year's election. An official statement is expected from Merkel at 7 p.m. local time (1800 UTC) on Sunday. The 62-year-old has faced a number of difficulties in recent months, from criticism over her handling of the migration crisis to falling support amid a rise in right-wing populist sentiment. Since taking office in 2005, however, Merkel has also been praised for navigating Europe's largest economy through the financial and eurozone crises. According to an Emnid survey published in the German newspaper \"Bild am Sonntag\" 55 percent of Germans are in favor of Merkel remaining head of the German government for another four years. Thirty-nine percent said they were against her re-election. Sign of stability Should she be elected next September, another full four-year term would put Merkel on a par with her mentor Helmut Kohl who set the post-war record and presided over the Fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. In light of the UK's shock vote to leave the European Union in June and Donald Trump's election last week as US president, Merkel's re-election is likely to be welcomed in many capitals as a sign of stability. During his final visit to Berlin this week, US President Barack Obama said that if he were able to, he would vote for his longtime partner and friend. In an interview with German magazine \"Spiegel\" and broadcaster \"ARD,\" Obama said: \"She has great credibility, and she is willing to fight for those values in a way that is very, very important.\" \"I'm glad that she's there and I think the German people should appreciate her. Certainly, I've appreciated her as a partner.\" Winning back votes With the less that a year until Germany heads to the polls, Merkel's CDU is now turning its efforts to wooing back disenchanted voters who have left the conservative camp to support the right-wing populists, Alternative for Germany (AfD). Formed as a Euro-sceptic party in 2013, the AfD won 4.7 percent of the popular vote in the last federal elections in 2013, just falling short of the 5 percent threshold required to enter the Bundestag - Germany's lower house of parliament. After benefiting from the rise in europsceptic, anti-immigration sentiment, seemingly sweeping across western Europe, the party now holds seats in nine of Germany's 16 states.",
        "generated_story": "Merkel's re-election bid comes amid growing populist sentiment in Germany Chancellor Angela Merkel has announced her intention to run for another four-year term in the Bundestag in 2017. The German daily Bild am Sonntag reported on Sunday that Merkel would seek a fourth term as Germany's chancellor. Merkel, 62, is expected to announce her intentions at 7 p.m. local time (1700 UTC) Sunday, the German news agency dpa reported, citing unnamed sources close to the chancellor's campaign team. German media reported that the candidate, Helmut Kohl, would run against Merkel's conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) in Sunday's election. \"The CDU and the AfD are the main opposition parties in this election,\" the paper said, adding that it would not contest the results of the first round of parliamentary elections scheduled for this week. Chancellor Merkel is widely seen as a potential successor to former US President George W. Bush, who died in office in 2005 at the age of 62. In a statement released Sunday evening, Merkel said she had \"no intention\" of running for a third term and that she was \"not going to be able to win the election.\" \"I have no intention of changing my mind,\" Merkel told the newspaper, which quoted her as saying, \"but I have to make a decision on my own.\" The interview was published on the same day as German weekly Bild, in which Merkel was due to give a speech in front of a packed house of parliament in Berlin. It was not immediately clear whether the interview would be broadcast live on German television, or if she would give an interview to a German newspaper. A number of media outlets reported Merkel as the frontrunner to take over the reins of power in her conservative conservative coalition government, with a total of four years to go until the end of her term. Many commentators, however, dismissed the comments as \"absurd\" and \"unhelpful,\" saying that they were not meant to imply a change of heart. On the other hand, some commentators said that there was a growing sense of unease among voters about the future of Germany after the fall of communism in 1989, when the Berlin Wall fell.

        "target": "NFL stars defy Donald Trump's call for boycott Baltimore Ravens and Jacksonsville Jaguars players \"took a knee\" during the national anthem after Trump urged fans to boycott football matches. The kneeling protest, to highlight social injustice, has stepped up a gear. Hundreds of National Football League (NFL) stars protested President Donald Trump's call for fans to boycott the league by refusing to stand for the US national anthem this weekend, starting Sunday's game between the Baltimore Ravens and Jacksonsville Jaguars. A number of other players locked arms in solidarity ahead of the game at Wembley Stadium in London. Jacksonville Jaguars' owner Shahid Khan, who last year donated one million dollars\u00a0(840,000 euros) to the Trump campaign, locked his arms with players - a rare scene, as owners almost never take to the field. US media reported that about 200 players on Sunday sat, knelt or raised their fists in defiance of Trump's comments. In one of the most memorable moments, singer Rico LaVelle took a knee and held up a fist at the last line of the Star Spangled Banner ahead of the game between the Detriot Lions and Atlanta Falcons. The protest came in response to Trump's tweets on Sunday morning urging fans to boycott NFL games to pressure the league into firing or suspending players to kneel in protest during the national anthem. In an early morning tweet, Trump posted: \"If NFL fans refuse to go to games until players stop disrespecting our Flag and Country, you will see change take place fast. Fire or suspend!\" \"NFL attendance and ratings are WAY DOWN. Boring games yes, but many stay away because they love our country. League should back US,\" he added. Later, the president said that his rant \"has nothing to do with race,\" despite the fact that the origins of the protest are to do with police brutality against minorities, especially African Americans. Trump said his comments were instead about \"respect for our country and respect for our flag.\" Trump's spat with US professional sports began at a Republican rally in Alabama on Friday, when the president attacked activist NFL players for kneeling or sitting during the national anthem, labelling them as \"sons of bitches.\" \"Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, 'Get that son of a bitch off the field right now... he is fired'?\" Trump told a crowd of cheering supporters. That day, basketball star Stephen Curry, the top player for California's Golden State Warriors, announced that he would not be attending a traditional White House reception honoring the National Basketball Association champions. The kneeling protest was started by former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick who refused to stand for the anthem back in 2016. Kaepernick's gesture came amid a spate of deadly police shootings of black men and was aimed at drawing more attention to treatment of minorities in the US. However, Kaepernick has since become a free agent, after failing to be signed by a new team for the new NFL season. NFL executives decry Trump's calls Trump also drew the ire of senior NFL executives and team owners. Responding to Trump's tweets, Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti, said he \"100 percent\" supported his players' decision to kneel during the anthem. Robert Kraft, the owner of the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots, who is also a close friend of Trump, said in a statement on Sunday that he was deeply disappointed by the president's comments in Alabama. Kraft defended players' rights to \"peacefully affect social change and raise awareness in a manner that they feel is most impactful,\" and said that sports were a unifying force in the US. \"Our political leaders could learn a lot from the lessons of teamwork and working together toward a common goal,\" he said. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, who has taken much of the heat for Kaepernick's failure to find a new team, was also quick to condemn Trump's comments.

The president's comments sparked online outrage on Friday, when NFL owners announced that they would be making at least $1 million ( 840,000 euros) in compensation to players who protest racial injustice. On Friday morning, NFL owner Robert Kraft said that the league's owners would make a \"significant contribution\" to the NFL's efforts to address the issue of racial inequality in the US. \"The NFL has made it clear that it will not stand for the Star Spangled Banner,\" Kraft told the Associated Press in an interview broadcast on the network's Facebook page. Trump also called for a boycott of NFL games this weekend, saying that players should stand \"in solidarity with the victims of the oppression of black and brown people in this country.\" The NFL said on Saturday it would not make any money from the sale of tickets to games in which the players are black, white or African-American. In a statement released on Sunday, league spokesman Steve Bisciotti said: \"We have no comment on this matter at this time. We will continue to monitor the situation and make sure that we are doing everything in our power to prevent this from happening again.\" Trump's statement came a day after NFL President Donald Trump said he was \"deeply troubled\" by the comments made by former 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who was fired by President Barack Obama last month for protesting police brutality in his home state of Alabama. He also said the team's decision to fire him was an \"inconsistent\" response to a tweet by NFL general counsel Robert K. Kraft, a former NFL executive who served as chairman of Kraft's board of directors, called the move \"disgraceful\" and \"unacceptable.\" \"This is a disgrace,\" said Kraft on Twitter, adding that he had \"no idea\" what the president was referring to when he tweeted about Kaepernick's firing. NFL officials have said they have not made any decision on whether or not to fine the player for his actions, but said it was not a violation of federal law. They have also not ruled out the possibility of a fine of up to 1 million euros ($1.6 million) for any player who does not protest the flag, which Trump has repeatedly criticized as a form of \"divide and conquer.\" In the wake of Sunday's announcement, Trump tweeted that \"the NFL should be ashamed of itself for what it has done to black people,\" and that his comments were \"ridiculous.\""

Greece had previously voiced reservations about the proposal. The proposed mission to be discussed at a NATO defense ministers meeting in Brussels on Thursday comes days after German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutolgu said they would raise the issue of refugees with the Alliance. According to a Reuters report citing a senior German official, initially reticent Greece has now given the green light for the operation, which could see NATO assets deployed in the Aegean in a mostly intelligence and reconnaissance role. Under the proposal, which would need to be approved by Alliance members, NATO maritime assets would provide information to national coastguards and the EU border agency Frontex to combat illegal smugglers using rickety boats to bring migrants to Europe. Turkey would then take back the refugees, as envisioned as part of a 3 billion-euro ($3.2 billion) EU-Turkey deal agreed to last year. According to German sources, the mission would not be similar to the NATO mission in the Mediterranean intercepting migrant boats making the dangerous run from Libya to Italy. However, NATO ships could intervene in emergency situations to save passengers. \"It is not NATO's remit to push back or stop refugee boats,\" the official told Reuters. The mission would use assets from the Alliance's standing naval group, a permanent reaction force deployed in the Mediterranean. The naval group's current flagship is the German combat support ship \"Bonn.\" Denmark has already said it would provide additional ships to the mission, according to the official. However, it is unclear whether NATO members will approve the mission which may fall outside the bounds of the Alliance's mandate. Complicating matters is a long-running maritime dispute between Greece and Turkey over sovereignty in the Aegean, where the two NATO members' jets regularly engage in dogfights. Turkey has taken in more than 2.5 million Syrian refugees, and is a major transit point for migrants from Asia and Africa. More than a million migrants and refugees reached Europe last year, many making the dangerous boat journey from Turkey to Greece by boat. So far this year, more than 340 have perished in the cold waters trying to reach Europe. cw/msh (AFP, dpa, Reuters)",

German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Thursday that the deployment was part of an EU-Turkey strategy to tackle the problem of illegal migration. \"We are going to do everything in our power to stop this flow,\" Merkel told a news conference in Bonn, Germany, where she was due to attend a NATO summit in Brussels later Thursday. Germany's defense minister Ahmet Davutolgu said the move was \"part of a broader effort to reduce the number of people who enter Europe illegally,\" adding that \"we will not allow this to continue.\" The move comes after Turkey announced it would close its border with Greece in a bid to prevent migrants from crossing into its territory. Turkey has said it will continue to cooperate with NATO in its fight against illegal migrants, but it is not clear how long this will last. It is unclear how many migrants will be allowed to cross into Greece, which is a member of the NATO alliance. Frontex, the anti-migration agency, has been tasked with monitoring the situation in Greece and Italy, as well as with dealing with the influx of refugees from Libya and other African countries who have fled to Europe in recent years. Last year, Turkey agreed to allow asylum seekers to stay in Europe for a period of three years in exchange for the right to return to their home countries. However, EU leaders have said they are not ready to give up the mission entirely until they see that Turkey is no longer a threat to European stability and security.

Despite the Syrian government's immediate apology, the shelling on the Turkish border has led to concerns about possible escalation. These weren't the first incidents on the Syrian-Turkish border, but the fact that several people on the Turkish side were killed by Syrian shells on Wednesday (03.10.2012) has brought the conflict between the two countries to a new level. It has led the Turkish military to retaliate for the first time. Several people were killed when Turkey shelled Syrian territory. But neither Turkey, which is a member of NATO, nor Syria would benefit from a broader conflict. An adviser to the Turkish president tweeted, \"Turkey has no interest in a war with Syria.\" Volker Perthes, director of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs in Berlin, agrees: \"Assad has no interest in an escalation,\" he told DW. \"That can be seen from the fact that the Syrian information minister apologized and expressed his regret over the victims immediately after the attack on Turkish territory.\" Perthes doesn't think it's likely that the Syrian President, Bashar Assad, wants to provoke Turkey to intervene in Syria. \"That would only accelerate the fall of his regime,\" he said. It's not yet clear who was responsible for the shelling. According to Syria's ally, Russia, it was a \"tragic accident.\" Relationship damaged The armed incidents on the Syrian-Turkish border have been going on for months. According to Amnesty International, some 300,000 Syrians have left their country since the start of the uprising against Assad, and many of them have fled to Turkey. The relationship between the two countries, which used to be close, has deteriorated dramatically, and the Turkish government is now openly supporting the Syrian opposition. \"Turkey is itself a player in the Syrian conflict,\" said Perthes. \"It provides shelter for many refugees and it's through Turkey that supplies come for the opposition.\" NATO has lined up behind Turkey and told Syria to end its \"flagrant violations of international law.\" Call for 'great discretion' The German chancellor, Angel Merkel, has also positioned herself alongside Turkey. \"We call on all parties to show great discretion,\" she said in Berlin. The foreign minister, Guido Westerwelle, declared that everything must be done to deescalate the situation, so that the Syrian conflict did not turn into a conflagration in the region. Indeed, the Syrian crisis is not only spreading to Turkey, but also to Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon. According to Perthes, \"The neighboring countries are partly victims and partly instigators. Jordan too has taken in refugees and supplies the rebels. On the other hand, Iraq has tended to support the government of Bashar Assad.\" Even so, he said, all the neighboring countries had an interest in ensuring the conflict was confined to Syria. Appeal to the international community But the number of Syrian refugees is rising by the day. Ruth J\u00fcttner, a Middle East expert with Amnesty International, believes this will continue in future months. \"It's important that the countries bordering on Syria are supported by the international community in providing accommodation, medical and psychological care and schooling for children,\" she told DW. It's an appeal she directs especially to European countries. The shelling on the Syrian-Turkish border has made it more likely that there will be armed conflict between Syria and its neighbors.

The Islamist-backed militia alliance that took over Tripoli and installed its own government announced a ceasefire on Friday, following a breakthrough in Geneva-based peace talks. Despite not attending the UN-brokered meeting, the militias have agreed to \"a ceasefire on all fronts,\" according to a statement issued by Islamist group Fajr Libya (Libya Dawn). The only condition is that \"the other parties respect the truce.\" The announcement came hours after the United Nations declared that Libya's warring factions had agreed to a roadmap for forming a unity government. Nearly four years after a NATO-backed revolt saw Moammar Gadhafi removed from power, two rival governments each backed by different groups of militias have plunged the country back into chaos and threatened all-out civil war. After the elected government of Prime Minister Abdullah al-Thinni was forced out of Tripoli by Libya Dawn, it was forced to move to the far eastern city of Tobruk while Libya Dawn reinstated the old parliament known as the GNC. The fighting and violence has displaced hundreds of thousands of civilians, left hundreds killed and thousands wounded. Most foreign diplomats fled the country and shut their embassies last year. The Tobruk government, as well as a few other factions who favor a peaceful resolution, came to Geneva to work on \"confidence-building measures,\" which includes the release of detainees from both sides, opening closed ports and securing safe freedom of movement around the country. es/bw (AP, AFP, Reuters)",

        "target": "France's conservatives: Combating the National Front with a swing to the right A staunch conservative is joining the race for the French presidency. Republican candidate Francois Fillon could turn into a big problem for right-wing extremist Marine Le Pen's National Front. France's Republicans are moving to the right: by choosing Francois Fillon, voters nominated a presidential candidate who has a reputation as a staunch conservative. The former prime minister has already announced that he intends to refocus politics with the traditional family in mind. Fillon takes a dim view of homosexual couples adopting children. He wants to introduce a cap on the number of refugees allowed into France, he intends to make it harder for foreign nationals to access the social welfare system, and he wants to put Muslim communities and mosques under government control. In addition, Fillon advocates a renationalization of school curricula. Fillon makes gains in FN territory Fillon's agenda could turn out to be a problem for the \"National Front\" (FN). The 62-year-old appeals to similar sentiments as the right-wing party's base: concern about foreign domination and loss of identity, fear of terrorism and crime. \"For a long time, FN was the only political force that addressed those fears,\" said Henrik Uterwedde of the German-French Institute (dfi) in Ludwigsburg. \"Now a politician has arrived on the scene who addresses those fears using a different language and makes them a political offer.\" In rural, Catholic France especially, where traditions still matter a great deal, the avowed Catholic Fillon strikes a chord with his proposals pertaining to family and society policies. He receives support from traditional Catholic groups who, for years, have been able to mobilize crowds for demonstrations against gay marriage. During the intraparty election campaign, Fillon predominantly traveled to France's villages and small towns - regions which FN leader Marine Le Pen had labeled the \"forgotten France,\" regarding herself as their foremost lobbyist. \"Fillon has made gains in an environment that is also canvassed by Le Pen,\" Andreas Jung, Chairman of the Bundestag's German-French parliamentary group, told German broadcaster rbb-Inforadio. \"He does not represent the lofty levels of Parisian politics, but rather provincial entrenchment. Fillon is committed to traditional values, like the family. Therefore, he may not only be capable of defeating Le Pen, but also of taking the lead during the first ballot.\" 'Most dangerous candidate for FN' Consequently, the FN camp is less than enthusiastic about the conservative's candidacy. \"Because of Fillon, we now have a strategy problem,\" Marion Marechal Le Pen, the FN leader's niece, recently told journalists. \"He is the most dangerous candidate for the National Front.\" Pollsters' findings appear to support that statement. Recent surveys establish Fillon as the current favorite in the French presidential election scheduled for next May. However, Fillon's election is not a foregone conclusion. By denouncing the conservative candidate as a member of the establishment, FN tries to win over those who are frustrated with politics and politicians in general. There is persistent opposition against his economic-liberal plans in particular. Fillon wants to abolish the 35-hour working week and raise the retirement age to 65 years. In addition, he wants to cut 500,000 jobs in the public sector and reform industrial law. Fillon is known as an admirer of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. \"Issues pertaining to liberal economic policy have always been heavily contested in France,\" said Uterwedde. \"Fillon's adversaries have already taken up their positions, criticizing what, in France, is called 'ultra-liberalism.'\" That was one of the nastiest words in French politics, he added. An offer for the left Fillon wants to raise VAT by 2 percent. This would predominantly hurt low-income households. Exactly that clientele, however, is wooed by FN with a program that is regarded as rather left-wing. The right-wing extremists are on a clear anti-globalization course, intending to seal off the French economy against foreign countries and exit from the European Union. The party is already trying to present Fillon as a symbol of anarchic, ultra-liberal capitalism. \"Francois Fillon will even go beyond EU demands for austerity and liberalism,\" David Rachline, Marine Le Pen's election campaign manager, wrote on Twitter. According to current polls, it is very likely that Fillon will have to face Marine Le Pen in a runoff election in May. The main hazard for the Republican candidate: his economic-liberal course could deter left-wing voters from choosing the conservative in order to avert Le Pen. \"Francois Fillon will have to start making offers, also to those voters who are closer to the center and more moderate,\" said France expert Uterwedde. \"And he will, prior to the runoff election at the latest, have to make offers to left-wing voters - without changing his original course.\"",
        "generated_story": "Fillon is the most dangerous candidate for France's presidential election Francois Fillon, the French National Front (FN) presidential candidate, has been dubbed the \"most dangerous\" candidate in the country's election history. The FN's candidate Henrik Uterwedde, a professor of political science at the German-French Institute in Ludwigsburg, told dfi news agency that the FN candidate was the least dangerous. \"He is a man of few words, and he is not a person of many words,\" he said, referring to the party's leader, Marion Marechal Le Pen, in a 35-hour interview broadcast on French television on May. In the interview, he also said he was \"very surprised\" by the results of the poll, which was conducted over 35 hours. He added that he had \"no idea\" what the result would be for the election and that it would have been a \"difficult decision.\" \"I don't think it's possible to predict the outcome of this election. I think there will be a lot of people who are going to vote for a candidate who is more dangerous than the other candidates. It's a very difficult decision to make. There are so many things that can go wrong. You have to be very careful about what you say and how you respond to it. That's why I'm very concerned about the situation in France, because it is very important that we have a fair and balanced election.\" The \"National Front,\" a conservative political party founded by former French Prime Minister Manuel Valls, is expected to win a majority of votes in May's parliamentary elections. But it has not yet been able to form a coalition government with the far-right FN party and the conservative Socialists (SPD) party, so far the only party with a clear majority in parliament. And the right-wing party has no chance of winning the Bundestag, where it currently holds the upper house of parliament, as well as the lower house. So far, there is little sign of a deal between the two parties on the issue of taxes, VAT or the European Union, but it seems to me that both candidates are at odds with each other in terms of their views on taxes and other issues. They are both very different in that they differ in many ways from one another. For one thing, they share the same political views as their conservative counterparts in other countries, such as Germany, Austria, Switzerland, France and Britain. Another thing that is different about them is their differences in ideology. Both candidates have different ideas on how to deal with taxes. One thing is for certain: they both have very strong opinions on tax and VAT, while the others are more moderate in their positions on social issues and on issues of social justice. This is why they are very much in favor of tax cuts and tax increases. However, both of them are opposed to VAT and are against the idea of raising the minimum wage in order to increase the tax burden on middle-income earners. What's more, neither candidate is willing to compromise on these issues, says Andreas Jung, an expert in French politics at rbb-Inforadio."

        "target": "Berlin court rules Google Street View is legal in Germany A Berlin court has ruled that Google Street View is legal. But that doesn't mean the lawsuits will end, legal scholars say. A Berlin court has ruled that Google Street View is, in fact, legal in Germany. Last Tuesday, the Berlin State Supreme Court (Kammergericht) announced its decision in a court case from late last year, in which a woman had sued Google, fearing that photos of her, her family and the front of her house would be posted on Google Street View and would thus violate her property and privacy rights. The court ruled that it is legal to take photographs from street level, rejecting her argument that Google was trying to take unauthorized pictures. Part of her argument rested on the fact that Google used cameras mounted at three meters (9.84 feet) high, which could see over her two-meter-high hedge. However, the court did not find this argument convincing, given that the photographs were taken from the street, and not the sidewalk. Furthermore, because Google automatically blurs faces and license plates and did allow Germans to opt-out of the service to have their house obfuscated as well, the court did not find any potential violations. This is the first high-level court ruling, which cannot be appealed any further, regarding Street View since the service debuted in Germany at the end of last year. An ongoing debate Since Google announced plans to launch Street View in Germany last summer, debate around the service has become heated, with some politicians trying to stop it at every turn, while German Chancellor Angela Merkel famously said that she would not remove her house from Street View. In November 2010, the company announced that 244,000 German residents in the 20 cities had chosen to opt out of Street View - less than three percent of residents. However, in Germany and everywhere else, the company also allows people to report abuse, inaccuracies or request that something be blurred using an online tool. \"Our job is to develop services that respect these cultural differences,\" Peter Fleischer, Google's global privacy counsel told Deutsche Welle in November 2010. \"We try to anticipate them. We're all internationally-minded people ourselves. We try to guess how people will react to them. But a lot of these services are new and have never been on the market before, so we learn and we adapt as we go along.\" A 'landmark decision' European legal experts called the Berlin ruling a \"landmark decision,\" saying that this would now become part of German case law regarding property rights. \"Yes, other people are now warned: Don't sue Google simply claiming that Google Street View violates personality [or] property rights,\" wrote Thomas H\u00f6ren, a professor of media and communications law at the University of M\u00fcnster, in an e-mail sent to Deutsche Welle. But, he also warned that this decision was very narrow, focusing on the issue of property rights, and not on the larger issues of data protection from Google. \"The problem of Google Street View - to be honest - has never been a problem of personality rights or property rights, but the enormous risk of personal data compilations in cases where people use Google Street View for compiling personal profiles (such as building insurance companies; future employees, et cetera),\" he added. \"And this risk has not been considered by the Berlin courts.\" Similarly, Viktor Mayer-Sch\u00f6nberger, a professor at the Oxford Internet Institute, agreed that this case was \"limited in scope,\" adding in an e-mail, \"The plaintiff never alleged an actual invasion of privacy, just a potential one.\" Author: Cyrus Farivar Editor: Nancy Isenson",
        "generated_story": "A Landmark Decision on Google Street View in Germany A landmark decision has been made in the German state of Kammergericht in November 2010. The decision marks the end of a long legal battle between Google and the Berlin State Supreme Court over the use of street-view technology in German public transport. A German court has ruled in favor of Google in a case that could have a major impact on the country's transport system. In a ruling published late last year, the court said that the company's technology should be allowed to be used in all public transportation systems, including buses, trains, airports and train stations. It also ruled that Google should not have to pay for the cost of operating a bus or train station. \"The decision is a victory for Google,\" said Thomas H\u00f6ren, a professor of computer science at the University of M\u00fcnster, referring to Google's decision to allow the Internet of Things (IoT) to take over traffic management. Google, however, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. On the other hand, Google said it would continue to work with the state to develop a system that would allow users to make decisions based on their interests and not on whether or not they had any other interests at stake. According to the Oxford Internet Institute's Cyrus Farivar, an expert on German transport policy, there are currently no plans to introduce a new system in Berlin. However, it is not clear whether the decision will have any impact in other German cities, such as Cologne, Munich, Frankfurt or the city of Kassel, or whether it will affect other European cities as well. There have been a number of developments in recent years. One of them is the opening up of the internet of things to people who are not familiar with it. For example, Germany's federal government has decided to open up its Internet portal to those who want to use it in their daily lives. This will be the first time that a German government will open its online portal for people to access the world's most popular online services. But there is still a lot of work to do before a decision like this can be made. That's why I think it's a good idea to start a discussion about the future of Internet transport, which is something that is very important to many people, but is also very difficult for many of us to understand. I don't think that's going to change much, because I'm not sure that I'll be able to say anything about it until I get to Germany. What I can say is that this is an important step in our journey to becoming a world-class transportation system, and I hope that we can make it happen.\" The ruling is expected to come as a surprise to German politicians, who have long been sceptical about whether Google would be willing to share its technology with other companies."

        "target": "UK lawmakers propose jail sentences for reckless bankers A British parliamentary commission has completed its work on the overhaul of the domestic banking sector. Among other things, it proposed jail terms for bankers displaying grave malpractice and causing huge damage. Members of the UK's Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards agreed Wednesday that Britain needed a radical overhaul of its scandal-hit lenders. The panel, which was mostly composed of lawmakers, concluded in its final report that senior bankers must be made personally responsible for malpractice through the introduction of a new criminal offence of reckless misconduct. It would carry a prison sentence. The reputation of the country's banking sector had been damaged in recent years by a string of scandals, including Libor rate-rigging, credit insurance mis-selling and a controversy over staff behavior and bonuses in the run-up to the 2008 global financial crisis. The level of malpractice had been \"shocking and widespread,\" said the commission's chairman, Conservative party lawmaker Andrew Tyrie. RBS cut in two? \"Taxpayers and customers have lost out, and the economy has suffered,\" the 500-page report said. \"Under our recommendations, senior bankers who seriously damage their banks or put taxpayers' money at risk can expect to be fined, banned from the industry or in the worst cases go to jail.\" The commission called for bankers to sign up to a new code of conduct under which all key responsibilities within a bank would be assigned to specific senior officials who would be held responsible. The panel also proposed that more remuneration for bankers should be deferred for longer periods of up to ten years in order to \"reflect the longer run balance between business risks and rewards.\" The commission recommended that the government consider splitting the state-rescued Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) into a good bank and a bad one mopping up toxic assets. The report was published ahead of a key speech by Finance Minister George Osborne on his bank reform plans. hg/ipj (AFP, Reuters)",

Westerwelle heads the free-market liberal FDP, which shares power with Chancellor Merkel's Christian coalition. Earlier this week, Bruederle, also an FDP member, said in light of Germany's currently growing economy, those economic gains should trickle down to employees in the form of higher wages. Merkel, who is also the head of the Christian Democratic Union, supported Bruederle's idea. \"That is something the chancellor sees the same way, letter for letter,\" said Merkel's spokesman, Steffen Seibert. Not so fast Earlier this week, analysts predicted growth of 3.5 percent this year and 2 percent in 2011. Germany's five leading economic think tanks also predicted that the number of unemployed would fall below 3 million next year, the lowest level since 1992. Despite the current rosy outlook for the German economy, not everyone is convinced that a growing economy should inevitably lead to higher wages. The president of the German Institute for Economic Research, Klaus Zimmermann, warned against reacting too quickly. \"I can't support the idea of a general wage increase, I think it is too dangerous,\" Zimmermann said in an interview with the Handelsblatt newspaper. Zimmermann wasn't opposed to the idea of raising wages, but said he was against across-the-board increases for all sectors and pointed out that not every industry is benefitting the same from the growing economy. \"We can't forget that the German economy did not resort to mass lay-offs when it wasn't going so well last year,\" Zimmermann said.

In a statement released on Friday, Chancellor Merkel said it was not possible for her to unilaterally increase the wage for all German workers, but that she was willing to \"make the necessary adjustments\" in order to meet the needs of the working-class. However, she did not rule out the possibility of raising wages for low-income workers in the future, according to the report. German Economy Minister Steffen Seibert, who is close to Merkel, said earlier this year that he had \"no confidence\" that her government would do the right thing by raising the average wage by a quarter of a percentage point.

The previous day, the 56-year-old leader openly accused Germany and neighboring Poland of planning a coup against him. \"There were [in Germany and Poland] plans worked out for an overthrow of the constitutional order,\" Lukashenko said in the Belarusian capital, Minsk, on Thursday. \"This is not an invention of our intelligence agencies.\" Lukashenko, who came to power in 1994, was re-elected last month with 80 percent of the vote in what the opposition and international monitors said was a rigged election. Relations between the reclusive Belarusian government and the West have been strained ever since. 'Belarus question must be answered' German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said in a statement that the accusations were \"baseless\" and an attempt by Lukashenko to draw attention away from his own wrongdoing. \"The EU needs to find a clear political answer to events surrounding the presidential election and the continued incarceration of opposition politicians and their supporters,\" Westerwelle said. A wide-reaching crackdown against the regime's opponents followed Lukashenko's re-election. Hundreds of his critics were arrested and dozens threatened with long-term jail sentences. Poland also dismissed the accusations as absurd and said that relations with Minsk would not be normalized unless all political prisoners were released. Sanctions threat The situation in Belarus pushed the European Union to adopt a resolution on Thursday in support of economic sanctions against the country. The threats earned a sharp rebuke from Lukashenko, who promised the \"hardest possible reaction\" should the bloc impose sanctions against his country. At the same time, the Belarusian prime minister, Mikhail Myasnikovich, travelled to Moscow in a effort to shore up Russian support for Minsk during its standoff with the EU.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government told the Supreme Court of India on Monday that the Rohingya were \"illegal\" immigrants. The hearing is taking place as Rohingya face severe violence in their native Myanmar. More than 400,000 Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh in the past few weeks to escape military and civilian reprisals that the United Nations has described as \"ethnic cleansing.\" Later on Monday, Myanmar's national security advisor said that his government was willing to welcome the refugees who had fled to Bangladesh back to their native Rakhine state, but that the details of the process still had to be worked out. \"We will make sure that everybody who left their home can return to their home but this is a process we have to discuss,\" Thaung Tun told Reuters news agency after a meeting with British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. It was unclear how this would affect the estimated 40,000 Rohingya believed to have settled in India, including 16,000 of whom are registered with the UN's refugee agency. Read more: Myanmar's Rohingya - A history of forced exoduses The Indian government told the court that it had intelligence data that showed links between some Rohingya Muslims and Pakistan-based terror groups and other international terror organizations. It argued that such links made them a \"serious threat to national security.\" The government also said there was a \"serious possibility of eruption of violence against Buddhists in India by radicalized Rohingya.\" Lawyer Colin Gonsalves, who in a separate case is representing about 7,000 Rohingya living in the northern Indian city of Jammu, countered the government's assertions. \"We just want to know: 40,000 people have been here, many of them for the last five years. Have you [the government] filed a single charge sheet, is anyone being prosecuted in the criminal court for being a terrorist? The answer is: no,\" he told DW. The court has adjourned the hearing in the matter to October 3. Lack of evidence India says it is not bound by the UN convention on refugees as it is not a signatory to the accord, but human rights activists disagree. \"The principle of non return of a person to a place where he will be executed or tortured has become a principle of customary international law which India follows,\" Gonsalves told DW. \"And it has attained the status of 'jus cogens,' which is a principle of law that no country can say is not applicable to it, such as torture and genocide.\" In a communication sent to all states in August, the Home Ministry [interior ministry] said the illegal migrants were more susceptible to terrorist recruitment efforts. But an investigation by Indian broadcaster NDTV found \"little evidence of the government claim.\" The investigation that was carried out at major Rohingya settlements in the country showed little involvement in criminal wrongdoing by the refugees. Lack of any evidence to support the government claim has led to speculations that the Rohingya were being targeted for their religion by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu-nationalist government. \"It is really unfortunate that the government is going back on its commitment to refugees which it has reiterated several times in the past merely because these Rohingyas are Muslims,\" said lawyer Prashant Bhushan, who filed the plea on behalf of two Rohingya men. \"I mean this is clearly a case of religious discrimination and an attempt to arouse a sort of feeling of... an anti-Muslim feeling or try and communalise the situation,\" he told reporters outside the courthouse. The UN's human rights chief last week deplored Indian government's move to deport Rohingya refugees. \"India cannot carry out collective expulsions, or return people to a place where they risk torture or other serious violations,\" Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein said. The Rohingya are an Indo-Aryan people, the vast majority of whom are Muslims. They usually migrate to India through a rather porous border to escape persecution in their native Rakhine state in Myanmar, where they have been denied citizenship rights. They are viewed by the local authorities as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. Myanmar's Buddhist majority is often accused of subjecting them to discrimination and violence.

The Home Ministry said the Rohingya, who have been living in Myanmar for the last five years, posed a \"eroneable threat.\" India's Foreign Minister, Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, told the UN General Assembly in an interview with NDTV that \"the Rohingya are a grave threat to our security and the security of our country.\" \"They pose an extremely serious threat,\" he said, adding that the situation in Rakhine state, where the majority of the population lives, was \"difficult to deal with.\" Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has called on Myanmar's military to take action against the group, which is believed to be a terrorist organization. \"The Myanmar army is not going to allow this to happen,\" Modi said at a press conference in Jammu, the capital of Myanmar, on August 25. He also called for an end to violence between Buddhists and Muslims in the state. India, however, rejected the call, saying it was too broad and too narrow. It also rejected a UN resolution calling for a ceasefire between Myanmar and its Rohingya Muslim minority, calling it an \"aggravated provocation\" by the Myanmar government. In a statement released on October 3, India said it would continue to support Myanmar in its fight against terrorism. However, it did not give a specific date for when the ceasefire would be lifted. Earlier, Indian foreign minister, Prashant Bhushan, had said that Myanmar would not allow the return of Rohingya to their home country. Bangladesh's Supreme Court of India has also ruled that Rohingya should not be allowed to return to Myanmar. Bangladeshi President Thaung Tun has been critical of Modi's government's crackdown on the influx of refugees, accusing it of \"playing a dangerous and dangerous game\" with its own security forces. Dhaka-based UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said on September 25 that India was ready to provide security to Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh, but that it had no immediate plans to do so."

Addressing his remarks to cyclists, McQuaid said the fight against doping was his priority. \"UCI is listening and is on your side. We\u2019ve come too far in the fight against doping to return to our past. Cycling has a future and something like this must not happen again.\" The scathing USADA report included testimony from 11 former teammates, accusing Armstrong of running the \"most sophisticated\" doping program in the sport's history. The USADA said it had collected evidence to prove the seven-time Tour de France winner had engaged in the biggest doping conspiracy to date. Effect on cycling and sponsorship Monday's decision comes as the sport of cycling reels from Armstrong's well-documented fall from grace. Organizers of the Tour de France will be trying to move on from the scandal as the race prepares to celebrate its centenary next year. Sponsors have been deserting Armstrong and the sport in general. Last week, Nike - one of Armstrong's main corporate sponsors - said it was terminating its relationship with the cyclist and accused him of deception. Trek, the company that made the bicycles Armstrong rode to seven titles, announced on the same day it would terminate its sponsorship contract - as did the beer maker Anheuser-Busch. The Dutch institution Rabobank ended its association with professional cycling after the doping allegations came to light, leaving 17 riders in need of a sponsor. Last week Armstrong also announced he would step down from his own charity, the Lance Armstrong Foundation, also known as Livestrong, a move believed to have been intended to limit the damage to the organization from the USADA report.

The UCI said in a statement that it had found no evidence that Armstrong had tested positive for the banned substances. \"We have not found any evidence to support the allegations,\" the organization said, adding that the decision was made \"in the interest of transparency and accountability.\" Armstrong's former team-mate Pat McQuaid, who now runs the Armstrong Foundation, said he had been informed of the news by his wife and daughter. He added that he would not comment on the matter at the time of publication, but that \"it is a matter of great concern to me that we are not allowed to comment at this time.\" \"It is an interesting and difficult couple of weeks for us,\" he said. 'We are very disappointed in the outcome of this investigation and we will continue to do our utmost to ensure the integrity of our athletes and the safety of all our fans and supporters.\" The announcement came as the United States Department of Agriculture announced it would no longer allow Armstrong to compete in cycling's most prestigious sporting event. It was the first time the sport's governing body had banned Armstrong from participating in any major sporting competition since the start of last year's Tour of France. In October, Armstrong won the Tour in his home state of Texas, where he spent the last two years as a professional cyclist. His father, Pat, is also a former cyclist, and his son, Lance, was also banned for doping in an attempt to prevent him from competing in other sporting events. A spokesman for Armstrong\u2019s foundation said the team was \"deeply disappointed\" with the ruling. \u201cWe regret to inform you that Lance has not been able to participate in this event,\u201d the spokesman told AFP news agency, referring to the announcement.

President Obama vowed to nominate a successor 'in due time,' despite political opposition. The 79-year old justice died in his sleep, presumably of natural causes, local media reported on Saturday. Scalia was visiting Texas for a hunting trip, and his body was discovered after he failed to appear for breakfast in the resort where he was staying. US President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama extended \"their deepest condolences to Justice Scalia's family,\" White House deputy spokesman Eric Schultz said. Texas Governor Greg Abbott described the conservative justice as a \"man of God, a patriot and an unwavering defender of the written Constitution and the rule of law.\" \"He was the solid rock who turned away so many attempts to depart from and distort the Constitution. His fierce loyalty to the Constitution set an unmatched example, not just for judges and lawyers, but for all Americans,\" Abbot said. Battle for the empty seat His passing is likely to open a new political front between President Barack Obama and the Republican Party, as Scalia's replacement could shift the composition of the court towards a more liberal persuasion. Several Republican lawmakers have already urged Obama to leave the decision to the next president who will be voted in later this year. \"The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court justice,\" Senate Republican majority leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement, referring to the upcoming November general election. \"Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president,\" McConnell concluded. President Obama, however, said he would fulfill his constitutional duty and nominate Scalia's successor \"in due time.\" \"These are responsibilities I take seriously, and so should everyone. They are bigger than any one party,\" he said. Decades of controversy Scalia joined the Supreme Court in 1986, becoming the first Italian-American to serve in the top judicial body. He was nominated by US President Ronald Reagan. Throughout his long carrier, Scalia voted in favor of privacy and protecting defendants' rights, but also against legalizing abortion, same-sex marriage and gun control. He also drew public attention for his theatrical flair and sharpness of tongue, as well as his alleged unwillingness to compromise. In June last year, the nine-person Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage with a five-to-four vote. Scalia, who was in the minority, commented he would \"hide my head in a bag\" if his own name were associated with the decision. He also said that the majority opinion was \"couched in a style that is as pretentious as its content is egotistic.\" dj/jm (AP, Reuters, AFP, dpa)",

One of the highlights is the Goethe Institute, which is located in the western German city of Freiberg. There's a museum there, as well as a library and a caf\u00e9, but I don't know much about it. But I do know that it's very important to me that I get to see the work of a German-Mexican professor who is very knowledgeable about German literature and history. He's also very interested in German history and philosophy, so I think I'll take a look at some of his books. My first stop was Mexico, where I was staying in a small apartment with my wife and two young children. After that, I went to Mexico to visit my parents and my grandmother. We had a great time there. And then I came back home and we had dinner. Then it was time to go to bed. That's when I realized that my trip was going to be a long one, because I didn't have the time or the money to travel. So I decided to stay for the night and sleep in my own bed for a couple of days. In the morning I woke up to a beautiful sunrise and the sun was shining on my face.

        "target": "Opinion: The pope's impossible mission in Mexico Pope Francis's trip to Mexico is a dangerous mission - a diplomatic as well as political balancing act, one that brings with it enormous expectations. Francis won't be able to meet them, says DW's Astrid Prange. Dead prisoners, disappearing students, refugees shot dead and murdered priests. Mexico has lived through one violent episode after the other. The mood in the nation is explosive. And now this: just a day before the pope is set to arrive, more than 50 people died in the largest prison revolt in the country's history. What meaning does the pope's presence hold on such an occasion? Only one thing is certain: Francis won't be able to resolve the problems of the world's second largest Catholic nation in just a five-day trip. The unrealistic demands placed on him are not something he can fill. Yet the pope carries with him an important message: you don't have to love your enemies but you do need to speak with them. And he's living the example himself by meeting with the Russian Orthodox Patriarch Kirill on a stopover in Cuba on his way to Mexico. Cuba all over again It's sensational! Bannings and mutual ex-communications are ancient history. Nearly a millennium after the split, the head of the Roman Catholic Church and the head of the Russian Orthodox Church are speaking to each other. It's not as if the two will become friends - their positions are far too different. Yet their centuries-old enmity feels out of place and in view of the massive worldwide persecution of Christians, almost unchristian. And both of these church leaders know this. In Mexico, efforts to stem the polarizing forces at play in society have not been successful. The extreme differences between rich and poor are dividing Mexican society. President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto has prioritized economic growth over dialogue with his critics - a group which includes students as well as teachers and union members who regularly protest against government policies. They demand an end to lawlessness and corruption. The presumed murder of 43 teaching students in Iguala in September 2014, a crime which remains unsolved, stands as a symbol of the lawlessness sweeping Mexico. The recent mutiny in a Monterrey jail serves as further proof of the country's shortcomings in regard to human rights and the rule of law. With a visit to Ciudad Juarez and the largest prison in Mexico, Francis will only make that deficiency more transparent. Even the pope of peace has enemies. The route he's chosen to take on his travels through the country has displeased the staunchly Catholic president. A meeting with the relatives of the Iguala victims is therefore hush-hush and participation in a holy mass remains secret. Considering the tense situation in the country, it's still possible that the pope's route will change once again. The church in the pillory Even within his own church, Francis has met with opposition. A meeting he requested with victims from the church's abuse scandal will not take place - a bitter disappointment for many former seminarians who were abused by Marcial Maciel, the founder of the Legion of Christ, and members of his order. It's just one example of how impunity continues even within the church itself. None of the perpetrators have yet to answer for their crimes in court. It appears as though the pope has accomplished more on the world stage than he has brought on reforms to the Vatican. Despite the revolutionary coming together of Cuba and the US and the revolutionary meeting with Patriarch Kirill, the revolution in Rome has yet to materialize. Do you have something to say? Add your comments below. The thread to this editorial closes in 24 hours.",

The pontiff's trip to the Roman Catholic Church is being criticized by some in the country for its lack of commitment to religious freedom. In an interview with DW's Astrid Prange, the head of Mexico's Catholic bishops' conference, Francis said he had \"no idea\" what he was doing. \"I don't know what the pope is going to do,\" he said, adding that he would like to \"make sure that the people of this country know that they are not being persecuted.\" The pope's visit comes just a day after the Mexican president, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, announced the end of his five-day visit to his home state of Chiapas, which he called \"the most sacred place in Latin America.\" In a statement released by the Vatican on Friday, Pope Benedict XVI said the visit was \"an opportunity for the faithful to express their love and respect for one another.\" \"The pope has a great deal to say about Mexico,\" said Marcial Maciel, president of the Russian Orthodox Church in Ciudad Juarez, \"but it is also an opportunity to show that Mexico is a Christian country, not a communist country.\" He added that \"it is not possible for a pope to travel to a country where there are so many people who are persecuted for their faith and who do not have the means to fight for what they believe to be the rights of others to live and work in peace and dignity.\" But it's not just the Pope who is criticized. He's also criticized the government's handling of human rights abuses in Cuba and Cuba, accusing it of failing to protect the interests of its citizens. On top of that, he has also called on the US government to step up its anti-apartheid efforts in other Latin American countries, such as Cuba. And he's calling for an end to violence against Christians in his own country. His visit is the latest in a long line of papal visits to Mexican cities, including the capital, Monterrey, as well as the city of Iguala, where he spent the last five days. It's the first visit by an American pope in more than a century, and the most recent was in September 2014, when Pope John Paul II visited Mexico in an attempt to ease tensions between US President Barack Obama and his successor, former US Secretary of State John Kerry."

        "target": "Report: Torture is a European problem too A day after Amnesty International published a report on Europe's collusion with the CIA's torture program, the Council of Europe published its own shocking survey of abuse in detention centers across the continent. Prison guards in several European countries carried out reprisals against detainees who talked to the Council of Europe's Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT), the new CPT report has revealed. The council considers this a violation of the spirit of cooperation between the CPT and the Council of Europe's member states. According to the CPT's 24th General Report, released on Wednesday, reprisals were carried out against prisoners in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Greece, Hungary, Moldova, Russia, Spain, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and Ukraine. \"Intimidation or retaliation against persons the CPT has interviewed may not only violate their human rights but also strikes a blow to the preventive mechanism established by the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture,\" CPT President Letif H\u00fcseynov said in a statement. \"I urge national authorities to respect their obligation to prevent, investigate and punish such actions.\" The report also highlighted several problems with the detention of juveniles around Europe, and proposed a series of practical measures to protect young people's rights when detained. Ad hoc visits The little-known CPT, now 25 years old, represents a unique approach to international torture prevention. A team of specialists make roughly 180 visits a year to all kinds of detention centers (including prisons, police stations, holding centers for immigration detainees, psychiatric hospitals, and even social care homes) all across the 47-member Council of Europe - one of the few international blocs that offer platforms for dialogue with Eastern European regimes considered to have poor human rights records, such as Russia, Azerbaijan, and Ukraine. The method combines the carrot of talks with government officials and the stick of ad hoc visits, which all members are committed to allowing into their prisons. Once inside, the CPT also has the right to interview any detainees it chooses - in private, though of course the detainees have the right to refuse. \"The first thing to say is how important the CPT is,\" said Carla Ferstman, director of Redress, a UK-based organization that helps torture survivors. \"As a result of their boot work over a very long period of time, the UN has set up a global system which in many ways mirrors the approach of the CPT.\" But given that the committee has no powers to enforce its proposals to governments, there are question marks over its effectiveness. \"In the report, they complain about how some of the recommendations they've made have not been implemented,\" said Ferstman. \"It's a sign that they're a little bit frustrated.\" But in the long run, she maintains, the CPT has more than proved its value. \"The dialogue that they are able to have is really important,\" she said. \"Looking long-term, they have been very effective.\" CIA collusion, asylum seekers The CPT's report comes a day after Amnesty International released its own report on European collusion with the CIA's torture program. While the CPT's report examines more prosaic day-to-day mistreatment, rather than mass rendition of terrorist suspects at the behest of the US, there are obvious links between the two, since some countries - such as Poland, Macedonia, and the UK - are highlighted in both reports. \"What is finally coming out in all of this is that the Europeans, despite all the criticism of the Bush and Obama administrations on the use of torture - so many of them connived,\" said Judy Dempsey, senior associate at Carnegie Europe. \"It's really a double standard. This report is quite damning and quite shameful, and it follows the Amnesty International one as well.\" The CPT's work also mentions the mistreatment of asylum seekers, a problem increasingly afflicting European countries that take in the largest number of asylum seekers - particularly Spain, Italy, and Greece. \"With Greece there are two things to remember,\" Dempsey told DW. \"A - the appalling situation of the prison system, and B - the lack of training among police of how to deal with asylum seekers. Awful things have happened. Parallel to this is the illegal detention centers. There have been lots of cases of terrible mistreatment over the last several years.\" \"Immigration detention is a growing issue,\" added Ferstman. \"In the UK, there was a whole parliamentary inquiry into one immigration detention center, where some of the women alleged that guards propositioned them in order to get quick treatment on their claims. Each country has its own history of torture.\"",

Every year, the East German city remembers its dead. DW's Naomi Conrad was on hand. As the tram trundled through Dresden's drab suburbs on Friday morning, a prim, elderly woman suddenly turned to her friend sitting on the seat beside her: \"You know, my mother never told me about the bombings.\" She shrugged, then, after a moment's pause, continued. \"It must have been such unspeakable hell that she just couldn't talk about it,\" the woman said. She was referring to February 13, 1945 - the morning, exactly 70 years ago, when Allied bombers swooped down on an unsuspecting city famous for its baroque architecture and that, until that point, had survived the war mostly unscathed. That was to change in the course of three dreadful days: As the bombs rained down on the city, its churches and palaces were turned to rubble. Up to 25,000 people - many of them refugees fleeing the advancing Soviet Red Army - died in the inferno that raged in the city for days. \"There was nothing left, nothing,\" a frail, bent man with a checkered cap recalled, \"just rubble and death.\" He was leaning on the balustrade of a viewing platform in Dresden's old gasometer, staring down at the 360-degree painting by the Iranian-German artist Yadegar Asisi; sirens howled from hidden speakers and strobe lighting illuminated the ruined churches and black smoke billowing from the burnt skeletons that were once buildings. The man swallowed, his voice hoarse, barely audible: \"It's so hard being here.\" The soundtrack and images, he said, \"bring back too many memories.\" 'So, so many dead' He was 15, he recalled, working on a school essay when the sirens began to wail. He never finished the essay. Instead, he ran for shelter with his family. When they returned home three days later, the roof had been blown off, the windows smashed. \"But we were lucky: We survived,\" he said. \"There were so, so many dead.\" His voice broke and, muttering an apology, he shuffled off. The bombings were intended to break the German population's morale - a decision that to many was incomprehensible, given that the war had long been decided and Dresden's economic and strategic importance was relatively minimal. Consequently, the death and destruction wreaked by the Allied bombers quickly became a tool, first for the Nazi propagandists in the last months of the war, then by the East German regime for its anti-West propaganda, and then later by neo-Nazi groups, who traditionally congregate on February 13. Even today, \"the debate continues about guilt and innocence, even about the exact number of victims,\" Dresden Mayor Helma Orosz told a packed audience, including delegations from abroad, gathered for a memorial service in the city's Frauenkirche, which in 2005 was rebuilt with the help of private donations after Germany's reunification, many of them from the United States and Great Britain. Call for peace \"War, hatred and violence begin in people's minds,\" Orosz said. \"We must resist any attempt at once again categorizing people based on their origin and skin color,\" she added, referring to what has often been described as a right-wing catchall movement called PEGIDA, generally translated as Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West, which has taken to the streets in Dresden since October. Later, on a platform overlooking thousands of people, many of them wearing white roses as a sign of peace while bracing the icy cold outside the church, Orosz called on Dresden to remember every victim of the Nazi terror - a plea that was reiterated by German President Joachim Gauck when he took to the microphone: \u201cWe don't want the pain that people suffered here to be misused by others.\u201d Behind him, the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, who, back in the Frauenkirche, had talked of the \u201cmiracle that peace in Europe represents,\u201d leaned in closer to his interpreter. Then, as evening fell over Dresden and church bells tolled, thousands - possibly as many as 10,000, according to the city's press office - lined up along Dresden's riverfront, holding hands to commemorate the dead and call for peace as police men dressed in black riot gear looked on. \"I can remember it all,\" Siegfriede Leonhard, a vivacious woman in her late 70s said. She was 7 when the bombs fell, she said, and had been coming to the commemorations in Dresden \"for at least 60 years.\" Sometimes, she said, stomping her feet to keep warm, she wondered whether she shouldn't remember at home, alone. \"",

The city was devastated by a series of bombings on February 13, 1945, which killed at least 60,000 people and wounded more than 2,500. Hundreds of thousands of people died in the bombing, and thousands more were injured. \"It was a terrible day for Dresden,\" Helma Orosz told DW in an interview published on Friday. She said she was shocked to learn that the bombings had been carried out by the Red Army, but that she had no idea what was going on until she saw the news on the television news. Her husband, Siegfriede Leonhard, was killed when a bomb exploded in front of his home in Dresden. He was taken to a nearby hospital, where he died three days later. His wife, Yadegar Asisi, died at the same hospital. They had just returned from a trip to the United States where they were reunited with their son, who was born in 1945. Their daughter, Naomi Conrad, is now in her late 70s and lives in Canterbury, New Zealand. In 2005, she married Joachim Gauck, a former German prime minister who later became the head of Germany's Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of Europe (PEGIDA), a group of anti-Communist politicians who opposed the reunification of East Germany with the Soviet Union. Since then, they have been living in exile in Great Britain and the former Soviet republic of Romania. Today, many of them have returned to Germany, although they no longer live in Germany. On the contrary, their lives have changed drastically since the end of World War II. Now they are back in their old lives, with a new generation of German citizens living and working in a refugee camp in northern England. And they're back to being Germans again, even if it's just for a short period of time before they return to their former homes. That's the way it used to be. Every year, Germany is bombarded by warplanes, rockets, bombs and rockets. At least 70 years ago, it was Germany that was bomb-free. Seventy years later, there is still the threat of nuclear war. There's still a great deal of fear and uncertainty about what the future holds for Germany and for the West. But it seems to me that there's a lot more to life than just war and peace. I can't wait to see what happens next."

        "target": "Experts: Taliban have not changed strategy with Kabul restaurant attack The weekend attack on a Kabul restaurant frequented by foreigners came as no surprise to international organizations on the ground. Experts don't believe the Taliban have changed their strategy to target more civilians. Dramatic scenes must have played out in the restaurant: Guests sought cover under tables as a group of terrorists shot wildly into the dining rooms. News agencies report the restaurant owner tried in vain to fend off the attackers. He was among the more than 20 people who perished, most of whom were employees at international organizations. The attackers were also among the dead. During the evening dinner rush, at 7:00 p.m. Friday (17.01.2014), one of three Taliban members detonated his explosives-laden vest and blew a breach in the highly secured restaurant. Neither the man-high blast walls, nor the secured access points with armed guards could stop the attackers. The two remaining terrorists were killed later in a firefight with security forces at the scene. No change in Taliban strategy The suicide bombing on the popular Lebanese restaurant, Taverna Du Liban, in the high-end Kabul neighborhood of Wazir Akbar Khan was the worst attack so far in 2014. Afghanistan votes for a new president in April; and the international troops are scheduled to withdraw from the country by the end of the year. Although there are plans for a small contingent to remain in Afghanistan, President Hamid Karzai first has to sign a bilateral security agreement with the United States. But he continues to play for time. In this context, the Taliban may be targeting civilians more in order to drive out not just the military coalition, but the entire international community. Yet \"as horrible as this incident is, I don't see a change in strategy,\" said Thomas Ruttig, the co-director of the Afghan Analysts Network. Similar attacks have also been launched before, \"at least 12 to 15 times in the past eight years,\" Ruttig said. The worst attack was in 2012 at Qargha Lake, a popular weekend destination near Kabul. More than 20 people were killed, all of them Afghans. Extensive security precautions The Taliban, which normally doesn't miss an opportunity for fiery rhetoric, hasn't declared a change in strategy. A spokesman for the Islamist militant group said the attack was retaliation for a NATO airstrike in Parwan Province, a few kilometers north of Kabul. According to an assistant of the Afghan president, seven children and one woman died in the coalition strike. \"You have to carefully monitor the security situation,\" Nils W\u00f6rmer, head of the Konrad Adenauer Institute in Kabul, told DW. \"But I think it's a bit early to talk about a change in [Taliban] strategy.\" W\u00f6rmer's office lies just a few hundred meters from the site of Friday's attack. He could clearly hear the explosion, which shook the window panes in his office. \"It was immediately clear to me that something had happened,\" W\u00f6rmer recounted. But the Konrad Adenauer Institute was prepared. \"We had a relatively concrete warning in the last week related to our neighborhood, and we were very cautious,\" W\u00f6rmer said. He met with colleagues in his secured office. Like most of the international organizations, the Konrad Adenauer Institute is also integrated into the security networks. \"The security precautions are high,\" W\u00f6rmer said. \"But that doesn't exclude the possibility that something similar could happen again.\" But the Afghan security forces have succeeded in preventing many attacks in the past few months, he said. Kabul residents criticize Taliban An informal, impromptu poll by DW's Kabul correspondent, Hussein Sirat, suggested the Taliban are not winning Afghan hearts and minds with such attacks. \"Wherever the Taliban have killed civilians, they have not achieved their goal,\" said Mirwais, a pedestrian in the Kabul city center. Idris, another Kabul resident, seconded Mirwais' sentiment. \"The Taliban intimidate the people so that the security agreement won't be signed,\" he said. \"But the people won't bend to this intimidation.\" How the international organizations adapt to the tense security situation in Kabul will come after many conversations, analyses, and briefings in the following days. But W\u00f6rmer is not thinking about giving up. \"We have a clear agenda and long-term projects, which I considered to be very sensible,\" W\u00f6rmer said. \"I am of the opinion, as I was before, that what I'm doing here with the Konrad Adenauer Institute is worth the risks.\"",
        "generated_story": "Afghan Analysts: Taliban haven't changed their strategy with Kabul restaurant attack Afghan analysts say the Taliban have not changed the strategy in the past eight years with the attack on a restaurant in Kabul. The attacks on the restaurant on Friday (17.01.2014) were the latest in a string of attacks by the Afghan Taliban on Afghan restaurants and bars across the country. In the last week alone, more than 1,000 people have died in attacks across Afghanistan, according to the Konrad Adenauer Institute, a think-tank in Parwan Province, which is home to Afghanistan's largest city, Mirwais. According to W\u00f6rmer, most of the victims of Friday's attack were Afghan nationals. \"They were all Afghans,\" he told DW, adding that many of them were Afghans, and that the attacks were a result of a lack of cooperation between Afghan security forces and the Kabul government. However, there were also reports that a number of people had been killed in recent attacks in other Afghan cities, including the capital Kabul, as well as in several other cities in northern and eastern Afghanistan. Some of these attacks have been carried out by armed groups, such as the Islamic State (IS), which controls large swathes of territory in eastern and western Afghanistan and has been waging a guerrilla war against the United States and NATO since 2012. Many of those who were killed have fled to neighboring countries, while others have returned to their home countries to seek refuge in Europe or the Middle East.

        "target": "Teabag filter cleans water with nanotechnology A new water filter developed in South Africa could provide millions of people with clean drinking water. The filter, about the size and shape of a teabag, would be inexpensive, easy to distribute and simple to use. Marelize Botes is conducting a final set of tests on a new type of diminutive water filter before industrial production can begin. The microbiologist pours water from a plastic bottle though a high-tech, teabag-sized filter before analyzing it in her in her laboratory at the University of Stellenbosch in South Africa. \"The filter is much cheaper than bottled water as well as any other filter on the market,\" she told Deutsche Welle. Instead of being filled with black or green tea, the bag contains active carbon granules and is made from nanofibers treated with biocide, which kills bacteria rather than simply filtering them from the water. Nanotech for pennies \"This project takes nanotechnology to the poorest of the poor people who live in this world, and it will make a difference in their lives,\" said Eugen Cloete, who in addition to inventing the filter is dean of the faculty of science at Stellenbosch University and chair of Stellenbosch University's Water Institute. With some 300 million people in Africa - and over a billion worldwide - living without access to clean drinking water, the need for such a filter is huge. When in mass production, the developers said they expect the teabag to cost just a few South African cents (under half a US cent and under a third of a euro cent). In addition to being inexpensive, Botes said, the filter is also easy to distribute to rural area and simple to use as it can be place in an adapter that fits on nearly any regular-sized plastic bottle. Each filter can clean one liter (one quart) of the most polluted water to the point where it is completely safe to drink. Once used, the filter can be disposed of and is biodegradable. African countries, led by Somalia, Mauritania and Sudan, were ranked to have the most vulnerable water supplies, according to a June report by UK-based risk consultancy firm Maplecroft. Decentralized use The filter's small size and light weight make it ideal for rural areas where other means of filtration do not exist, Cloete said. \"It is simply impossible to build purification infrastructure at every polluted stream,\" Cloete said. \"So we have to take the solution to the people. The water is cleaned right then and there when you drink from the bottle.\" The filter is now undergoing testing by the South African Bureau of Standards, after which Cloete and his team hope it can be rolled out to the United Nations and non-governmental organizations that have expressed interest in it by the end of the year. The project grew out of research into larger filters, according to Cloete. \"We were busy developing filters for larger applications, but when you do the tests in the labatory you do the tests on a much smaller scale,\" he said. \"The results we were getting on a smaller amount of water promoted me to think about a smaller application.\" Author: Joerg Poppendieck, Sean Sinico Editor: Anke Rasper",
        "generated_story": "A Teabag-sized water filter for decentralized drinking in Africa The South African Bureau of Standards has approved the use of a small, water-saving device to reduce the cost of drinking water in the country. It will be available in South Africa by the end of the year, according to a report published in June. According to the report, the device will cost just half a US cent (1 euro) to install. The report said that the technology would be able to be used in a wide range of countries, including Sudan, Somalia, Mauritania, Sudan and Somalia. \"It will allow us to provide water to people who have no access to clean water,\" said Joerg Poppendieck, a water expert at the University of Stellenbosch in Johannesburg, adding that it would also allow people with low incomes to drink water without having to pay for it. However, it is not yet clear how much the system would cost in terms of time and cost. In addition, there are concerns about the impact on people's health and well-being if the water is used for drinking purposes, such as for irrigation, for example, or for the treatment of crops. This is the first time that a system has been approved for decentralizing water supply to countries with high levels of poverty and social inequality. At the same time, this technology is being tested in countries where poverty rates are much lower than in other African countries. For instance, in Somalia there is a government-run water treatment plant, which is supposed to have the capacity to handle water from the ground up. But the government has rejected the idea, saying it was \"too expensive\" and \"unhelpful.\" \"We are not going to allow this to happen in our country,\" says Marelize Botes from Maplecroft, an agricultural research institute based in Cape Town. She adds that \"we have to make sure that we have enough water for our people to live in peace and prosperity.\" The project is part of an effort to improve the quality of water used by millions of people across the continent, and is aimed at reducing the number of conflicts of interest that can occur when people are living in conflict zones, she says. 'It's not a solution that will solve all the problems of conflict and poverty,' she adds."

It's very easy and the best bit is, it can be reused. Maybe it will come back to you on your birthday. 1. All you need is a piece of fabric big enough to wrap your gift, a ribbon long enough to go right around it, and if you want to make a gift tag, you will also need a piece of old cardboard, a hole punch and another small piece of ribbon. Ready? 2. No, wait, we forgot the present. Get that, and you have everything you need. Spread the fabric on the ground and put your gift on top 3. Fold the fabric around the gift you are wrapping 4. With the last little bit, you don't tuck it under, but create a little flap on top 5. Fold that flap over like this 6. Take one end of the parcel and tuck the fabric inside, BEHIND the gift inside 7. You can take your time to wiggle it all inside. Make it as flat as you can 8. Once it is all inside, turn to the other end and do the same thing again 9. When you have done both ends, it should look like this. Your present is all tucked up inside and you don't need any tape to keep it closed 10. Now for the ribbon. Place the gift on top of it 11. Tie the bow 12. So it looks like this. Finished? If you want a gift tag, that comes now. If you don't you're done! 13. Cut a piece out of an old cardboard box and make a hole in it using a hole punch. Watch your fingers though ;) 14. Put a piece of short ribbon through your hole 15. Tie the tag to your gift 16. And you are finished! P.S. You can either ask your friend to reuse the fabric, and show them how to wrap with it, or if they don't like that idea, you can take it home with you to use again the next time. And remember, you don't have to buy the fabric. You can use an old pillow case, an old t-shirt or skirt, or whatever you want. You can even make your ribbon from an old t-shirt if you don't have any. Happy wrapping.",

You don't have to be a professional to do it. Simply put, you can wrap your present with a paper towel and then wrap it in a plastic wrap. That way, it doesn't look like a piece of paper. It's not as if you're going to use paper, tape, scissors, or any other kind of adhesive. Just wrap the present in plastic and let it dry for a few minutes. Then you'll be ready to put it on the table. Don't forget to wash your hands before you put the paper on. This is a great way to make sure that everything is dry and that it's ready for the next time you go to the store. If you've got a lot of time to think about it, this is one of the most effective ways to get rid of clutter and clutter in your life. When you get to a certain point in time, just remember that you want to have a good, clean, and organized present, not just the one that looks like it belongs on a shelf, but also the ones that look as though they've been wrapped in paper for years. These are the kinds of things that can be done in the future. They can even be used to decorate a room, such as a kitchen, a dining room table, an office or even a guest room. The best part about wrapping presents is that they're easy to clean up and tidy up. There's no need to worry about what's in front of you when you open the package. All you need is the right amount of tape and a little bit of glue. And that's all there is to it! You're done! Now let's move on to something else. I'll show you how to wrap my present.  I'm not sure what it is exactly but I think it will be pretty easy for me to figure out what I want. What do I do with all of this paper? I just use my fingers and my hands and I can't think of a single thing that I wouldn't do without the help of my fingertips. We'll see how it all works out. First of all, let me tell you about the process of wrapping your presents. Do you have any idea how easy this process is?  You'll need a couple of tools. One of them is paper towels, the other is tape or a rubber band. Let's see if it works for you. Another is rubber bands or something like that.

        "target": "European court overturns law requiring German-language skills for spouse visas The European Court of Justice has overturned a German law requiring foreign spouses from certain non-EU countries to take a language test before receiving a visa. The ruling primarily affects Germany's Turkish minority. The European Union's highest court on Thursday ruled in favor of a Turkish citizen, who was denied a visa to live in Germany with her husband, because she was illiterate and therefore unable to demonstrate basic German-language skills. According to the court, a lack of language skills shouldn't automatically lead to the rejection of an entry visa application. Instead, Germany must consider the unique circumstances of each individual case. The court went on to say that quickly granting visas for spouses improves the quality of life and promotes the integration of foreign residents. Specifically addressing the case of the Turkish plaintiff, the court ruled that the rejection of her visa had violated a bilateral treaty between Turkey and the EU. In 1970, Brussels and Ankara agreed not to tighten their residency laws for each other's citizens. Law only applies to some In 2007, Germany introduced the requirement that spouses from certain non-EU countries must demonstrate a basic grasp of German before being granted a visa to live in Germany with their husbands or wives. Spouses affected by the law are required to obtain a basic language certificate from recognized centers, such as Germany's Goethe Institute, proving that they have an A1 level, or \"Beginning German\" language ability. The German government claims that the goal of the language requirement is to prevent forced marriages as well as marriages made simply for the sake of obtaining a visa. Citizens of European Free Trade Association (EFTA) member states are exempt from the language requirement. That includes Iceland, Lichtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. In addition, citizens of Australia, Canada, Israel, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea and the United States also don't have to demonstrate German-language skills. slk/xx (AFP, AP, dpa, KNA)",

The decision by the European Union's lower court in the eastern German city of Lichtenstein is a setback for the EU's efforts to ease the burden on spouses. A German court ruled Thursday that the law was not binding enough to make spouses aware of the differences between the two countries' languages. In a ruling that is expected to take effect in 2007, the court found that Germany's law did not infringe on the rights of spouses of EU citizens living in other EU member states. \"The law does not provide for spouses who are not able to understand each other's language,\" the ruling said in a statement. It also said that it would not affect spouses whose spouses are unable to communicate with one another. Germany, which has the largest number of German-speaking citizens, is the only EU country with a higher proportion of foreign-born citizens than the United States. However, it is not the first time that this has been the case. Earlier this year, Germany and Canada agreed on a new law that would allow spouses with two children to use German as a second language when they travel to other European countries. That law, known as EFTA (European Free Trade Association) (EFTA), was first introduced in 1970 by Norway's Goethe Institute, a think-tank that specializes in international relations, and was later adopted by Canada and New Zealand. Since then, there have been several other countries that have adopted similar laws, including Norway, Canada, Switzerland, Australia, Japan, South Korea, Turkey and the Netherlands. Norway has also adopted a similar law in recent years, but it has yet to be implemented in any other member state. lt/kms (AP, AFP, dpa)"

Many voters are still undecided, including those in the Paris caf\u00e9 where DW's Jake Cigainero saw the latest TV debate. Just over two weeks ahead of the first round of voting in France's presidential election, all 11 candidates met for the second televised debate of the campaign. It was the first time in the history of French elections that the entire official ballot shared a television stage. This race for the Elysee is perhaps the most closely watched election in the history of the Fifth Republic in view of conservative candidate Francois Fillon's embezzlement charges, the deterioration of the left, political amateur Emmanuel Macron's surprise surge to the top, and the rise of Marine Le Pen's National Front. With so much media attention on the five main candidates, Tuesday's debate felt almost like a consolation for the six other candidates rarely in the spotlight. For French voters watching the televised debate at Cafe des Phares on Place de la Bastille, the saturated stage kept the candidates from detailed discussion of pressing issues. For those who are still undecided, the debate did little to bring them closer to choosing their pick for president. Vincent Couronne, a researcher, said it was good to see candidates who don't get as much media attention. However, 11 candidates at once for the political spectator was overkill. \"It wasn't very interesting. It's just one position after another. There's no real debate. It's not like when it was just five candidates.\" Boredom all round Charlotte Theuvenin and her friends, all students in their early 20s, tuned out early on from boredom and exasperation. \"It was too flat and too hypocritical. Fillon and Le Pen play with our money, then say they did nothing and that they are good for our country,\" she said. As though addressing the candidates in front of her on the TV screen, she added, \"How dare you talk about being president when you use our money for your own interests.\" Le Pen had come under fire over accusations that she misused public funds to pay bodyguards as parliamentary assistants. Francois Fillon of Les Republicains, meanwhile, is under investigation for allegedly paying family members more than 1 million euros ($1.1 million) for government work they never carried out. Frequently casting a blank stare at his opponents, Fillon also seemed bored, or at least more subdued compared to the first debate. Couronne said, \"Fillon seems to be not there. Probably because he knows all the small candidates can attack him on the criminal offenses he's accused of.\" Debate watchers cited Europe as the most important issue of this election, with many fearing Le Pen's promise to tear France out of the European Union in a so-called Frexit. Though no one at the cafe vocally supported Le Pen's plan, several acknowledged the EU is a pressure point for France. \"France's place in Europe in relation to Germany is a very important issue,\" said student Thibault Cirier. \"The general problem is France has lost its influence at the European level over the years, and that needs to be remedied, because France is one of the founders of Europe and should have a strong place in the union. The EU is also important for cohesion and to have a strong position internationally.\" Caf\u00e9 viewers say no to Le Pen Cirier was initially excited by Macron when he launched his campaign, but ultimately decided there was no substance. Now he says he will probably vote for far-left candidate Jean-Luc Melenchon. Kevser Taspinar also said she liked Melenchon for his fighting spirit and that \"he throws barbs.\" As a practicing Muslim who wears a headscarf, she said the most important issue for her is laicite, France's state institution of secularism. \"For me Hamon has the best interpretation of this. Maybe Hamon,\" Taspinar said hesitating. \"I'm still undecided, because there's Melenchon.\" Another viewer, Marie Dubois, said that although she really liked Melenchon, she had definitively decided on Macron. \"Melenchon has a way of putting humanity in politics and giving hope,\" she said. \"But Macron is the only possible candidate.\" With polls putting Le Pen and Macron in the second round on May 7, the undecided voters at this Paris cafe said they were certain which candidate they would not for vote for in that scenario. \"Definitely Macron. There is no way I am going to vote for Le Pen,\" Theuvenin said. \"I will never vote for that woman or Front National, no matter who is running against them in the second round.\" Tuesday was the final debate for Macron and Melenchon, two of the crowd-pleasers among the candidates. Both have pulled out of the third debate on grounds that it cuts too close to the first vote just two days later on April 23.",
        "generated_story": "France's Le Pen and Fillon: 'No' DW's Jake Cigainero looks back at the years of French politics in the wake of Emmanuel Macron's election victory. The French president's victory was hailed as a victory for the country's democratic values. But it was also a defeat for France's far-right National Front (FN) party. In a speech delivered in Hamon on April 23, the FN's presidential candidate Thibault Cirier and his wife, Charlotte Theuvenin, spoke about the party's long-term prospects in France. \"The party is in a very difficult position,\" said the Front National's candidate for president, Jean-Luc Melenchon, \"but we have a lot of work to do.\" \"We have to make sure that the people of France are happy with the results of the election, and that we are not going to give up on the right to the French people,\" he said, adding that he was \"very proud\" of his father's support for Macron. He also said that his son, Vincent Couronne, was a \"good man\" and \"a great leader.\" But he also pointed out that, while he is not a member of any political party, he has a good relationship with his mother, who is a French-German mother of a Muslim. His father was born in Germany, but he moved to France in his early 20s and became a father of three children. When he left France for Germany in 2005, his parents were in exile. Since then, they have moved back to Germany and have been living in Paris since then. They are now in their early 30s, with their parents and grandparents still living there. Their parents are French and they don't speak German, so they speak French, French or German. Some of them are Muslim, others are from the Middle East and others from other countries, such as Germany or the United States. Many of these people are Muslims, which is why they are attracted to French culture, language and culture. It's not just France that is attracting young people from all over the world, it's also the European culture that attracts them. There's a whole generation of people who have never been to a country where they're not allowed to go to school. And they've never had a chance to get a job. That's why, just two days after Macron won the presidential election in May 7, a group of young men and women from France came to Paris to vote for him. At the same time, some of their friends from Germany were also there to support him, including former French Prime Minister Marie Dubois and French Foreign Minister Kevser Taspinar, both of whom are also French citizens. These are the kind of voters who want to see their country back in Europe, not to mention the fact that France is the only European country that doesn't have an EU member. This is because France has always been one of Europe's most open and open borders. You can see why France wants to be a free country. Just over two weeks after the elections, many French voters are turning out in droves for a referendum on whether or not France should leave the EU. On Tuesday, thousands turned out at a demonstration in front of Paris' historic Place de la Bastille to protest what they see as the \"fraudulent\" French government. Hundreds of thousands of euros ($1.1 million) have already been spent on a campaign to keep France from leaving the bloc. Most of those people, however, have no idea what the future holds."

And the news was good -- most of the numbers were down compared to the preceding year. Germany's streets were never particularly dangerous, but according to the Interior Ministry, they are now safer than at any time since statistics have been collected. Reported criminal offenses on the whole dropped by 1.4 percent over 2005 -- to a total of just over 6.3 million. \"The statistics show reductions in crime among children, adolescents and teenagers, as well as adults,\" said Sch\u00e4uble. He added that criminality among foreigners living in Germany also fell, saying that this development reflected Germany's efforts to integrate non-Germans. Drugs offenses were down 7.8 percent, followed by theft and street crime, which both declined by four percent or more. Youth violence Vandalism, on the other hand, was up 5.9 percent. Fraud rose slightly, as did violent crime -- among young people by an alarming 4.5 percent. Berlin Interior Minister Erhart K\u00f6rting said that was part of a decade-long trend in Germany. \"As many experts have pointed out,\" K\u00f6rting said, \"the potential for violence in society is increasing.\" The head of the German Police Officers' Union Konrad Freiberg also said those figures showed that German society was not truly getting safer. Frankfurt tops most-dangerous list Crime was down in Frankfurt am Main, but it's still the German city with the greatest number of criminal offenses person 100,000 people. Hanover was a close second, followed by D\u00fcsseldorf, Bremen and Berlin. The total percentage of criminal cases solved by German police also improved slightly from 55 to 55.4 percent. According to the study, Germany's safest place was Bergisch Gladbach, a city of 100,000 inhabitants in the west of the country -- coincidentally, model Heidi Klum's home town.",
        "generated_story": "The State of Crime in Germany: The state of the Union German Interior Minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble has called for an end to the \"state of crime\" in the country. The German police force has been accused of a \"culture of violence\" that has led to a rise in murders and suicides among non-Germans. In a statement released Tuesday, the Interior Ministry said that it would no longer tolerate crimes committed by police officers. \"We will not tolerate a culture of criminality in our country,\" the statement said. It added that the police forces would continue to fight crime, but that they would not be able to do so without cooperation from the public and the private sector. A spokesman for the German Police Officers' Union, Konrad Freiberg, said the government was committed to reducing the number of homicides and increasing the proportion of rapes and sexual assaults. He also pointed out that there was an increase in cases of rape, sexual assault and murder of women and children in 2005, compared with the preceding year, when there were no such incidents. However, he added, \"There is no evidence that this is the case in any other country.\" The statement was made in response to an inquiry by Germany's interior ministry into the crime rate in 2006, which had risen from 1.6 percent to 2.2 percent. Schatz said he was \"very concerned\" about the level of police violence in his country, adding that \"it is not a crime to commit crimes, it is an act of aggression.\" \"I am very concerned that we are going to have to deal with this in a very serious way,\" K\u00f6rting said, referring to police shootings of young men and women in recent years. But he also stressed the need for a fair and transparent approach to dealing with crime. Police officers have been criticized for their lack of transparency in their dealings with law enforcement. They have also faced criticism for not doing enough to prevent the spread of hate crimes. On the other hand, they have managed to keep a low profile despite the fact that many of their members are foreign-born and do not have a criminal record. Last year's election was marked by a surge in anti-corruption protests, with more than 100,000 people arrested and hundreds of thousands of people injured, according to figures compiled by the Federal Statistics Office (FSO). \"The police have become more and more politicized,\" said FSO spokesman Erhart K\u00fcrting."

        "target": "All or nothing for Bayern in Champions final Bayern Munich have one last chance to salvage a season that has otherwise been marked by their inability to beat Borussia Dortmund: a win against Chelsea in the Champions League final at their home stadium. All season long, Bayern Munich have been consumed with achieving one goal: reaching the final of the Champions League, held at their own Allianz Arena in Munich, and raising the trophy in front of their home fans. After finishing a distant second place to Dortmund in the Bundesliga and dismally losing to them 5-2 in the German Cup final, Bayern Munich are in a must-win situation Saturday against Chelsea. A loss would be the final straw in a disappointing season for a team that can't stand second place. A win for Bayern would mean redemption, to some extent, for their shortcomings in the league. Key players were rested down the stretch in the Bundesliga, especially before the two legs of Bayern's European semifinal against Real Madrid. That was an indication that Bayern had given up on the league and put all their eggs in one basket, hoping for a big payoff with the Champions League title. The same can be said for the German Cup final against Dortmund: true, Bayern essentially beat themselves by making mistake after mistake, but Bayern could, if they win Saturday, wipe the slate clean. Saving the season Win this match, and all will be forgiven in Munich. Lose, and it will be Bayern's second straight season without a piece of hardware, not to mention the heartbreak of losing the biggest match at Allianz Arena since it opened in 2005. \"We must not even think about [losing],\" said Bayern's Franck Ribery on Thursday. \"If we win the Champions League, then we can forget about not winning the league or the cup, nobody will care about that.\" Bayern are a team that thrives under pressure, and the high stakes of this match will be good for them. Chelsea are a team that showed in their semifinal upset of Barcelona that they can rise to a challenge, even if that challenge is simply holding on against a superior opponent. \"We are not the favorites of the game, we are playing away,\" Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech said on Thursday. \"It is very rare when you have the home team playing in the home stadium, using the home dressing room, so I think the advantage goes to Bayern Munich because of that. But we know we have a chance and we will fight for it.\" But this match will come down to the team that can better take advantage of holes that have been blown in each team's defense due to injuries and suspensions. Filling the gaps Between the two sides, seven starting players will miss out on the final. Chelsea saw Raul Meireles, Ramires, and Branislav Ivanovic each get their third yellow card in the second leg against Barcelona, and captain John Terry was given a straight red. Terry and Ivanovic are fixtures on Chelsea's backline, which was already at half-strength due to hamstring injuries suffered by Gary Cahill and David Luiz. Chelsea coach Roberto di Matteo hopes those two are fit enough for the final, since Chelsea will need all the help they can get in the back. For Bayern, David Alaba and Holger Badstuber - both defenders - and Luiz Gustavo, a defensive midfielder, are also suspended for picking up three yellow cards. The impact of the suspensions will hit Chelsea the most. In addition to a weakened back line, Meireles and Ramires are mainstays on offense, supporting strikers Didier Drogba or Fernando Torres. With Ramires out, Drogba could start as striker, with Torres moving to the wing. At any rate, there is more uncertainty in The Blues' lineup than there is in Bayern's, who will be able to rely on striker Mario Gomez and the dynamic-duo of Arjen Robben and Ribery on the wings as they have all season. Most of the question marks will still be defensive for both teams, but to think that this is an indication of a high-scoring affair on Saturday would be a discredit to both team's last lines of defense. Between the posts Neither side would be competing in the final if it wasn't for the heroics of the teams' keepers. Cech defended against wave after wave of attacks from Barcelona in the semifinal for Chelsea, and Manuel Neuer showed nerves of steel in Bayern's penalty shootout in the final leg against Real Madrid, blocking penalties from Madrid stars Cristiano Ronaldo and Kaka. Chelsea's best shot will be to come out of the gate at a sprint and gain an early advantage against Bayern, who will be doing everything they can to keep their long-cultivated dream-final in their control. Otherwise, Bayern's determination to salvage their season may be enough to carry them through to the trophy ceremony - at home, just like they planned it.

The Bundesliga's top two teams are set to meet on Saturday in their final match of the season. The first leg is in Dortmund's Allianz Arena, and the second leg will be in Madrid's Luiz Gustavo's former club. It's the first match between the two sides since the German Cup final in 2005. Both teams have already qualified for next year's competition, but it's not clear if they'll be able to make it to next season's final. That's a big question mark for Dortmund, who have a chance to win their first title since 2005, when they lost to Manchester United. They'll have to wait until the last minute to decide whether they want to go on to the next round, which is expected to take place on Sunday. Bayern have been on a roll all season, with a win over Manchester City and a draw against Real on Thursday. In the end, it was Bayern who won the Bundesliga title, beating Real 3-1 on aggregate. \"We're going to be very happy with the result,\" said Raul Meireles, Bayern's coach at the time, adding that he was \"very happy\" with his side's performance. But it wasn't just the players who were on the pitch. There was also a lot of pressure on coach Manuel Neuer's side, as well as the coaching staff, to get the best out of their players. And that's what they did. Coach Roberto di Matteo was not impressed by the way his players performed against Barcelona. He said he didn't expect them to do well in a match where they had to rely heavily on their own players and not their ability to score goals. Terry, meanwhile, has been a revelation in his own right, scoring three goals in as many games as he has in all competitions. His goal against Chelsea was one of his best in recent years, although he also had a couple of good chances against his former side. However, he's still not convinced that the Blues can win the title again, despite the fact that they've been playing well for so long. Last year, Chelsea's David Alaba was the man to beat Bayern in Munich's last four matches, winning the league and then the European Cup. Now, though, they're on course for a repeat of last season when he scored a brace against Bayern."

A high-ranking Vatican diplomat will face trial in the Holy See on charges of possessing child pornography in the US and Canada. Catholic priest Carlo Alberto Capella was indicted on Saturday after a Vatican investigation found he had allegedly possessed and exchanged \"a large quantity\" of child pornography during his diplomatic posting. His trial will start on June 22 in front of a Vatican magistrate. If convicted, he could be sentenced to between one and five years in prison and fined between \u20ac2,500 and \u20ac50,000 ($2,100 to $42,000). He is being held in the city's police barracks.

The church rejected the request and withdrew him in September to face investigation at home. Shortly afterwards, Canadian authorities issued an arrest warrant for allegedly possessing and distributing child pornography while visiting a church in Canada. The Capella case has hampered the Catholic Church's attempts to move on from its myriad of pedophile priest scandals. There has been particular focus in recent months on the Chilean branch of the Catholic Church ignoring and covering up of child abuse by pedophile priest Fernando Karadima during the 1980s and 1990s. Pope Francis wrote a letter to Chileans last week expressing \"shame\" for the affair despite previously defending one of the main alleged offenders behind the cover-up.

Vatican spokesman George Pell said the Vatican was looking into the allegations. \"The Vatican is looking at allegations of sexual abuse of minors,\" Pell told reporters at a news conference in Washington, D.C. On Saturday, Pope Francis said he was \"deeply troubled\" by the accusations, which he said were made against him by a Chilean priest. Francis also called on the pope to take action against the Catholic Church in the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Chile. He also said that if the charges were found to be true, he would be placed under house arrest and face up to five years in prison if found guilty. In a statement, the Holy See said it was aware of \"serious allegations\" of abuse and that it would take a \"long time\" before a conviction could be handed down. It was not immediately clear how long the investigation would last, but Vatican spokeswoman Fernando Karadima said in an email to Reuters that \"the Vatican will continue to investigate the matter.\" The pope has called for an end to the probe, saying it could lead to an \"immediate and long-term\" closure of the church. Last year, Vatican investigators said they had found no evidence of a cover-up. They also pointed to a lack of evidence that could have led to charges of child abuse, child endangerment and sexual exploitation of children, among other charges. A number of bishops, including Pope Benedict XVI, have also been accused of abusing their power to influence the public. Some of them have been charged with child sex offenses, while others have faced criminal charges, such as sexual assault and rape. Many of these charges stem from the 1980s and 1990s, when a priest in Chile was convicted of sexually abusing minors and sentenced to life imprisonment for the first time. Former Chilean Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero was also convicted in September, and was sentenced in absentia to two and a half years behind bars."

Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov unveiled a plan Monday aimed at creating a \"multi-billion-dollar\" funding vehicle for companies hit by Western sanctions. Moscow-based news agency RIA quoted Siluanov as saying that the emergency fund would be set up next year with money originally earmarked for the State Pension Fund and leftover funds from this year's budget. According to RIA, Moscow was planning to devote \"at least 100 billion roubles\" (2 billion euros) to the fund, which will mainly be aimed at helping cash-starved Russian banks and key oil companies. \"These 100 billion roubles will be added to the reserve next year, which will allow us to help companies,\" RIA quoted Siluanov as saying. \"We are planning to create a reserve of significant size.\" Just last week, the European Union and the United States imposed a third round of sanctions on Moscow for Russia's involvement in the Ukraine conflict. The latest sanctions target the Russian banking sector as well as key energy firms and arms manufacturers. As one of several companies that have asked for government help, Russia's oil giant Rosneft said it would need 1.5 trillion roubles ($39.70 billion) in aid to keep exploring for oil. Siluanov also told RIA news agency that the decision to stop transferring money to the Pension Fund would hand the budget an extra 309 billion roubles.

He said the fund would be created \"in accordance with the terms of an agreement between Russia and the European Union.\" He added that it would also be able to \"invest in companies that have suffered from sanctions,\" such as state-owned oil giant Rosneft, which is under sanctions over the conflict in eastern Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin has said he wants to use the funds to help companies which have been hit with sanctions. In a statement, the Kremlin said it was \"deeply concerned\" about the impact of the sanctions on Russia's oil industry, saying it \"would be a mistake\" to allow the companies to continue to operate in Ukraine without the help of Russian state funds. It did not say how many companies would benefit from the new fund, however, and said there was a \"very good chance\" that some of them would not be affected at all. A spokesman for the SPF told Reuters that there were no immediate plans to introduce sanctions against Russia, but that \"there is a strong possibility that Russia will act in a way that will allow us to protect the interests of our citizens.\" The statement came a day after the United States announced a $1 billion (2 billion euros) bailout for Russian oil companies, in response to a report that Moscow was preparing to sell assets to Ukraine in exchange for US sanctions relief. Russia has been accused by Western governments of failing to act on its own in relation to the Ukraine conflict. Moscow has denied the accusations. On Monday, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said his government was ready to take action on the issue, adding that sanctions were \"not an obstacle to our ability to meet our obligations as a sovereign state.\" \"We are prepared to do everything in our power to make sure that we do not fall into the trap of sanctioning our companies,\" the minister said. However, he added, \"we are not going to give up our right to veto any decision that is made against us.\" Russia is also expected to announce a new round of economic sanctions next week, including a freeze on oil exports and a ban on gas imports from Ukraine until the end of next year."

A century after the death of Heidi inventor Johanna Spyri, the lovable Alpine heroine is being portrayed in a new film which replaces grassy slopes and mountainous range with city skyscrapers and city streets. The $ 3.5 million \"Heidi\", funded by the Z\u00fcrich-based film company Vega and directed by German film maker Markus Imboden, is to be launched in Germany on Thursday. The making of the film was one of the highlights of a past year of events including exhibitions, lectures and fireworks celebrating the July 7 2001 centenary of the death of Spyri, whose novel \"Heidi\" sold 20 million copies and has been translated in 50 languages worldwide. It is thought to be one of the most successful books of all times. The book has inspired 17 films, including Shirley Temple\u2019s Oscar winning portrayal of Heidi in 1937 and a Japanese cartoon series. Imboden\u2019s remake is the 18th \"Heidi\" film. Blue hair in Berlin According to Vega, \"the film was transmitted to today\u2019s world without losing sight of the original novel\". But Imboden\u2019s new movie is far from the charming original, with its rosy-cheeked, curly-headed Heidi, delicate Clara and goat-tending shepherd Peter\u2019s frail old grandmother. In the first film, Heidi, who lives happily with her grandfather in a tiny hut in the Swiss Alps is plucked from her contented life by her Aunt Dete to live in a stiff, rich family in the bustling metropolis, Frankfurt. Heidi becomes so home-sick, she starts to sleepwalk and is eventually sent home. But not before she causes confusion in the otherwise prim household and brings laughter in the life of the disabled and homely, Clara. The Heidi in the latest film has blue hair, surfs the net and roams the streets of Berlin. Friend and shepherd Peter sheds his rustic pastimes and whizzes down streets on his mountainbike. Clara is not the weak, lame young girl of the Spyri novel, but a moody Britney Spears wannabe. Aunt Dete is a modern-day stylist living fashionably in the German capital. The new surroundings are a far cry from the tranquil days of cow milking, goat- tending and flower-plucking in the verdant meadows of the Swiss Alps. Transforming the Heidi myth According to a Berlin daily, the remake is a \"refreshing Heidi\", adding that the script writers had managed to transform the Heidi \"myth\" into an independent, self-assured girl and not into a \"transfigured mountain heroine\". However, it is just this portrait of a naive and charming alpine heroine that has made Heidi so popular all over the world. Heidi has become a well-known Swiss brand worldwide. Some 60,000 tourists \u2013 half from Japan \u2013 are said to visit the picturesque wine-growing village in Graubuenden, which boasts the original Heidi House and other Heidi related attractions such as winding mountain trails and pastures. Imboden\u2019s film, which is to be launched in Germany on Thursday, will also open elsewhere in Europe, and may reach fans in Japan and South Korea too. Whether Imboden\u2019s blue-haired, computer savvy Heidi will charm her Asian viewers, however, remains to be seen.",

It was opened on July 7 2001 by Markus Imboden and Johanna Spyri, the owners of the resort, which is located on the German-Austrian border, and is home to one of Germany's most famous ski resorts. \"It was a dream come true for Heidi,\u201d the owner said in an interview with German news agency Welt am Sonntag. \u201cShe was the most beautiful woman I have ever seen in my life.

        "target": "Rethinking the term 'honor killing' The murder of 28-year-old Samia Shahid comes less than two weeks after Qandeel Baloch was killed by her brother. The media was quick to report them as \"honor killings.\" We have to rethink that term, writes Gouri Sharma. When news broke that Samia Shahid, a British-Pakistani woman, had been found dead while visiting relatives in Pakistan at the end of July, mainstream media outlets were quick to report it as an honor killing. It was the second time in two weeks that the media had reported a killing of a woman this way - the first being the murder of Pakistani social media star Qandeel Baloch. There are strong similarities between the cases. Both were murdered in places where they would have felt they were at their safest - in their family homes. It's likely they knew their killers - in Baloch's case, her brother has admitted to strangling her, and Shahid's father and cousin have already been questioned. And as more reports emerge about Shahid's death, it's clear that both were killed because they didn't behave in a way deemed acceptable in a conservative, patriarchal society. 'Deeply offensive' term The debate around terminology in \"honor killings\" isn't new, and after Baloch's murder there were members of the media - such as ABC Australia journalist Juanita Phillips - who decided against using the term, calling it \"deeply offensive\" and referring to it as a \"family killing\" instead. And there are outlets, like the Guardian, that already use inverted commas with the word honor. But some commentators argue that more needs to happen if media consumers are to gain a better understanding of the problem. \"I think an important step for the media would be to refuse to give weight to the term 'honor crimes,'\" said UK-based freelance journalist Shehnaz Khan. \"While it is imperative to highlight that these crimes and murders stem from the roots of misogyny and therefore a false sense of 'honor,' there is absolutely nothing but'shame' within them, as murder is nothing but dishonorable.\" \"The word 'honor' can sometimes carry an almost positive connotation that we are inclined to automatically accept just because it's not happening to us, when the reality is, this a huge problem affecting thousands of girls and women across the world,\" she added. Naming the issue But this isn't a view shared by all journalists. Ruby Hamad, a writer at Australia's Daily Life newspaper, said that the first step in dealing with the issue is naming it. \"There are some deeply patriarchal societies that still limit women's freedom according to old tribal concepts of honor, where, unfairly, the behavior of women reflect on their entire family,\" Hamad said. \"By naming these 'honor killings,' we are acknowledging the role that this misogynistic concept of honor plays, not only in the murders themselves but in these entire societies, and how it entraps both men and women.\" Through the eyes of the perpetrator? There are other issues with the term though. Some have argued that by framing it as such, media outlets are showing the crime through the eyes of the perpetrator - and not through the victim - as they should. And with such cases regularly hitting the headlines, framing is important. The United Nations estimates that around 5,000 women - predominantly from Asia and the Middle East - are killed annually in honor-related crimes, a figure that women's advocacy groups say is closer to 20,000 worldwide. This raises an important cultural element for the media to consider - how far does the term play into cultural stereotypes? \"When honor is considered the most important thing in life, then all family members become expendable,\" Hamad said. \"The collective outweighs the rights of the individual. Does this feed into cultural stereotypes? Perhaps. But that doesn't mean we should pretend that this cultural context isn't there.\" Looking for answers - and alternatives There have been many alternatives put forward by women's advocacy groups, including hate crime, misogynistic murder, femicide and shame killings. But which one should we pick? Al Jazeera for one has decided which one they won't use. \"We are always updating our style guidelines to convey a deeper and more authentic understanding of world affairs. Recent events in Pakistan ignited a healthy debate in Al Jazeera on the term 'honor killings' in particular. Our editors are currently studying alternatives to the term, but'misogynistic murder' is not one of them,\" said an Al Jazeera spokesperson. Terminology in the media matters, and for murders as complex as these, it's the media's responsibility to find a name that better fits the crime. Only then will it become easier to work towards a solution.",

        "target": "Myanmar Junta Announces Amnesty The junta in Myanmar, also known as Burma, announced an amnesty for more than 7,000 prisoners on Friday, including a few political detainees. The amnesty came on the 21st anniversary of the brutal crackdown of a student-led pro-democracy movement in 1988 and the subsequent seizure of power by the current junta. Journalists were invited to Yangon\u2019s notorious Insein prison on Friday as the authorities released the first batch of prisoners. At least 600 inmates were freed as part of an amnesty for over 7,000 inmates nationwide. Among those released in Yangon were two journalists and 25 political prisoners -- rights groups say this is only 1 percent of the total number of political prisoners held by the military regime. Maung Zarni, a research fellow at the London School of Economics, was \u201chappy for the prisoners who were part of the release\u201d. \u201cThis is a very positive personal development and I am happy they have been released but we need to understand that the junta is using the prisoners\u2019 release as a public relations exercise. It is the 21st anniversary of the military coup so they are using this as a way to pacify political discontent in the country.\u201d Amnesty comes ahead of next year\u2019s polls Myanmar's director general of prisons, Zaw Win, said that the prisoners had been freed so they could take part in next year's polls. In recent months, rights activists, pro-democracy activists and Western countries have cast doubt on the credibility of the planned elections as many key political activists are still in detention. This includes pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who recently began a new 18-month period of house arrest after being found guilty of violating her house arrest order in a widely condemned trial. \u201cThe whole Suu kyi trial is rather unlawful,\u201d said Zarni. \u201cBecause the country does not have an independent judiciary, the judges are just puppets who dance to the tune of the top leadership.\u201d Junta is holding on tightly In 1990, Suu Kyi\u2019s National League for Democracy won Myanmar\u2019s last general election by a landslide. But the junta never recognised the results and has since tightened its control over the country. The 2008 constitution, which was drafted and approved by the military generals, which guarantees the army 25 percent of parliamentary seats, is yet another sign of its desire to consolidate power. \u201cThe military is going to be in power for a long time,\u201d warns Zarni, \u201cbecause they have got control of all the political and economic institutions in the country as well as the entire state of Burma. So with or without elections, this is likely to remain the same.\u201d New Democratic Party formed Meanwhile, a new political party has been formed in Myanmar. The Democratic Party is headed by Mya Than Than Nu, who is the daughter of the country\u2019s first democratically-elected prime minister, U Nu. The party has proposed a power-sharing deal with the military, which would give 40 percent of power to politicians and 60 percent to the military rulers. Harn Yawnghwe, the director of the Brussels-based Euro-Burma Office, doubts the new party stands a chance: \u201cIt is possible that they they would be able to get some votes. But it is not likely, even if they were able to contest the elections freely, that they will be able to form a new government because the military is not prepared to let any party rule.\u201d Democrats should exploit elections He thinks the only way out for the democratic forces in Myanmar is to use the upcoming elections wisely and \u201cto take part in them even if they are against them. I think we have to look at the elections as a process which will lead to democracy -- maybe in few more years.\u201d The National League for Democracy has indicated that it will not take part in the polls unless all Myanmar\u2019s political prisoners, including Suu Kyi, are released. Suu Kyi\u2019s lawyers have filed an appeal against the extension of her house arrest and the court is expected to give a ruling on October 2. But few are hopeful that the junta will amnesty her anytime soon. Author: Disha Uppal Editor: Anne Thomas",

        "target": "A quarter of deaths caused by environmental degradation, says UN A new United Nations report warns that pollution and global warming are causing millions more deaths than conflicts. The UN's environment agency has called for an urgent roll-back on harmful substances and fossil fuels. In its report \"Healthy Environment, Health People,\" the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), the World Health Organization and several other environment organizations said that, in 2012, an estimated 12.6 million deaths were attributable to deteriorating environment conditions. The largest numbers of deaths took place in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific regions, followed by sub-Saharan Africa, where around a quarter of deaths were likely caused byair pollution, chemicals, climate change and a lack of access to sanitation. \"By depleting the ecological infrastructure of our planet and increasing our pollution footprint, we incur an ever-growing cost in terms of human health and well-being,\" said UNEP Executive Director Achim Steiner. He added that humanity's life support systems had been compromised by globalization and powerful economic interests. The report was released during UN climate talks in the German city of Bonn which are drawing up rules pertaining to the Paris agreement, which seeks to lower carbon emissions. The document suggested that several drivers were responsible for the threat to human health, including ecosystem disruption, climate change, inequality, unhealthy and wasteful lifestyles, along with unsustainable consumption and production. Worsening effects UNEP estimated that an extra 250,000 deaths could occur each year between 2030 and 2050 as a result of climate change, leading to malnutrition, malaria, diarrhea and heat stress. Between them air pollution and a lack of access to clean water and sanitation cause almost 8 million premature deaths each year. Environmental impacts are responsible for the deaths of more than one quarter of all children under the age of five, the report states. UNEP called for governments to act to remove harmful substances from working environments, reduce the use of carbon fuels and rely instead on renewable energy, and change lifestyles to allow a more sustainable use of the world's resources. The report also called for a bigger investment to protect the planet's natural ecosystem. UNEP predicted a further increase in emerging zoonotic diseases (spread between animals and humans), and called on developing countries, in particular, to prioritize prevention methods. \"Never before have so many animals been kept by so many people - and never before have so many opportunities existed for pathogens to pass through the biophysical environment and wild animals to livestock and people,\" the report warned.",
        "generated_story": "A quarter of deaths due to environmental degradation, says UNEP The United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) aims to reduce the number of people who die from environmental pollution. The aim is to cut down on the deaths of children under the age of five, according to a report released by the UN on Thursday. According to the report, more than 1.5 million children in the Western Pacific and the Asia-Pacific are dying from the effects of climate change. This figure is up from 2.6 million in 2012, when the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that it would cut greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent by 2030 and 2050. These figures are in line with the Paris agreement, which called for an end to fossil fuel use by 2020. \"We have to make sure that our children and grandchildren have access to clean water and clean air,\" said Achim Steiner, head of UN's Healthy Environment, Health People program, in Bonn, Germany. He added that the aim was to eliminate the use of fossil fuels by 2050, and that this would be achieved by reducing the amount of carbon dioxide that is released into the atmosphere by 20 percent. Environmental degradation is also a major cause of death in developing countries, including Southeast Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America, he said, adding that there was a \"significant increase\" in deaths caused by deforestation and other forms of human-caused pollution, such as deforestation, rising sea levels and high levels of sea level rise. In addition, there is an increase in people suffering from cancer and heart disease, as a result of increased exposure to toxic chemicals. A third of the world's population is estimated to be living in areas with high concentrations of toxic substances, like mercury, arsenic, chromium, lead, mercury and lead. It's estimated that about one-third of all deaths from these substances occur in countries with low carbon emissions. That's a significant increase compared to countries like China, Japan, India, South East Asia and Australia, where the average age is between five and seven. But it's not clear how much of this increase will be attributable to human activities. What do you think? What are the chances that we will see more people die of these diseases? The UN said it was \"very optimistic\" about the impact of environmental change on people's health and well-being."

Trudeau calls for hopeful, diverse future In electing Trudeau, the charismatic son of a former popular prime minister, Canadian voters illustrated the growing discontent with nine years of Conservative rule that saw lowering of corporate taxes, avoidance of climate change legislation and disagreement with the Obama administration over the controversial Keystone XL pipeline. \"Canadians have spoken,\" Trudeau said, adding that he would be the man to lead the \"hopeful, positive\" country \"with a vision\" that they had asked for.

Harper, who was first elected in 2011 to a four-year term of office, was replaced by former New Democratic Party leader John Walsh, a former federal cabinet minister, and the Liberal Party's new leader, former finance minister and former foreign minister of Canada, Michael Ignatieff. In a speech delivered to Parliament on Monday night, Harper called on Canadians to support him in his quest for a second term. He also called for the government to provide Canada with an alternative energy source to the Keystone XL pipeline, which would have allowed the oil pipeline to be built into the country's western coast. Trudeau said his government would continue to pursue the pipeline's construction, but he did not rule out the possibility that the project would not be completed until the end of 2011. Canadian media reported that Harper had asked Trudeau to take over the reins of power from former Liberal leader Paul Martin. Martin said Harper was \"deeply disappointed\" by Trudeau's decision to step aside, adding that he had \"no interest in continuing to lead a government that is not committed to climate change.\" Harper also said he wanted to give Canada a chance to develop its own energy policy, something that would allow it to compete with the United States in energy markets. Canada has a long way to go before a new president can be elected. But Harper and Trudeau have a lot of work to do before they can do it.

Prime minister Harper made the announcement in an interview broadcast on CBC's \"The Canadian Press\" program.

According to preliminary results released on Sunday, the Ukrainian president, who was elected on June 15, has secured a majority of votes in the first round of the election. \"I am very happy with the results,\" said Andrij Shevchenko, a former deputy prime minister of Ukraine, in a televised address to the nation's parliament. He added that he would like to see a referendum on the constitution, which would give Ukraine the right to a parliamentary majority in parliament, as well as the ability to form a coalition government. Ukraine is currently governed by a pro-Western constitution and has a constitution that forbids the use of force against the opposition. However, it is not clear how long the new constitution will last in Ukraine. Author: Kitty Logan (dpa, Reuters, dpa)"

Brazilian judge Juliana Leal de Melo - who serves on a court overseeing amateur and professional sports - authorized the release of Hickey's passport upon payment of 1.5 million real ($435,000) bail. Hickey could now have medical treatment, the Rio state court system said in a statement. Reported to have a heart condition, Hickey was arrested three months ago during the Rio de Janeiro Olympics on ticket scalping charges. He is awaiting trial, though has not been imprisoned. Hickey has denied any wrongdoing. He is one of 10 people facing charges of ticket scalping, conspiracy and ambush marketing related to the Olympics. Hickey said he would fight \"each and every one\u201d of the Rio Games ticket-touting charges he faces.

He was due to appear in court on 10 August, but was freed three months ago after a three-month jail sentence. The former Olympic gold medallist, who served around eight years in the Rio de Janeiro Olympics, was charged on Monday with fraud and money laundering. His lawyer Juliana Leal de Melo said the charges against him were politically motivated. \"He is a member of the Olympic Council of Ireland,\" she said in a statement, adding that he was \"not guilty of any crime.\" \"I am not a criminal, I am a free man and I do not have any money. I have nothing to do with the Olympics,\" he said. A plea agreement was reached Monday, and the two sides agreed to a plea deal in exchange for an undisclosed amount of money, according to Reuters news agency. In exchange, the European Olympic Committee (OOC) said it would seek to set aside 1.5 million real ($ 435,000) to cover the costs of running the Games. Olympic officials said they would appeal the ruling, which is expected to be ratified by a vote of no confidence by the IOC's executive committee on Wednesday. Ireland's Olympic committee said on its website that the decision was made \"in accordance with international law.\" The IOC also said that it was looking into the possibility of an appeal against the verdict. Hickey, 71, is one of several former Olympians who have been accused of bribery, fraud, corruption and abuse of power. Last year's Rio Games were the first major international sporting event to take place outside the country's borders. At the time of his arrest, he had been living in Dublin, Ireland, where he worked as an IT engineer for several years before moving to Rio in order to pursue his dream of becoming an Olympic athlete. During his stay in jail, however, his lawyers said he would not be allowed to return to Ireland until he completed his medical studies and was cleared of all charges related to his involvement in drug trafficking. After his release from prison on 3 months' notice, a spokesman for the EU's anti-corruption agency, Euro Olympic, told Reuters that \"it is not possible to prosecute a person who has committed a crime without a court order.\" He added that there was no evidence to support the allegations."

Twenty years later, relations between Libya and Europe have done an about-face. The Berlin disco \"La Belle\" was packed as usual on the night of April 5, 1986. Among its guests were many US soldiers, who were certainly not thinking of politics, the Middle East or strained relations between the United States and Libya. But reality caught up with them: a bomb detonated near the dance floor that night, killing two Americans and a Turkish woman. Over 200 people were injured. A Berlin court ruled that Libya and its intelligence services were responsible for the bombing. In 2001, following a nearly four-year long trial, the judges convicted a Libyan diplomat and three others to prison sentences between 12 and 14 years. The big oil-exporting country in the meantime was busy working on its reputation. Already in the 1990s, Tripoli began striving to improve its relations to the European Union. Financial reparation opened the door to Europe In 2004, the Gaddafi International Foundation for Charity Associations and the legal representatives of the German La Belle victims settled on $35 million in compensation. This opened the door to Europe. Just a few weeks later, Germany's chancellor at the time, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, visited Moammar Gadhafi in a traditional Bedouin tent outside of Tripoli. Britain's Prime Minister Tony Blair also paid Gadhafi a visit. A few months earlier, in April 2004, the European Union had welcomed the Libyan leader to Brussels. It was Gadhafi's first official visit to Europe in 15 years. Bernd Westphal, the German ambassador to Libya, said bilateral relations had been through difficult times. \"The German Embassy in Tripoli today is working for a quick return to the liveliness of close relations between Germany and Libya,\" Westphal said. \"We want to build on our traditional friendship with Libya and we want to strengthen the political, economic and cultural cooperation between our two countries and peoples.\" Business interests booming in Libya In the past few years, Libya has moved from being the supporter of international terrorism to an attractive economic partner for the West. European business representatives have been increasingly knocking on Libya's door. Even the United States is showing increased interest in the northern African nation. Washington is pleased that Libya announced at the end of 2003 that it would discontinue its efforts to develop and produce weapons of mass destruction. Libya's ambassador to Germany, Said Abdulaati, said political and economic relations between Libya and Germany were \"excellent.\" Libya is one of Germany's strongest trading partners in northern Africa. Last year, Germany exported goods to Libya worth 657.7 million euros ($805.7 million), according to the German Federal Statistics Office. \"The economy is the driving power in German-Libyan relations,\" said Abdulaati in an interview with the Arab-German association for trade and industry. But Germany isn't the only European country making deals in Libya. France last month signed an accord with Libya on peaceful nuclear research. \"This accord represents a qualitative leap in relations between the two countries and proves that Libya has transformed its weapons of mass destruction into constructive weapons,\" Public Works Minister Maatuk Maatuk said at the signing ceremony in March. \"We are telling the world that we are moving towards the development of Libyan nuclear technology for peaceful purposes.\" This week, the Netherlands' Economics Minister Laurens Jan Brinkhorst will visit Libya to negotiate gas and oil agreements. It will be the first high-level visit by a Dutch official since Gadhafi took power in 1969.",

But that effort has not yet yielded results. In March, the German Embassy in Tripoli announced that it had received $35 million (657.7 million euros) from the United States in exchange for the release of former Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. \"We are very happy with the results,\" said Bernd Westphal, a former German ambassador to Libya. The German government, however, has been slow to respond to the Libyan regime's efforts to change its image in the Middle East. On April 5, 2006, it announced the end of the Gaddafi regime, which had ruled Libya since the 1990s. At the time, Libya was still governed by a dictator who had been overthrown in a coup in April of that year. Since then, there have been a number of failed attempts at reconciliation and reconciliation. One of those attempts was thwarted in March when a group of Libyan Bedouin refused to give up their right to join the army. Another failed attempt was made in early 2004 when the government of Libya, led by former French Prime Minister Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, was forced to withdraw its troops. A few months earlier, Libyan authorities had announced they would no longer allow the use of force against the regime. This was a major setback for a country that was supposed to be a staunch defender of democracy and human rights. It was also the first time that the EU had approved the withdrawal of troops from Libya after a failed coup attempt in 2001. That was the beginning of a long and bitter conflict between Gaddafi's regime and his loyalist forces. After the fall of his regime in 2003, he was driven to exile in Germany, where he spent 15 years as a prisoner of war before being released in 2004. He returned to his home country of Tripoli in 2005, and spent the next few years living with his wife and three children in exile. His wife, Maatuk, is now a retired nurse who works in public works. She was born in Berlin in 1969 and has lived in London since. Her father, who died in prison in 1991, worked in Brussels for over 12 and 14 years before returning to Tripoli. During that time she and her husband were married and had two children. They had a son and a daughter, but the marriage was not to last long. Now they have two sons and two daughters."

The Social Democrats (SPD) and Christian Democrats (CDU) have ruled the small northern city-state of Bremen in a coalition for the past 12 years. But after winning state elections on Sunday with 36.8 percent, the SPD is now flirting with the idea of ditching their previous coalition partners to rule together with the Greens, who made their best-ever showing in a German state poll with 16.4 percent. Bremen's state SPD leadership is to hold talks later on Wednesday with the CDU, which polled 25.7 percent. After an SPD meeting in Bremen, Mayor Jens B\u00f6hrnsen made the first signal he could be favoring the Greens. He said that during the campaign he had deliberately abstained from mentioning the possibility of a renewed CDU coalition because \"after 12 years it shouldn't automatically be continued.\" Bremen's acting head of government and CDU member Thomas R\u00f6wekamp, however, warned against an SPD-Green coalition. \"The majority of people don't want a red-green experiment, but a continuation of the grand coalition,\" he said. Both the SPD and CDU conceded heavy losses in the election, which showed a swing towards the Greens and the Left Party, which scored an unexpected 8.4 percent to win representation in a western German state legislature for the first time in its brief history. Block reforms? If Bremen's SPD decide in favor of the Greens, this would affect the ability of Chancellor Angela Merkel's grand coalition of CDU and SPD to push ahead with reforms requiring constitutional changes, such as stage two of Germany's urgently needed federalism reform. The federal Bundesrat, which is made up of state cabinet members, has to approve the majority of legislative bills passed by the lower chamber, the Bundestag, before they become law. Also, any proposed constitutional changes require two-thirds of all votes in order to be passed by the Bundesrat. The CDU and SPD currently hold 47 of the Bundesrat's 69 seats, which is one seat more than the necessary two-thirds majority. But without Bremen, the number held by the grand coalition would fall to 44 seats, meaning they would need the cooperation of one of the small opposition parties for any constitutional changes. Internal strife Earlier in the week, Chancellor Merkel called for unity within her ruling left-right coalition after the losses in Bremen set the stage for more infighting between the two parties. Merkel also warned the SPD against moving to the left after it lost some five percent points. The chancellor said the outcome showed the SPD had made a mistake by attacking the coalition and campaigning on promises of a minimum wage, which she believes will hamper efforts to fight unemployment of just under 10 percent. \"The result showed that this strategy did not pay off,\" Merkel told a press conference.",

The SPD-Green coalition, which includes the Left Party and Greens, is expected to win a majority of seats in the lower house of parliament. It would be the first time in 12 years that the two parties have been able to agree on a common agenda. Earlier in Sunday, Merkel and her conservative Christian Democrats (SPD) agreed to a deal to overhaul the country's tax code, but the deal was blocked by the SPD, the party's Bavarian sister party, in a vote of no confidence in Chancellor Merkel. \"We are not going to change the law,\" Merkel said at a press conference in Bremen, Germany, where she was due to be sworn in as chancellor at the end of the week. She also said that she would not accept a \"grand coalition\" with the Greens and conservatives. But she did not rule out the possibility that a grand coalition could be formed, she said, adding that there was \"no chance of that being the case.\" \"The SPD is the only party that is willing to compromise on the issue of tax reform,\" said Jens B\u00f6hrnsen from the left-wing Bundesrat party. He added that \"the SPD has a lot of work to do, and we have to make sure that we are doing it right.\" Merkel, who is seeking a third term in office, has been accused by some of her critics of a lack of transparency in her handling of public finances. In a speech to parliament on Sunday evening, chancellor Merkel accused her coalition partners of \"playing politics\" and \"showing that they don't know what they're doing.\" The chancellor also accused the opposition SPD of not being transparent enough about its plans, saying they were \"inadequate in their transparency.\" A spokesman for SPD leader Thomas R\u00f6wekamp said the chancellor's party had \"nothing to hide\" from her and that it would \"not be tolerated at all\" if she were to introduce a new tax law. Merkel has also called for an end to tax increases for low-income earners, a move that critics see as a threat to the welfare state. A spokeswoman for the coalition said she could not comment on whether or not the new law would have a positive impact on public spending."

The new pact, including an artillery buffer zone, was a move to strengthen a peace plan signed earlier this month, also in Minsk. However, Breedlove said violence levels in Ukraine in recent days were as high as prior to the earlier ceasefire. \"The ceasefire is still there in name, but what is happening on the ground is quite a different story,\" Breedlove said, adding that Russian forces were still operating in Ukraine, although he could not pinpoint how many. \"The fluidity of movement of Russian forces and Russian-backed forces back and forth across that border makes it almost impossible to understand the numbers,\" he said. A convoy from Russia consisting of about 170 trucks arrived in Ukraine on Saturday, with a reported cargo of humanitarian aid. Previous aid convoys sent from Russia were met with outrage in Kyiv, as it was suspected they may have been used to provide support to the pro-Moscow separatists in eastern Ukraine. Russia has repeatedly denied such accusations. The separatists have said they want to break from Kyiv and have already declared \"people's republics'\" in Donetsk and Luhansk.

The team later returned to the field after the flags had been taken down, before succumbing to a 3-0 defeat. On Monday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry strongly criticized the protest. Initially, it had been thought that the Chinese side would play in the Regionalliga S\u00fcdwest - a regional division of Germany's fourth tier which has only 19 teams but the plan was revised so the matches would just be friendlies. This followed an agreement signed in 2016 between the German FA and the Chinese government to help boost the sport in the Asian country, where the Bundesliga is increasingly popular.

In 2010, German car owners had to pay a high price for their mobility, according to ADAC, which cited record-high fuel prices as the major cost factor. \"For drivers, 2010 will go down in history as the most costly year ever,\" ADAC said in a statement. High taxes The cost of acquiring and operating a car has risen 42 percent since 1995, compared to a 24 percent increase in the general cost of living. Due to tax increases and higher production costs, fuel prices soared 86 percent over the 15-year period. In 2010 alone, the average price for a liter of super gasoline was more than 1.40 euros ($1.84) - the highest the average price ever. According to ADAC, urban singles spent an average of 3,340 euros on their cars in 2000. Five years later, that figure had jumped to 3,900 euros. By the end of 2010, their expenses reached 4,380 euros, or 1,000 euros more than a decade earlier. Driving is also pricey for four-person families with two cars. According to the automobile club, their annual costs have risen 30 percent over the past 10 years from 5,940 euros to 7,740 euros. Taxes account for the lion's share of gasoline and diesel prices. The German government's mineral oil and value added taxes account for nearly 88 cents of the 1.35-euro price of a liter of fuel.

The average German car club is worth 4,380 euros ($5,940 euros) a year. That's nearly 88 cents more than in 2005, when ADAC was founded. In 2009, the average club was worth 3,340 euros a car. This year, however, it's worth 1,900 euros. The most costly year in German auto club history? In 2000, car clubs in Germany were the least expensive, with a total cost of 4.2 billion euros (1.84-euro) for the 15-year history of the club. Since then, they have become the second-most expensive club in the country, behind only the Bavarian Auto Club, which has been in business for 15 years. \"In the past 10 years, there have been a lot of changes,\" said John Blau, chief executive officer of German automotive clubs. He added that the biggest change was the introduction of electronic payment systems for car owners, allowing them to charge a fee of 1.85 euros for every car they drive. However, this was not the first time that a club had to pay this much for a vehicle. It was also the last time it would charge the same amount for an entire car in 2010 alone. Last year's figures are the highest ever recorded by a German club since the end of 1995.

More than a third of its revenues came from the sale of cars and trucks, while the rest went to the tune of 2.5 billion euro ($3.3 billion) in subsidies. But the car industry is still struggling to cope with the high costs of a new model, and it is no surprise that car dealerships have struggled to keep up with demand. According to a survey conducted by German research firm Sam Edmonds, sales of new models have fallen by almost 88 percent since 2000. Among the reasons for this is a lack of demand for new cars, as well as the fact that there are fewer cars on the market than there used to be five years ago. There are also a number of factors that have contributed to this drop in sales. One of those factors is that, in order to stay competitive, cars have to compete with each other more and more. For example, if a model car is sold at a discount, then it has to sell for less than 1 euro. Another factor is the amount of money it costs to make up for lost time. And that's not just because the model cars are more expensive but also because they cost more money to build. If you look at the sales figures for 2009 alone, you can see how much the costs are going up."

Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said the first inmate from the US prison at Guantanamo Bay had arrived in his country. Madrid has agreed to host five prisoners, the largest commitment yet from a European country. Citing privacy concerns, Rubalcaba refused to give the prisoner's name or any identifying information, except to say he was a Palestinian. The new arrival will be able to work and move around Spain as he wishes, but will not be able to leave the country. \"He is a Palestinian, he has already arrived in our country. We do not want to give out further details because we want everyone who comes to live in our country to be able to live their lives normally,\" he told a news conference. Spain urges others to 'do the utmost' Spain's decision to take five Guantanamo detainees is part of an effort to help US President Barack Obama with his plans to shut down the jail. The prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, was set up at a US navy base by former President George W. Bush in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos has urged other European countries \"to do their utmost\" to take in former Guantanamo detainees as well. Third countries are being asked to take in detainees who are cleared of any charges, but who can't be sent back to their homelands for fear of persecution. Obama had said he would close the prison by January 22, 2010, yet the deadline passed unmet. Some 200 detainees remain there, but finding places to take in the prisoners - even the dozens already cleared for release - has proved controversial. jen/AFP/AP Editor: Andreas Illmer",

But now they should take care that Great Britain does not move further away from Europe, writes Birgit Maass. If only they had done it out of full conviction. If they at least believed that they could really benefit their country by withdrawing from the EU. But many of the parliamentarians whose vote will finally set Brexit on its wayhave voted against their hearts, as well as their minds. It was a vote against their minds, because the withdrawal from the EU will almost certainly, at least on a short to medium term basis, have negative repercussions for the British economy. And it was a vote against their hearts, because for many, a view of the future, divorced from Brussels and increasingly reliant on an unpredictable US President Donald Trump, is somewhat alarming. In recent days, many members of parliament have described it as \"a catastrophe.\" No vote \"against the will of the people.\" Of course there are \"Brexiteers\" who believe that a Britain independent of Brussels will be able to return to its former greatness, once it is no longer held back by the \"Little Europeans.\" But they are in the minority - the majority of parliamentarians already declared their support for remaining in the EU during the referendum campaign. Yet despite this, Theresa May's government was able to push its legislative proposal through the House of Commons without any great difficulty. The predominant view, also amongst members of the two leading parties, is that to hinder Brexit and to fail to support the government in its endeavors to do so, would be to go \"against the will of the people.\" Anti-EU newspapers have targeted Brexit opponents. And those who have publically come out in support of the EU have had to reckon with death threats. The at times passionate debate in the lower house, that went on over several days, was a temporary highlight in this European tragedy, which in the worst case could contribute to the continent disintegrating into individual sovereign states. Don't be intimidated The British public supports the hard-line position taken by Prime Minister May in withdrawing from the common market. Polls are showing that her strategy is gaining increased support. There is no turning back now. The British are now looking for clarity on the repercussions of their withdrawal from the EU. They want the negotiations with the EU to start as soon as possible. It was an historical misjudgement by David Cameron that he could win the referendum. Most of the members of the lower house believed the then-prime minister and voted to hold a referendum. But now they can no longer stop Brexit. But they should not let themselves be intimidated by party discipline, nor the leading Brexiteers, nor by voter impatience. Over the next two years they should use every chance they can to influence the withdrawal process. May announced that although they are leaving the European Union, they will not be moving away from Europe. The parliamentarians must now hold her to her word. Have something to say?

        "generated_story": "Brexit vote is not a referendum against the will of the British people The House of Commons has voted to leave the European Union. It is a vote against Britain's sovereignty. The British government has said that it will not allow the referendum to be held in the future. This is the first time that the UK has ever voted in favor of leaving the EU. In the past, the vote has been called by the majority of British parliamentarians in favour of a no-deal Brexit. But this time, it's not the case that Britain will be left with no deal at all. There is no such thing as a \"no\" vote. That's because the people of Great Britain are the ones who have the right to make the decision for them. They have to decide for themselves whether or not they want to stay or leave. And that's what we are going to do. We have a very strong majority in this house of parliament, and we will continue to fight for the rights of all citizens to live and work in a free, open and democratic society. If we do not, then we have no choice but to go to the polls and make a decision. What do you think of this vote? What does it mean for Britain? I think it means a lot to us, because it is an important vote for our country. I don't think there is any question that we should be able to get a deal that is acceptable to all of our citizens. So, what does that mean? It means we can't have another referendum on our future relationship with our European partners? That is why we need to look at this as an opportunity for us to move forward with a new relationship, not just for ourselves, but for all the other people who live in Britain, who are not British citizens and who want the same rights and privileges as us as Europeans. Why should we be so divided? The referendum result is very different from the one that was called for by David Cameron and Boris Johnson, both of whom are staunch Brexiteers. Both of them have been very vocal about their opposition to Brexit and their support for it. However, they have also been quite vocal in their criticism of May's plan. \"I think she has a good chance of winning this referendum,\" said Birgit Maass, an anti-EU campaigner who has campaigned against Brexit for 24 hours. She added: \"She has to win back the trust of her own people and the support of those who voted against her.\" She also pointed out that there was a clear majority for her plan, which she said was \"a clear and unequivocal rejection of Brexit.\" \"The referendum was not an attempt to change the course of history,\" she told the Commons."

        "target": "A Brief History of the Seaside Holiday These days, millions take seaside holidays for granted as one of life's pleasures. But 200 years ago, a dip in the sea was more a test of courage. Hardly anyone could swim. As late as the 18th century, many Europeans still thought of the sea as the realm of Satan: storm-tossed and inhabited by terrifying monsters. \"Unlike the mountains, the coasts were terra incognita as a holiday spot,\" says Manfred B\u00e4tje, director of the Bade-Museum on the North Sea island of Norderney. Anyone who set foot in the water was \"stepping into the unknown\". Brighton showed the way That only began to change after the British aristocracy discovered the healing power of salt water. As early as 1780, Brighton, England's biggest and oldest seaside resort, was a bustling spa. Philosopher and physicist Georg Christoph Lichtenberg (1742-1799) of G\u00f6ttingen gave Germans the starting signal with his 1793 essay \"Why doesn't Germany have any large public seaside resorts?\" In it, he called for the creation of a resort in Cuxhaven on the North Sea. He received support from the most notable German physician of the time, the Prussian king's court physician, Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland. But things turned out somewhat differently. Germany's first seaside resort was indeed built in September, 1793, but in Heiligendamm on the Baltic Sea. Four years later, permission was granted for construction of Germany's first resort on the North Sea, on Norderney. \"For the first bathing season on July and August of 1800, only around 250 guests turned up. Now, the nearly 6000 residents host a good 530,000 bathers annually, plus around 230,000 day-trippers,\" B\u00e4tje reels off the figures. Romanticist inspiration In the 19th century, the landscapes of Caspar David Friedrich, such as his famous Chalk Cliffs on R\u00fcgen (1818), gave seaside holidays added impetus. From then on, the sea was no longer a voracious beast. From the shore, the cultivated, modern European contemplated the vast melancholy of the deep. \"The calm sea became an embodiment of unspecified yearning, the waves an expression of vitality and dynamism,\" soliloquizes museum director B\u00e4tje. But the journey to the sea long remained an arduous, time-consuming one. It took the mail coach a good thirty hours to cover the distance from Hamburg to the North Frisian town of Aurich over bumpy, muddy roads. The express cab from Bremen only took about 16 hours to reach the East Frisian town of Norden - including six changes of horses along the way. \"It wasn't comfortable,\" explains B\u00e4tje. Not until the introduction of seaside tourist steamers out of Hamburg and Bremen to the islands and the expansion of the railways did the journey become easier. Strict bathing rules At first, it was primarily the well-to-do bourgeois and nobility who were able to afford a seaside holiday. Victorian-era society is known for its extreme prudishness, and the beach was not exempt. Bathing machines were essentially changing cabins on wheels that could be rolled into the surf. The sexes were kept strictly separated. Wet swimsuits could not be allowed to cling, thus revealing the body's contours. Women sported baggy flannel garments with bloomers underneath that swiftly became waterlogged to where the bather was risking her life. Hardly anyone really knew how to swim anyway. \"Most bathers wouldn't stay in the water any more than two minutes, often just seconds at a time. The English had a rule: 'Three dips and out',\" quips archivist Manfred B\u00e4tje, whose Bade-Museum is housed in a building for a former wave pool, just a few steps from Norderney's Weststrand, where, during the summer months, vacationers sunbathe in wicker beach chairs and on blankets, cooled by a salty sea breeze. Sunbathing first came in style early in the 20th century, and the first true swimsuits were produced in the United States. \"Starting in 1919, today's bathing culture gradually began to take shape,\" B\u00e4tje looks back. At the same time, ideals of beauty were in flux - such as the attitude towards tan skin, which had long been regarded as a mark of farmers and manual laborers. B\u00e4tje: \"People were still cultivating their genteel pallors.\" Water, Waves, Wellness Today, the sun worshipers are the devout masses, and seaside holidays are their pilgrimages. The North Sea resorts alone count some 12.9 million overnight stays annually. Health is once again a primary concern: sea air, sea water, sea salts and the algaes and mud used in",
        "generated_story": "A Brief History of the Seaside Holiday in Germany Four years later, the Bade-Museum in Bremen is celebrating its 200th anniversary with a special exhibition on the history of Germany's seaside holiday. The exhibition, which runs from September, 1793 to October 1799, is dedicated to the 20th century German seafaring tradition. It is the largest exhibition in the country's history, and the first to be held in a German city, it is located in Norderney, near the town of Aurich. In 1742-1799 it was opened to visitors from all over the world, including the United States, Canada, England, France, Germany, Great Britain and Scandinavia. During the summer months, visitors were able to enjoy a good thirty hours of sightseeing, sailing, boating, fishing and sailing. Today, however, there are only a few exceptions to this rule. For example, in 1818, Germans were allowed to visit the Chalk Cliffs in Cuxhaven for two minutes, but not for the whole of July and August of 1800. This was the last time Europeans were permitted to see the North Sea for more than a half hour. But it wasn't long before Germans began to take advantage of this opportunity to explore the region's beauty and culture. From the 1780s on, they enjoyed a great deal of leisure time sailing around the Baltic Sea, especially in summer. There was also the chance to spend time with family and friends, as well as a lot of time playing cards and watching the sea. And of course there were the occasional boat trips, such as the one in R\u00fcgen in 1794. These were all part of a long tradition that lasted for over 200 years, with the exception of one trip to Brighton, where the German ambassador to England was Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland. After all, B\u00e4tje and his wife, Dieter Sell, had been living in Brighton for many years. They were both born in Cologne, so they were well-known in their own right. \"It was a very special time for us,\" they said, \"and we were very proud of it.\" They also enjoyed the company of their children and grandchildren. As a result, many of them went on to study at the University of Cologne for a year or more. Nowadays, German tourists come back to Germany for summer vacations and enjoy the sights and sounds of sea life. At the same time, a number of people from other European countries are visiting Germany in order to get a taste of what it's like to live in one of these countries. One of those countries is England. More than 200 countries have visited Germany since the end of World War II. Germany has a reputation for being a welcoming country to its seafarers and its people are very generous with their time and generous in welcoming them to their holiday destinations. Many of its visitors come from the East Frisian countries, like the Netherlands and Germany. Some even travel to other parts of Europe, or even the U.S. or the Middle East."

        "target": "Threat of the Punjabi Taliban is growing Deutsche Welle talks to Pakistani political expert Hasan Askari Rizvi about the growing ties between militants in northwest Pakistan and Punjab province. At least four gunmen disguised in police uniforms raided a hospital in Pakistan's eastern city of Lahore on Monday night, claiming at least five lives. Local officials said the gunmen were trying to free a militant, who was being treated there after being captured during attacks on two mosques last Friday. The police said the gunfight at Jinnah Hospital had lasted around 45 minutes but the gunmen had managed to flee. Friday's twin attacks on the minority Ahmadi community left more than 90 people dead. They were claimed by a group, which identified itself as the Punjabi wing of the Taliban. Deutsche Welle spoke to political expert Hasan Askari Rizvi in Lahore, where there has been a wave of violence in recent days. DW: Who are the \"Punjabi Taliban\"? It is a kind of a pejorative term, which includes a host of groups. Initially in Punjab, you had two types of militancy: One, the groups that focussed mainly on Indian-administered Kashmir and there were other types of groups that focussed on Pakistan. Those were the sectarian groups targeting mainly the Shias, and there were some Shia groups targeting the Sunni leadership. Over the years a lot of factions have broken away from these groups and these small entities are functioning more or less autonomously. They have trainings in the tribal areas because these are secured for them and certain parts are not under Pakistani control so these groups go there. They operate with the Pakistani Taliban based in tribal areas against the Pakistani troops in the region. They also have an autonomous agenda, which they pursue in Punjab, as they have been doing in the past days. These groups also play host or are a kind of a local link to Taliban suicide bombers who come into the main part of Pakistan from the tribal areas (let's say to Punjab). If they have to target some place, they park themselves with these Punjab groups, and then do it. All these factions and groups that have broken away from traditional militant groups and are functioning in close collaboration with tribal area Taliban are often described as the \"Punjabi Taliban\". Why do you think these militants are resurfacing now? They have always existed here and there and generally the trend is that they undertake a couple of operations, one after the other. Then the government comes in and takes action against them. Then they just disappear or become sleeping groups and suddenly after a couple of months they resurface. That's the standard pattern. The last major incident in Lahore was in the first week of March. Then there was nothing in April and now towards the end of May you have this kind of incident. Do you think the government should have taken stronger action against them? They should have but the problem is that the Punjab government has a kind of ambiguous approach and I think there is some element of denial within the leadership also. These groups also have some sympathy if not support at the societal level and that makes it difficult for the government to go against them openly. They need to work together and to emphasise to the people that they are terrorists. They use different names and Islam but actually their agenda is terrorism. Somehow the government of Punjab has been rather confused and ambiguous regarding these groups. Interview: Disha Uppal Editor: Anne Thomas",

The group is known as Ahmadi and is believed to be based in the area of the Jinnah Hospital in Lahore.

In the past days, there have been reports that the Taliban were planning to take over the hospital, which is located near the border between Pakistan and India. At the same time, a number of people have died in clashes between the militants and the police, according to the report. One of them, Hasan Askari Rizvi, was killed in a shootout with police on Friday. Another man was injured in an attack on a police station in Punjab, where the Pakistani army is stationed. DW's Disha Uppal and Anne Thomas were among the injured. They were taken to an Indian-administered hospital where they were treated for gunshot wounds and were later released on bail. \"We have a lot of information on the situation in our country and we are working very closely with our Pakistani counterparts,\" she told DW, adding that she was \"very worried\" about the possibility of a return to her home state of Punjab. She added that her family was also worried about a possible return of Taliban fighters to Pakistan, and that they would be forced to flee the country if they returned to their home country. But she said she did not have any doubts about her son's safety, as she had no doubts that he would return home to his family. However, she added, \"I don't know if he's going to come back.\" The Punjabis, who are mainly Sunni, are not allowed to travel outside Pakistan at the moment, although they can travel to other parts of Pakistan to seek refuge. There is also the threat of attacks from the \"Shias,\" a group of Shia Muslims who claim to represent the majority of Pakistani society. Last week, German news agency DW reported that Pakistan's army was preparing to launch a major offensive against the Pakistan Taliban, with the aim of eliminating the militant group from its territory.

The Catalan club announced on Friday that the 45-year-old coach had died of cancer in a hospital in Barcelona after battling the disease for several months. \"Tito has been suffering from cancer for a long time,\" Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola said on Twitter, adding that he was \"deeply saddened\" by the death of his former coach, who was diagnosed with terminal cancer last November. Barcelona have been without a coach since the end of last season, when the club was relegated from the Primera Liga to the lower division. Vilavilla, a former Barcelona player, was one of the most successful players in the history of Spanish football. His career spanned more than a decade and was marked by a number of successes, including two league titles and a Champions League spot in 2014. However, he also had a string of disappointments in his professional career, most notably failing to make the squad for the 2014-15 season. Last year, Barcelona were relegated after losing two of their last three games to relegation-threatened Sevilla. In November, the Catalan side suffered a 5-1 defeat at home to Real Madrid in their first league match since returning from exile. After suffering a series of setbacks in recent years, Vilava was finally able to return to action last month when he underwent surgery to remove cancerous growth spurts from his abdomen. According to a statement released by his medical team, it was not immediately clear how long he would be out of action for, but it is believed to be at least a year before he returned to his native Barcelona.
