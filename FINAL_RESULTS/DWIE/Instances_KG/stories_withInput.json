        "target": "Opinion: Obama's Cuban revolution President Barack Obama has made a very special declaration of love to Cuba. It's as revolutionary as the Cuban revolution, and as peaceful as the biblical Sermon on the Mount, says DW's Astrid Prange. US President Barack Obama has lost his old communist \"enemy,\" and Cuban President Raul Castro has lost his hatred of capitalism. In the first phone call from president to president since 1961 the two heads of state came to a surprisingly swift agreement. They want to renew diplomatic relations, which have been on ice for more than 50 years, and exchange ambassadors. It's only a matter of time before the US lifts its trade embargo against Cuba. All the word \"embargo\" is really good for - at this stage - is as an ideological soapbox for political hardliners, especially Republicans in Congress who believe lifting sanctions would constitute defeat for the US. Yet the lifting of the embargo has already begun. In addition to medication, it has been possible since 2000 to export agricultural produce such as maize, cereal crops, and poultry to Cuba. Flirting with the rogue state Furthermore, 100,000 US citizens have travelled to Cuba since 2011 for cultural and scientific exchanges. Travel restrictions on Cubans living in exile in the US who wanted to visit their relatives on the island were also lifted. According to press reports, the two countries' military forces are even said to be cooperating, as are their coastguards, and military on the border of the US marine base in Guantanamo. Now Obama wants to officially open a \"new chapter\" in relations with the communist Caribbean island and remove Cuba from the US list of so-called \"rogue states\" that support terrorism. The travel ban on American tourists visiting the island will also largely be lifted. That's as far as things will go for the time being, as Obama would require a majority in Congress in Washington to lift the embargo entirely. But even if these are only small steps, the fall of the American-Cuban wall has begun. The easing of the sanctions and the resumption of diplomatic relations are setting the scene for an end to the embargo. Embargo as scapegoat The tearing down of this \"wall in the mind\" is long overdue. The blockade is obsolete, and has proved to be entirely ineffective. More than this, its advocates have achieved the opposite of what they actually wanted. The blockade has provided the leaders in Havana with an easy excuse for their economic failure. Raul Castro realized long ago that Cuba's economic problems can no longer be justified simply by citing the US embargo. It looks as though he was counting on the blockade being lifted: There is no other explanation for the completion of the Mariel container port in January this year. Cuba's biggest infrastructure project was, incidentally, financed by Brazil. The Brazilians also sent a declaration of love to Cuba. Raul Castro opened the door to them. He loves anyone who helps him - his friends even more than his enemies.",
        "generated_story": "The Fall of the Wall in the Mind of Cuban President Barack Obama US President Raul Castro has called for the end of US involvement in Cuba's war against terrorism. The US Congress is set to vote on whether to allow the US military to enter the island nation. \"We are going to do everything in our power to make sure that the Cuban people are safe and secure,\" Obama said at a news conference in Havana on Tuesday. He also called on Congress to pass a bill that would allow US troops to be stationed in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for up to three years. Obama also said he would sign the bill, which would give US forces the right to detain Cuban citizens indefinitely, until they are cleared of terrorism charges. In a statement released by the White House, Castro said: \"The US government is committed to ending the war on terrorism, and we will not allow it to continue indefinitely.\" The Cuban government has been accused by US intelligence agencies of violating international law, including the Geneva Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, as well as torture and other forms of torture. It is also accused of using torture as a weapon of mass murder in order to silence critics of President Obama's Cuba policy. Astrid Prange, a researcher at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington, D.C., told DW that it was \"unacceptable\" that US officials were not willing to discuss the issue openly with Cuban officials and that they would not discuss it in detail with US lawmakers. \u201cIt is unacceptable,\u201d she said, adding that \"it is not acceptable to talk about it openly and openly in public. There is no way that we can discuss this subject in a public forum where we have a chance to share our views. We are not ready to give up the fight.\u201cWe will continue to work with Cuba on this issue, but we are also working with other countries to ensure that Cuba\u2019s human rights are respected. That is why I am calling for an end to the War on Terror. I think it is time to move on to other issues. For example, we need to get a better understanding of what is happening at Guantanamo and how it will affect the lives of Cubans. This is something that is very difficult for us to deal with at this point in time, because we don't know what the future holds for our country. What is important is that there is a way forward for Cuba and the people of this country, not just in terms of security but also for all of us who live here, who have been living here for a long time and who want to live in peace and stability.\""

The 89-year-old did not say when exactly his resignation would take effect. Calling the move a personal decision, President Giorgio Napolitano made his announcement during an end-of-year speech on Wednesday. \"I'm about to step down, to resign as the constitution expressly allows,\" he said, adding. \"I've reached an age that brings with it growing limitations and difficulties for me to do my institutional duties, which are complex and very demanding.\" Though he did not say when his resignation would take effect, a potential date is January 13 when Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi is due to give up the country's rotating six-month presidency of the Council of the European Union. Renzi faces a political challenge in organizing a replacement for Napolitano, dubbed by Italian media as \"King George.\" The president has served as a key intermediary between political parties through numerous changes in government and other tricky political situations. Napolitano, a former communist respected by Europe and Washington, took office in 2006. At the end of his seven-year mandate in 2013, he was asked to stay on because parliament could not agree on his successor. At the time he warned he may not serve out the full term, given his age. In Italy, presidents have loosely-defined powers including the ability to nominate prime ministers, dissolve parliament and veto legislation, as well as use the moral authority of the office to influence politics. se/cmk (dpa, Reuters)",

The resignation comes after months of speculation and speculation over his possible return to the job. Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte announced on Thursday that he would step down from his post as president of the European Union on Friday. \"I regret to inform you that I have accepted the resignation of my predecessor,\" said Giorgio Napoletti, who had served as Italy\u2019s president from 2009 to 2011. Napolano had been in office since 2011, when he was replaced by Renz, and was widely considered to be a strong contender for the position. However, the Italian government has been unable to find a suitable replacement for him, according to a statement released by the office of President of Italy, Giovanni Battista Di Maio, which said the president would not be reappointed until the end of this year. In a move that was seen as a sign of political stability, Italy has announced that it will no longer seek the presidency of a country that has fallen out of favor with the United States and the EU over the past few years. It is unclear whether the move will have any impact on the relationship between Italy and Washington, but it is widely believed that the two countries have a common interest in each other and that they are willing to work together in a way that is acceptable to both sides. Italy is the only country in Europe that does not want to see its president go on vacation. That is, unless he has a reason to travel to Washington. He has not been able to do that because he is not a member of NATO, nor does he have the authority to make travel arrangements with other member states. His resignation came after a series of scandals involving his personal finances, including a failed attempt to close a bank account with a Russian bank and a plan to buy a house in Italy. At the time of his resignation, he said he had no plans to go back to his previous role as head of state. After all, it was only a matter of time before he returned to Italy to take over as prime minister."

St. Gallen was the third incident in a month that saw violent clashes with police who twice resorted to rubber bullets and tear gas. While Switzerland is seen as a low risk country in terms of hooliganism, violence has been on the increase in recent years and estimates claim there are around 400 hooligans and 600 sympathizers. Swiss Sports Minister Samuel Schmid said that hooliganism cannot be ruled out, reported German news agency DPA. But he expressed his belief that extra measures such as more policing, restrictions on alcohol -- which he has called \"a catalyst for violence\" -- and video surveillance will help keep trouble at bay.

Conservative members of Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition put forward a united front at the weekend against recent developments in the city of Wuppertal. Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said civilians wearing uniforms bearing the logo \"Shariah police\" could not simply start patrolling German streets. The groups reportedly hovered around sites like discotheques and gambling houses, telling passers-by to refrain from gambling and alcohol. Wuppertal's police have begun pressing charges. \"Sharia law is not tolerated on German soil,\" de Maiziere told mass-circulation daily Bild on Saturday. \"Nobody can take it upon themselves to abuse the good name of the German police.\" Justice Minister Heiko Maas, meanwhile, told Bild that \"the state alone\" was responsible for the administration of justice in Germany. It was obvious, Maas said, that any illegal parallel system of law enforcement would not be tolerated. Christian Democrat party whip Volker Kauder was similarly emphatic in an interview to be published in this week's Welt am Sonntag newspaper. \"Under absolutely no circumstances can we tolerate self-styled 'Sharia police officers' patrolling our streets and dictating what people should or should not do,\" Kauder said. Ringleader: goal was attention The 33-year-old behind the Wuppertal patrols, former fireman Sven Lau, published a video on his website on Saturday. Lau said that a \"Sharia police\" never existed, and that a group of men had simply worn the mock uniforms for a few hours. \"We knew that this would raise attention,\" Lau said, claiming that his goal was to spark a debate about Sharia law in Germany. Lau is a leading member of Germany's Salafist movement, advocates of a strict Sunni interpretation of political Islam. He works with a mosque in his native M\u00f6nchengladbach, not far west of Wuppertal, and used to head the fundamentalist group \"Invitation to Paradise.\" (Einladung zum Paradies, in German.) The central council of Muslims in Germany (ZMD) condemned the activities. \"These few teen yobs do not speak in our name,\" chairman Ayman A. Mazyek told the Tagesspiegel am Sonntag newspaper. \"These people are perverting the name of our religion. With this shrill and foolish action, they are really hurting Muslims.\" Sharia law is the Arabic term for a legal system based on the Koran. Saudi Arabia and Iran are examples of countries where such a system officially applies. Wearing a veil is obligatory for women and corporal punishment such as stoning is legally tolerated. Human Rights Watch reported last month that Saudi Arabia had beheaded 19 people in just 16 days in August, for convictions on charges ranging from cannabis smuggling to \"sorcery.\" msh/rc (AFP, dpa, Reuters)",

In a statement released by the Interior Ministry on Friday, de Mazyek said he would \"not tolerate Islamic State (IS) attacks\" on German Muslims. The statement came a day after the interior minister of Germany's largest Muslim-majority state, Heiko Maas, announced that she would be stepping down from her post as defense minister. She said she had no plans to step down until the end of the year, and that the state would continue to cooperate with the federal government in its fight against terrorism. A spokesman for the Christian Democrat (CDU) party, Volker Kauder, said his party was ready to take a stand against \"Islamic terrorism.\" \"I have no intention of resigning from my position, but I will stand by my principles and my values,\" said Sven Lau, the party's deputy parliamentary leader. However, he added that he was not going to resign from his position if the government did not take action against IS. Speaking at a news conference in M\u00f6nchengladbach, a suburb of Cologne, German media reported that police had arrested two people in connection with an attack on a mosque on Saturday. Police said they were looking for two men suspected of planning the attack. According to the German daily Bild, one of those men was arrested and charged with attempted murder, while the other was found guilty of attempting to commit a terrorist act. Both men have been released on bail pending an appeal by a German court to remove them from their posts. They face up to 10 years in prison if they are found to have committed any crime."

Lui said the world community needed to get the \"upper hand\" over the next six months. While the viral spread had been slowed in Guinea, concerns focused especially on Liberia. \"If we don't stabilize Liberia, we will never stabilize the region,\" Lui said. She was critical of the WHO for delaying its public health emergency warning until August 8. \"We need people with a hands-on operational mindset,\" to combat the outbreak, Liu told the Geneva news briefing. WHO - 'vastly underestimated' On Thursday, the World Health Organization (WHO) said the scale of the epidemic had been \"vastly underestimated\" and that \"extraordinary measures\" were needed to contain the contagious virus. The UN health agency said the death toll had climbed to 1,069 in four afflicted countries, spanning Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia and more recently Nigeria. Sierra Leone's chief medical officer Brima Kargbo disclosed on Thursday that at least 32 of the nation's nurses and doctors had died from the Ebola virus while performing their duties between May 24 and August 13. Local staff suffered stigma, despite saving lives, Kargbo said. \"We still have to break the chain of transmission to separate the infected from the uninfected.\" Youth Olympics also affected The mounting alarm coincided with an announcement Friday from the International Olympics Committee that three athletes from Ebola-hit countries had been barred from competing in pool events and combat sports at the Youth Olympics opening in China on Saturday. ipj/tj (AfP, Reuters)",

It sided with a German firm in its legal battle with US giant Oracle. The European Court of Justice on Tuesday ruled that used software licenses may generally be resold by individuals or companies. The Luxembourg-based court thus sided with the German firm UsedSoft in a protracted legal battle with US software giant Oracle. The ruling made it clear that trade in used software was permissible even if the software had not been shipped on a physical medium such as a CD or DVD, but had been digitally downloaded from the Internet. UsedSoft's business model hinges completely on reselling used packages or legally obtained license keys for them. By reselling the keys to clients, the latter are then able to download the latest version of a given program directly from a company's Internet site and obtain all new updates and patches in the process. Legal clarity Oracle had sued UsedSoft over its business model, trying to prevent buyers of used software licenses from downloading programs again. But the European court ruled that the so-called principle of exhaustion applied whenever software was originally sold to a customer for an unlimited time span, not giving the maker of the software the right to prevent the resale of that software. \"The door for the trade in used software has been pushed wide open throughout the European Union,\" UsedSoft said in a statement, welcoming \"perfect legal safety on the market.\" The court in Luxembourg emphasized, though, that whoever resold pieces of original software and their accompanying licenses must erase every copy on their own computers in advance and was not allowed to keep a copy after resale. hg/mz (AFP, dpa)",

Oracle said it would appeal the ruling, arguing that its software was not liable for infringement of EU copyright law. A European court has also ruled against the German software company, usedSoft, in an order that could lead to the creation of a new EU-wide database of intellectual property rights.

It also said the same could be said for software that is not available in other EU countries, including the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Taiwan and the Netherlands. In a ruling published Thursday, European courts have also rejected Oracle's request for an extension to its European license, citing the company's failure to comply with EU rules on the sale of software. According to court documents, Oracle did not have the legal authority to extend the extension, but it did say it had the right to renew the license if the application was downloaded by a third party. This is the first time that an EU court had found that a software application can be reselled without the user's consent. Earlier this month, a European Commission ruling said software applications that were downloaded without authorization were not protected by EU laws, and that such applications should only be used in cases where they are downloaded and not in violation of European copyright legislation.

NASA's Mars rover, \"Curiosity,\" will wrap up a lengthy self-testing phase on Thursday, freeing it up to continue exploring the surface of the Red Planet. Mission manager Jennifer Tropser told reporters in a conference call on Wednesday evening that the plan, once the final checks were completed, was to \"drive, drive, drive\" until Curiosity discovers a rock suitable for analysis. She added that the instrument checks have delivered positive results. \"Through every phase of the check-out, Curiosity has performed almost flawlessly,\" Tropser said. \"The success so far of these activities has been outstanding.\" Many of the tests have concerned Curiosity's robotic arm. The 2.1-meter (7-feet) appendage will be used to pick out and sample rocks and soil. NASA is investigating whether Mars can sustain life, or whether it could in the past. The tests were designed to identify any damage sustained during its interplanetary flight and also to ensure that the arm still functioned properly on Mars, with its different temperatures and gravity. The Mars rover landed in the giant Gale Crater, near the Martian equator, on August 5; it has so far moved about 109 meters within the crater. The rover is traveling east, heading first to an intersection called Glenelg, where three types of terrain meet. This is likely to be the location for the first rock and soil samples, though NASA said Curiosity was unlikely to arrive there for several weeks. Curiosity's ultimate destination is the nearby Aeolis Mons or Mount Sharp, a 3-mile-high mound of rock rising out of the crater.

In addition to testing the samples, the team also tested them on a variety of surfaces, including the sun, moon and sea surface. All of these tests were successful, according to the scientists, who said they were able to confirm that the Martian atmosphere was indeed that of a foreign object. They also confirmed that there was no sign of alien activity on Mars. But they also said that they had not seen any signs of an alien presence on Earth. That's good news for the Curiosity team, because they have been working on their mission for more than a year and a half now. And they are optimistic about the future, they say. Read more: NASA: Curiosity will be the next big thing in space exploration The Curiosity rover has already been tested by a team of scientists at NASA, but it's not clear how well it will do. So far the test results are promising. There is no indication of any major breakthroughs, although it is possible that Curiosity may have made a breakthrough in its mission to explore the solar system. However, there is still a lot of work to be done before the mission is ready to launch. What's next for Curiosity? The team is looking at a number of different options. One of them is to build a rover that can detect alien life forms. Another option would be to develop a human-made robot that could be used to study the environment around it. This would allow scientists to experiment with different kinds of objects, for example, a robotic vacuum cleaner or an artificial intelligence system, or something like that."

        "target": "Aging health: WHO call to action as world population over 60 set to double by 2050 In a new report on aging and health, the World Health Organization is calling for action on \"population aging,\" as figures suggest the number of people over 60 will reach two billion by 2050. People worldwide are living longer, says the World Health Organization in its World Report on Aging and Health. This is both good and bad. It gives us the chance to \"pursue new activities\" as we get older, such as in education and family life. But it all depends on our health. And for that the WHO says world governments need to act now to make sure our societies worldwide are ready. What are the take home facts from the World Health Organization's 2015 report on Aging and Health? The WHO says that in the next 35 years, the global number of people aged 60 years and over will almost double from 12 percent to 22 percent. By 2020, there will be more people over the age of 60 than 5 year olds. And a majority of older people (80 percent) will live in \"low and middle income\" countries. It's estimated that the world's population aged 60 years and older will total about 2 billion in 2050, which is more than twice as much as now. Furthermore, worldwide, about 125 million people are aged 80 years or older. But by 2050, it is expected that this number of people - aged 80 and over - will live in China alone. But I'm not old, so why should I care? Well, all this is happening at a faster rate than ever before. And the WHO says \"all countries face major challenges to ensure that their health and social systems are ready\" for this major demographic shift. It will cost a lot of money to improve health and social infrastructures, especially in more developed countries where traditional families structures have changed dramatically. Surely, there's \"no typical older person,\" though. How does the WHO define aging? We tend to think of older people as physically and mentally frail. But that's not necessarily the case, not everywhere in the world. Old is a relative concept - especially in middle income to rich countries. For instance, some 70 year olds are as fit as some 20 year olds. Just think how many older folk are at your gym, and ask yourself whether you can keep up with all of them. But that still doesn't explain aging. What is it exactly? The WHO says that at a biological level, \"aging results from the impact of the accumulation of a wide variety of molecular and cellular damage over time.\" Basically, this puts people at a higher risk of disease and, of course, death. But aging can also be associated with \"life transitions,\" such as retirement or witnessing other people, such as friends and family, die around you. This can affect you psychologically and sometimes, as a result, physically. What sort of diseases come with old age? Some of the most common non-fatal conditions include hearing loss, cataracts, back and neck pain and osteoarthritis. Other conditions include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - which affects the lungs - diabetes, depression, and dementia. What needs to be done? The WHO is proposing a five-step plan of action, which includes: Committing to healthy aging and \"evidence-based policies to strengthen the abilities of older persons.\" Aligning health systems with the needs of older populations Developing systems for providing long-term care Creating \"age-friendly cities and communities Improving measurement, monitoring and understanding of \"aging issues\" worldwide. But don't forget: \"a longer life brings with it opportunities, not only for older people and their families, but also for societies as a whole.\"",
        "generated_story": "WHO's Population Aging Plan: Actions Now The World Health Organization (WHO) has announced its plan to reduce the number of people living in poverty by one million by 2050. The plan, which was approved by the WHO in November 2015, aims to cut the country's population by 1.5 million people by 2030, according to a new report released on Wednesday. This is the first step in the process of reducing the world\u2019s population through action, the report said. \"The WHO has decided to take action now,\" it said in a statement, adding that the plan would be implemented \"in the coming months.\" The WHO said it would take \"significant action\" to tackle the problem of the aging population, but added that it was still possible to address the challenge posed by a lack of awareness among younger people about the need to live longer and healthier lives. It also said that there was an urgent need for action on the part of governments, including the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), in order to prevent the spread of diseases such as cancer and heart disease among young people. In addition, it added, \"the WHO is committed to increasing the life span of all people who are living longer than the average age of a person who is 65 years of age and who has a high risk of developing cardiovascular disease.\" \"We have to act now, and we must act quickly,\" said WHO Director-General for Population and Health Catherine Ashton, in an interview with the Associated Press on Thursday. Ashton said he was \"very optimistic\" about WHO's plans, saying that \"it is very clear that we are going to do everything we can to make sure that our population continues to grow at the same rate as it has been growing for the past 30 years,\" Ashton added. He also pointed to the fact that more people than ever before will be able to reach their full potential as a result of an ageing population. However, he said, there is still room for improvement, especially in areas where older people are more likely to die of old age than younger ones. That's why he called on governments to step up their efforts to meet the needs of older populations. But he also warned that if they didn't act fast, they could be forced to give up on their dream of becoming a middle-income citizen."

It is a reflection of his current inauspicious Formula One campaign that World Champion Michael Schumacher is only featuring in reports on this weekend's German Grand Prix at Hockenheim dues to his nationality. The home grown champion equaled his own record of 11 wins in a season at last year's race but this year he will be hoping to just get on the podium at the end. Schumi lies in third place some 34 points off the top spot and has a lot to do if he is to record his 85th career win. Ferrari's poor season to date is unlikely to get better with hopes dwindling that the 36-year-old will add to his sole victory of the season although the seven-time world champion characteristically refuses to rule it out. Schumi and Ferrari still in the fight \"Contrary to many other people's opinions, we have in no means written ourselves off, even though we have to admit that the situation has worsened recently, rather than improved,\" said the German, referring to the problems with this season's car. \"But that doesn't mean that it can't be improved again, and that's exactly what we're working on.\" The limelight is falling on two young pretenders to Schumacher's throne as Sunday's race approaches. The battle between McLaren's flying Finn Kimi Raikkonen and championship leader Renault's speedy Spaniard Fernando Alonso is diverting eyes from the world record holding German on his own turf. Kimi aims to keep heat on leader Alonso Raikkonen must finish the German Grand Prix for the first time in five attempts to close the gap on Alonso if he is to keep his own championship hopes alive. The Finn retired from last year's race because of a rear wing failure and this season has been plagued by technical problems which most recently cost him 10 places on the starting grid in each of the last two rounds. Despite those penalties for engine failure, the 25-year-old managed to finish second and third but he will have to increase his total of three race wins if he is to make a significant impression on the 26-point chasm that separates him from Alonso. \"The battle for the championship is still on and I am determined to get a good result and work on closing the gap,\" said the Finn. \"The (car) has good speed and we need to make the most of it this weekend.\" Montoya doing McLaren team mate no favors Raikkonen's car is obviously a fast one this season but he's not the only driver in a McLaren hot seat. Colombia's Juan Pablo Montoya is not to going to make way for his team mate while his own hopes of the title, however small, remain alive. \"I am really looking forward to racing again this weekend in Germany,\" said Montoya, who won at Hockenheim for Williams two years ago and got his first victory for McLaren in Britain two weeks ago. \"I enjoy racing at Hockenheim, I have performed well here and won in the past and I am aiming for a strong result like at Silverstone.\" Consistent Ferdy the man to beat at Hockenheim Championship leader Alonso, meanwhile, has been impressively consistent for Renault so far this season, winning five times and failing to score points only at the Canadian Grand Prix, where he crashed, and in Indianapolis. The Spaniard is setting the pace and the standard this season so, problems aside, Alonso will again be the man to beat at Hockenheim.",

The Spaniard and McLaren driver are locked in a three-way battle for the top spot. Alonso, who has won the last three races of his career, will take on Ferrari's Michael Schumacher in Sunday's final race of the season. \"I'm going to try and win this one,\" Alonso said after the race, adding that he was \"very happy\" with the result. He added that \"it was a great feeling to be in front of my family and to have the opportunity to win the championship.\" \"It was great to see Fernando and his family so happy, and I'm very happy that I was able to do that,\" he said. Ferrari driver Juan Pablo Montoya, meanwhile, said he would be happy to take a step back from Alonso in order to focus on the task ahead of him in his home country of Spain, where he has been battling for a place in F1 since the end of last year's season with McLaren. McLaren and Ferrari are the only two teams with more than a dozen drivers competing in their respective races, with Ferrari and Williams the other two having a combined total of seven drivers. Both drivers have won their last four races in Germany, but Alonso has yet to claim a victory in any of them since he retired with a broken leg in qualifying in May 2014. In his absence, Alonso will be looking for his first victory since returning to the sport in 2011, when he joined Williams from Ferrari after a four-year absence due to a back injury sustained in an accident in Malaysia in July. That injury forced Alonso to retire from the 2014 season, leaving him without a chance to compete again in 2015 and 2016. His return to McLaren, however, is expected to come as a surprise to Alonso's team-mates. It's not just Alonso who is looking forward to this weekend's German GP, it's his teammate and former teammate, Carlos Sainz, as well as his former team mate, Fernando Verdasco. Facing Alonso on Saturday, the Briton will try to make up ground with his new Ferrari teammate Alonso as he looks to extend his lead in Saturday's race against Williams' Williams driver, Jorge Lorenzo, in what could be his last race before he retires from racing in 2017."

She will share the prestigious award with US compatriot Oliver Williamson. The jury from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said the Americans' research had shown how \"economic analysis can shed light on most forms of social organization.\" Ostrom, a professor at Indiana University, was honored for her \"analysis of economic governance,\" especially in relation to the management of common property or property under common control. The political scientist's work challenges the widely accepted belief that common property is poorly managed and should be either regulated by central authorities or privatized, it added. She carried out numerous studies showing how self-organization and local-level management work to keep common resources viable. Her studies included both natural resources, such as forests, and artificial structures, for example police forces. Ostrom told Swedish television that she felt \"great surprise and appreciation\" and was \"in shock\" about being the first woman to win the prize. The pros and cons of big firms In his work, co-prizewinner Oliver Williamson, of University of California, Berkeley, examines why large corporations tend to arise - and why they do not - based on the cost and complexity of transactions, according to the Nobel committee. \"He has taught us to regard markets, firms, associations, agencies, and even households from the perspective of their contribution to the resolution of conflict,\" the jury said. Williamson authored 'The Economic Institutions of Capitalism' in 1975, a landmark text of the 'new institutional economics' movement that questioned the idea of firms as simple profit-making machines. Last but not least The Nobel prize for economics is the only Nobel award that was not created by the will of Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel in 1896. It was actually founded by the Swedish central bank, the Sverige Riksbank, to celebrate its tri-centenary a year earlier. It was awarded for the first time in 1969 under its official name: the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel. But although it was the last \"Nobel prize\" to be created and the last to be announced each year, the prize is not a poor relation in monetary terms. Winners of the awards for peace, literature, medicine, physiology, chemistry and physics all receive 10 million Swedish crowns (969,000 euros). A good year for women This year was a record year for women laureates. German-Romanian writer Herta Mueller won the Nobel Prize for Literature. Australian-American Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider of the United States were awarded the prize for medicine. And Ada Yonath of Israel was one of three scientists recognized for her work in chemistry. Americans more or less swept the board this year. Nine of the 11 laureates were US citizens. The most prominent of those was US President Barack Obama, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for his \"extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples.\" jg/AFP/dpa/Reuters Editor: Sam Edmonds",

        "target": "The Sun Sets Slowly Over Brandenburg's Tropical Dream Having suffered many disappointments concerning publically funded projects, the state of Brandenburg hoped a tropical leisure center would offer a ray of hope. Instead the ailing concern is just bringing more gloom. The economically depressed eastern German state of Brandenburg has seen its fair share of bitter experiences when it comes to huge public investment projects since German unification in 1990. Against this background, state authorities were pleased when Malaysian businessman Colin Au built a huge tropical-feeling leisure center in Brandenburg without any subsidies. The center, which opened about a year ago, was to become a symbol of economic success in a region where unemployment still hovers around the 20 percent mark. But the leisure time park, which has already swallowed a little under 100 million euros ($120 million) in private investment, is now going to have to depend on public funding to avoid another economic fiasco in Brandenburg. State authorities in Brandenburg haven't been too successful in their public investment policy in the past 10 years, to put it mildly. A grand plan to build one of the world's most modern chip-producing factories there burst like a bubble in 2003. The much-talked about Brandenburg-Berlin International airport still seems light years away from being built. Line of failures looked to be ended by Au's vision Another beacon of economic hope disappeared in 2002 when a company planning to build gas-filled transport airships went bust despite considerable subsidies. But Au's vision for the abandoned dome which the airship company needed as a hangar offered Brandenburg another chance. In the middle of nowhere, he created what he named his \"Tropical Islands\" wonderland, sporting everything from sandy beaches, lakes and a Laguna to a Caribbean-style village. The economics ministry in Brandenburg was over the moon to see Au originally agreeing to build the facility without any state subsidies. And Au himself had no doubt at the time that he could well do without them. Overestimated visitor numbers tell sorry story But the center's first year in operation tells a different story. Colin Au, who has meanwhile left Brandenburg and transferred matters to a German management company, had expected some 1.5 million visitors to come to Tropical Islands within the first year, but only some 950,000 will have turned up by the end of 2005. It seems highly unlikely that visitor numbers will increase considerably in future, placing a question mark on the viability of the whole centre. But Brandenburg's economics ministry is certain that the park will be in the black as of 2008. To make the place more attractive, it has agreed to shell out 15 million euros in subsidies for yet another reconstruction and marketing effort. After all, the leisure time center has a workforce of about 500 and is thus the biggest employer in an otherwise depressed region marked by a high jobless rate. Tropical center down but not out...not yet \"We hope the money will help make the Tropical Islands resort better known throughout Europe according to the new marketing concept hammered out the management,\" ministry spokesman Steffen Kammrath said. \"This leisure time center is unique and has to be marketed as such. What you have there is a tropical and water world 12 months a year with a lot of attractive offers to spend a whale of a time there.\" Some commentators believe that state subsidies may prolong the center's life span, but will not be able to avoid its demise in the long run. But the idea of also making it more attractive for tourists from all over Europe seems unrealistic to them if the resort's management can't even get enough visitors from home to ensure a profitable operation.",

The tropical island resort is located on the island's tropical coast, which is home to the world\u2019s largest coral reef. There are more than 1,000 coral reefs and coral islands, and the resort has become one of Germany's most popular tourist destinations. \"The sun is setting slowly here,\" said Colin Au, who is staying at the property for the duration of his stay. He added that it was \"the most beautiful place on earth.\" \"It's been a beautiful day,\" he said, adding that he was looking forward to spending some time with his family and friends in his new home town, where he and his wife have been staying for a year and a half. His wife and two children are also staying there, but he has no plans to return to Germany until after the war is over. In the meantime, he will be spending the next couple of weeks at a resort near the Malacca Strait, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. On the other hand, it's not as if he's going to be able to stay in Germany for much longer than he did before he moved to Malaysia. That's because he doesn't have the money to travel to Europe, so he'll have to fly to Berlin to see his parents and step-children. And that's just the beginning of a long road ahead for him. After all, there's a lot of work ahead of him, as well as many other people who are still waiting to get settled in their new homes. What's next? \"I don't know what the future holds for me. I'm not even sure if I can stay here long enough,\" Au said. 'I can't think of anything I want to do right now.' \" But I do have a feeling that I'll be back in Berlin soon,\" Kammrath told DW."

Bayern's coach Juergen Klinsmann says Hoffenheim are legitimate contenders, but commercial manager Uli Hoeness disagrees. When the Bundesliga scheduled Bayern's home match against Hoffenheim in the league's unloved Friday night slot, they probably didn't imagine that it would turn out to be the match of the first half of the season. Indeed, few experts or fans thought that Hoffenheim, a first-division debutante located in a southern German village with 3,000 inhabitants, would give mighty Munich a run for its money. But it's the first week of December, and Hoffenheim top the table by three points. They also have a much better goal difference than their second-placed rivals -- and that has drawn praise from Bayern's coach, Juergen Klinsmann. \"I have the highest estimation of Hoffenheim because they've built the squad very ambitiously, rationally and with very good players,\" Klinsmann told DPA news agency. \"They can be proud of that.\" Klinsmann said he thought that the club could establish itself among the top three or four sides in Germany in the years to come and qualify for international competition next season. He also had words of praise for Hoffenheim's software billionaire patron, Dietmar Hopp, whose money has funded the club's ascent. \"There's nothing negative about it,\" Klinsmann said. \"He used to play for the club, is a soccer man through and through and helped the team get on its feet.\" Some fans have criticized Hopp and Hoffenheim for paying inflating salaries and luring talent away from other clubs instead of developing homegrown players. In fact, Hoffenheim's official salary budget is about average for the Bundesliga. Hoeness sounds his horn But while Bayern's coach was praising his opponents to the skies, Munich's commercial manager Uli Hoeness has been trying to play with their heads. On the heels of Bayern's convincing win over Leverkusen last weekend, Hoeness is back to taunting rivals. \"The performance we showed in the second half against Leverkusen will be enough against Hoffenheim,\" Hoeness told the German soccer magazine kicker. Hoeness also dropped a none-too-thinly-veiled hint that Hoffenheim's personnel expenditures were far higher than the officially released figures and scoffed at the idea that strategy would determine the outcome of Friday's match. \"Games are decided by the better players, not by tactics,\" Hoeness said. \"And of course, we've got better players than Hoffenheim.\" But that particular verbal attack may represent some wishful thinking of the manager's part. Hoffenheim coach Ralf Rangnick is one of only two current Bundesliga skippers with a winning record against Munich. Rangnick, whose team cruised past Bielefeld last weekend to keep Bayern three points back, reacted to Hoeness' remarks with a shrug. \"We're preparing for Munich exactly the same way we did against Bielefeld,\" Rangnick said. In any case, soccer fans in Germany know what they'll be doing Friday evening -- finding a bar with cable sports television to watch a top match that no one, before the start of the season, would have considered possible.",

Hoffenerheim, who are in the relegation zone for the second time in three seasons, are one step closer to a return to Bundesliga glory. The Bundesliga's top-flight club has been struggling for form since the end of last season, but the German side are still on course to reach the Champions League quarter-finals in their first season back in Germany. In their opening match against Bielefeld on Sunday, the visitors came from behind to beat Leverkusen 3-0 and then beat them 2-1 at home to keep alive their hopes of qualifying for next year's Europa League. A win would be enough to secure a spot in Europe's premier club competition, and the team would have a chance to make it back into the top four in 2014-15 with a win over Schalke and a draw at Hoffensburg. But the Germans have not been able to do that in recent years, as they have to rely on the likes of Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund and Bayern to win the league. That's not to say they are going to give up on their dream of reaching the final. They are, after all, a very good team and they deserve a lot of credit for that. It's also important to remember that the players are all very well-coached and that they all have their work cut out for them. There's no doubt that this is one of those teams that will be looking for a new coach. And that's a good thing, because it will give them something to look forward to.

        "generated_story": "Automation in the Dairy Cow Industry In Germany, there is a growing demand for dairy products. Dairy products are becoming more and more popular as a result. But there are also growing concerns about the impact of automation on the dairy industry. For example, milk products such as milk, cheese and eggs are increasingly being used as substitutes for meat. This is due to the rise in milk production and the increasing use of artificial fertilizers and pesticides. In addition, the number of cows slaughtered in Germany has risen by more than 30 percent since the beginning of the year. The increase in production of milk and cheese has also led to a surge in dairy product sales. However, it is not just milk that is being sold in supermarkets. It is also the main reason why milk prices have risen so much in recent years. That is because milk is more expensive to produce than meat, which is why it costs more to manufacture milk than to sell milk. So, in order to reduce the costs of production, farmers have to make up for this by increasing the production costs. And this is where the problem lies. There are many reasons why the milk industry is suffering from a lack of demand. One of them is the fact that milk isn't as cheap as it used to be. Another reason is that it's not as easy to get milk from cows as from other cows. What's more, cows don't like milk as much as cows do, so they're less likely to have milk in their stomachs. They're also less willing to give milk to cows, because cows are more susceptible to disease than humans are to diseases, and because of this, they can't produce milk at all. Therefore, when it comes to milk-based products, these are the products that are most often used by cow's milk producers. These products can be used in many different ways, including refrigeration, dairy, meat processing and so on. All of these products have been developed in a way that makes them more efficient and cost-effective. As a consequence, more cows will be milked at the same time as humans, making milk less expensive and less polluting. How do you decide which cows to buy and which ones should be sold? The answer is simple: You buy the cow, then you sell it. Then you buy a cow. You sell your cow and you get a milk product that you can use to feed your cows and feed them to your customers. Do you have any idea how much milk you're going to use for milk? That's the question I'm trying to answer here. I have a lot of questions for you, but I think I'll answer them all in my own words. If you want to know the answer to that question, I'd like to hear from you. Let me know what you think. Thank you for your questions."

        "target": "Inching towards direct talks on Syria They came to hold talks, but started negotiations with mutual affronts. But if there is one person who might be able to mediate between the intransigent Syrian conflict parties, it's Lakhdar Brahimi. Lakhdar Brahimi, the United Nations special envoy for Syria, seemed very tired on Friday (24.01.2014). He had had a long day, which was actually supposed to be the first real day of negotiations at the Syria Conference in Geneva. \"Good afternoon,\" Brahimi told the assembled international press, before adding, \"or good evening, I don't know.\" At the Palais des Nations in Geneva, he presented the most important result of his attempts to mediate between the Syrian government and the opposition to the more than 250 journalists who had managed to get a coveted place at the press conference: \"Tomorrow we expect and we have agreed that we will meet in the same room.\" What Brahimi is declaring an achievement doesn't sound like much, but considering how irreconcilable the conflict parties have been, even that can be seen as a small success. Separate talks with Brahimi The two delegations were actually due to meet on the first day of negotiations in Geneva in order to agree on a timetable and on the subject and agenda of the talks. But emotions are running too high on both sides. Instead both delegations held separate talks with Lahkkdar Brahimi, both lasting just about an hour each In the morning. The Syrian government delegation had apparently been threatening to leave the conference. At least that is what the deputy foreign minister Faisal Mekdad had implied. \"We are here to start the negotiations,\" he told waiting journalists, \"but we found that the other party did not want to come.\" Before the conference, the opposition had explained that for its delegation, the formation of a transition government would be a central tenet of the negotiations. They emphasized that this topic should be discussed right at the beginning of talks and that the establishment of such a body should be initiated without delay. Social media and good old propaganda The representatives of the Syrian National Coalition that were present in Geneva neatly used all imaginable channels to make their views public. At #Geneva2, they tweeted: \"Forming a transitional body is our major priority,\" leaving people in no doubt that the Syrian National Council would not want to include Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Assad's government, on the other hand, is relying on classic propaganda and loyal state media representatives in Geneva. An impressive entourage of dominant journalists from state-run media outlets is constantly at hand, accompanying the government delegation and making sure they get their point across at press conferences. Lakhdar Brahimi even had a small altercation with a journalist from a Syrian state news agency, who made a political statement under the pretense of asking the UN mediator a question. \"Are there any signs that Saudi Arabia, Turkey and other countries would stop the support of terrorism in Syria?,\" she asked in somewhat shaky English, before Brahimi interrupted her. \"Please, please, there is no point in asking such questions!\" Such exchanges hint at the type of negotiating style the experienced diplomat and mediator Brahimi must have behind the scenes. 'Wish us luck' Lakhdar Brahimi described the preliminary talks that took place in Geneva as encouraging and asked for patience. He said that because the peace conference had come about at the last minute and the delegations had therefore only been appointed very recently, there hadn't been enough time to hold preliminary discussions - a task that the delegations were now catching up on. \"We never expected it to be easy and I'm sure it's not going to be,\" he said. \"But I think the two parties understand what is at stake. Their country is in very, very bad shape.\" He added: \"The huge ambition of this process is to save Syria. Nothing less than that.\" After appealing to the willingness of both parties to negotiate, he simply added: \"So wish us luck!\" Fight for freedom As the official delegations held talks with UN mediator Brahimi in the Palais des Nations, the European headquarters of the United Nations, hundreds of Syrian expatriates who had come from all over Europe protested outside, forming a sea of red, white and black Syrian flags on the Place des Nations. With their presence outside the UN gates they wanted to show that despite all the government propaganda, the Syrian National coalition has a lot of support from the Syrian people. Thirty-two-year-old Ziad Malki came to Geneva from Zurich to show his solidarity. Ziad knows how it feels to be deprived of his freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. In 2005, he was arrested at a demonstration in Damascus and says he was tortured during his time in prison. Now he is fighting for a new Syria from outside the country's borders. Ziad is sure that with Bashar al-Assad and his family, there will be nothing new. \"We don't want this man to be in",
        "generated_story": "Mediating with the Syrian National Coalition in Geneva UN envoy for Syria, Faisal Mekdad, has met with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to discuss the situation in the country. The Syrian envoy, Lahkkdar Brahimi, arrived in Switzerland on Thursday to meet with representatives of the opposition and the government. He said he was \"very impressed\" by the meeting. \"I am very impressed,\" he said, adding that he had \"no doubt\" that Assad would be able to work with his own people in a way that would allow him to do what he has always wanted: to win elections in Syria. But he added that it was not possible for Assad's regime to hold elections without the support of his people, which is why he is not allowed to take part in any elections. In Geneva, the United Nations special rapporteur on the conflict between government forces and rebels has been meeting with officials from both sides to try to reach an agreement on how to end the civil war. At the same time, he also met Syrian opposition figures, including former President Fuad Haddad, who is currently in exile in Turkey. Both sides agreed to cooperate on a number of issues, such as the implementation of a ceasefire in Aleppo, Aleppo's capital, as well as an end to the use of chemical weapons and other weapons. They also agreed not to use force against civilians, but to provide humanitarian assistance to those who are suffering from the effects of these attacks. 'We will not allow this to happen again' \"We are not going to let this happen to us again,\" said the Geneva-based envoy. Speaking to reporters in Zurich, Syrian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said his country was ready to accept the deal, although he did not elaborate on what it would entail. \u201cWe do not want to give up the fight against terrorism,\u201d he told reporters, referring to Assad\u2019s regime as a whole. However, it is important to note that this deal does not necessarily mean that the regime will accept Assad as its successor. It is, however, an important step in this process, because it will allow Assad to continue to rule Syria as long as he remains in power."

        "target": "Italy's navy to patrol with Libyan ships to curb human trafficking Italy wants to work more closely with Libya to limit the number of sea crossings by migrants and potential asylum seekers. But what are the consequences? Italy's prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni, does not want to wait any longer for EU countries to show solidarity in distributing asylum seekers throughout the bloc. On Thursday he announced in Rome that the Italian navy would be patrolling with Libyan ships just off the Libyan coastline. The aim, Gentiloni says, is to curb human trafficking and bring migrants back from the smugglers' boats to Libya. According to the Italian government's figures, 93,000 migrants have arrived in Italy so far this year. At least 2,000 have drowned in the attempt to cross the Mediterranean - the true figure is unknown. Italy has already threatened to stop allowing boats carrying rescued migrants to dock in Italian ports, or that it may issue migrants with documents that would allow them to travel on to other European countries. Rome has not yet implemented either policy, but the government has made clear that Italy will soon run out of options. The EU Commissioner for Migration Dimitris Avramopoulos acknowledged, again, in Brussels on Thursday that \"Europe continues to face high migratory pressures. And Italy more than (almost) any others.\" The European Commission issued a letter offering more aid and personnel to help manage migration better. Accommodation will soon be full The office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, wrote at the beginning of July that \"Close to 200,000 accommodation places are available for refugees and migrants across [Italy], but are nearly all full.\" The High Commissioner referred particularly to the numbers of people dying when he warned, \"What is happening in front of our eyes in Italy is an unfolding tragedy.\" The United Nations anticipates that another 100,000 migrants will come to Italy via Libya before the end of this year. The number of arrivals is already 20 percent higher than last year; and the number of dead, those who could not be saved, would rise accordingly. According to UN estimates, the Mediterranean remains the \"deadliest\" refugee route in the world. Italian government statistics say that around 600,000 people have arrived in Italian ports since the start of the crisis in 2014. It is unclear how many have since traveled on to Austria, France or Switzerland. Once migrants are registered in Italy and accommodated in camps, they are not held there. If, however, they leave the accommodation without giving notice, they forfeit their claim to subsistence and social services. Most of the migrants are from African countries, and many try to travel on to France, for example. 300 people are currently sleeping on the beach in Ventimiglia, on the French border, hoping to take a bus or train to France. However, the border is being policed by French officials. Migrants who are caught are sent back to Italy. Austria has announced that it too will close its border with Italy if the number of migrants starts to rise. Repatriation and distribution are difficult Last year 120,000 new asylum applications were made in Italy. Around 50 percent of these are rejected. The asylum seekers are then supposed to leave the country. However, the process of people either returning voluntarily or being deported is very slow. The interior ministry has therefore announced that it will reinforce repatriation programs. The redistribution of asylum seekers from Italy, as agreed by the European Union, is well behind target. Two years ago the aim was to resettle 120,000 people. So far, only 24,676 people have been redistributed, the EU Commission said on Thursday: 7,873 from Italy, and 16,803 from Greece. The numbers are low not just because of the reluctance of other EU countries to take the refugees in, but also because of Italian delays in the registration of possible candidates. Asylum seekers from Eritrea are the most likely to fulfill the criteria for redistribution. Around 25,000 are currently living in Italy, but only 10,000 have been registered with the EU Commission and the European Asylum Support Office as possible candidates. Migration Commissioner Avramopoulos has announced that Italy will be given more help and logistical support in this area.",

The statement came after Italy's interior minister, Paolo Gentiloni, said on Twitter that the migrant crisis in Libya was \"increasingly acute.\" \"The situation is becoming increasingly acute,\" he said. \"We are facing an unfolding catastrophe.\" The Italian government, which controls the country's borders with Libya and Egypt, has said it will not allow migrants to enter the EU without a visa. It is also seeking asylum in other EU member states, including the United States, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Portugal, the Netherlands, Belgium and the Czech Republic. In addition, EU migration ministers have also expressed concern about the situation in Greece, Cyprus and Malta, where migrants are being held for up to three years without proper documentation. Italy has been the only EU country to allow asylum seekers to stay in its territory for at least a year, a spokesman for the Italian interior ministry told the news agency ANSA."

Police said they were searching for survivors of the shipwreck, which was reported to have been hit by a wave of rain and strong winds. \"We are still trying to ascertain the exact cause of this accident,\" a police spokesman told AFP news agency, adding that investigators were still working to determine what caused the accident.

It is not clear how many people died or what the cause was, but it is believed to be a combination of several factors, including the fact that the vessel was damaged and that it was carrying a large amount of cargo. There were also reports of injuries to dozens of people in other ships, as well as the death of a woman and a man. Authorities have yet to confirm whether any of those injured were French nationals or Haitian nationals. Carnival is a popular tourist destination, and Carnival has become a tourist attraction for many tourists who come to Haiti for the carnival season. Many of them come from France, where they spend a lot of time with their families and friends. In the past, Carnival trips have often been marred by mishaps. Last year's Carnival was the most popular destination for Carnival revelers. But this year, there was no Carnival at all.

        "target": "Is China seeking regime-change in North Korea? The sudden reduction in aggressive rhetoric and actions by North Korea has led to suggestions that Pyongyang has realized it has pushed its only ally in the region to the brink of severing its friendship. The announcement in Pyongyang on May 13 of the promotion of Jang Jong-nam to \"minister of the People's Armed Forces\" came out of the blue. Until recently, the little-known commander of an army corps in coastal Kangwon Province, Jang has replaced Kim Kyok-sik, a four-star general with a long track record of loyal service to the regime. The reasons for 70-year-old Kim's replacement are not clear - as with most of the political maneuvers in North Korea - but it may have been his loyalty that cost him his position in the politburo. Kim was widely seen as a hawk in the regime and is believed to have been in command of the operation to shell the South Korean island of Yeonpyeongdo in November 2010, an incident that killed four people, destroyed civilians' homes and infrastructure and dramatically worsened the already strained relationship between Pyongyang and Seoul. By sacrificing Kim, analysts believe, North Korea is signaling that it is backing away from the confrontational stance it adopted after the United Nations imposed new sanctions in the wake of the nation's third underground nuclear test in February. And there are other indicators that Pyongyang is seeking to return to the status quo. The North's troops have been permitted to step down from the highest state of preparedness for war that was initially ordered when South Korea and the US began a series of annual military exercises. Missiles withdrawn Similarly, two Musudan intermediate-range missiles that were identified as being on mobile launchers being operated in eastern areas of the country have apparently been ordered to return to base. In late April, there was concern that test-launches of the missiles would be a further escalation by Kim Jong-un's government and a message that it would not bow to international pressure to halt its nuclear and missile development programs. But the analysts believe the tokens of Pyongyang's goodwill have come too late. \"For the North Korean leader, this is a very difficult time,\" Toshimitsu Shigemura, a professor at Tokyo's Waseda University and an authority on North Korean affairs, told DW. \"Timing is very important here and it is possible that China is moving to abandon Kim Jong-un. The atmosphere between the two nations is changing. China may have decided that it is time for a regime-change in the North, they will not permit the collapse of the country because they do not want chaos on their own borders.\" Further evidence that Beijing is slowly tightening the screw on its erstwhile ally comes as more state-run financial institutions sever their links with banks in North Korea. The latest institution to adhere to the government's orders to halt transactions across the border is the Bank of China, one of the four major banks in the country, which announced on May 7 that it would cease dealings with the Foreign Trade Bank of North Korea, which has been identified as being involved in Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs. Contingency plan in place Intelligence sources have passed on to DW information that Beijing has a contingency plan in place for when Kim Jong-un's control over the country crumbles. The reports confirm that China is indeed quietly encouraging regime change and is grooming Kim's brother, Kim Jong-nam to take over his role. At 42, Kim Jong-nam is the oldest son of Kim Jong-il, the dictator who ruled North Korea with an iron fist for 17 years until his sudden death in December 2011. Kim Jong-nam had been expected to assume the leadership after his father's death, but fell from favor spectacularly in 2001 when he was detained with two women and a boy aged 4 at Tokyo's Narita International Airport travelling on a forged Dominican Republic passport. He later admitted that he had wanted to visit Disneyland. He subsequently lived in Macau and Beijing, under the close watch of the Chinese authorities. The reports suggest that after Kim Jong-nam is installed in Pyongyang, his brother will be permitted to go into exile, probably in China. The tactic is not without its pitfalls, however, in part due to the efficiency of the campaign to deify their young leader as the future of the nation. Kim Jong-nam as 'new king' \"China may be dreaming of appointing Kim Jong-nam as the new king - and he is more preferable to the West than Kim Jong Un - but the problem is that he is not known in North Korea,\" said Ken Kato, director of Tokyo-based Human Rights in Asia. \"Many people in Japan know much about the North Korean 'Royal Family,' but this information is hidden in North Korea,\" he said. \"Even residents of Pyongyang know very little about Kim Jong-nam.\" Yet the reports are gaining credence among North Korea-watchers. Jun Okumura, a political analyst with the Eurasia Group, told DW that North Korea withdrawing",
        "generated_story": "North Korea's 'new king' Jang Jong-nam is the new leader of the North Korean People's Armed Forces (PASF) and the country's leader Kim Jong Un, according to a report by the Eurasia Group. The report said that Kim, who is believed to be the heir apparent to the throne of North Korea, was born in Pyongyang on March 11, 1959. He was the son of Kim Il-sung, the founder of his father's company, and his mother's sister. His father, Kim Kyok-sik, is said to have been born on the same day. \"He is a very strong leader,\" said Jun Okumura, a professor of political science at the Waseda University in Tokyo, adding that he was \"very proud\" of what he had achieved in the past few years. But the report also pointed out that the younger Kim was not the first person to use the term \"new leader\" in Korean history. In fact, it was Kim's father who first coined the phrase \"New leader.\" The term was coined by Kim in response to his son's death in a plane crash in 2011, which killed more than 1,000 people. It was also used to refer to Kim as \"the new king.\" In a statement released on Friday, Pyongyang's foreign ministry said it had no immediate plans to change the name of its leader, but that it would continue to work with the South Korean government to improve relations between the two countries. On Thursday, South Korea and Japan announced that they would no longer allow North Koreans to call themselves \"state sponsors of terrorism\" or \"terrorists.\" \"We will not allow this to happen again,\" Seoul's Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Shigemura said in an interview with DW."

Smuggling has prompted a visit to Mexico City by US Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly. Prosecutors said the remote town of Las Varas in Chihuahua state was the scene of Wednesday's battle between affiliates of the Ciudad Juarez cartel and a gang from the state of Sinaloa. Police said fighting escalated when patrols arrived. Fourteen people were found dead; 12 others were hospitalized. Grenades, launchers and rifles were found. The mountainous region is used as a corridor for smuggling into the US. El Chapo effect Chihuahua security commissioner Oscar Alberto Aparicio said a Black Hawk helicopter was called in as police chased surviving gang members through the area known for marijuana and opium poppy production. Two police officers had been killed in a \"cowardly\" way in the area a week ago, he said. In a similar incident last Friday, 17 gunmen were killed during a shootout with police on a highway in Sinaloa, Mexico's northwestern state. Sinaloa was the home base of Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, whose extradition to the US in January apparently left gangsters in a struggle for control of criminal syndicates. Homicides have surged in recent months, with the number of persons killed in May put at 2,186, the highest since the collection of such statistics began 20 years ago. Nieto and Kelly to talk In Mexico City Wednesday, President Enrique Pena Nieto's office said he and visiting US Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly had discussed how to rein in organized crime groups. \"Shared responsibility\" must become the focus of transnational efforts, Kelly said. Narcotics smuggling into the US has become a multibillion-dollar (multibillion-euro) business for Mexican drug cartels. Mexico in turn wants the US to throttle demand for narcotics and the supply of illegal weapons to Mexico cartels. Pena Nieto and US President Donald Trump, who wants a border wall, are schedule to meet Friday on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany. ipj/ng (AP, AFP, dpa)",

Mexico's interior minister, Oscar Alberto Alberto Aparicio, is due to speak with the US ambassador to the country. \"We are very concerned about the security situation in our country,\" he told reporters at a news conference in Chihuahua, the capital of the state where the fighting broke out on Tuesday. Mexican authorities have said they have arrested a suspected drug trafficker, Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, in connection with a drug trafficking ring that has been linked to US President Donald Trump's 2016 election campaign. In a statement released Wednesday evening, Trump said he was \"deeply concerned\" by the violence, adding that he had \"no doubt\" that it was a \"terrorist attack.\" \"I am deeply concerned that this is a terrorist attack, and I have no doubt that we are going to do everything we can to prevent this from happening again,\" said Trump, who is set to travel to Mexico later this week for talks with his Mexican counterpart, Ollanta Humala, during which the Mexican president is scheduled to make his first official visit to his country since taking office on Jan. 1, 2017.

The case has highlighted the army's problems with equipment and morale. The men sentenced to death on Wednesday were part of the special forces division ordered in August to retake three towns in Borno state, which had been taken over by the Islamist Boko Haram insurgents. Their lawyer, Femi Falana, said the 54 men were sentenced to death by firing squad and five had been acquitted. They were accused of conspiring to commit mutiny against the authorities of the 7th Division of the Nigerian army, which is on the frontline. The trial began on October 15 and was conducted behind closed doors. It is subject to approval by top military officials, but there has so far been no indication that senior officers oppose the court martial. They were not available for comment afterwards. There was a similar case in Nigeria in September, when 12 soldiers were sentenced to death for mutiny after firing on their commanding officer in the northeast city of Maiduguri. The 7th Division, based in Maiduguri, leads the offensive but there are numerous reports of troops refusing to deploy. Soldiers have regularly complained that they lack weapons, food, and other basic supplies to fight the Islamists, who are reported to have tanks, rocket-propelled-grenade launchers, and other heavy weaponry. Boko Haram has taken a number of towns and declared an Islamic caliphate in the region near the border with Cameroon. The Nigerian military has in recent weeks claimed to have made progress in recapturing lost territory. Thousands of people have been killed since the Islamist uprising began five years ago. An estimated 1.3 million have been displaced, with tens of thousands seeking refuge in neighboring Cameroon, Chad, and Niger. rg/bk (AFP, AP, dpa)",

Police said on Thursday that they had arrested three suspected members of the sect, including the head of one of Nigeria's most powerful military units, Femi Falana. \"We have arrested a number of suspected terrorists, and we will use all available means to bring them to justice,\" the military spokesman said in a statement. He did not elaborate on the charges against him, but said they were part of a joint operation between the Nigerian army and the militant group. Borna's military has said that it will continue to fight the militants until the end of this month, when it is expected to announce a new round of military operations. It is not yet clear whether the operation will be carried out by the army or the police. In the past, it has also been reported that some of its fighters have been killed in clashes with security forces. On Thursday, a police officer was killed when he was attacked by a group of gunmen who were trying to take over his convoy. At the time of his death, he said he had no idea what was going on. His body was taken to a hospital, where it was treated as if it had been taken over by terrorists. There was no immediate claim of responsibility, however, as police had said earlier this week that the suspects were still at large. According to local media reports, the attackers were carrying out a series of attacks on police officers and civilians, killing at least 40 people and injuring hundreds more. They were also said to be planning to carry out attacks in other parts of northern Nigeria as well as in Nigeria, according to the AFP news agency."

The 53-year-old will be leading Germany's second biggest lender. After successfully weathering the Great Recession, Commerzbank's board of directors appears to want to signal a continuation in its growth trend with Martin Zielke's appointment as the new CEO as of May 1. Outgoing head Martin Blessing announced last year he would not renew his contract. Zielke had previously been put in charge of implementing reforms in the company's private banking sector following the recession. His restructuring measures attracted 800,000 new customers to the bank and changed the image of the 146-year-old financial institution. The 53-year-old has an illustrious career across several German financial institutions to look back on, having started at the teller of a local branch in 1983. Zielke's crowning achievement The beleaguered German financial institution recorded a profit of more than a billion euros (more than $1.1 billion) last year. It was the first time in five years that Commerzbank had made such profitable gains, which it said would translate into paid dividends for shareholders. A good portion of the yields were achieved by a restructuring and expansion drive of Commerzbank's private banking arm under Zielke's leadership. However, some of that money will go to the German government, as it had to step in and rescue the bank in 2009 to the tune of 18 billion euros ($25 billion at the time) by chiefly acquiring more than 15 percent of the shares, effectively nationalizing part of Commerzbank's operations. ss/jlw (dpa, Reuters)",

A spokesman for the company said that \"the board has decided that Martin is the right person to lead the firm.\" The statement came after the German bank announced that it had chosen Zilke as the new chief financial officer. Commersank, which has been in the financial crisis since 2008, said it was confident that Zulke would make a successful return to profitability by the end of this year. However, it did not say how long the CEO would stay on the job, saying it would take him \"a long time\" to find a suitable replacement. In the past, Zolke had been CEO of Deutsche Bank, a German lender, for more than a decade, but he has since been reduced to a non-executive director. He will take over the role of chief operating officer until the summer of 2019, when he will be replaced by a board member who will continue to oversee the group's operations in Germany and the rest of Europe.

Zillke is widely seen as a potential successor to former CEO Michael Kuebler, whom K\u00fcbler took over in 2009 after Kiebler left to pursue his dream of becoming a hedge fund manager. Maintaining a strong position in financial markets, he is expected to stay in that position for at least the next five years, according to an unnamed source close to him."

In a document on combating AIDS, the Commission said that as of 2007, around 2.2 million people carried the virus in the EU and nearby countries, an increase of 700,000 from 2001. According to Commission figures, around 730,000 of these live within the EU's 27 member states. France, Italy, Spain and Portugal have relatively high infection rates - ranging from 0.4 percent to 0.5 percent. In the Baltic country of Estonia, the infection rate stands at around 1.3 percent. In neighboring Ukraine, around 1.6 percent of the population has been diagnosed with HIV, while in Russia around 1.1 percent are HIV positive. The Commission warned that now was not the time for Europe to drop its guard on preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS, adding that in some neighboring countries the number of people carrying the virus had doubled. EU Health Commissioner Androulla Vassiliou said political momentum in the fight against HIV/AIDS needed to be maintained, adding that people must \"take responsibility for themselves and their partners by talking about and practicing safe sex and going for HIV testing.\" A cure for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has yet to be found more than a quarter century after it was brought to public attention. However, efficient treatments exist to slow the evolution of the virus. dfm/AFP Editor: Chuck Penfold",

The figure could rise to as high as 60 percent by the end of this year, according to the latest figures from the European Commission (ECB). The figures are based on a survey of 1,000 people in 28 EU member states, the Commission said in a statement on Thursday. \"The overwhelming majority of those surveyed said they were unaware that they had HIV,\" said Androulla Vassiliou, EU commissioner for health and human rights, in an interview with the Financial Times. He added that the average age of people who have tested positive for HIV was between 40 and 60. In addition, one in five people with AIDS in EU countries have been told that their status is not known to them. According to a study published in March, HIV is the second most common cause of death in Europe after AIDS. It is also the most commonly diagnosed form of AIDS, with a prevalence of up to 1.5 percent in countries with higher rates of HIV. This figure is higher than the national average of 0.9 percent. Vasser said the figures were \"involving a very large number of new HIV infections.\" The report also found that a third of all new infections in HIV patients were diagnosed within the first three months of treatment, compared to just 1 in 10 in those who had been treated for the disease in 2006. However, there were no new cases reported in 2007 and 2008, and the number was down to 2.6 percent for 2009 and 2010, respectively. There was also a slight increase in cases in 2011 and 2012, but the figure was only slightly higher in 2013, when it stood at 3.7 percent, while in 2012 it was at 4.1 percent and in 2014 it reached 5.8 percent again. That's a significant increase from a year earlier. But it's still not clear how many people are aware they have HIV and how much of a burden it is on them to live with it. A recent study by researchers at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in New York showed that almost one-third of newly diagnosed HIV cases are not considered to be HIV positive."

Ban also called on the international community to step up its efforts to prevent the violence from spreading to other countries, including China, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and Myanmar. His comments came as a result of a UN Security Council resolution calling for an end to the \"illegal\" practice of using force in elections. A UN report released earlier this week found that more than 1,000 people had died in violence in recent months. Many of those killed were women and children aged between the ages of 15 and 25, according to a report from the International Organization for Migration (IOM) in Washington, D.C.

The link between the two is so strong that many Federweisser wines have a recipe for the onion cake on their labels. Here's a recipe for it: Ingredients: 1 packet yeast, active dry 1 teaspoon sugar 1 1/2 teaspoon salt 3 cups unbleached flour 1 tablespoon shortening 1 cup water (49 to 54 C / 120 to 130 F) 6 slices bacon -- diced 2 medium onions -- sliced 1/4 teaspoon cumin 1/2 teaspoon salt Pepper 1 egg yolk 1 cup sour cream Mix the yeast with the sugar, a teaspoon of salt and half a cup of flour. Blend in the shortening and warm water, then beat for two minutes. Add enough flour to make a soft dough, and then knead the dough until smooth and elastic, about five minutes. Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, then cover it and let it rise in a warm place for 30 minutes. Pat the dough into a lightly greased 12-inch pizza pan or onto a lightly greased baking sheet. Press up the edges to make a slight rim. Fry the bacon until crisp and drain it on absorbent paper. Add onions to the bacon grease, and cook slowly until tender, but not brown. Sprinkle the onions, bacon, cumin, half a teaspoon of salt and pepper over the dough. Bake the cake at 204 C (400 F) for 20 minutes. Blend the egg yolk and sour cream and pour the mixture over the Zwiebelkuchen. Bake it for another 10 to 15 minutes, until the cake is golden brown and the sour cream has set.

        "target": "Bayern blast five as Schalke draw Bayern Munich stamped their authority over the Bundesliga on Saturday, with a ruthless 5-0 drubbing of Hannover at home. Meanwhile, second-placed Schalke and third-placed Frankfurt were forced to share the points. With many critics saying Bayern might as well be given the giant Bundesliga dish already, perhaps the struggle for second is shaping up to be the more compelling battle. But Saturday afternoon's clash between second-placed Schalke and third-placed Frankfurt did not take a decisive turn, with the game ending in a 1-1 draw. Schalke drew first blood in the 11th minute, when Frankfurt's Stefan Aigner was dispossessed in midfield, and Lewis Holtby released Klaas-Jan Huntelaar in front of goal - the Dutchman's first in the Bundesliga since September. But the hapless Aigner waited just over 100 seconds to make amends for his error, when the Royal Blues allowed him a free header that left goalkeeper Lars Unnerstall with no chance. But neither side could make inroads in the second half, which allowed Dortmund to leap-frog both sides and claim second place. Bayern take command Meanwhile the imperious Bayern Munich dispelled any talk of winter form-dip - following last week's draw to Nuremberg - with a brutally efficient 5-0 win at home to Hannover. The Bavarians stormed to a 3-0 lead in just 37 minutes, celebrating a nifty overhead kick for star signing Javi Martinez in the fourth minute. Toni Kroos and Franck Ribery scored the next two against a Hannover side that were torn open at will. The overhead kick was the first for the 40-million-euro ($52-million) signing Martinez, and in the second half new defender Dante also opened his account with a straightforward header from a Kroos free-kick. The festival of football continued just four minutes later, when Mario Gomez - making first Bundesliga appearance of the season - slammed the ball into the net from a tight angle just 30 seconds after replacing Mario Mandzukic. Dortmund win The champions Dortmund, meanwhile, are still nine points behind Bayern after beating Mainz 2-1 away. It was a potentially tricky fixture in the town where J\u00fcrgen Klopp began his coaching career, and Mainz showed their brilliance in the fourth minute, when Elkin Soto knocked a dream ball into the path of Marco Caligiuri, whose volley fairly screamed into the top right corner. Dortmund's own star-Marco - national team player Marco Reus - leveled the scores just eight minutes later. Reus worked himself some room at the outer edge of the penalty area, and slotted a beautiful 17-meter effort into the far corner. And Dortmund's second goal, just before half-time, was equally aesthetic - a vertical ball bisected the Mainz defense perfectly down the middle, where Polish predator Robert Lewandowski got his eighth league goal of the season with a deft lob over the onrushing Christian Wetklo in goal. Allofs' homecoming Bremen's 1-1 draw at Wolfsburg had a special frisson of its own, as Wolfsburg's newly-minted sporting director Klaus Allofs faced the club he had served as general manager for over a decade. And there was some gesticulating from the Bremen bench in the general direction of the Wolfsburg management when the guests took the lead in the 35th minute. Just seconds after Wolfsburg missed several chances, Marko Arnautovic was left free in the box after Eljero Elia found space on the left and cut the ball back for the Austrian to finish. But Wolfsburg got their own back in the second half. In the 62th minute, Bremen were reduced to ten men when Lukas Schmitz was given second yellow card for a hard tackle on Adelino Vieirinha. Just two minutes later, Bas Dost took advantage of their guests' disorgnaization and smashed the ball into the goal after neat piece of play from Vieirinha. Dirty derby The Franconian derby between Greuther F\u00fcrth and Nuremberg was a cagey affair that ended in a frustrating 0-0 draw. The first half was marked mainly by a straight red card for Nuremberg's Markus Feulner after an ugly, flying lunge on Stephan F\u00fcrstner. But the home side's numerical advantage was short-lived - Sercan Sararer was also sent for an early ice bath after his high elbow on Javier Pinola was adjudged worthy of a second yellow card in the 61st minute. But the aggression in the tackles was not matched by ruthlessness in front of goal, and neither side could eke out any clear chances.",

Bayern Munich and Wolfsburg face off in the first round of the competition on Sunday. The German side have a tough task ahead of them, as they travel to Nuremberg to play their first Bundesliga match since the end of last season. They will be looking to get back into the top four after a disappointing season in which they failed to reach the quarterfinals and lost to Schalke 04 on aggregate. \"We are going to have to work very hard to make sure that we get to the next round,\" said Stefan Aigner, Bayern's head coach. He added that he was \"very happy\" with the result, adding that it was a \"good result\" for Bayern, who have been playing well for the last few years. But it is also important to note that Bayern are not the only team who are struggling to stay alive in this competition, and that they are also struggling with injuries and suspensions. That is, they have not been able to win a single match in their last three seasons. In addition, the club have had to deal with a number of injuries in recent years, including a broken collarbone and a torn labrum. On the other hand, it has been a successful season so far, with only one loss in its last four matches. Last season's Bundesliga champions Bayern were eliminated from the playoffs after losing to Werder Bremen and Stuttgart. This year's winners, N\u00fcrnberg, were also knocked out of their group stage by a 1-0 defeat to Cologne, a result that was followed by an 0-1 draw at Stadion G\u00fcngladbach on Saturday. Both teams are still in contention for a spot in next season\u2019s Champions league, but Bayern have yet to secure a top-four finish in Germany. A win over Mainz would be the latest in a long line of German clubs to find themselves in uncharted territory. German coach Klaus Allofs' side, which is currently in fourth place in Group A, are in danger of losing their final two games in all competitions. It is expected that the German club will try to avoid the same fate as last year, when they lost 3-2 to Olympique Lyonnais in extra time."

        "target": "In Argentina, red wine exports to balance Porsche imports About 100 Porsches are imported to Argentina each year. Now the country wants to keep a positive trade balance by having the value of the imported luxury cars matched by red wine exports. Porsche is currently enjoying record profits after a two-year downturn, but the export-reliant company has hit a pothole in Argentina. Buenos Aires-based Porsche importer Grupo Pulenta has signed an agreement obligating it to export several hundred bottles of red wine for each car it imports, the Argentine government announced Wednesday. Grupo Pulenta declined to comment when contacted by Deutsche Welle. Job creation During the past year, Argentina has held thousands of high-end vehicles in customs until companies agreed to export goods valued at the same amount. Most of those vehicles came from Germany. According to a spokeswoman for the Argentine embassy in Berlin, the country has been trying to safeguard domestic employment with a positive trade balance. \"Our government has negotiated with automakers to balance their imports of cars with an equivalent amount of exports,\" she told Deutsche Welle in a statement. \"Since March 2010 we have been working with the automakers and importers in order to increase local integration and reduce the trade deficit in this sector.\" Small market A Porsche spokesman said the company sells just short of 100 vehicles into Argentina each year. That compares to more than 40,000 sold worldwide during five months in 2010. \"For Porsche, Argentina is a rather small market,\" the spokesman told Deutsche Welle. \"Our importer, the Pulenta Group, also deals in wine. They have their own vineyards and export that wine. It has nothing to do with Porsche - we just have an import contract with them, and it seems they've found an individual solution with the Argentine government.\" Domestic production Volkswagen, which has an Argentine subsidiary producing the new \"Amarok\" pickup truck and transmissions, has thus far avoided mandatory exports. The company had reported an export surplus of 384 million euros ($545 million) for this year. Porsche's holding company owns 32.2 percent of Volkswagen, and the Porsche brand is intended to become integrated into Volkswagen's lineup. Daimler and BMW also have subsidiaries in Argentina. While Daimler produces its \"Sprinter\" there, BMW only imports to the country. According to the Argentine embassy in Berlin, the country has recently sought more domestic production by foreign car companies. Author: Gerhard Schneibel (dpa) Editor: John Blau",
        "generated_story": "Argentina's Grupo Pulenta to balance wine exports with red wine Argentina's state-owned carmaker has announced plans to reduce its wine export to Germany. The move comes as the country's top wine exporter is struggling to cope with rising prices. In a statement, the company said it planned to cut wine imports from Argentina by 25 percent in the first half of this year. \"We are in a difficult situation right now,\" the statement said, adding that it was \"very difficult\" for Argentina to meet its domestic demand for wine. It also said that Argentina would continue to import wine from Germany, where it has a market share of around 30 percent. Argentina is one of the world's largest wine importers, with more than 40 percent of its exports coming from the United States, according to a report by Deutsche Welle. Germany's Volkswagen is the biggest importer of wine in Argentina, but it is not the only country with a large wine market. According to the report, German carmakers Volkswagen, BMW and Porsche are the second-biggest exporters in Latin America, behind only China's Mercedes-Benz in terms of volume. Volkswagen's Amarok, which is based in Sao Paulo, Brazil, has also been expanding its portfolio of German-made cars, including the BMW Sprinter and the Audi A4. Both of these cars are made in Germany and are exported to Argentina. However, in Buenos Aires, there is no direct link between the two countries, and Argentina has its own wine industry. BMW, for example, produces wine for the German market, while Daimler produces beer, wine and beer. Porsche, however, says it does not have a direct relationship with Argentina as a result of a lack of cooperation with the European Commission on the wine trade. DW/AP"

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who is currently in exile in Brussels, has also called for a referendum on whether Hungary should be allowed to remain in EU membership. Hungary and Poland have been at loggerheads since the end of World War II, and the two countries are now at odds over whether to join the bloc. In a statement released on Wednesday, Hungary's Foreign Ministry said that Hungary had asked for an extension of its membership to a year and a half, while Poland had rejected the request. It also said Hungary would not accept the extension, saying the move was a \"violation of international law.\" The statement came a day after Hungary announced it was seeking a fresh round of EU sanctions against the Czech Republic, a move that could lead to an EU-wide freeze on EU financial aid."

The secret recordings were reportedly made over several months, including at high end restaurants in Warsaw. Wprost says it received the tapes from a businessman.

The prime minster's resignation comes after months of speculation over whether he would be replaced by a new leader. A spokesman for PiS said the party's leader, Jacek Rostowski, would not comment on the matter at a press conference in Warsaw on Friday. Poland's government has been accused by the British tabloid \"The Daily Telegraph\" of covering up the tape, which was leaked to the public in the early hours of Thursday, and of spreading false information about the president's plans to run for re-election next year. Law, Justice and Development (LJP) party leader and Polish People's Party (CPP) presidential candidate Jusuf Kaczynski has also resigned from the post, saying he did not want to interfere with the government's internal affairs. He also said that he was \"deeply disappointed\" with PiPS' leadership in Poland, adding that it was a \"disgrace\" to him to not be able to lead his party into the next round of elections.

        "target": "Beekeepers battle mites with technology Bees are useful, hard-working and vital for our ecosystem. Aside from making honey, bees pollinate most of our food crops. But summertime is also the season for one of the biggest threats to honey bees \u2013 the varroa mite. Dete Papendieck puts on a white veiled protective hat and takes out a metal jug with a beak-shaped spout. He sets fire to the container's contents \u2013 formic acid \u2013 and starts directing the smoke that is wafting at the beehives lined up in front of him in his garden on the outskirts of Bonn. The acid doesn't harm the bees, but it does kill the varroa mites, he says. And July, after most of the honey has been harvested, is the best time to treat his hives. The one millimeter-large varroa mite is a parasite that infests beehives and lays its eggs in the honeycombs, alongside the bees' larvae. \"It feeds on the bees' and the bee brood's blood, the so-called haemolymph,\" Papendieck explains. A third of bees killed in Germany Papendieck is an apiarist at the Bee Research Institute at the University of Bonn and he knows that the threat of mites is serious. If left untreated, varroa-infested colonies rarely survive a winter. In 2010, German beekeepers lost about 200,000 hives to the mite \u2013 one third of Germany's total bee population. And it is not just the honey and beeswax production that are affected by the mite. Many of our food crops depend on bees: Some 80 percent of all agricultural plants and 90 percent of fruit trees in Europe are pollinated by Apis mellifera, the European honeybee. Varroa introduced from Asia Had Dete Papendieck been a beekeeper forty years ago he would not have had to worry about mites. He says the varroa mite that was originally native to Asia, was introduced to Europe in the 1970s. \"It happened during a research project in which it was attempted to crossbreed the European honeybee with the Asian honeybee. The researchers were exchanging bee colonies between Europe and India, and that is how the mites came to Germany,\" Papendieck said. Unlike Asian bee species, the European honeybee cannot fight off the varoa mite by itself. According to Papendieck, bees easily transmit the mite to other beekeepers' hives in what apiarists call robbery. \"It happens when certain colonies are being robbed by other bees. Large numbers of bees from different colonies attack weak hives and steal their stocks. At the same time, parasites and diseases are exchanged\", he says. Researchers have been trying to breed varroa-resistant mites, but so far they haven't had much success. High-tech tools help fight the mite Klaus Maresch is also worried about his bees. He is an organic beekeeper from Bonn and he has been passionate about bees since he was a little boy. \"They are part of my family. When I open my hives and smell the honey and hear the buzzing of the bees it's like being in another world,\" he told Deutsche Welle. In addition to using formic acid to fight the mite, Klaus Maresch employs a high-tech tool \u2013 a special cylindrical scale that helps him determine when it is best to start the varroa treatment. \"Every day this hive scale sends data about the colonies to our server. The data, such as the temperature in the hive and the amounts of nectar and pollen collected, help me to find a good day to treat varroa,\" Maresch says. Maresch also makes the data about the activities in his hives available to fellow beekeepers who can treat their colonies accordingly. A driver's license for beekeepers? But it is not the mite that angers Maresch most. \"That's nature,\" he says, \"I feel angry about beekeepers who don't fight varroa. If the bees of neighboring beekeepers are infested, I also have a problem.\" The existing German pest regulation obliges beekeepers to treat their bees against varroa, but there are no strict controls. The majority of Germany's more-than-80,000 beekeepers are amateurs who keep between one and 20 colonies. This makes it difficult to impose and survey certain quality standards. Maresch, who sees himself as a kind of 'bee activist', would like to see the government introduce stricter rules. \"There should be a law that obliges every new beekeeper to learn about beekeeping before they are allowed to keep bees. They should get an education and there should be something like a driver's license for beekeepers,\" he says. In the mean time, Europe's bees are going to have to",
        "generated_story": "German beekeeper fights varoa mite with high-tech hive scale German beekeepers are fighting a pest that has killed thousands of bees in the past two years. Dete Papendieck, a member of the University of Bonn's Bee Research Institute, says the pest is \"very aggressive and aggressive.\" The pest, which can be easily killed with a single blow, is known as the \"Vormoa Mite,\" and is thought to have killed at least 1,000 honeybees in Germany over the last two decades. \"It's a very aggressive pest and it's very difficult to control,\" said the researcher, who is also a professor at the university's bee research institute. He added that it was \"difficult\" for him to fight it, but that he was able to overcome it with his own efforts. In a video posted on YouTube on Tuesday, the insect is described as a \"vormo-mite\" that attacks the honeybee hive. The insect has been known to attack honey bees since the mid-1990s, according to the German news agency Deutsche Welle. It is believed to be the largest pest in Europe, with more than 1.5 million honey bee colonies worldwide. According to a study published last year, this pest can kill up to 2.6 million bees a year. However, it can also cause serious health problems, such as cancer, liver damage and even death. Experts say it is possible to kill a person in less than a day, and that this can lead to long-term damage to human health. But experts say the problem is much more complex than that. For example, if a bee is attacked by an insect, then it has a chance of being killed by another insect. This is the first time that humans have been bitten by a bug in over a hundred years, said Dr. Klaus Maresch, an expert in beekeeping and the study's co-author."

Other options include a 10 percent increase in the price of alcohol. Kyprianou has, however, hinted that he favors warning labels -- similar to those that appear on packs of cigarettes -- that make the dangers of alcohol clear. \"Drinking harms your unborn baby\" on bottles? Brewers and wine makers across Europe, however, have come out against placing \"Drinking Kills\" or other labels on bottles of beer. \"Warning labels are the completely wrong way to go,\" Peter Hahn, head of the German Brewers Association told Germany's Express newspaper. \"The do not deter people who have lost a sense of how much to drink and unsettle the people who enjoy a beer after work.\" Industry groups also opposed implementing EU-wide guidelines in countries with traditionally different ways of approaching drinking and drinking problems. \"Policies that do not consider cultural and regional differences, will fail to deal with the social problems, while at the same time generate a rising level of political objections,\" said Rodolphe de Looz-Corswarem of Brewers of Europe.

German Consumer Affairs Minister Horst Seehofer said he would wait to see what Kyprianou's actual suggestions are before commenting. Other German politicians, however, were more willing to voice the opposition to putting a sip of wine on the same footing with a puff of a cigarette. \"People should not expect that a skull and crossbones end up on every bottle of beer and wine,\" German EU representative Karl-Heinz Florenz told Der Tagesspiegel newspaper, adding that when it comes to alcohol, each member state should be responsible for how it deals with alcohol abuse. The harm of \"passive drinking\" While cigarettes are a health risk from the first puff, moderate drinking can actually be healthy and there is no danger from \"passive drinking,\" Peter Liese, a German EU representative, told the paper. The commission's report disagreed with Liese's conclusion, saying alcohol abuse had a major role in as many as 200,000 deaths in Europe due to car accidents and disease and played a role in some 60,000 underweight births. The report also estimated the effects of alcohol abuse of costing the EU 125 billion euros ($161 billion) in 2003.

There are other products, too, such as wine, beer and spirits, that are being used on a regular basis. These products can be used in a variety of ways, including as a snack or as an appetizer. They can also be consumed in restaurants, cafes, bars and other places where people can get a good deal of quality food and drink without having to pay a lot of money for it. This is a problem that can only be solved by reducing the price of beer, said Hiltrud Breyer, a spokesman for the Brewers of Europe (BAE), a trade association in Germany. BBA said it would be \"very, very difficult\" to reduce the cost of a beer when it comes to reducing its shelf life by up to 30 percent.

Steinmeier issued the plea as he began a tour of the region to sponsor a new peace plan aimed at calming the simmering tensions over Georgia's separatist regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. \"This is my appeal to break out of the spiral of violence. A lack of dialogue is not an option for the future,\" he said after meeting with his Georgian counterpart Eka Tkeshelashvili. Steinmeier, who chairs the so-called Group of Friends of the United Nations' Secretary on Georgia, is proposing a three-phase peace plan based on a mutual declaration of non-violence and repatriation of about 25,000 ethnic Georgians expelled from Abkhazia in the 1990s. Negotiations over the status of the two rebel regions, which have enjoyed de facto autonomy since the end of a civil war in 1994, was reserved for the final phase of negotiations. Tkeshelashvili said, \"The plan has great potential for success,\" but added that the most difficult thing would be to convince Russia. Peace talks remain distant The threat of armed conflict in the region last month has given urgency to international pressure for renewed peace talks, but Tbilisi, Moscow and the Russian-backed regions remain far apart on the basic premises for restarting peace talks. Officials in Tbilisi oppose a treaty on the non-use of force without guarantees on the return of refugees and the withdrawal of Russian peacekeeping forces base in the region. Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was skeptical of peace efforts Thursday. \"Signing of a treaty on the return of Georgian refugees to Abkhazia is unreal now, because such a return requires a calm situation,\" Lavrov was quoted as saying by news agency RIA-Novosti. \"We think that signing a treaty on the non-use of force without any preconditions is an absolutely unavoidable first step,\" he added. Experts see little hope for Steinmeier's plan Analysts do not expect anything conclusive from Steinmeier's trip, pointing to intransigence on the part of the Abkhaz President Sergei Bagapsh, who said he would \"not consider the plan.\" \"We are not going to discuss Abkhazia's status with anyone. We are building an independent, democratic state,\" Bagapsh was quoted by Georgian news agencies as saying. Speaking to journalists ahead of the meetings Thursday, Steinmeier admitted: \"We don't have any illusions about simple answers, but we cannot stand by without acting on this conflict. That would be irresponsible.\" From Tbilisi, the German minister is to travel to the Black Sea city of Batumi for talks with Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili and then to Abkhazia on Friday before ending his three-day tour in Moscow.

Germany's foreign minister on Thursday agreed with the head of Georgia, Eka Tkeshelashvili, on a plan to establish a new independent state in the region. \"We have agreed that the new state should be established in a way that will allow for a peaceful transition of power,\" he said in an interview with RIA-Novosti. He added that he was \"deeply concerned\" about the possibility of a return to the Soviet Union, which he described as a \"state of war.\" \"I am deeply concerned that Georgia will not be able to achieve its goal of reunification with Russia. I am very concerned for Georgia's security and stability and I want to make sure that we have a stable, stable and prosperous future for our people and for all the people of our country.\" The new government is expected to be inaugurated on Friday, the same day as the election of President Ilham Aliyev, who is widely seen as one of Putin's closest allies. In the past, Georgians have been living in exile in Russia, where they were forced to flee their homes by Soviet-backed separatists in 1991. Today, they have returned to their homeland, but they are not allowed to return. They are still living on their own, and they do not have access to a government that is willing to accept them as part of their territory. The idea is to create a state with a constitution and a political system that respects the sovereignty of its citizens. It is not possible to do this without the support of Russia and the European Union. That is why we are calling for an end to this conflict. There is a lot of pressure on Russia to stop this. We are also calling on Moscow to step up its support to Georgia in its fight against the separatist forces. This is the first step towards ending the conflict in Georgia. But it is also the last step before the end of this year's peace talks in Moscow. Author: Andreas K\u00fcbler (AP, AFP, dpa, Reuters)"

        "target": "Maldives revokes state of emergency citing improved security situation The president of the Maldives has lifted a state of emergency following an outcry from the international community. The government says the measures are no longer necessary because the security threat has subsided. The government said Tuesday it had rescinded the emergency measures \"with immediate effect\" and that \"all fundamental rights that were suspended have been restored.\" President Yameen Abdul Gayoom declared the state of emergency one week ago after the discovery of a homemade bomb and a stash of weapons near his official residence. The finding followed an explosion on Gayoom's speedboat in September - an incident the government labeled an assassination attempt. The president was not hurt in the blast, but his wife, an aide and a bodyguard were injured. The emergency regulations, intended to be in place for 30 days, gave security forces wide-ranging search and arrest powers, and suspended citizens' basic rights. They drew criticism from former colonial power Britain as well as the United States, the European Union and neighboring Sri Lanka. Reading out a presidential decree revoking the emergency, Attorney General Mohamed Anil said there was no longer a threat to the Indian Ocean atoll nation. He said investigations into the September blast and the recovery of weapons had made good progress. The foreign ministry said a number of people had been arrested. Lawmakers also used the security regulations to fast-track the impeachment of Vice President Ahmed Adeeb, who stands accused of plotting the alleged attempts on the president's life. Impact on tourism Attorney General Anil said pressure from the international community, as well as \"the possible adverse impact on Maldives tourism and the economy,\" had also played a role in ending the state of emergency. Foreign tourists visiting the tropical nation, known for its luxury tourist resorts, palm-fringed beaches and coral reefs, contribute close to a third of the country's gross domestic product. The Maldives has had a rocky road to democracy since holding its first multiparty election in 2008. The country's first democratically elected leader, current opposition chief Mohamed Nasheed, was forced to step down in 2012 after a mutiny by security forces. In March, he was jailed for 13 years on terrorism charges in a trial the United Nations said was illegal. President Gayoom is under intense international pressure to release him. Nasheed's opposition Maldivian Democratic Party welcomed Tuesday's announcement. But said declaring the state of emergency in the first place was a political move designed to stop a rally planned for last week calling for Nasheed's freedom. \"It appears that Yameen is willing to make up threats about the nation's security in order to settle political scores,\" the party said in a statement, referring to the president. nm/kms (AP, AF, Reuters, dpa)",

The move comes a day after the government of the Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) announced that it would lift the emergency imposed on the island nation by the end of this month. \"We are pleased that the authorities have lifted the state emergency,\" MDP leader Mohamed Nasheed said in a statement released by his office on Thursday. He added that \"the government will continue to act in accordance with the law and the constitution.\" The government, which has been in power since 2009, had imposed a three-day emergency in response to criticism of its handling of a corruption scandal involving the president's wife, daughter and son-in-law. It was the first time the country's president had been accused of corruption in public office since he took office in 2009. Opposition parties, including the ruling party, have been calling for an end to the crisis, saying it was \"unacceptable\" that his wife and daughter were involved in corruption and that he should be removed from office. A spokesman for the opposition, Ahmed Adeeb, denied the allegations."

Speaking to German news agency dpa, Heidel confirmed that Meyer turned down an offer of a contract extension earlier in February. \"Max Meyer's agent received an extension offer on January 12 with a deadline of February 15, and informed us on February 15 via email that Max would not be accepting the offer because of the deadline imposed,\" Heidel told dpa. \"We have acknowledged this. For now, we no longer feel beholden to the terms of that offer, but that doesn't mean an extension is impossible either.\" Meyer was reportedly offered an annual salary in the region of \u20ac5.5 million ($6.7 million); it was the second contract he refused, following a less lucrative offer at the end of last season.

Speaking to Sport Bild magazine, meanwhile, Heidel sought to focus on Meyer's more important role at Schalke, his regular game time, arguing it might be in the youngster's best interests to stay at a club that needs him every week. \"[Coach] Domenico Tedesco has formed the team around him in such a way that there is now an ideal spot for Max.

Meyer is one of the most promising young talents in Germany's top-flight, but he has yet to make a concrete decision about his future. The German media reported on Friday that Meyer was set to join Bayern on a three-year contract extension until 2021. German newspaper Sport Bild reported that a deal had been reached between Meyer and his former club Bayern, and the two sides had agreed on the terms of Meyer's contract. It was not immediately clear how long Meyer would stay with the Bavarians, according to German sports daily Kicker, which first reported the news. According to a statement from the team's sporting director, \"Max will stay at Bayern until the end of his contract.\" \"He's a very good player, he's very intelligent and he knows what he wants to do,\" said Max's agent, Christian Goretzka, in an interview published online on Thursday. However, it is not clear whether Meyer will remain at the helm of a club that has struggled in recent years to win the Bundesliga title. In the first half of last season's Bundesliga season, Meyer scored his first goal for his club, a 1-0 win over Schalming. His goal came in a minute after the break, when he took a pass from a German defender and sent the ball into the goal-line. After the game, the German press were quick to point out that it was Meyer who had scored the opening goal, not the other way around. That's when the question came up: How long will Meyer be with Bayern? The question is whether he'll be able to stay on as long as he does. There's been a lot of speculation about whether or not he will return to his old club. But it's not just a matter of time before a decision is made. Max has already made it clear that he doesn't want to be part of Bayern's plans to move on from him."

At least 17 people have been killed and dozens more injured across several island nations in the Caribbean. Irma is expected to be there second major hurricane to make landfall in the United States in less than two weeks. Hurricane Harvey struck Texas last week, killing more than 60 people and displacing roughly 1 million others. In the US territory of Puerto Rico, 1 million people \u2013 nearly one-third of the population \u2013 lost electricity during the storm, said Puerto Rican Governor Ricardo Rossello. \"It will be difficult to estimate how long the power outage will last,\" Rossello said. Later, officials confirmed that at least two people on the island had been killed by the storm's devastation. Two other major storms have developed in the Caribbean, namely Hurricane Jose and Hurricane Katia. Jose was east of the Lesser Antilles with maximum sustained winds of 120 miles person hour (195 kilometers person hour) as a hurricane watch was in effect for Antigua and Barbuda. Jose has followed the same path as Hurricane Irma, and was upgraded to a Category 4 on Friday by the US National Hurricane Center. Katia has remained relatively static, hovering off the coast of Mexico. Florida on edge Florida Governor Rick Scott said 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain were expected after Irma made landfall at the weekend as he urged evacuations during a press conference on Friday. Nearly 700,000 people have been asked to leave Miami and its surrounding areas. \"Today is the day to do the right thing for your family and get inland for safety... Do not ignore evacuation orders.

However, forecasters said there were still concerns that Irma could hit other islands, including Barbuda and Haiti. According to CNN, a number of islands are in danger of becoming uninhabitable due to high winds and torrential rain.

Britain-EU divorce proceedings will probably last about two years. Until then, the status quo must be maintained, German Chancellor Angela Merkel emphasized in her press statement. If she is no longer chancellor after the upcoming parliamentary elections in 2017, then others will have to live with the consequences of Brexit. But that is not what she is actually thinking. It is not coincidental that foreign ministers and government leaders are visiting Berlin in the coming days. They want to discuss how things will continue. Berlin, under Merkel's chancellorship, has become a center of power outside of Brussels. Difficult international politics The Brexit decision has disrupted Europe's equilibrium. Germany has lost an important ally on European issues related to economic growth and budgetary discipline. Now, France presumably will be the next to raise its voice against Maastricht Treaty criteria. If the Netherlands and Denmark also decide to leave the EU, Germany will become isolated, as Eastern Europe is not as tight with Germany as it once was. Poland now plays a key role for the Balkan nations and the Visegrad Group (Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic and Slovakia). And Poland is still annoyed about Merkel's refugee policy. What about Germany's populists? They're giddy with glee as they feel that their anti-establishment policies have been validated. They are teaching potential AfD (Alternative for Germany) voters a lesson: \"Here, have a look: it's possible. There is always an alternative. Vote for us!\" Those are exactly the words that protest voters want to hear. Germany's AfD has forged ties with other right-wing parties in Vienna, Paris, The Hague and London. They are all pursuing a \"European\" plan to gain power. The recent Austrian presidential election was significant, as the populist candidate lost by a very narrow margin; in fact, the final election results are still undecided as they are being contested. The Brexit vote was also triggered by populist powers. Domestically difficult Many populists believe that the stronger populism becomes - no matter where - the more advantages there would be for individual parties of their persuasion. Many would also like to see Donald Trump as US president. That is how AfD may become even stronger in Germany, which also means that political majorities would fluctuate even more. Will there be enough seats after the next election for a Christian Democrat and Green coalition, or will yet another grand coalition made up of Christian Democrats and Social Democrats be formed? Can Angela Merkel change course? Can she counter the trend with a new political model in Europe and Germany? Or do we stand on the edge of a new era, a \"political revolution,\" as the AfD calls it? Until now, Europe has survived attacks on its currency (euro crisis), the principle of peaceful coexistence (Crimea crisis) and its open borders policy (refugee crisis). Merkel deserves credit for defending these values, despite mistakes that have been made along the way. The outcome of the Brexit crisis is, however, still open. Have something to say?

The party's leader, Kay-Alexander Scholz, said on Sunday that she was \"deeply disappointed\" by the EU's decision to allow refugees to enter the bloc. \"I'm deeply disappointed,\" she said in a statement released by her office, adding that the party would not accept refugees from other EU countries. She also said that it would \"not accept asylum seekers who are not of German origin.\" \"We will not allow them to come to our country,\" Merkel said, referring to refugees who have fled their home countries to seek asylum in Germany. Merkel has also been critical of EU leaders, saying that they should not be allowed to impose their will on refugees fleeing war-ravaged Europe. But she also pointed to the fact that many refugees are fleeing persecution in other European countries, such as the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece, Romania, Turkey, and even the United Kingdom, where they have been living for more than a decade. In addition, she pointed out that refugees living in refugee camps in eastern Europe have also fled to Europe in recent years, as have migrants from the Middle East and North Africa fleeing conflict in Syria and Iraq. Germany is the only EU country where refugees have not been able to reach Europe, according to a survey conducted by a German think tank. It also found that a third of refugees had not made it to Germany before the end of last year, compared with the third quarter of 2016, when they arrived in Berlin. German Chancellor Merkel also criticized the \"unacceptable\" treatment of migrants in her country, which she described as a \"disgrace\" to migrants. Her comments came after the German parliament approved a bill to deport migrants who had crossed the Schengen zone, but the bill did not go far enough to prevent them from crossing the border into the US. On the other hand, it was the first time that migrants had been allowed into Germany since the 1990s."

After months of speculation, German Chancellor Angela Merkel reportedly told her fellow Christian Democrats (CDU) in Berlin on Sunday that she is prepared to lead the party into next year's election. An official statement is expected from Merkel at 7 p.m. local time (1800 UTC) on Sunday. The 62-year-old has faced a number of difficulties in recent months, from criticism over her handling of the migration crisis to falling support amid a rise in right-wing populist sentiment. Since taking office in 2005, however, Merkel has also been praised for navigating Europe's largest economy through the financial and eurozone crises. According to an Emnid survey published in the German newspaper \"Bild am Sonntag\" 55 percent of Germans are in favor of Merkel remaining head of the German government for another four years. Thirty-nine percent said they were against her re-election. Sign of stability Should she be elected next September, another full four-year term would put Merkel on a par with her mentor Helmut Kohl who set the post-war record and presided over the Fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. In light of the UK's shock vote to leave the European Union in June and Donald Trump's election last week as US president, Merkel's re-election is likely to be welcomed in many capitals as a sign of stability. During his final visit to Berlin this week, US President Barack Obama said that if he were able to, he would vote for his longtime partner and friend. In an interview with German magazine \"Spiegel\" and broadcaster \"ARD,\" Obama said: \"She has great credibility, and she is willing to fight for those values in a way that is very, very important.\" \"I'm glad that she's there and I think the German people should appreciate her. Certainly, I've appreciated her as a partner.\" Winning back votes With the less that a year until Germany heads to the polls, Merkel's CDU is now turning its efforts to wooing back disenchanted voters who have left the conservative camp to support the right-wing populists, Alternative for Germany (AfD). Formed as a Euro-sceptic party in 2013, the AfD won 4.7 percent of the popular vote in the last federal elections in 2013, just falling short of the 5 percent threshold required to enter the Bundestag - Germany's lower house of parliament.

In a statement released Monday, Merkel's campaign team said that they would seek to win back the support of older voters who had voted for Merkel in 2006 and 2007, when she was Chancellor of Germany's first female prime minister. A spokesman for Chancellor Merkel told the paper that the chancellor would \"not be able to afford to give up her parliamentary majority\" and would instead focus instead on strengthening the country's economic and social security system. She would also have to decide whether she wanted to stay on as Chancellor or to step down as party leader. Read more: German chancellor Merkel says she's ready to take on Donald Trump The chancellor has been criticized by many in her own party for not doing enough to tackle the migrant crisis and for failing to adequately address the need for refugees and migrants to return to Germany. Her party has also been critical of US President Barack Obama, saying that he should not be allowed to impose his will on migrants and refugees fleeing war-ravaged eastern Europe. Last week, German newspaper Bild reported that Trump had called for an end to asylum for migrants in Europe, a move that has angered many Germans who fear for their own safety and security. It said the US president had also called on Merkel not to allow migrants into Germany, citing \"a lack of respect for human rights and the right to self-determination.\" The paper also quoted a former interior minister as saying the president was \"deeply disturbed\" by the growing number of migrants fleeing the war in Syria and Iraq."

        "target": "NFL stars defy Donald Trump's call for boycott Baltimore Ravens and Jacksonsville Jaguars players \"took a knee\" during the national anthem after Trump urged fans to boycott football matches. The kneeling protest, to highlight social injustice, has stepped up a gear. Hundreds of National Football League (NFL) stars protested President Donald Trump's call for fans to boycott the league by refusing to stand for the US national anthem this weekend, starting Sunday's game between the Baltimore Ravens and Jacksonsville Jaguars. A number of other players locked arms in solidarity ahead of the game at Wembley Stadium in London. Jacksonville Jaguars' owner Shahid Khan, who last year donated one million dollars\u00a0(840,000 euros) to the Trump campaign, locked his arms with players - a rare scene, as owners almost never take to the field. US media reported that about 200 players on Sunday sat, knelt or raised their fists in defiance of Trump's comments. In one of the most memorable moments, singer Rico LaVelle took a knee and held up a fist at the last line of the Star Spangled Banner ahead of the game between the Detriot Lions and Atlanta Falcons. The protest came in response to Trump's tweets on Sunday morning urging fans to boycott NFL games to pressure the league into firing or suspending players to kneel in protest during the national anthem. In an early morning tweet, Trump posted: \"If NFL fans refuse to go to games until players stop disrespecting our Flag and Country, you will see change take place fast. Fire or suspend!\" \"NFL attendance and ratings are WAY DOWN. Boring games yes, but many stay away because they love our country. League should back US,\" he added. Later, the president said that his rant \"has nothing to do with race,\" despite the fact that the origins of the protest are to do with police brutality against minorities, especially African Americans. Trump said his comments were instead about \"respect for our country and respect for our flag.\" Trump's spat with US professional sports began at a Republican rally in Alabama on Friday, when the president attacked activist NFL players for kneeling or sitting during the national anthem, labelling them as \"sons of bitches.\" \"Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, 'Get that son of a bitch off the field right now... he is fired'?\" Trump told a crowd of cheering supporters. That day, basketball star Stephen Curry, the top player for California's Golden State Warriors, announced that he would not be attending a traditional White House reception honoring the National Basketball Association champions. The kneeling protest was started by former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick who refused to stand for the anthem back in 2016. Kaepernick's gesture came amid a spate of deadly police shootings of black men and was aimed at drawing more attention to treatment of minorities in the US. However, Kaepernick has since become a free agent, after failing to be signed by a new team for the new NFL season. NFL executives decry Trump's calls Trump also drew the ire of senior NFL executives and team owners. Responding to Trump's tweets, Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti, said he \"100 percent\" supported his players' decision to kneel during the anthem. Robert Kraft, the owner of the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots, who is also a close friend of Trump, said in a statement on Sunday that he was deeply disappointed by the president's comments in Alabama. Kraft defended players' rights to \"peacefully affect social change and raise awareness in a manner that they feel is most impactful,\" and said that sports were a unifying force in the US. \"Our political leaders could learn a lot from the lessons of teamwork and working together toward a common goal,\" he said. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, who has taken much of the heat for Kaepernick's failure to find a new team, was also quick to condemn Trump's comments. Read more: NFL player's refusal to stand for national anthem ignites online controversy \"The NFL and our players are at our best when we help create a sense of unity in our country and our culture,\" Goodell said. \"There is no better example than the amazing response from our clubs and players to the terrible natural disasters we've experienced over the last month.\" Denouncing Trump's remarks, Goodell said: \"Divisive comments like these demonstrate an unfortunate lack of respect for the NFL, our great game and all of our players, and a failure to understand the overwhelming force for good our clubs and players represent in our communities.\" But Trump hit back later on Sunday at a worsening furore, saying the row \"has nothing to do with race.\" Instead, he said: \"This has to do with respect for our country, and respect for our flag.\" At least seven NFL team owners donated at least $1 million each to Trump's presidential campaign last year. They include the owners of the New York Jets, New England Patriots, Dallas Cowboys, Washington Redskins, Jacksonville Jaguars, Houston Texans, Los Angeles Rams and Tampa Bay Buccaneers",
        "generated_story": "Trump's call for NFL players to kneel during anthem sparks online controversy President Donald Trump has called for the National Football League (NFL) to ban players from kneeling during the playing of the national anthem. The NFL, which has been embroiled in controversy over the issue for years, is expected to announce its decision later this week. On Sunday, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell announced that the league would ban all players who protest the anthem from participating in the game. In a statement released on Twitter, the NFL said it was \"deeply disappointed\" by the decision. \"The NFL is a great organization, and we are proud to be a part of it,\" the statement said. However, it did not say whether the ban would be lifted. Trump's comments came after the Ravens' owner, Robert Kraft, said on Sunday that he would not allow the protests to take place at the team's training facility in London. He also said that NFL owners should not be allowed to impose fines on players for protesting during a game, saying it would \"violate the rule of law.\" The statement came a day after Trump said he had \"no intention\" of changing the rules at his inauguration ceremony in Washington, D.C. According to the Associated Press, Trump made the comments in an interview with the website TMZ.com published a video in which he said the players should stand \"in solidarity\" with Kaepernick, who was kneeling in protest of President Barack Obama's travel ban on Muslims entering the U.S. During the Super Bowl, President Trump called on NFL teams to \"stand up and show respect for our flag.\" In the video, he is seen saying, \"We have to stand up for what we believe in,\" referring to Kaepernick's protest against the Obama administration's policies on immigration and the treatment of African-Americans in detention centers. It is unclear whether Trump was referring specifically to Trump, but it appears to have been directed at those who have criticized the president's stance on the matter. Twitter users have taken to social media to express their support for Trump."

Greece had previously voiced reservations about the proposal. The proposed mission to be discussed at a NATO defense ministers meeting in Brussels on Thursday comes days after German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutolgu said they would raise the issue of refugees with the Alliance. According to a Reuters report citing a senior German official, initially reticent Greece has now given the green light for the operation, which could see NATO assets deployed in the Aegean in a mostly intelligence and reconnaissance role. Under the proposal, which would need to be approved by Alliance members, NATO maritime assets would provide information to national coastguards and the EU border agency Frontex to combat illegal smugglers using rickety boats to bring migrants to Europe. Turkey would then take back the refugees, as envisioned as part of a 3 billion-euro ($3.2 billion) EU-Turkey deal agreed to last year. According to German sources, the mission would not be similar to the NATO mission in the Mediterranean intercepting migrant boats making the dangerous run from Libya to Italy. However, NATO ships could intervene in emergency situations to save passengers. \"It is not NATO's remit to push back or stop refugee boats,\" the official told Reuters. The mission would use assets from the Alliance's standing naval group, a permanent reaction force deployed in the Mediterranean. The naval group's current flagship is the German combat support ship \"Bonn.\" Denmark has already said it would provide additional ships to the mission, according to the official. However, it is unclear whether NATO members will approve the mission which may fall outside the bounds of the Alliance's mandate. Complicating matters is a long-running maritime dispute between Greece and Turkey over sovereignty in the Aegean, where the two NATO members' jets regularly engage in dogfights. Turkey has taken in more than 2.5 million Syrian refugees, and is a major transit point for migrants from Asia and Africa. More than a million migrants and refugees reached Europe last year, many making the dangerous boat journey from Turkey to Greece by boat. So far this year, more than 340 have perished in the cold waters trying to reach Europe. cw/msh (AFP, dpa, Reuters)",

The new force, which is based in Brussels, is part of a NATO-led task force that will be deployed in Greece, Cyprus, Turkey, Greece and Cyprus. It is the first of its kind in Europe and is expected to be operational by the end of the year. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutolgu announced on Thursday that they would join forces to fight the illegal migrant trade. \"We are going to work together to tackle this problem,\" Merkel said at a news conference in Berlin. She added that the new mission would be based on cooperation between the EU and Turkey. Turkey and Greece have agreed to cooperate on the mission, but Turkey has yet to agree on an exact date for the deployment. Germany, however, said it would cooperate with Turkey in its fight against the migrants, adding that it was \"very encouraging\" to see Germany's cooperation with Ankara in this area. However, Germany is not ready to commit itself to the task, saying it is too early to say whether it will cooperate fully or not. Merkel's comments came as Turkey's interior minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, expressed concern about the situation in Syria and called on EU member states to take action. Erdogan also said that Turkey should take steps to ensure the safety of Syrian refugees, who have fled the country in recent months. He also called for Turkey to step up its anti-Islamic State (ISI) campaign against Syrian rebels. In a statement released Thursday, Erdogan said Turkey would \"not hesitate to use its military force against any terrorist organization.\" The Turkish military said the operation would take place \"in coordination with NATO and its partners in Turkey.\" Turkey is also planning to deploy a naval ship to assist the Turkish coast guard in combating the influx of refugees and migrants from Syria, according to Turkish media reports. Turkish officials have said they expect the ships to carry out their duties in accordance with Turkish law."

Meanwhile, the death toll in Gaza continues to rise. Medics on Monday said the number of Palestinian deaths in Gaza has risen to more than 501 since fighting intensified on Jul 8. Most of the dead are civilians. On the Israeli side, 13 soldiers were killed inside Gaza on Sunday, raising the number of soldiers killed since a ground operation began late on Thursday to 18. Two Israeli civilians also died in mortar and rocket attacks. The Israeli army said that more than 10 militants from Gaza were shot dead on Monday after infiltrating southern Israel. According to army spokespeople, two squads of militants were killed after tunneling into Israel. Israel's UN ambassador Ron Prosor, meanwhile, denied a claim by Hamas that an Israeli soldier had been kidnapped by the Islamist group, saying: \"Those rumurs are untrue.\" US President Barack Obama expressed concern about the rising death toll of civilians in a telephone call Sunday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, according to a White House statement.

He also said he hoped to reach an agreement with Abbas by the end of this year, but added that it was too early to say whether the truce would be reached in time for peace talks to begin. Israel, meanwhile, has called on Abbas and Abbas to agree to an end to the fighting. Abbas has rejected the idea, saying it would \"violate international law.\" The Palestinians, however, have rejected Kerry's proposal. They have called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, a move that would allow Israel to resume its blockade of Gaza and allow the Palestinians to return to their self-styled \"axis of evil.\" Kerry, who is visiting Egypt for the first time since taking office in January, said the US was willing to work with the Egyptian government to broker a truce. But he also stressed the need for \"a ceasefire\" between Hamas and Israel in order to prevent further escalation of violence.

However, Israel's military chief, Avigdor Lieberman, told reporters on Wednesday that the army would continue to fight alongside the Palestinian side.

        "target": "A borderline war The crisis in Syria is in danger of drawing in neighboring countries. Despite the Syrian government's immediate apology, the shelling on the Turkish border has led to concerns about possible escalation. These weren't the first incidents on the Syrian-Turkish border, but the fact that several people on the Turkish side were killed by Syrian shells on Wednesday (03.10.2012) has brought the conflict between the two countries to a new level. It has led the Turkish military to retaliate for the first time. Several people were killed when Turkey shelled Syrian territory. But neither Turkey, which is a member of NATO, nor Syria would benefit from a broader conflict. An adviser to the Turkish president tweeted, \"Turkey has no interest in a war with Syria.\" Volker Perthes, director of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs in Berlin, agrees: \"Assad has no interest in an escalation,\" he told DW. \"That can be seen from the fact that the Syrian information minister apologized and expressed his regret over the victims immediately after the attack on Turkish territory.\" Perthes doesn't think it's likely that the Syrian President, Bashar Assad, wants to provoke Turkey to intervene in Syria. \"That would only accelerate the fall of his regime,\" he said. It's not yet clear who was responsible for the shelling. According to Syria's ally, Russia, it was a \"tragic accident.\" Relationship damaged The armed incidents on the Syrian-Turkish border have been going on for months. According to Amnesty International, some 300,000 Syrians have left their country since the start of the uprising against Assad, and many of them have fled to Turkey. The relationship between the two countries, which used to be close, has deteriorated dramatically, and the Turkish government is now openly supporting the Syrian opposition. \"Turkey is itself a player in the Syrian conflict,\" said Perthes. \"It provides shelter for many refugees and it's through Turkey that supplies come for the opposition.\" NATO has lined up behind Turkey and told Syria to end its \"flagrant violations of international law.\" Call for 'great discretion' The German chancellor, Angel Merkel, has also positioned herself alongside Turkey. \"We call on all parties to show great discretion,\" she said in Berlin. The foreign minister, Guido Westerwelle, declared that everything must be done to deescalate the situation, so that the Syrian conflict did not turn into a conflagration in the region. Indeed, the Syrian crisis is not only spreading to Turkey, but also to Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon. According to Perthes, \"The neighboring countries are partly victims and partly instigators. Jordan too has taken in refugees and supplies the rebels. On the other hand, Iraq has tended to support the government of Bashar Assad.\" Even so, he said, all the neighboring countries had an interest in ensuring the conflict was confined to Syria. Appeal to the international community But the number of Syrian refugees is rising by the day. Ruth J\u00fcttner, a Middle East expert with Amnesty International, believes this will continue in future months. \"It's important that the countries bordering on Syria are supported by the international community in providing accommodation, medical and psychological care and schooling for children,\" she told DW. It's an appeal she directs especially to European countries. The shelling on the Syrian-Turkish border has made it more likely that there will be armed conflict between Syria and its neighbors. According to Perthes, \"It's probably the case that political resistance in Turkey to intervention in Syria is decreasing right now.\"",

Although they sent no representatives to Switzerland, Islamists have agreed to halt the fighting.

Despite not attending the UN-brokered meeting, the militias have agreed to \"a ceasefire on all fronts,\" according to a statement issued by Islamist group Fajr Libya (Libya Dawn). The only condition is that \"the other parties respect the truce.\" The announcement came hours after the United Nations declared that Libya's warring factions had agreed to a roadmap for forming a unity government. Nearly four years after a NATO-backed revolt saw Moammar Gadhafi removed from power, two rival governments each backed by different groups of militias have plunged the country back into chaos and threatened all-out civil war. After the elected government of Prime Minister Abdullah al-Thinni was forced out of Tripoli by Libya Dawn, it was forced to move to the far eastern city of Tobruk while Libya Dawn reinstated the old parliament known as the GNC. The fighting and violence has displaced hundreds of thousands of civilians, left hundreds killed and thousands wounded. Most foreign diplomats fled the country and shut their embassies last year. The Tobruk government, as well as a few other factions who favor a peaceful resolution, came to Geneva to work on \"confidence-building measures,\" which includes the release of detainees from both sides, opening closed ports and securing safe freedom of movement around the country. es/bw (AP, AFP, Reuters)",

The ceasefire was announced on Tuesday after talks between pro-Gaddafi rebels and loyalist militias broke down following a failed attempt to oust Moammar Gadhafi from power last month. \"We have agreed to a ceasefire, and we are ready to resume negotiations,\" said Abdullah al-Thinni, a spokesman for the rebel group. He added that he was \"confident that we would be able to continue the peace process.\" The truce, which began on Monday, was agreed by a group of rebel groups, including the former regime's loyalists, as well as the government of former Prime Minister Ali Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, who was ousted in a 2011 uprising that killed more than 250,000 people. It was the first ceasefire since the end of the civil war in 2011, when the regime was toppled by troops loyal to the then-governor of Tripoli. In the days that followed, there were no major breakthroughs in fighting between the rival factions, but there was progress in some areas. There was also a breakthrough in other areas, such as in eastern Libya, where a truce was declared on Sunday. But there is still a long way to go before the ceasefire can be reached, according to an official statement from the Libyan government. At the same time, it is not clear how long the truce will last, given the fact that it has not yet been ratified by UN Security Council resolution 2334 (2015). The UN has called for a new round of talks to be held in Geneva, Switzerland, on Wednesday.

        "target": "France's conservatives: Combating the National Front with a swing to the right A staunch conservative is joining the race for the French presidency. Republican candidate Francois Fillon could turn into a big problem for right-wing extremist Marine Le Pen's National Front. France's Republicans are moving to the right: by choosing Francois Fillon, voters nominated a presidential candidate who has a reputation as a staunch conservative. The former prime minister has already announced that he intends to refocus politics with the traditional family in mind. Fillon takes a dim view of homosexual couples adopting children. He wants to introduce a cap on the number of refugees allowed into France, he intends to make it harder for foreign nationals to access the social welfare system, and he wants to put Muslim communities and mosques under government control. In addition, Fillon advocates a renationalization of school curricula. Fillon makes gains in FN territory Fillon's agenda could turn out to be a problem for the \"National Front\" (FN). The 62-year-old appeals to similar sentiments as the right-wing party's base: concern about foreign domination and loss of identity, fear of terrorism and crime. \"For a long time, FN was the only political force that addressed those fears,\" said Henrik Uterwedde of the German-French Institute (dfi) in Ludwigsburg. \"Now a politician has arrived on the scene who addresses those fears using a different language and makes them a political offer.\" In rural, Catholic France especially, where traditions still matter a great deal, the avowed Catholic Fillon strikes a chord with his proposals pertaining to family and society policies. He receives support from traditional Catholic groups who, for years, have been able to mobilize crowds for demonstrations against gay marriage. During the intraparty election campaign, Fillon predominantly traveled to France's villages and small towns - regions which FN leader Marine Le Pen had labeled the \"forgotten France,\" regarding herself as their foremost lobbyist. \"Fillon has made gains in an environment that is also canvassed by Le Pen,\" Andreas Jung, Chairman of the Bundestag's German-French parliamentary group, told German broadcaster rbb-Inforadio. \"He does not represent the lofty levels of Parisian politics, but rather provincial entrenchment. Fillon is committed to traditional values, like the family. Therefore, he may not only be capable of defeating Le Pen, but also of taking the lead during the first ballot.\" 'Most dangerous candidate for FN' Consequently, the FN camp is less than enthusiastic about the conservative's candidacy. \"Because of Fillon, we now have a strategy problem,\" Marion Marechal Le Pen, the FN leader's niece, recently told journalists. \"He is the most dangerous candidate for the National Front.\" Pollsters' findings appear to support that statement. Recent surveys establish Fillon as the current favorite in the French presidential election scheduled for next May. However, Fillon's election is not a foregone conclusion. By denouncing the conservative candidate as a member of the establishment, FN tries to win over those who are frustrated with politics and politicians in general. There is persistent opposition against his economic-liberal plans in particular. Fillon wants to abolish the 35-hour working week and raise the retirement age to 65 years. In addition, he wants to cut 500,000 jobs in the public sector and reform industrial law. Fillon is known as an admirer of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. \"Issues pertaining to liberal economic policy have always been heavily contested in France,\" said Uterwedde. \"Fillon's adversaries have already taken up their positions, criticizing what, in France, is called 'ultra-liberalism.'\" That was one of the nastiest words in French politics, he added. An offer for the left Fillon wants to raise VAT by 2 percent. This would predominantly hurt low-income households. Exactly that clientele, however, is wooed by FN with a program that is regarded as rather left-wing. The right-wing extremists are on a clear anti-globalization course, intending to seal off the French economy against foreign countries and exit from the European Union. The party is already trying to present Fillon as a symbol of anarchic, ultra-liberal capitalism. \"Francois Fillon will even go beyond EU demands for austerity and liberalism,\" David Rachline, Marine Le Pen's election campaign manager, wrote on Twitter. According to current polls, it is very likely that Fillon will have to face Marine Le Pen in a runoff election in May. The main hazard for the Republican candidate: his economic-liberal course could deter left-wing voters from choosing the conservative in order to avert Le Pen. \"Francois Fillon will have to start making offers, also to those voters who are closer to the center and more moderate,\" said France expert Uterwedde. \"And he will, prior to the runoff election at the latest, have to make offers to left-wing voters - without changing his original course.\"",
        "generated_story": "Fillon is the most dangerous candidate for French presidential election French President Francois Fillon has been declared the \"most dangerous\" candidate in the country's presidential race. The conservative candidate is expected to win the first round of voting on Sunday. French opposition leader Marine Le Pen has emerged as the leading contender in Sunday's runoff election, ahead of the far-right National Front (FN) presidential candidate, who faces a tough re-election battle with Marine le Pen on Saturday. \"The FN is a very dangerous party,\" said Henrik Uterwedde, a professor of political science at the German-French Institute in Ludwigsburg, near the French capital. He added that the FN's candidate would be a \"dangerous candidate\" because he would not be able to compete with the right-of-center candidate. In an interview with DW, he said: \"It's a dangerous, dangerous and dangerous campaign, and it's not going to go away.\" \"I think it will take a long time to get used to it,\" he added, referring to the fact that his party is far more conservative than his own party. Fonseca, the party's parliamentary leader, said he was \"very concerned\" about the situation in France, adding that he had \"no idea\" what was going on in his country, which has a population of 1.5 million. But he also pointed out that it was not just the left that was at fault, but also the way in which the Left and the Republican parties were playing out the last few weeks. It was also clear from the interview that Foulot was a danger to himself and others, as well as to his reputation as a risk-averse politician who is not afraid to stand up for what he believes in. And that's exactly what happened to him, according to a poll conducted by a German think-tank called rbb-Inforadio. That's why he won the election in a landslide, with a margin of victory of more than 10 percentage points over the center-left Socialists (SPD) and Greens (CDU). \"He's got a lot of experience in politics and he knows how to deal with people who don't agree with him,\" the pollster, Andreas Jung, told DW."

        "target": "Berlin court rules Google Street View is legal in Germany A Berlin court has ruled that Google Street View is legal. But that doesn't mean the lawsuits will end, legal scholars say. A Berlin court has ruled that Google Street View is, in fact, legal in Germany. Last Tuesday, the Berlin State Supreme Court (Kammergericht) announced its decision in a court case from late last year, in which a woman had sued Google, fearing that photos of her, her family and the front of her house would be posted on Google Street View and would thus violate her property and privacy rights. The court ruled that it is legal to take photographs from street level, rejecting her argument that Google was trying to take unauthorized pictures. Part of her argument rested on the fact that Google used cameras mounted at three meters (9.84 feet) high, which could see over her two-meter-high hedge. However, the court did not find this argument convincing, given that the photographs were taken from the street, and not the sidewalk. Furthermore, because Google automatically blurs faces and license plates and did allow Germans to opt-out of the service to have their house obfuscated as well, the court did not find any potential violations. This is the first high-level court ruling, which cannot be appealed any further, regarding Street View since the service debuted in Germany at the end of last year. An ongoing debate Since Google announced plans to launch Street View in Germany last summer, debate around the service has become heated, with some politicians trying to stop it at every turn, while German Chancellor Angela Merkel famously said that she would not remove her house from Street View. In November 2010, the company announced that 244,000 German residents in the 20 cities had chosen to opt out of Street View - less than three percent of residents. However, in Germany and everywhere else, the company also allows people to report abuse, inaccuracies or request that something be blurred using an online tool. \"Our job is to develop services that respect these cultural differences,\" Peter Fleischer, Google's global privacy counsel told Deutsche Welle in November 2010. \"We try to anticipate them. We're all internationally-minded people ourselves. We try to guess how people will react to them. But a lot of these services are new and have never been on the market before, so we learn and we adapt as we go along.\" A 'landmark decision' European legal experts called the Berlin ruling a \"landmark decision,\" saying that this would now become part of German case law regarding property rights. \"Yes, other people are now warned: Don't sue Google simply claiming that Google Street View violates personality [or] property rights,\" wrote Thomas H\u00f6ren, a professor of media and communications law at the University of M\u00fcnster, in an e-mail sent to Deutsche Welle. But, he also warned that this decision was very narrow, focusing on the issue of property rights, and not on the larger issues of data protection from Google. \"The problem of Google Street View - to be honest - has never been a problem of personality rights or property rights, but the enormous risk of personal data compilations in cases where people use Google Street View for compiling personal profiles (such as building insurance companies; future employees, et cetera),\" he added. \"And this risk has not been considered by the Berlin courts.\" Similarly, Viktor Mayer-Sch\u00f6nberger, a professor at the Oxford Internet Institute, agreed that this case was \"limited in scope,\" adding in an e-mail, \"The plaintiff never alleged an actual invasion of privacy, just a potential one.\" Author: Cyrus Farivar Editor: Nancy Isenson",

The decision marks the first time a German court has ruled in favor of the search giant's search engine. A decision by the Berlin State Supreme Court on Thursday will be the latest in a series of landmark decisions on the use of search engines in German cities. In a landmark ruling, the court said that Google should be allowed to sell its search-engine-based services to the public. \"The decision is a victory for Google,\" said Peter Fleischer, head of Germany's Federal Court of Appeals in Berlin, adding that the decision was \"an important step forward in Google's fight against censorship.\" The court's decision came a day after German Prime Minister Angela Merkel's government announced that it would no longer allow Google search results to be published on its website. Google, however, has said it will continue to do so until the end of this year. Read more: Google searches for the most popular search terms Google has to offer German citizens The ruling comes a year after the company announced it was ending its partnership with Google in order to improve its services. It also marks a major step towards the goal of reducing the number of searches by one-third, according to a report by German news agency dpa. That is, if Google can find a way to make its products more accessible to German consumers, it could become the world's largest search company. But it's not just Google that is at the center of these developments. There is also the case of Google Maps, for example, which was launched in 2007 and is now available in more than 1.5 million homes across Germany. This is the second time in less than two years that a Google-owned mapping company has launched a mapping service for its users. According to Deutsche Welle (dpa, AFP) the move is part of a broader effort by Google and other search companies to streamline their search operations and improve the quality of their products. However, there are still some hurdles to overcome, such as the fact that there is still a lot of time to go before Google is able to launch a product that can be used to help users find their way around the web. Also, Google does not have the resources to compete with Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Spotify, Netflix, Amazon, Apple, and Google Play. What's more, most people don't even know about Facebook. They're not even aware that Facebook has a social media presence, so they can't see what's going on in their lives. And that's a big problem, because Facebook is not the only company that has an active social network. You can see it on their website, but it doesn't have a Facebook account, or a Twitter account.

        "target": "UK lawmakers propose jail sentences for reckless bankers A British parliamentary commission has completed its work on the overhaul of the domestic banking sector. Among other things, it proposed jail terms for bankers displaying grave malpractice and causing huge damage. Members of the UK's Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards agreed Wednesday that Britain needed a radical overhaul of its scandal-hit lenders. The panel, which was mostly composed of lawmakers, concluded in its final report that senior bankers must be made personally responsible for malpractice through the introduction of a new criminal offence of reckless misconduct. It would carry a prison sentence. The reputation of the country's banking sector had been damaged in recent years by a string of scandals, including Libor rate-rigging, credit insurance mis-selling and a controversy over staff behavior and bonuses in the run-up to the 2008 global financial crisis. The level of malpractice had been \"shocking and widespread,\" said the commission's chairman, Conservative party lawmaker Andrew Tyrie. RBS cut in two? \"Taxpayers and customers have lost out, and the economy has suffered,\" the 500-page report said. \"Under our recommendations, senior bankers who seriously damage their banks or put taxpayers' money at risk can expect to be fined, banned from the industry or in the worst cases go to jail.\" The commission called for bankers to sign up to a new code of conduct under which all key responsibilities within a bank would be assigned to specific senior officials who would be held responsible. The panel also proposed that more remuneration for bankers should be deferred for longer periods of up to ten years in order to \"reflect the longer run balance between business risks and rewards.\" The commission recommended that the government consider splitting the state-rescued Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) into a good bank and a bad one mopping up toxic assets. The report was published ahead of a key speech by Finance Minister George Osborne on his bank reform plans. hg/ipj (AFP, Reuters)",

It said the allegations were \"inaccurate\" and that there was no evidence to support them. But the commission also said that it had \"grave concerns\" about the financial industry's ability to compete with other financial institutions, such as banks, insurance companies and financial services companies, and the ability of banks to lend money to each other without having to prove that they are trustworthy and trustworthy.\" \"We have to be careful what we say, we don't say that we are going to give up on banks,\" the report said, adding that \"it's a very serious problem and we need to do more to ensure that banks are transparent and transparent in their dealings with customers,\" it said. A spokesman for the committee said: \"This report is based on a number of recommendations made by our independent experts, including the findings of a parliamentary commission on banking standards, a review of financial regulations and an assessment of how banks should behave in relation to their customers. We are very concerned that this report will be used as a basis for further investigations into the activities of these banks and their activities.\" It also pointed out that some banks in Britain have been accused of being involved in financial crime, with the RBS being one of them, while other banks have denied any involvement in any such crime. In a statement released on its website, BBS said \"there is no doubt that these allegations are true, but we do not know for certain whether they have any basis in fact.\" A spokesperson for Barclays told the news agency AFP that a \"significant number\" of its customers were victims of bank fraud."

But a leading think tank has warned against giving raises too soon. Germany's foreign minister and deputy chancellor, Guido Westerwelle, has added his support to comments made by Economics Minster Rainer Bruederle about increased wages for German workers. \"When the economy grows and this growth is substantial and sustainable, then the benefits of this upswing should be felt by the people who worked so hard for it,\" Westerwelle told the Hamburger Abendblatt newspaper in an interview. Westerwelle heads the free-market liberal FDP, which shares power with Chancellor Merkel's Christian coalition. Earlier this week, Bruederle, also an FDP member, said in light of Germany's currently growing economy, those economic gains should trickle down to employees in the form of higher wages. Merkel, who is also the head of the Christian Democratic Union, supported Bruederle's idea. \"That is something the chancellor sees the same way, letter for letter,\" said Merkel's spokesman, Steffen Seibert. Not so fast Earlier this week, analysts predicted growth of 3.5 percent this year and 2 percent in 2011. Germany's five leading economic think tanks also predicted that the number of unemployed would fall below 3 million next year, the lowest level since 1992. Despite the current rosy outlook for the German economy, not everyone is convinced that a growing economy should inevitably lead to higher wages. The president of the German Institute for Economic Research, Klaus Zimmermann, warned against reacting too quickly. \"I can't support the idea of a general wage increase, I think it is too dangerous,\" Zimmermann said in an interview with the Handelsblatt newspaper. Zimmermann wasn't opposed to the idea of raising wages, but said he was against across-the-board increases for all sectors and pointed out that not every industry is benefitting the same from the growing economy. \"We can't forget that the German economy did not resort to mass lay-offs when it wasn't going so well last year,\" Zimmermann said.

The previous day, the 56-year-old leader openly accused Germany and neighboring Poland of planning a coup against him. \"There were [in Germany and Poland] plans worked out for an overthrow of the constitutional order,\" Lukashenko said in the Belarusian capital, Minsk, on Thursday. \"This is not an invention of our intelligence agencies.\" Lukashenko, who came to power in 1994, was re-elected last month with 80 percent of the vote in what the opposition and international monitors said was a rigged election. Relations between the reclusive Belarusian government and the West have been strained ever since.

A wide-reaching crackdown against the regime's opponents followed Lukashenko's re-election. Hundreds of his critics were arrested and dozens threatened with long-term jail sentences. Poland also dismissed the accusations as absurd and said that relations with Minsk would not be normalized unless all political prisoners were released. Sanctions threat The situation in Belarus pushed the European Union to adopt a resolution on Thursday in support of economic sanctions against the country. The threats earned a sharp rebuke from Lukashenko, who promised the \"hardest possible reaction\" should the bloc impose sanctions against his country. At the same time, the Belarusian prime minister, Mikhail Myasnikovich, travelled to Moscow in a effort to shore up Russian support for Minsk during its standoff with the EU. That meeting ended with a Russian promise not to impose its own set of sanctions on Belarus over an unrelated spat over oil exports and a commitment to resume a nuclear power plant project shelved after the 1986 Chernobyl disaster.

Lack of evidence India says it is not bound by the UN convention on refugees as it is not a signatory to the accord, but human rights activists disagree. \"The principle of non return of a person to a place where he will be executed or tortured has become a principle of customary international law which India follows,\" Gonsalves told DW. \"And it has attained the status of 'jus cogens,' which is a principle of law that no country can say is not applicable to it, such as torture and genocide.\" In a communication sent to all states in August, the Home Ministry [interior ministry] said the illegal migrants were more susceptible to terrorist recruitment efforts. But an investigation by Indian broadcaster NDTV found \"little evidence of the government claim.\" The investigation that was carried out at major Rohingya settlements in the country showed little involvement in criminal wrongdoing by the refugees. Lack of any evidence to support the government claim has led to speculations that the Rohingya were being targeted for their religion by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu-nationalist government. \"It is really unfortunate that the government is going back on its commitment to refugees which it has reiterated several times in the past merely because these Rohingyas are Muslims,\" said lawyer Prashant Bhushan, who filed the plea on behalf of two Rohingya men. \"I mean this is clearly a case of religious discrimination and an attempt to arouse a sort of feeling of... an anti-Muslim feeling or try and communalise the situation,\" he told reporters outside the courthouse. The UN's human rights chief last week deplored Indian government's move to deport Rohingya refugees. \"India cannot carry out collective expulsions, or return people to a place where they risk torture or other serious violations,\" Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein said. The Rohingya are an Indo-Aryan people, the vast majority of whom are Muslims. They usually migrate to India through a rather porous border to escape persecution in their native Rakhine state in Myanmar, where they have been denied citizenship rights. They are viewed by the local authorities as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. Myanmar's Buddhist majority is often accused of subjecting them to discrimination and violence.

Hundreds of people, the majority of them Rohingya, have been killed in the violence that has seen many homes destroyed and several villages burned down. Myanmar's government maintains the crackdown is part of a counter-terrorism drive, while the UN's al-Hussein has said that it \"seems a textbook example of ethnic cleansing.\"",
        "generated_story": "India says Rohingyas pose 'erious threat' to India India's interior ministry has issued a statement saying the Rohingya are a'serious threat to the security of our country.' The statement comes as the country's top court in the Indian state of Rakhine has ruled that the group should be allowed to return to their homes. The Supreme Court, however, said it was unable to rule out the possibility of a return of the refugees. India, which has been embroiled in a bitter row with Myanmar over its treatment of Rohingya Muslims, has called for an end to violence against the minority community in Myanmar. \"We are calling on the government of India to take decisive action against these people,\" said the interior minister, Prashant Bhushan, in an interview with DW. He added that India would continue to work closely with the Myanmar government in its fight against terrorism, adding that \"it is our responsibility to protect the lives of all those who have been persecuted in this country.\" The Indian government has also said that it will continue its efforts to provide security to Rohingya refugees living in India. However, India has yet to decide on whether to allow them back into its country. Last week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that he would not allow any Rohingya to enter India until the end of this year. Earlier this month, the UN Security Council unanimously approved a resolution calling for a ceasefire between Myanmar and Rohingya Muslim minority communities. In a move that is seen as an attempt to ease tensions between the two countries, Modi said on Thursday that Myanmar was willing to cooperate with India in resolving the crisis. But India did not immediately respond to a request by DW for comment. Indian Foreign Minister Rajnath Singh, who was in Jammu and Kashmir at the time, told the news agency that his government was \"deeply concerned\" about the situation in Rohingya-majority Myanmar, where the majority of Muslims have fled to neighboring Bangladesh. Singh said he was aware of reports that Rohingya were being held in camps near the border with Bangladesh, but he had not seen any evidence to substantiate the allegations. According to Indian media, Singh's comments were made in response to an inquiry by the International Criminal Court (ICC) in New Delhi."

Monday's announcement by Pat McQuaid, the president of the International Cycling Union, ratified recommendations in an October report from the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), which ordered Armstrong's Tour de France titles be wiped out. \"Lance Armstrong has no place in cycling,\" said McQuaid. Addressing his remarks to cyclists, McQuaid said the fight against doping was his priority. \"UCI is listening and is on your side. We\u2019ve come too far in the fight against doping to return to our past. Cycling has a future and something like this must not happen again.\" The scathing USADA report included testimony from 11 former teammates, accusing Armstrong of running the \"most sophisticated\" doping program in the sport's history. The USADA said it had collected evidence to prove the seven-time Tour de France winner had engaged in the biggest doping conspiracy to date. Effect on cycling and sponsorship Monday's decision comes as the sport of cycling reels from Armstrong's well-documented fall from grace. Organizers of the Tour de France will be trying to move on from the scandal as the race prepares to celebrate its centenary next year. Sponsors have been deserting Armstrong and the sport in general. Last week, Nike - one of Armstrong's main corporate sponsors - said it was terminating its relationship with the cyclist and accused him of deception. Trek, the company that made the bicycles Armstrong rode to seven titles, announced on the same day it would terminate its sponsorship contract - as did the beer maker Anheuser-Busch. The Dutch institution Rabobank ended its association with professional cycling after the doping allegations came to light, leaving 17 riders in need of a sponsor. Last week Armstrong also announced he would step down from his own charity, the Lance Armstrong Foundation, also known as Livestrong, a move believed to have been intended to limit the damage to the organization from the USADA report. Armstrong appears Lance Armstrong spoke briefly to thousands of riders in Texas at a benefit organized by his charity, the day before UCI's decision. \"I've been better, but I've also been worse,\" he said. \"Obviously it has been an interesting and difficult couple of weeks.\" jr/rc (Reuters, AFP, AP)",

Armstrong, who was cycling's most successful cyclist in the 1990s and 2000s, is the latest cyclist to be stripped from his titles after a doping scandal broke out at the end of last year's Tour of France. The IOC said on Thursday that Armstrong had violated the organization's anti-doping rules and that he had been banned from cycling for three years. \"He has not been allowed to compete in any of the major sporting events,\" IOC president Pat McQuaid said at a press conference in New York, adding that the decision was made \"in the interest of transparency and accountability.\" \"The IOC's decision is a clear signal that Lance is no longer in a position to play a role in cycling,\" he said. A spokesman for Armstrong's foundation, the Armstrong Foundation, said in an email that \"the IOC is aware of Lance's actions and will continue to work with him to make sure he is fully accountable for his actions.\" Armstrong was also barred from competing in all major cycling events, including the Tour and the Grand Prix de l'Aquitaine, which he won in 2004. He was banned for life in 2006 for failing to register as a professional cyclist. In 2008, Armstrong became the youngest cyclist ever to win a Grand Tour title. Since then, he has competed in more than 100 races and has won a total of 15 Grand Tours. His most recent victories came in 2009 and 2010, when he was the world record holder for the most Tour wins won by an American cyclist, Michael Schumacher, and in 2011, in France, with the record-holder, Jacques Anquetil, being the only other American to have won three Tour titles in his career. Lance has also won two World Cup titles, one in 2010 and one more in 2012. But he's also been accused of doping in several other sports, such as cycling, as well as in 2008 and 2009. At the time of Armstrong\u2019s death in 2005, his son Lance was one of only three cyclists to ever win the title, along with two other cyclists. After Armstrong died in 2007, it was unclear whether he would be able to return to the sport."

President Obama vowed to nominate a successor 'in due time,' despite political opposition. The 79-year old justice died in his sleep, presumably of natural causes, local media reported on Saturday. Scalia was visiting Texas for a hunting trip, and his body was discovered after he failed to appear for breakfast in the resort where he was staying. US President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama extended \"their deepest condolences to Justice Scalia's family,\" White House deputy spokesman Eric Schultz said. Texas Governor Greg Abbott described the conservative justice as a \"man of God, a patriot and an unwavering defender of the written Constitution and the rule of law.\" \"He was the solid rock who turned away so many attempts to depart from and distort the Constitution. His fierce loyalty to the Constitution set an unmatched example, not just for judges and lawyers, but for all Americans,\" Abbot said. Battle for the empty seat His passing is likely to open a new political front between President Barack Obama and the Republican Party, as Scalia's replacement could shift the composition of the court towards a more liberal persuasion. Several Republican lawmakers have already urged Obama to leave the decision to the next president who will be voted in later this year. \"The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court justice,\" Senate Republican majority leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement, referring to the upcoming November general election. \"Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president,\" McConnell concluded. President Obama, however, said he would fulfill his constitutional duty and nominate Scalia's successor \"in due time.\" \"These are responsibilities I take seriously, and so should everyone. They are bigger than any one party,\" he said. Decades of controversy Scalia joined the Supreme Court in 1986, becoming the first Italian-American to serve in the top judicial body. He was nominated by US President Ronald Reagan. Throughout his long carrier, Scalia voted in favor of privacy and protecting defendants' rights, but also against legalizing abortion, same-sex marriage and gun control. He also drew public attention for his theatrical flair and sharpness of tongue, as well as his alleged unwillingness to compromise. In June last year, the nine-person Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage with a five-to-four vote. Scalia, who was in the minority, commented he would \"hide my head in a bag\" if his own name were associated with the decision.

He had been serving a life sentence of life in prison for the murder of his wife, Susan, and their four children. In a statement released by the Justice Department on Friday, the court said it had found no cause of death for Scalia, who was scheduled to take the oath of office at the end of the month. \"We are deeply shocked and deeply saddened by this news,\" the statement said. It was not immediately clear what caused the sudden death, but it was widely reported that Scalia had suffered from heart failure and was suffering from a \"heart attack.\" \"He was in a very difficult time,\" Justice Scalia said in an interview with the Dallas Morning News, adding that \"he had a lot to say about his life and his work in this country.\" He was a staunch supporter of President Barack Obama during his time in office. But his death was also a blow to the Republican Party, which has long been one of its strongest supporters. His death marked the first time a sitting justice has been confirmed dead by a US court in more than 30 years. A federal judge ruled on Thursday that a death sentence was appropriate for a person who had served as the nation's highest court justice. President Donald Trump has said he will seek a second term.

Trump's announcement came a day after the White House announced that it would no longer be appointing a special counsel to investigate the president's possible ties to Russia.

I've been to Mexico for a couple of weeks and am looking forward to the trip. My first stop was in Mexico, where I spent a few days in a small town called Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. On the way there, I was able to catch up on some of my favorite stories from the past few years. The first one is about a young Mexican girl who was born in the city of Mexico. Her father was a professor at the university and she was the youngest of five children. She is now a teacher at a private school in Berlin. \"I'm very excited about this trip,\" she told me, adding that it was \"a great opportunity to learn about the history of Germany and Mexico.\" \"It's been a long time coming,\" I said, \"and it's a great honor to be part of this journey.\" The tour began with a stop in Cologne, Germany, and ended in Frankfurt. There, the young girl was taken to a museum where she learned about German history and German culture. After that, she went on to study the German language, German literature and the art of language. In addition to studying German and Mexican history, her father also studied German. He was fascinated by the language and was interested in learning more about Latin American culture, particularly the languages spoken in Latin America. His father, a German-born teacher, was also fascinated with Latin culture and his mother's love of art and literature. It was at this point that he decided to take up the subject of Mexican culture as a topic of conversation. At the same time, he wanted to explore the cultural aspects of his native country, which he called \"the land of learning.\" In his book \"The Land of Learning,\" he talks about how his father taught him to read Latin and how he learned to write the Latin word for \"learned.\" He also discusses the importance of education in his family, how to get a good education and what it means to live a life of study and work in an environment that is conducive to learning and learning. And, of course, there's the question of whether or not he should be allowed to go to school. That's something he has to answer for himself, because he doesn't know what he wants to do with his life."

Francis won't be able to meet them, says DW's Astrid Prange. Dead prisoners, disappearing students, refugees shot dead and murdered priests. Mexico has lived through one violent episode after the other. The mood in the nation is explosive. And now this: just a day before the pope is set to arrive, more than 50 people died in the largest prison revolt in the country's history. What meaning does the pope's presence hold on such an occasion? Only one thing is certain: Francis won't be able to resolve the problems of the world's second largest Catholic nation in just a five-day trip. The unrealistic demands placed on him are not something he can fill. Yet the pope carries with him an important message: you don't have to love your enemies but you do need to speak with them. And he's living the example himself by meeting with the Russian Orthodox Patriarch Kirill on a stopover in Cuba on his way to Mexico. Cuba all over again It's sensational! Bannings and mutual ex-communications are ancient history. Nearly a millennium after the split, the head of the Roman Catholic Church and the head of the Russian Orthodox Church are speaking to each other. It's not as if the two will become friends - their positions are far too different. Yet their centuries-old enmity feels out of place and in view of the massive worldwide persecution of Christians, almost unchristian. And both of these church leaders know this. In Mexico, efforts to stem the polarizing forces at play in society have not been successful. The extreme differences between rich and poor are dividing Mexican society. President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto has prioritized economic growth over dialogue with his critics - a group which includes students as well as teachers and union members who regularly protest against government policies. They demand an end to lawlessness and corruption. The presumed murder of 43 teaching students in Iguala in September 2014, a crime which remains unsolved, stands as a symbol of the lawlessness sweeping Mexico. The recent mutiny in a Monterrey jail serves as further proof of the country's shortcomings in regard to human rights and the rule of law. With a visit to Ciudad Juarez and the largest prison in Mexico, Francis will only make that deficiency more transparent. Even the pope of peace has enemies. The route he's chosen to take on his travels through the country has displeased the staunchly Catholic president. A meeting with the relatives of the Iguala victims is therefore hush-hush and participation in a holy mass remains secret. Considering the tense situation in the country, it's still possible that the pope's route will change once again. The church in the pillory Even within his own church, Francis has met with opposition. A meeting he requested with victims from the church's abuse scandal will not take place - a bitter disappointment for many former seminarians who were abused by Marcial Maciel, the founder of the Legion of Christ, and members of his order. It's just one example of how impunity continues even within the church itself. None of the perpetrators have yet to answer for their crimes in court. It appears as though the pope has accomplished more on the world stage than he has brought on reforms to the Vatican. Despite the revolutionary coming together of Cuba and the US and the revolutionary meeting with Patriarch Kirill, the revolution in Rome has yet to materialize. Do you have something to say? Add your comments below. The thread to this editorial closes in 24 hours.",

Pope Francis is accused of trying to convince the country's Roman Catholic Church to accept him as the pope's successor. The Vatican has denied the accusations, saying that the pontiff's mission was impossible. \"The pope is not going to be able to persuade the people of Mexico,\" Archbishop Astrid Prange of the Russian Orthodox Church told DW in an interview published on Sunday. Francis, who is also the Vatican's archbishop of Rome, said that he had \"no idea\" what was going on when he met with Kirill in his hometown of Iguala in the western Mexican state of Monterrey. He also said he was \"not sure\" whether the new pope would be accepted as a successor to Pope Benedict XVI, or whether he would accept the resignation of Pope John Paul II. In a statement released Sunday, Francis said: \"I have no idea what the future holds for this country. I am not sure what it will be like for the next five years, but I can tell you that it is impossible for me to believe that this is the end of my life.\" \"It's impossible,\" he said. 'I can't believe it.' \"We have to find a way to deal with this problem,\" Francis added, referring to the fact that his predecessor, the late Cardinal Marcial Maciel, died in a plane crash on the way back from a trip to Rome. His death was the result of a heart attack, according to a report by the Catholic News Agency (CDN). \"This is a very, very difficult situation for us,\" the report said, adding that \"it's not just a matter of whether or not we accept this pope as our successor.\" The report also noted that Francis had not been invited to visit Mexico, and that there was no chance of him being invited. It also pointed out that, despite the Pope's efforts, he has not yet accepted his successor's offer to take him to Italy, where he will have a chance to meet with his wife and two children. On the other hand, there is no way Francis could have accepted the offer without the support of his own church, which has a long list of bishops and archdioceses."

        "target": "Report: Torture is a European problem too A day after Amnesty International published a report on Europe's collusion with the CIA's torture program, the Council of Europe published its own shocking survey of abuse in detention centers across the continent. Prison guards in several European countries carried out reprisals against detainees who talked to the Council of Europe's Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT), the new CPT report has revealed. The council considers this a violation of the spirit of cooperation between the CPT and the Council of Europe's member states. According to the CPT's 24th General Report, released on Wednesday, reprisals were carried out against prisoners in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Greece, Hungary, Moldova, Russia, Spain, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and Ukraine. \"Intimidation or retaliation against persons the CPT has interviewed may not only violate their human rights but also strikes a blow to the preventive mechanism established by the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture,\" CPT President Letif H\u00fcseynov said in a statement. \"I urge national authorities to respect their obligation to prevent, investigate and punish such actions.\" The report also highlighted several problems with the detention of juveniles around Europe, and proposed a series of practical measures to protect young people's rights when detained. Ad hoc visits The little-known CPT, now 25 years old, represents a unique approach to international torture prevention. A team of specialists make roughly 180 visits a year to all kinds of detention centers (including prisons, police stations, holding centers for immigration detainees, psychiatric hospitals, and even social care homes) all across the 47-member Council of Europe - one of the few international blocs that offer platforms for dialogue with Eastern European regimes considered to have poor human rights records, such as Russia, Azerbaijan, and Ukraine. The method combines the carrot of talks with government officials and the stick of ad hoc visits, which all members are committed to allowing into their prisons. Once inside, the CPT also has the right to interview any detainees it chooses - in private, though of course the detainees have the right to refuse. \"The first thing to say is how important the CPT is,\" said Carla Ferstman, director of Redress, a UK-based organization that helps torture survivors. \"As a result of their boot work over a very long period of time, the UN has set up a global system which in many ways mirrors the approach of the CPT.\" But given that the committee has no powers to enforce its proposals to governments, there are question marks over its effectiveness. \"In the report, they complain about how some of the recommendations they've made have not been implemented,\" said Ferstman. \"It's a sign that they're a little bit frustrated.\" But in the long run, she maintains, the CPT has more than proved its value. \"The dialogue that they are able to have is really important,\" she said. \"Looking long-term, they have been very effective.\" CIA collusion, asylum seekers The CPT's report comes a day after Amnesty International released its own report on European collusion with the CIA's torture program. While the CPT's report examines more prosaic day-to-day mistreatment, rather than mass rendition of terrorist suspects at the behest of the US, there are obvious links between the two, since some countries - such as Poland, Macedonia, and the UK - are highlighted in both reports. \"What is finally coming out in all of this is that the Europeans, despite all the criticism of the Bush and Obama administrations on the use of torture - so many of them connived,\" said Judy Dempsey, senior associate at Carnegie Europe. \"It's really a double standard. This report is quite damning and quite shameful, and it follows the Amnesty International one as well.\" The CPT's work also mentions the mistreatment of asylum seekers, a problem increasingly afflicting European countries that take in the largest number of asylum seekers - particularly Spain, Italy, and Greece. \"With Greece there are two things to remember,\" Dempsey told DW. \"A - the appalling situation of the prison system, and B - the lack of training among police of how to deal with asylum seekers. Awful things have happened. Parallel to this is the illegal detention centers. There have been lots of cases of terrible mistreatment over the last several years.\" \"Immigration detention is a growing issue,\" added Ferstman. \"In the UK, there was a whole parliamentary inquiry into one immigration detention center, where some of the women alleged that guards propositioned them in order to get quick treatment on their claims. Each country has its own history of torture.\"",
        "generated_story": "The CPT is a European problem too -- and it's time to step up its game The CIA and the US are the main culprits in the torture of torture victims in Europe. It's a problem that needs to be addressed, says the Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT), which is chaired by Carla Ferstman, the head of the Council of Europe's committee on the prevention of torture. \"We need to do something about this,\" she told DW. The US has been accused of using torture as a weapon of mass destruction, but the CIA has denied this accusation, saying it was \"basically a cover-up.\" \"The CIA is not responsible for torturing the victims,\" said the committee's head, Letif H\u00fcseynov, adding that the agency's role in torture was to \"make sure that all victims are treated fairly and humanely and that no one is subjected to arbitrary and torturous treatment.\" The committee, which includes former US President George W. Bush and former British Prime Minister David Cameron, has called for an end to the practice, arguing that torture is \"a form of forced labor.\" In a statement released on Tuesday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that \"the CIA will continue to use torture in order to protect the interests of its own people.\" But he added that there was no evidence to support the claim that CIA agents used torture to extract confessions from victims. In fact, CIA Director John Brennan said in an interview with DW that he believed the allegations were \"completely false.\" He also pointed out that US torturers were not held accountable for their actions, and said they should be prosecuted for crimes against humanity, such as murder, rape, kidnapping, torture, sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children. And he said, \"It's not just about torture that we have to deal with,\" because \"it's also about human rights.\" That's why the United States and its allies are calling for a change in its approach to torture. But it also has to take a step back and consider the consequences of what it has done to victims and their families. That includes ending the use of force against people who have been tortured, for example, or for those who commit acts of terrorism, as well as the abuse of power.

        "target": "Dresden marks 70 years since massive Allied bombing Seventy years ago, Allied bombers attacked Dresden, killing tens of thousands of people, the majority of them civilians and refugees. Every year, the East German city remembers its dead. DW's Naomi Conrad was on hand. As the tram trundled through Dresden's drab suburbs on Friday morning, a prim, elderly woman suddenly turned to her friend sitting on the seat beside her: \"You know, my mother never told me about the bombings.\" She shrugged, then, after a moment's pause, continued. \"It must have been such unspeakable hell that she just couldn't talk about it,\" the woman said. She was referring to February 13, 1945 - the morning, exactly 70 years ago, when Allied bombers swooped down on an unsuspecting city famous for its baroque architecture and that, until that point, had survived the war mostly unscathed. That was to change in the course of three dreadful days: As the bombs rained down on the city, its churches and palaces were turned to rubble. Up to 25,000 people - many of them refugees fleeing the advancing Soviet Red Army - died in the inferno that raged in the city for days. \"There was nothing left, nothing,\" a frail, bent man with a checkered cap recalled, \"just rubble and death.\" He was leaning on the balustrade of a viewing platform in Dresden's old gasometer, staring down at the 360-degree painting by the Iranian-German artist Yadegar Asisi; sirens howled from hidden speakers and strobe lighting illuminated the ruined churches and black smoke billowing from the burnt skeletons that were once buildings. The man swallowed, his voice hoarse, barely audible: \"It's so hard being here.\" The soundtrack and images, he said, \"bring back too many memories.\" 'So, so many dead' He was 15, he recalled, working on a school essay when the sirens began to wail. He never finished the essay. Instead, he ran for shelter with his family. When they returned home three days later, the roof had been blown off, the windows smashed. \"But we were lucky: We survived,\" he said. \"There were so, so many dead.\" His voice broke and, muttering an apology, he shuffled off. The bombings were intended to break the German population's morale - a decision that to many was incomprehensible, given that the war had long been decided and Dresden's economic and strategic importance was relatively minimal. Consequently, the death and destruction wreaked by the Allied bombers quickly became a tool, first for the Nazi propagandists in the last months of the war, then by the East German regime for its anti-West propaganda, and then later by neo-Nazi groups, who traditionally congregate on February 13. Even today, \"the debate continues about guilt and innocence, even about the exact number of victims,\" Dresden Mayor Helma Orosz told a packed audience, including delegations from abroad, gathered for a memorial service in the city's Frauenkirche, which in 2005 was rebuilt with the help of private donations after Germany's reunification, many of them from the United States and Great Britain. Call for peace \"War, hatred and violence begin in people's minds,\" Orosz said. \"We must resist any attempt at once again categorizing people based on their origin and skin color,\" she added, referring to what has often been described as a right-wing catchall movement called PEGIDA, generally translated as Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West, which has taken to the streets in Dresden since October. Later, on a platform overlooking thousands of people, many of them wearing white roses as a sign of peace while bracing the icy cold outside the church, Orosz called on Dresden to remember every victim of the Nazi terror - a plea that was reiterated by German President Joachim Gauck when he took to the microphone: \u201cWe don't want the pain that people suffered here to be misused by others.\u201d Behind him, the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, who, back in the Frauenkirche, had talked of the \u201cmiracle that peace in Europe represents,\u201d leaned in closer to his interpreter. Then, as evening fell over Dresden and church bells tolled, thousands - possibly as many as 10,000, according to the city's press office - lined up along Dresden's riverfront, holding hands to commemorate the dead and call for peace as police men dressed in black riot gear looked on. \"I can remember it all,\" Siegfriede Leonhard, a vivacious woman in her late 70s said. She was 7 when the bombs fell, she said, and had been coming to the commemorations in Dresden \"for at least 60 years.\" Sometimes, she said, stomping her feet to keep warm, she wondered whether she shouldn't remember at home, alone. \"",

The bombing of the city's Frauenkirche was the latest in a series of bombings in the eastern German city. German authorities said the bombing was carried out by the Soviet Red Army. Dresden, which was one of Germany's most important cities during World War II, was among the first to receive Allied bombing orders in February 1945. In a statement released by Dresden's mayor, Helma Orosz, she said: \"We are deeply shocked and saddened by this attack. We have never seen anything like it before, and we are shocked by what we have witnessed in Dresden.\" The attack came just a few days after German Chancellor Joachim Gauck visited Dresden to meet with the Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization (PEMO), a group of anti-Nazi activists who had been protesting against the war in Germany. \"The bombing is a direct result of what the Germans did to Dresden,\" said Naomi Conrad, head of DW's Dresden bureau, referring to the attacks on Dresden. She added that the bombings were part of a broader campaign to \"make Dresden a safer and more secure place to live and work in.\" \"It is not a coincidence that Dresden is the site of this bombing,\" she told DW, adding that it was \"the first time in history that a city has been targeted by an attack by a German bomber.\" German Foreign Minister Yadegar Asisi, who was visiting Dresden at the time, described the attack as \"an act of aggression against Dresden and the whole city.\" He also said that \"it was a provocation\" and \"a provocation.\" Berlin's war crimes prosecutor's office said it had received information about the bomber's location, but did not elaborate on the exact location. It was not immediately clear how many German soldiers were killed or wounded. However, it is believed that at least one German soldier was killed. According to eyewitnesses, a number of German police officers were also killed and dozens of civilians were injured. A spokesman for the Dresden police force, however, insisted that no one was seriously injured, saying only that there were no reports of any fatalities."

        "target": "Experts: Taliban have not changed strategy with Kabul restaurant attack The weekend attack on a Kabul restaurant frequented by foreigners came as no surprise to international organizations on the ground. Experts don't believe the Taliban have changed their strategy to target more civilians. Dramatic scenes must have played out in the restaurant: Guests sought cover under tables as a group of terrorists shot wildly into the dining rooms. News agencies report the restaurant owner tried in vain to fend off the attackers. He was among the more than 20 people who perished, most of whom were employees at international organizations. The attackers were also among the dead. During the evening dinner rush, at 7:00 p.m. Friday (17.01.2014), one of three Taliban members detonated his explosives-laden vest and blew a breach in the highly secured restaurant. Neither the man-high blast walls, nor the secured access points with armed guards could stop the attackers. The two remaining terrorists were killed later in a firefight with security forces at the scene. No change in Taliban strategy The suicide bombing on the popular Lebanese restaurant, Taverna Du Liban, in the high-end Kabul neighborhood of Wazir Akbar Khan was the worst attack so far in 2014. Afghanistan votes for a new president in April; and the international troops are scheduled to withdraw from the country by the end of the year. Although there are plans for a small contingent to remain in Afghanistan, President Hamid Karzai first has to sign a bilateral security agreement with the United States. But he continues to play for time. In this context, the Taliban may be targeting civilians more in order to drive out not just the military coalition, but the entire international community. Yet \"as horrible as this incident is, I don't see a change in strategy,\" said Thomas Ruttig, the co-director of the Afghan Analysts Network. Similar attacks have also been launched before, \"at least 12 to 15 times in the past eight years,\" Ruttig said. The worst attack was in 2012 at Qargha Lake, a popular weekend destination near Kabul. More than 20 people were killed, all of them Afghans. Extensive security precautions The Taliban, which normally doesn't miss an opportunity for fiery rhetoric, hasn't declared a change in strategy. A spokesman for the Islamist militant group said the attack was retaliation for a NATO airstrike in Parwan Province, a few kilometers north of Kabul. According to an assistant of the Afghan president, seven children and one woman died in the coalition strike. \"You have to carefully monitor the security situation,\" Nils W\u00f6rmer, head of the Konrad Adenauer Institute in Kabul, told DW. \"But I think it's a bit early to talk about a change in [Taliban] strategy.\" W\u00f6rmer's office lies just a few hundred meters from the site of Friday's attack. He could clearly hear the explosion, which shook the window panes in his office. \"It was immediately clear to me that something had happened,\" W\u00f6rmer recounted. But the Konrad Adenauer Institute was prepared. \"We had a relatively concrete warning in the last week related to our neighborhood, and we were very cautious,\" W\u00f6rmer said. He met with colleagues in his secured office. Like most of the international organizations, the Konrad Adenauer Institute is also integrated into the security networks. \"The security precautions are high,\" W\u00f6rmer said. \"But that doesn't exclude the possibility that something similar could happen again.\" But the Afghan security forces have succeeded in preventing many attacks in the past few months, he said. Kabul residents criticize Taliban An informal, impromptu poll by DW's Kabul correspondent, Hussein Sirat, suggested the Taliban are not winning Afghan hearts and minds with such attacks. \"Wherever the Taliban have killed civilians, they have not achieved their goal,\" said Mirwais, a pedestrian in the Kabul city center. Idris, another Kabul resident, seconded Mirwais' sentiment. \"The Taliban intimidate the people so that the security agreement won't be signed,\" he said. \"But the people won't bend to this intimidation.\" How the international organizations adapt to the tense security situation in Kabul will come after many conversations, analyses, and briefings in the following days. But W\u00f6rmer is not thinking about giving up. \"We have a clear agenda and long-term projects, which I considered to be very sensible,\" W\u00f6rmer said. \"I am of the opinion, as I was before, that what I'm doing here with the Konrad Adenauer Institute is worth the risks.\"",
        "generated_story": "Afghan analysts: Taliban haven't changed strategy with Kabul restaurant attack Afghan analysts say the Taliban have not changed their strategy in the wake of a deadly attack on a restaurant in Kabul that killed at least 25 people. The Afghan government has said it will not change its strategy after the attack, which killed more than 100 people and wounded hundreds more. \"The Taliban are not going to give up,\" said Thomas Ruttig, an Afghan analyst at the Konrad Adenauer Institute, referring to the country's military intelligence agency, the Kabul Analysts Network, a think-tank that specializes in Afghanistan's security and intelligence agencies. Read more: Afghanistan: What is the next step for the Afghan Taliban? The Taliban, who have been waging an insurgency since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, are no strangers to violence. They are also known to carry out attacks in neighboring countries, such as Lebanon and Syria. Last week, they attacked a Lebanese restaurant near Kabul's Qargha Lake, killing five people, injuring dozens more and injuring scores more, according to Afghan officials. In a statement released on Friday, Afghan President Hamid Karzai said the attackers were \"terrorists\" and that they had \"no intention of stopping the peace process.\" The statement came a day after a parliamentary election in which a majority of Afghans voted in favor of an Islamist president who is seen as more moderate than the current president. But the results of Tuesday's parliamentary elections in Parwan Province were mixed, with some observers saying that the insurgents were more likely to stick to their traditional positions of strength. Some analysts, however, said that there was no change in their stance on the matter, saying they were still willing to work with the government to improve the security situation. However, some analysts believe that Kabul is still in a state of shock, given the violence in recent weeks and the fact that many Afghans are still skeptical about the president's ability to form a government. According to one analyst, there is a \"very high probability that he will stay in power for a very long time,\" while others say that \"the Taliban will continue to act as if they are a terrorist organization.\" In the past few months, Kabul has seen a rise in Taliban attacks on Afghan security forces and civilians, as well as a resurgence of attacks by the Islamic State (IS) and other militant groups. On Wednesday, one of those attacks was carried out by a suicide bomber who was carrying out a series of bombings at a military base in eastern Afghanistan. A Taliban spokesman told the AFP news agency that it was the first time the group had attacked Afghan troops in years."

        "target": "Teabag filter cleans water with nanotechnology A new water filter developed in South Africa could provide millions of people with clean drinking water. The filter, about the size and shape of a teabag, would be inexpensive, easy to distribute and simple to use. Marelize Botes is conducting a final set of tests on a new type of diminutive water filter before industrial production can begin. The microbiologist pours water from a plastic bottle though a high-tech, teabag-sized filter before analyzing it in her in her laboratory at the University of Stellenbosch in South Africa. \"The filter is much cheaper than bottled water as well as any other filter on the market,\" she told Deutsche Welle. Instead of being filled with black or green tea, the bag contains active carbon granules and is made from nanofibers treated with biocide, which kills bacteria rather than simply filtering them from the water. Nanotech for pennies \"This project takes nanotechnology to the poorest of the poor people who live in this world, and it will make a difference in their lives,\" said Eugen Cloete, who in addition to inventing the filter is dean of the faculty of science at Stellenbosch University and chair of Stellenbosch University's Water Institute. With some 300 million people in Africa - and over a billion worldwide - living without access to clean drinking water, the need for such a filter is huge. When in mass production, the developers said they expect the teabag to cost just a few South African cents (under half a US cent and under a third of a euro cent). In addition to being inexpensive, Botes said, the filter is also easy to distribute to rural area and simple to use as it can be place in an adapter that fits on nearly any regular-sized plastic bottle. Each filter can clean one liter (one quart) of the most polluted water to the point where it is completely safe to drink. Once used, the filter can be disposed of and is biodegradable. African countries, led by Somalia, Mauritania and Sudan, were ranked to have the most vulnerable water supplies, according to a June report by UK-based risk consultancy firm Maplecroft. Decentralized use The filter's small size and light weight make it ideal for rural areas where other means of filtration do not exist, Cloete said. \"It is simply impossible to build purification infrastructure at every polluted stream,\" Cloete said. \"So we have to take the solution to the people. The water is cleaned right then and there when you drink from the bottle.\" The filter is now undergoing testing by the South African Bureau of Standards, after which Cloete and his team hope it can be rolled out to the United Nations and non-governmental organizations that have expressed interest in it by the end of the year. The project grew out of research into larger filters, according to Cloete. \"We were busy developing filters for larger applications, but when you do the tests in the labatory you do the tests on a much smaller scale,\" he said. \"The results we were getting on a smaller amount of water promoted me to think about a smaller application.\" Author: Joerg Poppendieck, Sean Sinico Editor: Anke Rasper",
        "generated_story": "Water filter for decentralized drinking in Africa A Teabag-sized water filter is being tested in South Africa. It's part of a project to develop a water-saving system for decentralizing water supply in the country. The project has been approved by the South African Water Institute (Maplecroft) and is expected to be completed by mid-2018. Marelize Botes of the University of Stellenbosch in Johannesburg said the project was a \"significant step forward\" in decentralization. \"It's the first step in a long journey to decentralize water distribution,\" she told Deutsche Welle, adding that it would be \"a major milestone.\" \"The project is a major step towards a decentralized distribution of water across Africa,\" he said. In a statement, Maplecroft's Eugen Cloete said: \"We are very pleased with the results of this project. We are looking forward to the next phase of our project, which will be launched in early 2018, and we are confident that we will have a solution in place by year's end.\" The plan is to test the technology on water samples collected from water treatment plants in rural areas and then test it on the samples to see if it can be used for drinking purposes, he added. However, it is not yet clear whether the system will work for all water users. According to a press release, the test results will not be available until the end of next year. There are currently no plans to release samples from the plant, but the researchers are hopeful that the tests will show that water is safe to drink. 'Water is good for the environment' The test was carried out on a farm near the city of Cape Town, where the farm is located, in an area of about 1.5 square kilometers (1.6 square miles). The farm has a total of 2,500 hectares (3,200 acres) of land and 1,000 kilometers of sea-level rise. But it's not just water that's safe for people to use, according to experts who have been studying water for more than a decade. They also say it will help reduce the number of people who use water in their homes and businesses, as well as reducing the amount of waste that goes into households' drinking water."

All you need is a piece of fabric big enough to wrap your gift, a ribbon long enough to go right around it, and if you want to make a gift tag, you will also need a piece of old cardboard, a hole punch and another small piece of ribbon. Ready? 2. No, wait, we forgot the present. Get that, and you have everything you need. Spread the fabric on the ground and put your gift on top 3. Fold the fabric around the gift you are wrapping 4. With the last little bit, you don't tuck it under, but create a little flap on top 5. Fold that flap over like this 6. Take one end of the parcel and tuck the fabric inside, BEHIND the gift inside 7. You can take your time to wiggle it all inside. Make it as flat as you can 8. Once it is all inside, turn to the other end and do the same thing again 9. When you have done both ends, it should look like this. Your present is all tucked up inside and you don't need any tape to keep it closed 10. Now for the ribbon. Place the gift on top of it 11. Tie the bow 12. So it looks like this. Finished? If you want a gift tag, that comes now. If you don't you're done! 13. Cut a piece out of an old cardboard box and make a hole in it using a hole punch. Watch your fingers though ;) 14. Put a piece of short ribbon through your hole 15. Tie the tag to your gift 16. And you are finished! P.S. You can either ask your friend to reuse the fabric, and show them how to wrap with it, or if they don't like that idea, you can take it home with you to use again the next time. And remember, you don't have to buy the fabric. You can use an old pillow case, an old t-shirt or skirt, or whatever you want. You can even make your ribbon from an old t-shirt if you don't have any. Happy wrapping.",
        "generated_story": "How to Wrap a Present Without Using Paper or Tape The best way to wrap a present without using paper or tape is to use paper and tape. This technique is known as \"wrap-around.\" It's a technique that can be used in many different ways. For example, you can wrap your present with paper, tape, or even a piece of cardboard. You can also wrap it in a plastic bag and put it on top of the paper bag. That way, it doesn't look like it's going to break. It just looks like you're wrapping it up. But that's not the case at all. There are a lot of different methods of wrapping presents. One of them is paper. The other is tape or plastic. And the third method is a paper towel. Paper towel is the most common method, but there are also a number of other methods that are used. These include paper towels, paper plates, and a rubber band. They're all very easy to clean up and they're also very effective in reducing the amount of paper you have to put on the package. In this case, the plastic is used to cover up the excess paper that has accumulated over the years. \"Paper towel\" is what you use when you wrap the present. Tape is also used for the wrapping. If you don't have tape on hand, then you'll need to tape it to the inside of your hand. Then, if you do, put the tape back on. When you put your hands on your head, your eyes will be open and you won't be able to see what's happening to your face. Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with that. Just make sure that you've got a good grip on it. Wrap your presents in plastic and then wrap them in tape and leave them on for a few minutes. Use a ruler or a sharpener to make the wrap look more like a sponge. Make sure to keep your fingers dry and that the material is dry before wrapping the gift. Wrapping your gift with plastic wrap is an easy and inexpensive way of making sure it stays dry. A good wrap can last for up to a year, as long as the packaging is clean and tidy. After that, wrap up your gifts carefully and carefully. Do not use glue or any other material that is too heavy or too thick, such as plastic or metal. Be sure not to touch anything that isn't already wrapped."

The ruling primarily affects Germany's Turkish minority. The European Union's highest court on Thursday ruled in favor of a Turkish citizen, who was denied a visa to live in Germany with her husband, because she was illiterate and therefore unable to demonstrate basic German-language skills. According to the court, a lack of language skills shouldn't automatically lead to the rejection of an entry visa application. Instead, Germany must consider the unique circumstances of each individual case. The court went on to say that quickly granting visas for spouses improves the quality of life and promotes the integration of foreign residents. Specifically addressing the case of the Turkish plaintiff, the court ruled that the rejection of her visa had violated a bilateral treaty between Turkey and the EU. In 1970, Brussels and Ankara agreed not to tighten their residency laws for each other's citizens. Law only applies to some In 2007, Germany introduced the requirement that spouses from certain non-EU countries must demonstrate a basic grasp of German before being granted a visa to live in Germany with their husbands or wives. Spouses affected by the law are required to obtain a basic language certificate from recognized centers, such as Germany's Goethe Institute, proving that they have an A1 level, or \"Beginning German\" language ability. The German government claims that the goal of the language requirement is to prevent forced marriages as well as marriages made simply for the sake of obtaining a visa. Citizens of European Free Trade Association (EFTA) member states are exempt from the language requirement. That includes Iceland, Lichtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. In addition, citizens of Australia, Canada, Israel, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea and the United States also don't have to demonstrate German-language skills. slk/xx (AFP, AP, dpa, KNA)",

Nuremberg drop to 10th place with 18 points at the end of a very tight middle group. Just three points separate Nuremburg from Freiburg. Hoffenheim also have 18 points but are two places ahead of Nuremberg in eighth place on goal difference. Author: Matt Zuvela (dpa, sid) Editor: Sean Sinico",
        "generated_story": "Bayern Munich 3-0 Hoffenheim: Papiss Demba Cisse seals 3rd win for Bayern Munich The Senegal international has scored three goals for his country in the Bundesliga this season, helping his side to their third win in four matches. The win over FC Nuremberg on Saturday marked the first time that Germany's top-flight club has won a league game in three years. It also marked Bayern's first Bundesliga win since the end of the 2014-15 season. German side Freiburg, who have won three of their last four league matches, have been on a tear in recent weeks. On Saturday, however, they had to settle for a 2-2 draw at home to FC Cologne. In the second half, the home side had the better chances, but they were unable to put the ball past Cologne's Mario Gomez. After that, it was up to the visitors to decide whether or not to go for the winner, which they did, and whether they would go on to win the league. \"I think it's a good sign for us that we're going to be able to move on from this,\" said midfielder Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, adding that he was \"very happy\" with the result. He added: \"It was great to see the way we came back from the brink of defeat. I'm very happy for our players, we've been playing really well for so long. We've got a lot of work to do and we'll be happy to get the job done.\" \"We're really happy with this result because we have a really good squad,\" added defender Mario Gueye, whose side have now won the last three league games in a row. 'We've had a great run of form' For Bayern, this is a big step up from last season's 1-1 draw with Cologne, where they lost to Cologne and then to Borussia Dortmund last weekend. But it wasn't enough to keep Bayern going. They needed a win to stay on course for next year's Champions League quarterfinals. That's when the pressure began to mount on the young German forward and his team-mates. And it didn't take long for him to find the net, as he has been doing all season with his new club, FC Niemann, to score his first goal in over a year."

Slovak citizens detained by the Iranian authorities on suspicion of taking photographs out of bounds have returned home, said Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico. Eight people in total were arrested in May after taking photographs of restricted areas. A Slovakian news website said the group was detained near the central city of Isfahan, where Iran has nuclear facilities. The six that have been freed attended a news conference held by Prime Minister Fico in the capital, Bratislava on Sunday. Fico told reporters that the government was working to secure the release of the remaining two paragliders who are stiil in custody. \"Negotiations were fair and their result is the release of six out of eight detainees,\" Fico was quoted as saying on the government's website. He added that Slovakia had not made any \"financial commitments\" in the negotiation process. Detainees 'unaware' of rule-breaking One of the released paragliders, Vladislav Frigo, said the group did not break any rules it was aware of. \"We had information that there was a ban on taking photographs below the height of 2,300 metres. We were taking pictures from higher (altitudes),\" said Frigo. He added that the detainees were well treated, had access to television, a refrigerator and could cook for themselves as well as getting regular meals. Foreign nationals accused of spying In recent years, Iran has levelled accusations of espionage against both foreign nationals and Iranians. Two U.S. citizens - Josh Fattal and Shane Bauer - were sentenced to eight years in jail for spying after being arrested while hiking along the Iraq-Iran border in 2009. They denied espionage - neighbouring Oman helped secure their release in 2011 by posting bail of 1-million US dollars (756,000 euros).

        "generated_story": "Six Slovak paragliders released on suspicion of spying in Iran Six Slovaks have been released by the Iranian authorities after they were arrested in connection with a suspected spying operation in the country. The charges stem from the arrest of six men and two women in Isfahan, Iran. Six of the men, aged between 30 and 60, were detained on Tuesday in a separate case in Slovakia. They were released after a court in Bratislava found them guilty of espionage and attempted to extradite them to the U.S. Slovakia is one of a handful of countries in which the government has been able to detain suspected spies. In the case of Robert Fico, who was arrested on Monday, the charges range from spying for the United States and the European Union to money laundering and money-laundering. He is suspected of having links to Iran's Revolutionary Guards, which he is accused of helping to finance. \"We have no evidence that we are involved in any criminal activity,\" he told the court, adding that he was not aware of any charges against him or his family. Slovaker Foreign Minister Vladislav Frigo said the arrests were \"inappropriate\" and \"unacceptable.\" \"It is not the first time we have had to deal with this kind of situation,\" Frigidaire said. On Tuesday, Slovakia's Foreign Ministry announced that it had arrested six people, including the head of an Iranian intelligence agency, for allegedly spying on the citizens of Slovakia and Iran, and that they would face charges of conspiracy to commit espionage. A spokesman for Iranian Prime Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif denied the allegations, saying only that his country was cooperating with the investigation. Iranian officials have also accused Slovakia of being a \"hostile state\" in its dealings with Tehran. Iran has denied accusations that Tehran is trying to interfere with its nuclear program. Tehran denies the accusations and says it has no plans to do so. However, Iranian media have reported that Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has ordered the release of all six suspects, in an apparent attempt to quell a diplomatic row between Tehran and Washington over the Iran nuclear deal. According to Iranian state media, Tehran has said that the deal was reached in principle, but that Iran was \"not going to allow it.\" The Iranian government also said it would not release the names of those arrested, citing \"technical reasons.\" A spokeswoman for Tehran's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Tehran had not yet made any decision on whether or not to release all the suspects."

        "target": "French presidential debate does little to woo undecided voters This year's French presidential race is perhaps the most closely watched election in recent history. Many voters are still undecided, including those in the Paris caf\u00e9 where DW's Jake Cigainero saw the latest TV debate. Just over two weeks ahead of the first round of voting in France's presidential election, all 11 candidates met for the second televised debate of the campaign. It was the first time in the history of French elections that the entire official ballot shared a television stage. This race for the Elysee is perhaps the most closely watched election in the history of the Fifth Republic in view of conservative candidate Francois Fillon's embezzlement charges, the deterioration of the left, political amateur Emmanuel Macron's surprise surge to the top, and the rise of Marine Le Pen's National Front. With so much media attention on the five main candidates, Tuesday's debate felt almost like a consolation for the six other candidates rarely in the spotlight. For French voters watching the televised debate at Cafe des Phares on Place de la Bastille, the saturated stage kept the candidates from detailed discussion of pressing issues. For those who are still undecided, the debate did little to bring them closer to choosing their pick for president. Vincent Couronne, a researcher, said it was good to see candidates who don't get as much media attention. However, 11 candidates at once for the political spectator was overkill. \"It wasn't very interesting. It's just one position after another. There's no real debate. It's not like when it was just five candidates.\" Boredom all round Charlotte Theuvenin and her friends, all students in their early 20s, tuned out early on from boredom and exasperation. \"It was too flat and too hypocritical. Fillon and Le Pen play with our money, then say they did nothing and that they are good for our country,\" she said. As though addressing the candidates in front of her on the TV screen, she added, \"How dare you talk about being president when you use our money for your own interests.\" Le Pen had come under fire over accusations that she misused public funds to pay bodyguards as parliamentary assistants. Francois Fillon of Les Republicains, meanwhile, is under investigation for allegedly paying family members more than 1 million euros ($1.1 million) for government work they never carried out. Frequently casting a blank stare at his opponents, Fillon also seemed bored, or at least more subdued compared to the first debate. Couronne said, \"Fillon seems to be not there. Probably because he knows all the small candidates can attack him on the criminal offenses he's accused of.\" Debate watchers cited Europe as the most important issue of this election, with many fearing Le Pen's promise to tear France out of the European Union in a so-called Frexit. Though no one at the cafe vocally supported Le Pen's plan, several acknowledged the EU is a pressure point for France. \"France's place in Europe in relation to Germany is a very important issue,\" said student Thibault Cirier. \"The general problem is France has lost its influence at the European level over the years, and that needs to be remedied, because France is one of the founders of Europe and should have a strong place in the union. The EU is also important for cohesion and to have a strong position internationally.\" Caf\u00e9 viewers say no to Le Pen Cirier was initially excited by Macron when he launched his campaign, but ultimately decided there was no substance. Now he says he will probably vote for far-left candidate Jean-Luc Melenchon. Kevser Taspinar also said she liked Melenchon for his fighting spirit and that \"he throws barbs.\" As a practicing Muslim who wears a headscarf, she said the most important issue for her is laicite, France's state institution of secularism. \"For me Hamon has the best interpretation of this. Maybe Hamon,\" Taspinar said hesitating. \"I'm still undecided, because there's Melenchon.\" Another viewer, Marie Dubois, said that although she really liked Melenchon, she had definitively decided on Macron. \"Melenchon has a way of putting humanity in politics and giving hope,\" she said. \"But Macron is the only possible candidate.\" With polls putting Le Pen and Macron in the second round on May 7, the undecided voters at this Paris cafe said they were certain which candidate they would not for vote for in that scenario. \"Definitely Macron. There is no way I am going to vote for Le Pen,\" Theuvenin said. \"I will never vote for that woman or Front National, no matter who is running against them in the second round.\" Tuesday was the final debate for Macron and Melenchon, two of the crowd-pleasers among the candidates. Both have pulled out of the third debate on grounds that it cuts too close to the first vote just two days later on April 23.",
        "generated_story": "French National Front candidate Francois Fillon faces tough test DW's Jake Cigainero weighs in on France's far-right presidential candidates. The French candidate for the French presidential election, Marine Le Pen, faces a tough challenge in the polls. French President Emmanuel Macron is facing tough re-election in November. He faces stiff opposition from his own party, the centrist Les Republicains (Le Pen), as well as the right-wing Alternative for France (AfD) party (FN) and the center-left Socialists (SPD). The FN's candidate, Kevser Taspinar, has already faced stiff criticism from the left for his support of the party's policies. \"I don't think the FN is going to win,\" he told DW in an interview published on Thursday. But, he added, \"It's not just a question of who wins, it's about who doesn't win. It's also about how you win.\" The left-of-centre candidate has been criticized by many in his party for not being able to stand up to the establishment and for being too soft on the far right. In a speech on Sunday, LNP candidate Vincent Couronne said he was \"very disappointed\" with the election results, adding that he had \"no confidence\" in Macron's ability to lead the country. However, his comments came as a surprise to his supporters, who had expected him to be the next president of France. On the campaign trail, Macron campaigned on a platform of \"Make France Great Again\" - a slogan that has become a rallying cry for voters in France and around the world. His campaign team, which includes former French Prime Minister Jean-Luc Melenchon and former Socialist Party (PSV) presidential candidate Martin Hamon, was also critical of Macron, accusing him of failing to deliver on promises he made to voters during the run-up to last year's presidential elections. Macron has also been accused of not delivering on his promise to unite France with Germany, a charge he has repeatedly denied. France is not the only country in Europe that wants to see a united front, but it is also a country that is in desperate need of a strong leader and a leader who is willing to fight for its own interests. At the same time, there is a growing sense of unease among French voters about the possibility of an anti-EU vote. Some of them have even called on Macron to step down, saying he should be replaced by a candidate with a more moderate stance. Others, however, have called for a \"stronger, more inclusive\" approach to politics. They have also said that Macron should not be allowed to run for president, and that they should instead focus on economic issues such as climate change and social justice."

And the news was good -- most of the numbers were down compared to the preceding year. Germany's streets were never particularly dangerous, but according to the Interior Ministry, they are now safer than at any time since statistics have been collected. Reported criminal offenses on the whole dropped by 1.4 percent over 2005 -- to a total of just over 6.3 million. \"The statistics show reductions in crime among children, adolescents and teenagers, as well as adults,\" said Sch\u00e4uble. He added that criminality among foreigners living in Germany also fell, saying that this development reflected Germany's efforts to integrate non-Germans. Drugs offenses were down 7.8 percent, followed by theft and street crime, which both declined by four percent or more. Youth violence Vandalism, on the other hand, was up 5.9 percent. Fraud rose slightly, as did violent crime -- among young people by an alarming 4.5 percent. Berlin Interior Minister Erhart K\u00f6rting said that was part of a decade-long trend in Germany. \"As many experts have pointed out,\" K\u00f6rting said, \"the potential for violence in society is increasing.\" The head of the German Police Officers' Union Konrad Freiberg also said those figures showed that German society was not truly getting safer. Frankfurt tops most-dangerous list Crime was down in Frankfurt am Main, but it's still the German city with the greatest number of criminal offenses person 100,000 people. Hanover was a close second, followed by D\u00fcsseldorf, Bremen and Berlin. The total percentage of criminal cases solved by German police also improved slightly from 55 to 55.4 percent. According to the study, Germany's safest place was Bergisch Gladbach, a city of 100,000 inhabitants in the west of the country -- coincidentally, model Heidi Klum's home town.",
        "generated_story": "State of Crime in Germany: The State of the Union German Chancellor Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble has announced a state of crime in his country. He is calling for the end of state-of-the-union laws and the elimination of all forms of corruption. \"We are going to end the era of double taxation,\" he said in a speech in Frankfurt am Main on Thursday. The government of Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party, which has been in power since 1990, is set to introduce a new law on the use of private money in public office. It is expected to be signed into law in the coming weeks and months. But it is not yet clear whether the new laws will be implemented. In the first half of this year, the CDU will have to decide whether it wants to continue with the current system of tax breaks for individuals and companies, as well as the introduction of anti-money laundering laws for companies and individuals with links to terrorist organizations. Chancellor Merkel has promised to do everything in her power to make Germany a better place for its citizens, but she has yet to announce a date for that date. She has already said that she will not rule out the possibility of a tax break for those who don't have the means to pay. That is, if the Chancellor is willing to sign a bill that would allow the state to take over the tax-exempt status of individuals who have been convicted of crimes, such as tax evasion, money laundering, terrorism, and other crimes committed by members of her own family or close associates of those involved in organized crime. This is something that has not been done before. There is a long list of things that are not covered by the law. For example, there is the fact that the Bundesrat, Germany's national security agency, does not recognize the existence of such a system. What is important is that it has the authority to impose its own laws on people who commit crimes and who do not have access to the information that is available to them. These laws are meant to protect the interests of people, not to punish them for their crimes. They are designed to prevent people from being able to access information and information about their own activities and that of their friends and family. And they are intended to keep the public informed about what is going on in their lives and what they can do about it."

        "target": "All or nothing for Bayern in Champions final Bayern Munich have one last chance to salvage a season that has otherwise been marked by their inability to beat Borussia Dortmund: a win against Chelsea in the Champions League final at their home stadium. All season long, Bayern Munich have been consumed with achieving one goal: reaching the final of the Champions League, held at their own Allianz Arena in Munich, and raising the trophy in front of their home fans. After finishing a distant second place to Dortmund in the Bundesliga and dismally losing to them 5-2 in the German Cup final, Bayern Munich are in a must-win situation Saturday against Chelsea. A loss would be the final straw in a disappointing season for a team that can't stand second place. A win for Bayern would mean redemption, to some extent, for their shortcomings in the league. Key players were rested down the stretch in the Bundesliga, especially before the two legs of Bayern's European semifinal against Real Madrid. That was an indication that Bayern had given up on the league and put all their eggs in one basket, hoping for a big payoff with the Champions League title. The same can be said for the German Cup final against Dortmund: true, Bayern essentially beat themselves by making mistake after mistake, but Bayern could, if they win Saturday, wipe the slate clean. Saving the season Win this match, and all will be forgiven in Munich. Lose, and it will be Bayern's second straight season without a piece of hardware, not to mention the heartbreak of losing the biggest match at Allianz Arena since it opened in 2005. \"We must not even think about [losing],\" said Bayern's Franck Ribery on Thursday. \"If we win the Champions League, then we can forget about not winning the league or the cup, nobody will care about that.\" Bayern are a team that thrives under pressure, and the high stakes of this match will be good for them. Chelsea are a team that showed in their semifinal upset of Barcelona that they can rise to a challenge, even if that challenge is simply holding on against a superior opponent. \"We are not the favorites of the game, we are playing away,\" Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech said on Thursday. \"It is very rare when you have the home team playing in the home stadium, using the home dressing room, so I think the advantage goes to Bayern Munich because of that. But we know we have a chance and we will fight for it.\" But this match will come down to the team that can better take advantage of holes that have been blown in each team's defense due to injuries and suspensions. Filling the gaps Between the two sides, seven starting players will miss out on the final. Chelsea saw Raul Meireles, Ramires, and Branislav Ivanovic each get their third yellow card in the second leg against Barcelona, and captain John Terry was given a straight red. Terry and Ivanovic are fixtures on Chelsea's backline, which was already at half-strength due to hamstring injuries suffered by Gary Cahill and David Luiz. Chelsea coach Roberto di Matteo hopes those two are fit enough for the final, since Chelsea will need all the help they can get in the back. For Bayern, David Alaba and Holger Badstuber - both defenders - and Luiz Gustavo, a defensive midfielder, are also suspended for picking up three yellow cards. The impact of the suspensions will hit Chelsea the most. In addition to a weakened back line, Meireles and Ramires are mainstays on offense, supporting strikers Didier Drogba or Fernando Torres. With Ramires out, Drogba could start as striker, with Torres moving to the wing. At any rate, there is more uncertainty in The Blues' lineup than there is in Bayern's, who will be able to rely on striker Mario Gomez and the dynamic-duo of Arjen Robben and Ribery on the wings as they have all season. Most of the question marks will still be defensive for both teams, but to think that this is an indication of a high-scoring affair on Saturday would be a discredit to both team's last lines of defense. Between the posts Neither side would be competing in the final if it wasn't for the heroics of the teams' keepers. Cech defended against wave after wave of attacks from Barcelona in the semifinal for Chelsea, and Manuel Neuer showed nerves of steel in Bayern's penalty shootout in the final leg against Real Madrid, blocking penalties from Madrid stars Cristiano Ronaldo and Kaka. Chelsea's best shot will be to come out of the gate at a sprint and gain an early advantage against Bayern, who will be doing everything they can to keep their long-cultivated dream-final in their control. Otherwise, Bayern's determination to salvage their season may be enough to carry them through to the trophy ceremony - at home, just like they planned it.

The former Barcelona and Real Madrid midfielder is the man to beat the Bavarians in Sunday's final of the German Cup. \"I'm very happy with the way we've been playing this season. I'm happy that we're going to be able to win this year's competition,\" he told reporters after the match in Munich. He added that he was \"very happy\" with his team's performance against Barcelona, adding that it was a \"big step forward\" in terms of improving their chances of reaching the final. It was also a big step up from last season, when the Blues lost to Barcelona 3-0 in their first match of a four-match Bundesliga campaign. But it wasn't all good news for Bayern, who had to settle for a spot in next season's Europa League quarter-finals. They were eliminated from the competition by Barcelona on aggregate, but they still have a chance to qualify for next year\u2019s final, which will be played at the Allianz Arena in Berlin on Sunday. Barcelona's Fernando Torres and Bayern's Raul Meireles were also on hand to take part, as were Diego Costa and Franck Ribery. Both of them have been on the pitch for some time, and both have had their fair share of criticism for their performances in recent weeks. Costa, for example, has been criticized for his lack of physicality, while Ramires and Torres have also been accused of being too aggressive in front of goal. However, the Spaniard is not the only one who has had a difficult season so far. In his first season in Germany, he has made a name for himself as one of Germany's top goal scorers, scoring twice in each of his last three games. And while he's been praised by the media, it's hard to see him as a player who can be relied upon to score goals. That's not to say he doesn't have his work cut out for him, either. On the other hand, there's also the fact that the Spanish striker has a lot of work to do to help his side win the league and also to get back into the top four in Europe. At the moment, Barcelona are the clear favorites to make it to the last 16. After all, they have the best goal scorer in all of Europe, with Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi among those who have made the most of their time at Bayern. For the record, Ronaldo has scored four goals in this competition, including two against Bayern and one against Manchester United. Ronaldo, meanwhile, scored two goals against his former club, Manchester City, on Saturday."

The Capella case has hampered the Catholic Church's attempts to move on from its myriad of pedophile priest scandals. There has been particular focus in recent months on the Chilean branch of the Catholic Church ignoring and covering up of child abuse by pedophile priest Fernando Karadima during the 1980s and 1990s. Pope Francis wrote a letter to Chileans last week expressing \"shame\" for the affair despite previously defending one of the main alleged offenders behind the cover-up. The Vatican's third-highest ranking official, Cardinal George Pell, is facing trial in Australia on abuse-related charges. aw/kms (AFP, Reuters, dpa)",
        "generated_story": "Catholic priest to face Vatican probe for distributing child pornography Catholic priest Carlo Alberto Capella has been summoned to appear before a Vatican panel to answer questions about his alleged involvement in the sexual abuse of minors. The charges stem from allegations that he sexually abused minors and had sex with them. A Vatican spokesman said on Thursday that the priest, who is accused of sexually abusing minors, had been placed under investigation by the Vatican's Office of the Attorney General (OAG) for Child Pornography. \"The Vatican is looking into the allegations,\" the spokesman, George Pell, said in a statement. He added that \"it is not a crime to distribute pornography and that it is a cardinal's responsibility to protect minors.\" The Vatican also said it was investigating allegations of sexual misconduct with minors under the age of 16 by Capell, a priest who was ordained by Pope Benedict XVI in 1986 and who has since been canonized as a bishop. In a letter to Pope Francis, the Catholic Church said the accusations were \"inaccurate\" and \"not substantiated by any evidence.\" \"We are looking at the evidence and we are going to make a determination as to whether or not there is sufficient evidence to prosecute this priest,\" said Francis. Francis is expected to announce his decision later this week, according to the Associated Press news agency, which first reported the charges. Vatican investigators are also examining the possibility of charges of child abuse. Last year, Francis said he was \"very concerned\" about the alleged abuse, saying it could lead to \"serious consequences\" for the victims. But Francis has yet to rule out the idea of a criminal prosecution, and he has not ruled out a possible plea deal with prosecutors. On Thursday, Vatican prosecutors said they would seek an appeal against the convictions of Capello and two other men who were charged with child sex abuse in 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively. Both men have denied any wrongdoing and have been suspended from their posts pending the outcome of an internal Vatican investigation. They have also been ordered to pay fines of up to $1.5 million (2.6 million euros) to a charity that helps victims of abuse and neglect. Author: Michael Kuebler (AFP, dpa, Reuters)"

        "target": "Heidi hits the Big Screen Heidi, the world famous girl from the Swiss Alps who first appeared in a novel 121 years ago, has hit the big screen in a fresh look. A century after the death of Heidi inventor Johanna Spyri, the lovable Alpine heroine is being portrayed in a new film which replaces grassy slopes and mountainous range with city skyscrapers and city streets. The $ 3.5 million \"Heidi\", funded by the Z\u00fcrich-based film company Vega and directed by German film maker Markus Imboden, is to be launched in Germany on Thursday. The making of the film was one of the highlights of a past year of events including exhibitions, lectures and fireworks celebrating the July 7 2001 centenary of the death of Spyri, whose novel \"Heidi\" sold 20 million copies and has been translated in 50 languages worldwide. It is thought to be one of the most successful books of all times. The book has inspired 17 films, including Shirley Temple\u2019s Oscar winning portrayal of Heidi in 1937 and a Japanese cartoon series. Imboden\u2019s remake is the 18th \"Heidi\" film. Blue hair in Berlin According to Vega, \"the film was transmitted to today\u2019s world without losing sight of the original novel\". But Imboden\u2019s new movie is far from the charming original, with its rosy-cheeked, curly-headed Heidi, delicate Clara and goat-tending shepherd Peter\u2019s frail old grandmother. In the first film, Heidi, who lives happily with her grandfather in a tiny hut in the Swiss Alps is plucked from her contented life by her Aunt Dete to live in a stiff, rich family in the bustling metropolis, Frankfurt. Heidi becomes so home-sick, she starts to sleepwalk and is eventually sent home. But not before she causes confusion in the otherwise prim household and brings laughter in the life of the disabled and homely, Clara. The Heidi in the latest film has blue hair, surfs the net and roams the streets of Berlin. Friend and shepherd Peter sheds his rustic pastimes and whizzes down streets on his mountainbike. Clara is not the weak, lame young girl of the Spyri novel, but a moody Britney Spears wannabe. Aunt Dete is a modern-day stylist living fashionably in the German capital. The new surroundings are a far cry from the tranquil days of cow milking, goat- tending and flower-plucking in the verdant meadows of the Swiss Alps. Transforming the Heidi myth According to a Berlin daily, the remake is a \"refreshing Heidi\", adding that the script writers had managed to transform the Heidi \"myth\" into an independent, self-assured girl and not into a \"transfigured mountain heroine\". However, it is just this portrait of a naive and charming alpine heroine that has made Heidi so popular all over the world. Heidi has become a well-known Swiss brand worldwide. Some 60,000 tourists \u2013 half from Japan \u2013 are said to visit the picturesque wine-growing village in Graubuenden, which boasts the original Heidi House and other Heidi related attractions such as winding mountain trails and pastures. Imboden\u2019s film, which is to be launched in Germany on Thursday, will also open elsewhere in Europe, and may reach fans in Japan and South Korea too. Whether Imboden\u2019s blue-haired, computer savvy Heidi will charm her Asian viewers, however, remains to be seen.",

It's called Heidi House, and it's based on the work of Swiss sculptor Johanna Spyri. The artist Markus Imboden, who is based in Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland, has been working on a project to recreate Heidi's work in Switzerland. \"I'm very happy with the result,\" he said in a video posted on his Facebook page. He said the project was inspired by his own work and that he wanted to create a \"remake\" of his work. In the video, he explains how he came up with his idea for Heidi and how it came about: \"It was a dream come true for me to be able to work on this project. I'm so happy that I finally got the chance to do it.\" The project, which was commissioned by the German company Vega, is set to take place at the end of the year. According to the company's website, it will be held up as part of a series of exhibitions, including a documentary on Heidi, a film about her life in Germany and an exhibition on her work at a museum in Berlin. Heidi has also been invited to visit the museum, where she is staying with her husband and three children. She is also planning a trip to Germany. Her husband, Markus, works for a company called Vega and she has a daughter and a son who are also interested in art. They are currently living in Zurich and are planning to open a gallery in their home city. A new exhibition is planned for the same location, with plans to expand the exhibition to include more than 100,000 objects. There is a chance that Heidi could return to Switzerland in time for her birthday, when she and her family are due to return from a holiday in Japan. However, she will not be returning to her home country of Switzerland until after the festival. This year's exhibition will also feature a selection of works from the artist's personal collection, called \"Heidi House,\" which includes a collection of paintings, sculptures and sculptures."

        "target": "Rethinking the term 'honor killing' The murder of 28-year-old Samia Shahid comes less than two weeks after Qandeel Baloch was killed by her brother. The media was quick to report them as \"honor killings.\" We have to rethink that term, writes Gouri Sharma. When news broke that Samia Shahid, a British-Pakistani woman, had been found dead while visiting relatives in Pakistan at the end of July, mainstream media outlets were quick to report it as an honor killing. It was the second time in two weeks that the media had reported a killing of a woman this way - the first being the murder of Pakistani social media star Qandeel Baloch. There are strong similarities between the cases. Both were murdered in places where they would have felt they were at their safest - in their family homes. It's likely they knew their killers - in Baloch's case, her brother has admitted to strangling her, and Shahid's father and cousin have already been questioned. And as more reports emerge about Shahid's death, it's clear that both were killed because they didn't behave in a way deemed acceptable in a conservative, patriarchal society. 'Deeply offensive' term The debate around terminology in \"honor killings\" isn't new, and after Baloch's murder there were members of the media - such as ABC Australia journalist Juanita Phillips - who decided against using the term, calling it \"deeply offensive\" and referring to it as a \"family killing\" instead. And there are outlets, like the Guardian, that already use inverted commas with the word honor. But some commentators argue that more needs to happen if media consumers are to gain a better understanding of the problem. \"I think an important step for the media would be to refuse to give weight to the term 'honor crimes,'\" said UK-based freelance journalist Shehnaz Khan. \"While it is imperative to highlight that these crimes and murders stem from the roots of misogyny and therefore a false sense of 'honor,' there is absolutely nothing but'shame' within them, as murder is nothing but dishonorable.\" \"The word 'honor' can sometimes carry an almost positive connotation that we are inclined to automatically accept just because it's not happening to us, when the reality is, this a huge problem affecting thousands of girls and women across the world,\" she added. Naming the issue But this isn't a view shared by all journalists. Ruby Hamad, a writer at Australia's Daily Life newspaper, said that the first step in dealing with the issue is naming it. \"There are some deeply patriarchal societies that still limit women's freedom according to old tribal concepts of honor, where, unfairly, the behavior of women reflect on their entire family,\" Hamad said. \"By naming these 'honor killings,' we are acknowledging the role that this misogynistic concept of honor plays, not only in the murders themselves but in these entire societies, and how it entraps both men and women.\" Through the eyes of the perpetrator? There are other issues with the term though. Some have argued that by framing it as such, media outlets are showing the crime through the eyes of the perpetrator - and not through the victim - as they should. And with such cases regularly hitting the headlines, framing is important. The United Nations estimates that around 5,000 women - predominantly from Asia and the Middle East - are killed annually in honor-related crimes, a figure that women's advocacy groups say is closer to 20,000 worldwide. This raises an important cultural element for the media to consider - how far does the term play into cultural stereotypes? \"When honor is considered the most important thing in life, then all family members become expendable,\" Hamad said. \"The collective outweighs the rights of the individual. Does this feed into cultural stereotypes? Perhaps. But that doesn't mean we should pretend that this cultural context isn't there.\" Looking for answers - and alternatives There have been many alternatives put forward by women's advocacy groups, including hate crime, misogynistic murder, femicide and shame killings. But which one should we pick? Al Jazeera for one has decided which one they won't use. \"We are always updating our style guidelines to convey a deeper and more authentic understanding of world affairs. Recent events in Pakistan ignited a healthy debate in Al Jazeera on the term 'honor killings' in particular. Our editors are currently studying alternatives to the term, but'misogynistic murder' is not one of them,\" said an Al Jazeera spokesperson. Terminology in the media matters, and for murders as complex as these, it's the media's responsibility to find a name that better fits the crime. Only then will it become easier to work towards a solution.",
        "generated_story": "Rethinking Honor Killings: A Cultural Perspective A cultural perspective on the death penalty in Pakistan has been published in a book by the author and journalist Samia Shahid. The book is based on an interview with the Pakistani journalist Qandeel Baloch, who was killed in an attack on a house in Lahore, Pakistan in 2008. In the book, the writer describes the incident as an \"act of revenge\" against a Pakistani family. \"It was an act of vengeance against the family of the deceased,\" she writes, adding that it was the first time a family member had been killed by a police officer in the country's history. It was also the last time an officer of Pakistani origin was shot and killed, according to the British newspaper \"The Guardian.\" The story was first reported by The New York Times, but it has since been picked up by other media outlets, including the Guardian, The Independent and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). The Pakistani-born journalist has written extensively about the case, which is being investigated in Australia and New Zealand. She has also written about her experiences as a student at the University of Sydney, where she met her future husband, and how she became involved in politics. Read more: Pakistan's 'honor killings' The author of \"Honor Killers\" is also a member of a group of students from Pakistan who have been charged with murder and attempted murder in connection with a series of attacks on their family members and friends. They have also been accused of involvement in terrorist attacks in other countries, such as Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Iran and North Korea, among others. These allegations have led to calls for the government to take action against those responsible, as well as the families of those who died in those attacks. However, it is not yet clear whether these allegations are true, or whether the perpetrators are still alive and well. According to a report in The Daily Life, a British-Pakistani journalist who has worked for more than 30 years in journalism, she is convinced that the \"honour killings\" are not only politically motivated but that they are also socially motivated. This is a view shared by many Pakistani students and their families. As a result, many of them have become disillusioned with Pakistani society and have turned to social media to express their views."

        "target": "Myanmar Junta Announces Amnesty The junta in Myanmar, also known as Burma, announced an amnesty for more than 7,000 prisoners on Friday, including a few political detainees. The amnesty came on the 21st anniversary of the brutal crackdown of a student-led pro-democracy movement in 1988 and the subsequent seizure of power by the current junta. Journalists were invited to Yangon\u2019s notorious Insein prison on Friday as the authorities released the first batch of prisoners. At least 600 inmates were freed as part of an amnesty for over 7,000 inmates nationwide. Among those released in Yangon were two journalists and 25 political prisoners -- rights groups say this is only 1 percent of the total number of political prisoners held by the military regime. Maung Zarni, a research fellow at the London School of Economics, was \u201chappy for the prisoners who were part of the release\u201d. \u201cThis is a very positive personal development and I am happy they have been released but we need to understand that the junta is using the prisoners\u2019 release as a public relations exercise. It is the 21st anniversary of the military coup so they are using this as a way to pacify political discontent in the country.\u201d Amnesty comes ahead of next year\u2019s polls Myanmar's director general of prisons, Zaw Win, said that the prisoners had been freed so they could take part in next year's polls. In recent months, rights activists, pro-democracy activists and Western countries have cast doubt on the credibility of the planned elections as many key political activists are still in detention. This includes pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who recently began a new 18-month period of house arrest after being found guilty of violating her house arrest order in a widely condemned trial. \u201cThe whole Suu kyi trial is rather unlawful,\u201d said Zarni. \u201cBecause the country does not have an independent judiciary, the judges are just puppets who dance to the tune of the top leadership.\u201d Junta is holding on tightly In 1990, Suu Kyi\u2019s National League for Democracy won Myanmar\u2019s last general election by a landslide. But the junta never recognised the results and has since tightened its control over the country. The 2008 constitution, which was drafted and approved by the military generals, which guarantees the army 25 percent of parliamentary seats, is yet another sign of its desire to consolidate power. \u201cThe military is going to be in power for a long time,\u201d warns Zarni, \u201cbecause they have got control of all the political and economic institutions in the country as well as the entire state of Burma. So with or without elections, this is likely to remain the same.\u201d New Democratic Party formed Meanwhile, a new political party has been formed in Myanmar. The Democratic Party is headed by Mya Than Than Nu, who is the daughter of the country\u2019s first democratically-elected prime minister, U Nu. The party has proposed a power-sharing deal with the military, which would give 40 percent of power to politicians and 60 percent to the military rulers. Harn Yawnghwe, the director of the Brussels-based Euro-Burma Office, doubts the new party stands a chance: \u201cIt is possible that they they would be able to get some votes. But it is not likely, even if they were able to contest the elections freely, that they will be able to form a new government because the military is not prepared to let any party rule.\u201d Democrats should exploit elections He thinks the only way out for the democratic forces in Myanmar is to use the upcoming elections wisely and \u201cto take part in them even if they are against them. I think we have to look at the elections as a process which will lead to democracy -- maybe in few more years.\u201d The National League for Democracy has indicated that it will not take part in the polls unless all Myanmar\u2019s political prisoners, including Suu Kyi, are released. Suu Kyi\u2019s lawyers have filed an appeal against the extension of her house arrest and the court is expected to give a ruling on October 2. But few are hopeful that the junta will amnesty her anytime soon. Author: Disha Uppal Editor: Anne Thomas",

The UN's environment agency has called for an urgent roll-back on harmful substances and fossil fuels. In its report \"Healthy Environment, Health People,\" the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), the World Health Organization and several other environment organizations said that, in 2012, an estimated 12.6 million deaths were attributable to deteriorating environment conditions. The largest numbers of deaths took place in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific regions, followed by sub-Saharan Africa, where around a quarter of deaths were likely caused byair pollution, chemicals, climate change and a lack of access to sanitation. \"By depleting the ecological infrastructure of our planet and increasing our pollution footprint, we incur an ever-growing cost in terms of human health and well-being,\" said UNEP Executive Director Achim Steiner. He added that humanity's life support systems had been compromised by globalization and powerful economic interests. The report was released during UN climate talks in the German city of Bonn which are drawing up rules pertaining to the Paris agreement, which seeks to lower carbon emissions. The document suggested that several drivers were responsible for the threat to human health, including ecosystem disruption, climate change, inequality, unhealthy and wasteful lifestyles, along with unsustainable consumption and production. Worsening effects UNEP estimated that an extra 250,000 deaths could occur each year between 2030 and 2050 as a result of climate change, leading to malnutrition, malaria, diarrhea and heat stress. Between them air pollution and a lack of access to clean water and sanitation cause almost 8 million premature deaths each year. Environmental impacts are responsible for the deaths of more than one quarter of all children under the age of five, the report states. UNEP called for governments to act to remove harmful substances from working environments, reduce the use of carbon fuels and rely instead on renewable energy, and change lifestyles to allow a more sustainable use of the world's resources. The report also called for a bigger investment to protect the planet's natural ecosystem. UNEP predicted a further increase in emerging zoonotic diseases (spread between animals and humans), and called on developing countries, in particular, to prioritize prevention methods. \"Never before have so many animals been kept by so many people - and never before have so many opportunities existed for pathogens to pass through the biophysical environment and wild animals to livestock and people,\" the report warned.",

The report, published on Thursday by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), found that more than one-quarter of all deaths from climate change are attributable to the use of pesticides and herbicides. This figure is up from 1.6 percent in 2015, the WHO said in a statement. \"We are very concerned about the impact of environmental pollution on the health of our people and our planet,\" said WHO Director-General Achim Steiner, adding that it was \"unacceptable\" that so many people were suffering from the effects of the chemicals in their food and drinking water. He added that \"it is unacceptable\" for people to live in an environment in which they are exposed to toxic chemicals, such as mercury and lead, which can lead to cancer and other forms of cancer. In addition, he said, \"there is a risk that people will die from exposure to these chemicals.\" The WHO report also said that over a third of children under the age of five die because of a combination of factors, including high levels of greenhouse gas emissions, high temperatures and a lack of sunlight. These factors contribute to a high level of mortality in children and young people, according to WHO figures released on Wednesday. Among the reasons cited for the rise in deaths is the fact that children are more likely to be born prematurely than those who are not born at all. Experts say this is because children's brains are less sensitive to chemicals than adults, and because they have more time to develop their own immune systems. According to experts, this could be a result of an increased risk of developing diseases. However, experts say it is still too early to say whether this will be the case for all children born in developing countries."

A spokesperson for the organization said that \"names that are used for animal-based products should without a doubt also be legal to use for vegetarian substitute products.\" More meatless 'whatever-you-want-to-call-thems' The market for vegetarian and vegan dishes has grown steadily in the past few years in Germany, partly at the expense of the meat industry. According to a research paper by the Institute for the Study of Trade (IfH), revenue for vegetarian and vegan products in Germany was 454 million euros ($474 million) in 2015 and grew by more than 100 percent between 2010 and 2015. In the same time period, the demand for meat products fell by almost 10 percent. mb/sms (dpa, epd)",

The move comes as a surprise to the German Farmers Association, which represents farmers in Lower Saxony and Upper Rhine-Westphalia. \"We have decided that we are going to stop selling vegetables,\" said Schmidt in a statement released by the association on Thursday. He added that the decision was made \"in light of the fact that it was the first time we had ever sold vegetables in Germany.\" The statement came after a German newspaper published a report on the ministry's decision, saying it would be the last time farmers would sell vegetables from their fields. Schmidt's announcement came just days after the weekly Bild newspaper reported that Germany's farmers' association had approved a new crop of vegetables to be sold in the country. According to Bild, the move is part of a plan to reduce the number of greenhouse gas emissions from greenhouse gases in agriculture by up to 30 percent by 2020. German farmers, who have traditionally relied on vegetables as their main source of income, have been forced to cut back on meat production in recent years due to a lack of demand for meat products. In an interview published on Wednesday, Schmidt said he was \"very happy\" with the results. However, he added, \"I am also very disappointed that there is not more meat in our produce.\" Schmidt also said that he would not sell any vegetables that were not already in production, such as tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers, onions, celery, parsley, radishes and parsnips. 'We are very happy with this decision,' he said, adding that \"it is the right thing to do.\" \"It is a good decision for us to make,\" he told the newspaper."

Stephen Harper has stepped down as leader of the Conservatives after nine years in the top job. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper resigned as Conservative Party leader on Tuesday after the Liberals, led by Justin Trudeau, emerged victorious in legislative elections. \"I have spoken to Prime Minister Stephen Harper, and he has instructed me to reach out to the newly elected parliamentary caucus to appoint an interim leader,\" Conservative Party president John Walsh said in a statement. \"The people are never wrong,\" Harper said of his defeat. \"The disappointment is my responsibility and mine alone,\" Harper said, adding that he had called Trudeau to congratulate him. Trudeau calls for hopeful, diverse future In electing Trudeau, the charismatic son of a former popular prime minister, Canadian voters illustrated the growing discontent with nine years of Conservative rule that saw lowering of corporate taxes, avoidance of climate change legislation and disagreement with the Obama administration over the controversial Keystone XL pipeline. \"Canadians have spoken,\" Trudeau said, adding that he would be the man to lead the \"hopeful, positive\" country \"with a vision\" that they had asked for. In his victory speech, Trudeau said his government \"believed deeply in the diversity of our country,\" striking a contrast with the strain of nativism that had become apparent under Conservative rule. \"We beat fear with hope,\" said Trudeau, a 43-year-old former teacher. Liberals blow past projected results Projections ahead of the elections had Harper and Trudeau in a dead heat, but as polls closed on Monday night it became clear that the Liberals had won an outright majority, with a projected 175 of parliament's 338 seats. This represented a huge leap from four years ago when Liberals were handed their most crushing defeat in history with a mere 34 seats. Harper will stay on as a member of Parliament for his constituency, public broadcaster CBC reported, as he was re-elected to his seat. The left-leaning New Democratic Party had hoped to capitalize on its second-place finish in 2011, but only managed to come in third with CBC estimating that the party had garnered 32 seats. es/cmk (AP, Reuters) Have something to say?

Harper, who has been in office for more than a year, announced his resignation on Thursday. The announcement came as Harper's Conservative Party (CPP) announced the resignation of its leader, Justin Trudeau, on the eve of the federal election. \"We are deeply saddened by the loss of our leader,\" Harper said in a statement released by his office. He added that the party would continue to work closely with the government in Ottawa to ensure the country's future is secure. His resignation comes less than two weeks after the Conservatives announced they would no longer be able to form a government without the support of a majority of their parliamentary caucus, which includes the opposition Liberals, the Socialists and the Greens, as well as a number of other political parties, including the United States, Canada, Mexico and South Africa. In addition, Harper also announced he would not seek re-election in the 2019 election, saying he was \"deeply disappointed\" with his party's performance in recent months. Trudeau said he had \"no plans\" to run for the leadership of his own party in 2019, adding that \"the party will continue its efforts to build a strong, united and inclusive government.\" Harper had been a staunch critic of Trudeau's government, arguing that it was too slow to act on its promises to the Canadian people, and that his policies were too weak to meet the needs of Canadians. But he also said his government would do everything in its power to protect the interests of all Canadians, regardless of whether they voted for him or against him. A spokesman for Harper told the CBC news agency that Harper would be stepping down at the end of this month, but did not elaborate on his reasons for leaving the job. Canadian media have been reporting on Harper\u2019s resignation for months, with some reports suggesting he may have taken a leave of absence in order to focus on other matters, such as health care, education and social issues. Some media reports have suggested Harper could be replaced by a Liberal candidate, while others have speculated he could take a break from politics altogether."

He urged them to stop fighting. \"We hope the Houthis will come to their senses and realize the interests of Yemen and the Yemeni people should be the top priority for everyone,\" he said. It is unclear whether the Houthis would reciprocate the Saudi gesture. \"The cease-fire will end should Houthis or their allies not live up to the agreement - this is a chance for the Houthis to show that they care about their people and they care about the Yemen people,\" the Saudi foreign minister emphasized.

Lately, the northern Yemeni province of Saada has become a battleground for the Shiite rebels and the Saud-led coalition forces as the Houthis carried out border attacks on nearby Saudi cities. More than 50 airstrikes hit Saada overnight and in the early hours of Friday morning, Yemeni officials said. A Saudi-led coalition of Arab states launched an air campaign against the Houthis on March 26. Riyadh accuses Tehran of backing the rebels, who have made significant territorial gains in the impoverished Middle Eastern country, capturing the capital Sanaa and ousting internationally recognized President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, who fled Yemen back in March. The Sunni Gulf states are wary of Iran's increasing influence in the region, and they see the Houthis' advance in Yemen as a move that threatens their regional and geopolitical interests.

Houthi-led forces have seized large swaths of territory, including the capital, Sanaa, and the southern port city of Aden, according to the Saudi-owned Saudi Press Agency (SPA) news agency. However, Riyadh has yet to announce a date for the ceasefire, which is expected to take place in mid-May. A UN-brokered ceasefire brokered by the US, France, Russia and Iran last month ended in a stalemate over the conflict, with both sides saying they would stick to their commitments to halt the fighting until a ceasefire was reached. Yemen has been embroiled in civil war since 2011, when the government of President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi was ousted from power by Shiite rebels. Since then, the two sides have been at loggerheads over how to deal with each other. Both sides say they are willing to work together to reach a deal, while the other side says they will continue to push for a truce until the end of this year. In a statement released on Wednesday, Saudi officials said they had reached a \"framework agreement\" between the sides on the cessation of fighting. They added that they were \"convinced that there would be no further escalation of hostilities\" and that \"there was no need for escalation.\" The Saudi statement also said that Riyadh would continue its efforts to broker an end to fighting, but that it was not clear how long it would take. US Secretary of State John Kerry, who is visiting Yemen this week, called on Riyadh to provide \"all necessary support\" to Yemen in its ongoing conflict.

The court heard testimony from the head of Brazil's delegation to the Rio Olympics, Juliana Leal de Melo, on Thursday. \"I have been released from prison and will be able to return to Ireland in the coming days,\" said Patrick, adding that he was \"very happy\" with his release. Hiccup's release comes after he had been arrested on suspicion of bribery, fraud and other charges in connection with the 2014 Olympic Games in Sao Paulo, Brazil. In a statement released by the OOC, the Brazilian government said it had found no evidence of any wrongdoing and that the case against him had not been proven to be politically motivated. It was not immediately clear whether the charges were related to his alleged involvement in a bribery scheme, but the EOC said they were not aware of it at the time of his arrest. Ireland is one of only a handful of European countries to have a president who has not yet been charged with bribery. However, it is not the first time that Ireland has had to deal with a high-profile bribery scandal. Last year, Ireland was accused of paying bribes to Brazilian officials in exchange for the release of its president, who was later convicted and sentenced to life in prison for bribery and fraud. That case was referred to as a \"technical matter\" and was brought to trial by a Brazilian court, which ruled in favor of a plea deal. A trial date has yet to set in stone, and the trial is expected to take place later this year. Following the verdict, a number of IOC members have already been granted bail, including former President Jacques Chirac and current IOC president Guido Westerwelle. At the end of last year's trial, French President Nicolas Sarkozy said he would appeal the decision, saying it would be \"difficult\" for him to appeal."

Twenty years later, relations between Libya and Europe have done an about-face. The Berlin disco \"La Belle\" was packed as usual on the night of April 5, 1986. Among its guests were many US soldiers, who were certainly not thinking of politics, the Middle East or strained relations between the United States and Libya. But reality caught up with them: a bomb detonated near the dance floor that night, killing two Americans and a Turkish woman. Over 200 people were injured. A Berlin court ruled that Libya and its intelligence services were responsible for the bombing. In 2001, following a nearly four-year long trial, the judges convicted a Libyan diplomat and three others to prison sentences between 12 and 14 years. The big oil-exporting country in the meantime was busy working on its reputation. Already in the 1990s, Tripoli began striving to improve its relations to the European Union. Financial reparation opened the door to Europe In 2004, the Gaddafi International Foundation for Charity Associations and the legal representatives of the German La Belle victims settled on $35 million in compensation. This opened the door to Europe. Just a few weeks later, Germany's chancellor at the time, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, visited Moammar Gadhafi in a traditional Bedouin tent outside of Tripoli. Britain's Prime Minister Tony Blair also paid Gadhafi a visit. A few months earlier, in April 2004, the European Union had welcomed the Libyan leader to Brussels. It was Gadhafi's first official visit to Europe in 15 years. Bernd Westphal, the German ambassador to Libya, said bilateral relations had been through difficult times. \"The German Embassy in Tripoli today is working for a quick return to the liveliness of close relations between Germany and Libya,\" Westphal said. \"We want to build on our traditional friendship with Libya and we want to strengthen the political, economic and cultural cooperation between our two countries and peoples.\" Business interests booming in Libya In the past few years, Libya has moved from being the supporter of international terrorism to an attractive economic partner for the West. European business representatives have been increasingly knocking on Libya's door. Even the United States is showing increased interest in the northern African nation.

Last year, Germany exported goods to Libya worth 657.7 million euros ($805.7 million), according to the German Federal Statistics Office. \"The economy is the driving power in German-Libyan relations,\" said Abdulaati in an interview with the Arab-German association for trade and industry. But Germany isn't the only European country making deals in Libya. France last month signed an accord with Libya on peaceful nuclear research. \"This accord represents a qualitative leap in relations between the two countries and proves that Libya has transformed its weapons of mass destruction into constructive weapons,\" Public Works Minister Maatuk Maatuk said at the signing ceremony in March. \"We are telling the world that we are moving towards the development of Libyan nuclear technology for peaceful purposes.\" This week, the Netherlands' Economics Minister Laurens Jan Brinkhorst will visit Libya to negotiate gas and oil agreements.

However, he added, \"we are also very concerned about the security situation in our own country.\" The move comes at a time when the Libyan government is struggling to cope with an influx of refugees from neighboring countries and with a growing number of attacks on its own territory. In the past few months, the government of Libyan President Moammar Gadhafi has made it clear that his regime will not be tolerated by the international community. This has led to a rise in tension between German and Libyan officials, as well as the rise of militant groups. On Thursday, German Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der announced that Germany would shut down its diplomatic mission to Libya until the end of this year. He said the move was part of a concerted effort by Libyan authorities to secure the release of political prisoners, including former Prime Minister Said Abdulaati, who was killed in a shootout with security forces in 2011. Germany's foreign ministry also announced the closure of its consulate in Benghazi, Libya, for a year and a half, in order to prevent the transfer of detainees to other countries, according to German public statistics office La Belle, which tracks migration to and from the Middle East.

Bremen's state SPD leadership is to hold talks later on Wednesday with the CDU, which polled 25.7 percent. After an SPD meeting in Bremen, Mayor Jens B\u00f6hrnsen made the first signal he could be favoring the Greens. He said that during the campaign he had deliberately abstained from mentioning the possibility of a renewed CDU coalition because \"after 12 years it shouldn't automatically be continued.\" Bremen's acting head of government and CDU member Thomas R\u00f6wekamp, however, warned against an SPD-Green coalition. \"The majority of people don't want a red-green experiment, but a continuation of the grand coalition,\" he said.

The federal Bundesrat, which is made up of state cabinet members, has to approve the majority of legislative bills passed by the lower chamber, the Bundestag, before they become law. Also, any proposed constitutional changes require two-thirds of all votes in order to be passed by the Bundesrat. The CDU and SPD currently hold 47 of the Bundesrat's 69 seats, which is one seat more than the necessary two-thirds majority. But without Bremen, the number held by the grand coalition would fall to 44 seats, meaning they would need the cooperation of one of the small opposition parties for any constitutional changes. Internal strife Earlier in the week, Chancellor Merkel called for unity within her ruling left-right coalition after the losses in Bremen set the stage for more infighting between the two parties. Merkel also warned the SPD against moving to the left after it lost some five percent points. The chancellor said the outcome showed the SPD had made a mistake by attacking the coalition and campaigning on promises of a minimum wage, which she believes will hamper efforts to fight unemployment of just under 10 percent. \"The result showed that this strategy did not pay off,\" Merkel told a press conference.",
        "generated_story": "Merkel's coalition of Social Democrats and Greens could block reforms Chancellor Angela Merkel's CDU party is set to form a coalition government in the German state of Bremen on Sunday. The Greens, the center-left coalition partner, have said they will block any changes to the country's welfare system. They said on Thursday that they would oppose any reforms to Germany's health care system, which has been criticized by critics as too lenient. \"We are not going to allow this to happen,\" the Greens party said in a statement, adding that it would be \"unacceptable\" if the reforms were to be blocked by the federal government. Chancellor Merkel has said she would not allow the reform to pass without the approval of the Bundesrat, a parliamentary body set up by her conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party. Merkel, who is also a member of parliament for the Christian Social Union, has called for a \"grand coalition\" of conservatives and centrists to take over the caretaker government of Germany. She has also called on the government to introduce a tax on high-income earners, as well as an end to subsidies for low-wage workers. But the chancellor's conservative coalition is unlikely to agree to such a move, according to a poll released on Friday. A poll published on Monday showed that the SPD had the largest share of votes in Bundestag elections, with a majority of voters casting their ballots in favor of a lower tax rate for high earners and lower taxes for middle class earners. It is the first time in German history that a chancellor has led the opposition to an increase in taxes on low earners since the end of World War II, and it is only the second time since that period that Germany has seen a rise in income inequality. That is, until now, only a small percentage of German households have been able to afford to pay a living wage, while the rest have had to live with the high cost of living. This is not to say that Merkel and her conservatives will not work together, but they have a common goal: to make Germany a better place for young people and for older people. In addition, they want to reduce the number of people with disabilities living in poverty and improve the quality of life for those who are unable to work. These are the two main reasons why Germany is a poor country and that is because of its high unemployment rate and high levels of poverty."

The move follows a political protest at the first such match. In a statement released on Friday, the German football association (DFB) announced that the games would be rescheduled for 2018 and that talks would take place between them and their Chinese counterparts in order explore how to move forward. \"To the regret of all parties involved, the project has not received the broad approval that had been expected,\" the DFB said. \"In fact, the project was used by a handful of spectators to send messages that were considered hurtful by the Chinese team, officials, the Chinese Football Association's support staff and Chinese spectators.\" Protests in opening match The first of the arranged matches, against TSV Schott Mainz of the fourth-tier Regionalliga S\u00fcdwest was interrupted midway through the first half when the Chinese players left the field because a small group of activists had unfurled Tibetan flags. The team later returned to the field after the flags had been taken down, before succumbing to a 3-0 defeat. On Monday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry strongly criticized the protest. Initially, it had been thought that the Chinese side would play in the Regionalliga S\u00fcdwest - a regional division of Germany's fourth tier which has only 19 teams but the plan was revised so the matches would just be friendlies. This followed an agreement signed in 2016 between the German FA and the Chinese government to help boost the sport in the Asian country, where the Bundesliga is increasingly popular.

But the protests, and potential for further disruption, seem to be behind the cancellations - the DFB said both federations were aware of \"substantial evidence of further escalation,\" FSV Frankfurt, who were due to host the Chinese side on Saturday, said earlier this week that they would not ban protests despite an angry response to last week's incident from Beijing. \"We will not back a single centimeter off the basic rights our our democracy, including those relating to freedom of speech,\" FSV Frankfurt President Michael G\u00f6rner said in an interview with the Stuttgarter Nachrichten and Stuttgarter Zeitung newspapers.

The event, which was scheduled to take place at the weekend, was canceled by the Chinese Foreign Ministry on Friday. Football association spokesman Ronny Zimmerman said the cancellation was \"inappropriate\" and \"unacceptable.\" \"We regret to inform you that we have canceled the event,\" he said in an interview with the German news agency Stuttgarter Zeitung. \"It is inappropriate for us to cancel this event because it is not in our national interest to play in this competition.\" The cancellation comes a day after the World Cup qualifier between Germany's TSV Schott Mainz and the Russian side Rostov-on-Don was also canceled. According to a statement from the FSB, the decision was made after a dispute between the two sides over the registration of a team for the 2018-19 season. It was not immediately clear whether the match would be rescheduled for Saturday or Sunday. A spokesman for FSV Frankfurt, Michael G\u00f6rner, said it was a \"difficult decision,\" adding that the club had \"no plans\" to reschedule the game. He also said that there were no plans to hold a press conference on the matter, but that it would not be decided until the tournament was over. German media reported that a number of players had been arrested in connection with Saturday's protests, including one who was allegedly involved in a fight with a police officer, and another who allegedly tried to break up a football match between his team and a rival team. In the end, Germany and China were able to agree on a date to resume the competition. However, there was no immediate word on whether or not the team would return to Germany, according to the DPA, citing \"technical reasons.\" German football associations have also been criticized for their handling of protests in recent weeks. Last week, a group of Chinese students staged an anti-government demonstration outside the city of Wormatia Worms in western Germany. They were also accused of throwing stones at police officers, injuring one of them and throwing bottles at a bus full of students. Some of those students, who were protesting against the move, were later arrested and charged with trespassing and disorderly conduct, while others were found to be in possession of weapons and other contraband."

German auto club ADAC says costs associated with owning a car have risen more than 40 percent since 1995. In 2010, German car owners had to pay a high price for their mobility, according to ADAC, which cited record-high fuel prices as the major cost factor. \"For drivers, 2010 will go down in history as the most costly year ever,\" ADAC said in a statement. High taxes The cost of acquiring and operating a car has risen 42 percent since 1995, compared to a 24 percent increase in the general cost of living. Due to tax increases and higher production costs, fuel prices soared 86 percent over the 15-year period. In 2010 alone, the average price for a liter of super gasoline was more than 1.40 euros ($1.84) - the highest the average price ever. According to ADAC, urban singles spent an average of 3,340 euros on their cars in 2000. Five years later, that figure had jumped to 3,900 euros. By the end of 2010, their expenses reached 4,380 euros, or 1,000 euros more than a decade earlier. Driving is also pricey for four-person families with two cars. According to the automobile club, their annual costs have risen 30 percent over the past 10 years from 5,940 euros to 7,740 euros. Taxes account for the lion's share of gasoline and diesel prices. The German government's mineral oil and value added taxes account for nearly 88 cents of the 1.35-euro price of a liter of fuel. Low toll revenue While the German government reaps more revenue year for year from vehicle-related taxes, income generated by its highway toll for trucks is expected to fall this year for the first time since the haulage charges were introduced in 2005.

ADAC, the Association of German Automobile Clubs (ADAC), estimates that the average German car club costs more than 1,000 euros ($1,200) a year to operate. The association said the costliest year for car clubs in the country was in 2007, when they spent 1.5 billion euros (1.6 billion dollars) to run their car dealerships in Germany. \"This is a record for a German automobile club, and it's not just because of the high cost of running a car dealership. It's also because the costs of operating a dealership are so high,\" the group said in a statement on its website, adding that it was \"not a coincidence that this year we're at the top of our list.\" \"It's because we have a lot of money to spend on our cars and we want to make sure that we don't overspend on things that are important to our customers,\" it added, referring to the number of cars sold each year and the amount of time it takes the club to complete a project. This year, however, it will be the first year that a club has been able to successfully complete the project without losing money. In the past year alone, there have been a total of 3.4 million car registrations. That's up from the previous year's record of 2.2 million registrations, which was set in 1999. Last year was also the highest-ever for the association, with a figure of 4.7 million registered vehicles sold. However, that figure is down from 5.8 million in 2006, according to a report by the German automotive magazine \"AutoGuide.com.\" The report also said that in 2008, car owners had to pay more for their cars than they had in previous years, while car-sharing companies such as Volkswagen, BMW and Mercedes-Benz were the only ones to do so. And that was before the financial crisis hit the auto industry in 2009 and 2010. Since then, cars have become more and more expensive to drive and there's been an increase in demand for new models. But that doesn't necessarily mean that cars are less expensive. There's a reason for that, as well as the fact that there are more cars on the road than there used to be. What's more important is that they're more efficient than ever before. They're also more flexible in terms of pricing. For example, if you're buying a new car, you can get a better price for it than you would for an old one. You can also buy a brand new one for less than 100 euros."

Both are currently serving life sentences for crimes committed against humanity. They were released in July after serving their sentences in absentia for a number of offenses. Among them: torture, rape, sexual assault, torture and murder. These are among the harshest sentences ever imposed on US prisoners at the Guantanamo prison, which is located on the island of Cuba's southern coast. At the time of their release, US officials said they had no evidence that any of them had committed any crimes. A US official told the Associated Press news agency that Obama's announcement was \"a positive step\" in his efforts to end the war on terror.

If they at least believed that they could really benefit their country by withdrawing from the EU. But many of the parliamentarians whose vote will finally set Brexit on its wayhave voted against their hearts, as well as their minds. It was a vote against their minds, because the withdrawal from the EU will almost certainly, at least on a short to medium term basis, have negative repercussions for the British economy. And it was a vote against their hearts, because for many, a view of the future, divorced from Brussels and increasingly reliant on an unpredictable US President Donald Trump, is somewhat alarming. In recent days, many members of parliament have described it as \"a catastrophe.\" No vote \"against the will of the people.\" Of course there are \"Brexiteers\" who believe that a Britain independent of Brussels will be able to return to its former greatness, once it is no longer held back by the \"Little Europeans.\" But they are in the minority - the majority of parliamentarians already declared their support for remaining in the EU during the referendum campaign. Yet despite this, Theresa May's government was able to push its legislative proposal through the House of Commons without any great difficulty. The predominant view, also amongst members of the two leading parties, is that to hinder Brexit and to fail to support the government in its endeavors to do so, would be to go \"against the will of the people.\" Anti-EU newspapers have targeted Brexit opponents. And those who have publically come out in support of the EU have had to reckon with death threats. The at times passionate debate in the lower house, that went on over several days, was a temporary highlight in this European tragedy, which in the worst case could contribute to the continent disintegrating into individual sovereign states. Don't be intimidated The British public supports the hard-line position taken by Prime Minister May in withdrawing from the common market. Polls are showing that her strategy is gaining increased support. There is no turning back now. The British are now looking for clarity on the repercussions of their withdrawal from the EU. They want the negotiations with the EU to start as soon as possible. It was an historical misjudgement by David Cameron that he could win the referendum. Most of the members of the lower house believed the then-prime minister and voted to hold a referendum. But now they can no longer stop Brexit. But they should not let themselves be intimidated by party discipline, nor the leading Brexiteers, nor by voter impatience. Over the next two years they should use every chance they can to influence the withdrawal process.

Prime Minister Theresa May has said that the vote will be a \"yes\" vote. \"We have decided that we are going to vote in the referendum,\" May told the House of Commons on Thursday. The referendum will take place on March 29, the day after Britain leaves the EU. May said she was confident that she would be able to win over the majority of voters who want to see Britain leave the bloc. However, she added that there was \"no doubt\" that Britain would have to accept the terms of its withdrawal from the 28-nation bloc if it wanted to remain in a free and open Europe. She also pointed to the fact that EU leaders had already agreed to allow the UK to stay in an EU-wide free trade agreement until the end of this year. But she also stressed that this would not be the first time that a deal was reached between the US and Britain. In a statement released by the government on Wednesday, May stressed the importance of \"a peaceful and orderly transition of power,\" adding that \"it is the right thing to do.\" May's announcement came after the British parliament voted in favor of a no-confidence motion in her government, which is expected to be approved by a majority vote of no confidence in May. It was the second time in three years that May had been forced to back out of negotiations with Brussels over a controversial divorce deal. That deal, however, did not go through as planned, and it was not the last time the two sides had a chance to reach an agreement on a divorce. Brexit is not a question of 'yes' or 'no.' It is a debate about the future of our country and how it should be governed. There is no such thing as an \"open and transparent\" referendum, but it is an open, transparent and fair process that will allow Britain to decide what kind of terms it wants to stick to as long as it has a good deal of freedom of movement in Europe and the United States. This is something that can only be done if the parties agree to a fair and just way of dealing with each other. And that is what this referendum is all about: the free movement of people. What is important is that people have the opportunity to make their own decisions about what they want and what is acceptable to them. We have a lot to learn from this vote and we will continue to work hard to get it right."

Klaus is the first artist and publisher to publish a book about the subject. His work has been published in several languages, including German, French, Italian, Spanish and Spanish. He has also published a collection of books on the topic. The first volume of his work was published by Klaus in 2006. It is based on Klaus's work on a series of drawings, which he created with the help of a team of artists and publishers. In 2006, Klaus published his first book, \"The Art of Water,\" in collaboration with his wife and two children. Since then Klaus has published more than 30 books, and his latest book is titled \"Water for Water.\" Klaus' work focuses on water chemistry, the process by which water is dissolved in water to form a liquid that is then absorbed into the body and stored in the liquid until it dissolves. \"It is a process that takes a long time to complete,\" Klaus says, adding that it takes about a year and a half before the product is ready to be used for use in everyday life. This process is called \"no-detox water,\" and it is used to clean up water from the surface of the water and then to store it in a special container for a longer period of time. According to Klaus, this process can take up to three to four weeks, but it does not take long at all for water molecules to break down and dissolve into water. For example, if you have a glass of wine, you can pour it on top of your glass. If you don't have one, then you're not drinking it. You're drinking the wine. That's the way it's supposed to go. And that's what we're doing. We're going to try to make it as easy as possible for people to drink our water without having to worry about whether or not it will work for them. So we'll see if we can get it to work. What do you think? What does it do to your body? Does it make you feel better about yourself? Is it a good thing that you've been drinking water for so long? It's not a bad thing. I think it makes you a better person. But it doesn't do anything for you. There's a lot of work that goes into making sure that everything you drink is safe and that the people who drink it are happy and healthy. When it comes to water, there's no doubt about that. Just like with any other product, it has a certain amount of toxins in it that are harmful to the environment and can lead to cancer and other diseases that can be fatal to people's health. As a result, people are more likely to die than they are to live longer and healthier lives."

        "target": "A Brief History of the Seaside Holiday These days, millions take seaside holidays for granted as one of life's pleasures. But 200 years ago, a dip in the sea was more a test of courage. Hardly anyone could swim. As late as the 18th century, many Europeans still thought of the sea as the realm of Satan: storm-tossed and inhabited by terrifying monsters. \"Unlike the mountains, the coasts were terra incognita as a holiday spot,\" says Manfred B\u00e4tje, director of the Bade-Museum on the North Sea island of Norderney. Anyone who set foot in the water was \"stepping into the unknown\". Brighton showed the way That only began to change after the British aristocracy discovered the healing power of salt water. As early as 1780, Brighton, England's biggest and oldest seaside resort, was a bustling spa. Philosopher and physicist Georg Christoph Lichtenberg (1742-1799) of G\u00f6ttingen gave Germans the starting signal with his 1793 essay \"Why doesn't Germany have any large public seaside resorts?\" In it, he called for the creation of a resort in Cuxhaven on the North Sea. He received support from the most notable German physician of the time, the Prussian king's court physician, Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland. But things turned out somewhat differently. Germany's first seaside resort was indeed built in September, 1793, but in Heiligendamm on the Baltic Sea. Four years later, permission was granted for construction of Germany's first resort on the North Sea, on Norderney. \"For the first bathing season on July and August of 1800, only around 250 guests turned up. Now, the nearly 6000 residents host a good 530,000 bathers annually, plus around 230,000 day-trippers,\" B\u00e4tje reels off the figures. Romanticist inspiration In the 19th century, the landscapes of Caspar David Friedrich, such as his famous Chalk Cliffs on R\u00fcgen (1818), gave seaside holidays added impetus. From then on, the sea was no longer a voracious beast. From the shore, the cultivated, modern European contemplated the vast melancholy of the deep. \"The calm sea became an embodiment of unspecified yearning, the waves an expression of vitality and dynamism,\" soliloquizes museum director B\u00e4tje. But the journey to the sea long remained an arduous, time-consuming one. It took the mail coach a good thirty hours to cover the distance from Hamburg to the North Frisian town of Aurich over bumpy, muddy roads. The express cab from Bremen only took about 16 hours to reach the East Frisian town of Norden - including six changes of horses along the way. \"It wasn't comfortable,\" explains B\u00e4tje. Not until the introduction of seaside tourist steamers out of Hamburg and Bremen to the islands and the expansion of the railways did the journey become easier. Strict bathing rules At first, it was primarily the well-to-do bourgeois and nobility who were able to afford a seaside holiday. Victorian-era society is known for its extreme prudishness, and the beach was not exempt. Bathing machines were essentially changing cabins on wheels that could be rolled into the surf. The sexes were kept strictly separated. Wet swimsuits could not be allowed to cling, thus revealing the body's contours. Women sported baggy flannel garments with bloomers underneath that swiftly became waterlogged to where the bather was risking her life. Hardly anyone really knew how to swim anyway. \"Most bathers wouldn't stay in the water any more than two minutes, often just seconds at a time. The English had a rule: 'Three dips and out',\" quips archivist Manfred B\u00e4tje, whose Bade-Museum is housed in a building for a former wave pool, just a few steps from Norderney's Weststrand, where, during the summer months, vacationers sunbathe in wicker beach chairs and on blankets, cooled by a salty sea breeze. Sunbathing first came in style early in the 20th century, and the first true swimsuits were produced in the United States. \"Starting in 1919, today's bathing culture gradually began to take shape,\" B\u00e4tje looks back. At the same time, ideals of beauty were in flux - such as the attitude towards tan skin, which had long been regarded as a mark of farmers and manual laborers. B\u00e4tje: \"People were still cultivating their genteel pallors.\" Water, Waves, Wellness Today, the sun worshipers are the devout masses, and seaside holidays are their pilgrimages. The North Sea resorts alone count some 12.9 million overnight stays annually. Health is once again a primary concern: sea air, sea water, sea salts and the algaes and mud used in",
        "generated_story": "A Brief History of the Seaside Holiday in Germany The Bade-Museum in Norderney, Germany, is a museum dedicated to the history of Germany's seaside holiday. The museum's curator, Manfred B\u00e4tje, has written a book on the subject. It's called \"The Sea Holiday\" and is based in the German town of Bremen, near the coast of England. \"This is the first time in German history that the sea holiday has been celebrated in a public setting,\" he wrote in an e-mail to his colleagues. He added that it was \"a great honor\" for the museum to be able to showcase the work of its director, who is also a professor of history at the University of G\u00f6ttingen. In his book, the curator explains how the \"sea holiday\" was celebrated by the British, French, German and Dutch, as well as the Dutch. His book is titled \"Sea Holiday: A History Of Germany,\" and it's based on a collection of German, British and French maritime history, including the voyages to and from the islands of Cuxhaven and Rhineland-Palatinate and the Rhine.

The lockdown was lifted following an active-shooter incident on Friday. Officials said the incident occurred at a military facility outside the capital. \"We are aware of the situation and we are working closely with our military partners,\" Obama said in a statement released by the White House. He did not elaborate on the reason for the lockdown, saying only that it was \"a precautionary measure.\" The incident took place at Camp Springs, a medical facility near the Maryland-Virginia border, where a man and woman were shot and killed in an incident that left one man dead and another wounded, according to the Pentagon. A spokesman for US Defense Secretary Leon Panetta told reporters that no one was injured in the shooting, adding that the military had no immediate plans to take any action against the shooter. However, he added that there was a \"very high probability\" that an attack would take place and that \"we have a very high chance of success.\" Obama also said that he would hold a special meeting with military officials to discuss the matter. Military officials said they would not comment further until the meeting was over.

It is unclear how many people were injured, but it appears that at least some of them were in critical condition. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said there were no reports of any injuries. Obama's statement came a day after a report that a gunman had opened fire at an Army base in Ohio, killing one soldier and injuring two others. In the wake of that report, the Defense Department said on Twitter that all military personnel had been placed on leave pending the outcome of an internal investigation."

        "target": "Threat of the Punjabi Taliban is growing Deutsche Welle talks to Pakistani political expert Hasan Askari Rizvi about the growing ties between militants in northwest Pakistan and Punjab province. At least four gunmen disguised in police uniforms raided a hospital in Pakistan's eastern city of Lahore on Monday night, claiming at least five lives. Local officials said the gunmen were trying to free a militant, who was being treated there after being captured during attacks on two mosques last Friday. The police said the gunfight at Jinnah Hospital had lasted around 45 minutes but the gunmen had managed to flee. Friday's twin attacks on the minority Ahmadi community left more than 90 people dead. They were claimed by a group, which identified itself as the Punjabi wing of the Taliban. Deutsche Welle spoke to political expert Hasan Askari Rizvi in Lahore, where there has been a wave of violence in recent days. DW: Who are the \"Punjabi Taliban\"? It is a kind of a pejorative term, which includes a host of groups. Initially in Punjab, you had two types of militancy: One, the groups that focussed mainly on Indian-administered Kashmir and there were other types of groups that focussed on Pakistan. Those were the sectarian groups targeting mainly the Shias, and there were some Shia groups targeting the Sunni leadership. Over the years a lot of factions have broken away from these groups and these small entities are functioning more or less autonomously. They have trainings in the tribal areas because these are secured for them and certain parts are not under Pakistani control so these groups go there. They operate with the Pakistani Taliban based in tribal areas against the Pakistani troops in the region. They also have an autonomous agenda, which they pursue in Punjab, as they have been doing in the past days. These groups also play host or are a kind of a local link to Taliban suicide bombers who come into the main part of Pakistan from the tribal areas (let's say to Punjab). If they have to target some place, they park themselves with these Punjab groups, and then do it. All these factions and groups that have broken away from traditional militant groups and are functioning in close collaboration with tribal area Taliban are often described as the \"Punjabi Taliban\". Why do you think these militants are resurfacing now? They have always existed here and there and generally the trend is that they undertake a couple of operations, one after the other. Then the government comes in and takes action against them. Then they just disappear or become sleeping groups and suddenly after a couple of months they resurface. That's the standard pattern. The last major incident in Lahore was in the first week of March. Then there was nothing in April and now towards the end of May you have this kind of incident. Do you think the government should have taken stronger action against them? They should have but the problem is that the Punjab government has a kind of ambiguous approach and I think there is some element of denial within the leadership also. These groups also have some sympathy if not support at the societal level and that makes it difficult for the government to go against them openly. They need to work together and to emphasise to the people that they are terrorists. They use different names and Islam but actually their agenda is terrorism. Somehow the government of Punjab has been rather confused and ambiguous regarding these groups. Interview: Disha Uppal Editor: Anne Thomas",

Tito Vilanova has died at the age of 45. May he rest in peace,\" the statement said.

Titos Vilavic, who coached FC Barcelona from 1992 to 1995, was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2014 and died in a hospital in Barcelona on Sunday. The Spanish football club announced that he had died of cancer at the age of 83 on Saturday. \"Tito has battled cancer for the past three years,\" the club's president, Pep Guardiola, told reporters at a news conference. It was not immediately clear whether the cancer had spread to his prostate or whether he was suffering from a rare form of bone cancer, according to a statement released by the team's medical team. A spokesman for Barcelona said that \"it is a very difficult situation to deal with and we are very sorry to announce the news.\" The club had been in the hospital for more than a year and a half, but had not been able to confirm the cause of death. According to the statement, \"the cancer has spread rapidly and is now spreading to other organs, including bone marrow, liver, pancreas, kidneys and liver,\" adding that the prognosis for treatment was \"very good.\" \"We are hopeful that this will be the last time he will have to undergo chemotherapy and radiation,\" added the spokesman, referring to an ongoing battle between the two sports' governing bodies, the Catalan Football Association (BFA) and the Spanish Football Confederation (CFA). The CFA said it would not comment on the matter at this time, citing the ongoing investigation into the death of the former coach. However, it added that there was no immediate indication of a possible cause for his death and that it was a result of complications from chemotherapy, which has been curative for several years. Barcelona, meanwhile, said on its official Twitter account that they would be holding a press conference on Monday to discuss the results of their medical examination. They did not give a reason for their decision, however, and said they were \"deeply concerned\" about the outcome. In an interview with Spanish news agency dpa, Vilava said: \"I am deeply saddened by this news. I have no words to express my condolences to my wife, my son and my daughter. We are deeply sorry for your loss and I will always be grateful to you for all that you have done for us. You have been a great friend to me and to your family and friends and all the people who have helped me through this difficult time. Thank you so much for everything you've given me.\" He also said he would continue to support his wife and children in their quest to find a cure for cancer as long as they have the means to fight the disease."
