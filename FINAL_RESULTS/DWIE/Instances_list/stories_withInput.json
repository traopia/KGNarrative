        "target": "Opinion: Obama's Cuban revolution President Barack Obama has made a very special declaration of love to Cuba. It's as revolutionary as the Cuban revolution, and as peaceful as the biblical Sermon on the Mount, says DW's Astrid Prange. US President Barack Obama has lost his old communist \"enemy,\" and Cuban President Raul Castro has lost his hatred of capitalism. In the first phone call from president to president since 1961 the two heads of state came to a surprisingly swift agreement. They want to renew diplomatic relations, which have been on ice for more than 50 years, and exchange ambassadors. It's only a matter of time before the US lifts its trade embargo against Cuba. All the word \"embargo\" is really good for - at this stage - is as an ideological soapbox for political hardliners, especially Republicans in Congress who believe lifting sanctions would constitute defeat for the US. Yet the lifting of the embargo has already begun. In addition to medication, it has been possible since 2000 to export agricultural produce such as maize, cereal crops, and poultry to Cuba. Flirting with the rogue state Furthermore, 100,000 US citizens have travelled to Cuba since 2011 for cultural and scientific exchanges. Travel restrictions on Cubans living in exile in the US who wanted to visit their relatives on the island were also lifted. According to press reports, the two countries' military forces are even said to be cooperating, as are their coastguards, and military on the border of the US marine base in Guantanamo. Now Obama wants to officially open a \"new chapter\" in relations with the communist Caribbean island and remove Cuba from the US list of so-called \"rogue states\" that support terrorism. The travel ban on American tourists visiting the island will also largely be lifted. That's as far as things will go for the time being, as Obama would require a majority in Congress in Washington to lift the embargo entirely. But even if these are only small steps, the fall of the American-Cuban wall has begun. The easing of the sanctions and the resumption of diplomatic relations are setting the scene for an end to the embargo. Embargo as scapegoat The tearing down of this \"wall in the mind\" is long overdue. The blockade is obsolete, and has proved to be entirely ineffective. More than this, its advocates have achieved the opposite of what they actually wanted. The blockade has provided the leaders in Havana with an easy excuse for their economic failure. Raul Castro realized long ago that Cuba's economic problems can no longer be justified simply by citing the US embargo. It looks as though he was counting on the blockade being lifted: There is no other explanation for the completion of the Mariel container port in January this year. Cuba's biggest infrastructure project was, incidentally, financed by Brazil. The Brazilians also sent a declaration of love to Cuba. Raul Castro opened the door to them. He loves anyone who helps him - his friends even more than his enemies.",
        "generated_story": "The Fall of the Wall in the Mind of Cuban President Barack Obama The fall of a wall in Cuba is the latest in a series of events that have rocked the country's political landscape. Raul Castro, the former leader of Cuba's ruling Communist Party, is at the center of these events. The US president is expected to announce his plans to close the Guantanamo Bay prison, which has been used as a detention center for dissidents since the end of Fidel Castro's rule in 1959. In a statement released on Tuesday, Obama said that the US would no longer use Guantanamo as an interrogation facility. \"We will not use the term Guantanamo,\" he said, referring to the detention facility where the Cuban leader was held for more than a year and a half. He added that he would \"not hesitate to use this term to refer to any other term that might be used against him.\" The Cuban president has also been accused of using the facility to detain dissidents, who are thought to be close to his own family, as well as those of his wife and two children, Astrid Prange and her husband, Alejandro, are believed to have been detained there in 2009. They have since been released and are due to return to Cuba in early 2013. But they have not yet been able to reunite with their families, and they are still waiting for a decision on whether or not to open the prison. Last week, Cuba announced that it would close its Guantanamo prison for the first time since Fidel was overthrown by a military coup in 1961. It is not clear how long this will last, but it is likely to take longer than expected. There is a lot of speculation about the future of Guantanamo and whether it will be closed down or whether Cuba will open it up again. Some analysts believe that this could be the beginning of an end for Obama's Cuba policy. After all, he was elected president in 2008. His first year in office, however, was marked by the release of former US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and other senior Cuban officials, including former CIA Director John Brennan and former Defense Secretary Leonid Bershidsky. Obama has repeatedly said he will close Guantanamo if he is unable to persuade Congress to allow it to remain open. That is, until he can convince Congress and the White House to reopen it. And that is exactly what he has done so far: He has made it clear that his goal is to make Guantanamo open to all Cubans, not just those who want to see it shut down and shut it down. On the other hand, there is also the question of whether Obama is willing to give up the idea of closing Guantanamo indefinitely. This is something that, in his view, would be impossible to do without the help of Congress."

The 89-year-old did not say when exactly his resignation would take effect. Calling the move a personal decision, President Giorgio Napolitano made his announcement during an end-of-year speech on Wednesday. \"I'm about to step down, to resign as the constitution expressly allows,\" he said, adding. \"I've reached an age that brings with it growing limitations and difficulties for me to do my institutional duties, which are complex and very demanding.\" Though he did not say when his resignation would take effect, a potential date is January 13 when Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi is due to give up the country's rotating six-month presidency of the Council of the European Union. Renzi faces a political challenge in organizing a replacement for Napolitano, dubbed by Italian media as \"King George.\" The president has served as a key intermediary between political parties through numerous changes in government and other tricky political situations. Napolitano, a former communist respected by Europe and Washington, took office in 2006. At the end of his seven-year mandate in 2013, he was asked to stay on because parliament could not agree on his successor. At the time he warned he may not serve out the full term, given his age. In Italy, presidents have loosely-defined powers including the ability to nominate prime ministers, dissolve parliament and veto legislation, as well as use the moral authority of the office to influence politics. se/cmk (dpa, Reuters)",
        "generated_story": "Giorgio Napolitano resigns as Italy's president The Italian president has announced his resignation as president of the European Union. Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi announced the resignation of his country's new president on Friday. The resignation comes after a meeting between the EU's executive and the Council of Europe (ECU) in Rome, where the Italian prime minister is expected to take the oath of office later this week. \"I regret to inform you that I have decided to step down from my position as European Council President,\" Napolano said in a statement released by his office. He also said that he would not seek re-election to the post of president in the event of a referendum on whether Italy should remain as EU member states. Italy, which is currently the world's third-largest economy after the United States and Germany, has been divided over the issue of migration and whether it should be allowed to continue as a member state. In an interview with the Associated Press on Thursday, the president said he was \"deeply disappointed\" by the results of last year's referendum, in which Italy was the only EU country to vote in favor of leaving the bloc. It is unclear whether the referendum result will be ratified by parliament or not, but it is widely believed that the outcome will not be decided by a vote of no confidence in Italy\u2019s president. Napoli, who was first elected in 2009, was widely seen as the most powerful man in Europe at the time. But he has since been criticized for his handling of migrant crises in Africa and Latin America, as well as for the way he handled the migrant crisis in Libya and other crises that have hit the continent in recent years. On Friday, Italy announced that it would no longer allow migrants to enter the country without first obtaining a visa, a move that was criticized by Washington and Europe as \"unacceptable.\" The move was seen by many as an attempt to distance Italy from the US and its allies in Asia, particularly China and India, and to make it more difficult for European countries to reach an agreement on asylum for migrants. EU leaders have called for an end to visa-free travel for asylum seekers and for EU citizens to be able to return to their countries if they want to stay in their own countries. However, EU foreign policy chief Federico Mogherini has said the move is \"not a sign of weakness\" and that Italy will continue to seek a solution to its migration crisis."

The spokesman said more help was needed, but could not give exact numbers \"due to pending assignments.\" Recent soccer violence raises concern Swiss media has been questioning the security preparations for Euro 2008 after a spate of violence at recent games. In the latest incident, seats were ripped out and a goal post wrenched from the ground after St. Gallen faced the prospect of relegation following a 2-0 defeat to Bellinzona on May 20. St. Gallen was the third incident in a month that saw violent clashes with police who twice resorted to rubber bullets and tear gas. While Switzerland is seen as a low risk country in terms of hooliganism, violence has been on the increase in recent years and estimates claim there are around 400 hooligans and 600 sympathizers. Swiss Sports Minister Samuel Schmid said that hooliganism cannot be ruled out, reported German news agency DPA. But he expressed his belief that extra measures such as more policing, restrictions on alcohol -- which he has called \"a catalyst for violence\" -- and video surveillance will help keep trouble at bay. Private firms to boost European police The private security companies will be responsible for patrolling the stadiums and their surroundings, as well as the public viewing areas, team hotels and trainings areas. An international police force will manage the rest. Switzerland has committed some 31,200 police officers and soldiers. Another 1,700 police will be sent from Germany, which will have the authority to make arrests.

Conservative members of Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition put forward a united front at the weekend against recent developments in the city of Wuppertal. Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said civilians wearing uniforms bearing the logo \"Shariah police\" could not simply start patrolling German streets. The groups reportedly hovered around sites like discotheques and gambling houses, telling passers-by to refrain from gambling and alcohol. Wuppertal's police have begun pressing charges. \"Sharia law is not tolerated on German soil,\" de Maiziere told mass-circulation daily Bild on Saturday. \"Nobody can take it upon themselves to abuse the good name of the German police.\" Justice Minister Heiko Maas, meanwhile, told Bild that \"the state alone\" was responsible for the administration of justice in Germany. It was obvious, Maas said, that any illegal parallel system of law enforcement would not be tolerated. Christian Democrat party whip Volker Kauder was similarly emphatic in an interview to be published in this week's Welt am Sonntag newspaper. \"Under absolutely no circumstances can we tolerate self-styled 'Sharia police officers' patrolling our streets and dictating what people should or should not do,\" Kauder said.

Lau is a leading member of Germany's Salafist movement, advocates of a strict Sunni interpretation of political Islam. He works with a mosque in his native M\u00f6nchengladbach, not far west of Wuppertal, and used to head the fundamentalist group \"Invitation to Paradise.\" (Einladung zum Paradies, in German.) The central council of Muslims in Germany (ZMD) condemned the activities. \"These few teen yobs do not speak in our name,\" chairman Ayman A. Mazyek told the Tagesspiegel am Sonntag newspaper. \"These people are perverting the name of our religion. With this shrill and foolish action, they are really hurting Muslims.\" Sharia law is the Arabic term for a legal system based on the Koran. Saudi Arabia and Iran are examples of countries where such a system officially applies. Wearing a veil is obligatory for women and corporal punishment such as stoning is legally tolerated.

Its warning follows a WHO admission that the epidemic requires \"extraordinary measures.\" The head of Medicins Sans Frontieres (MSF), Joanne Liu -- fresh from a visit to western Africa -- said in Geneva on Friday that more experts were needed in the hard-hit region. \"It is deteriorating faster, and moving faster, than we can respond to,\" Liu told reporters. \"Like in a war time, we have a total collapse of infrastructure,\" she added. Lui said the world community needed to get the \"upper hand\" over the next six months. While the viral spread had been slowed in Guinea, concerns focused especially on Liberia. \"If we don't stabilize Liberia, we will never stabilize the region,\" Lui said. She was critical of the WHO for delaying its public health emergency warning until August 8. \"We need people with a hands-on operational mindset,\" to combat the outbreak, Liu told the Geneva news briefing. WHO - 'vastly underestimated' On Thursday, the World Health Organization (WHO) said the scale of the epidemic had been \"vastly underestimated\" and that \"extraordinary measures\" were needed to contain the contagious virus. The UN health agency said the death toll had climbed to 1,069 in four afflicted countries, spanning Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia and more recently Nigeria. Sierra Leone's chief medical officer Brima Kargbo disclosed on Thursday that at least 32 of the nation's nurses and doctors had died from the Ebola virus while performing their duties between May 24 and August 13. Local staff suffered stigma, despite saving lives, Kargbo said. \"We still have to break the chain of transmission to separate the infected from the uninfected.\" Youth Olympics also affected The mounting alarm coincided with an announcement Friday from the International Olympics Committee that three athletes from Ebola-hit countries had been barred from competing in pool events and combat sports at the Youth Olympics opening in China on Saturday. ipj/tj (AfP, Reuters)",

She added that \"we are not ready to give up the fight against the disease.\" \"The outbreak is continuing to grow,\" Liu said, adding that there was no evidence that Ebola had spread to other countries, such as China, or even to the United States, where the virus was first discovered in 1976. Ebola is spreading rapidly across the globe, with the most recent death toll in Africa reaching 2,000 in January. In the US, Ebola has claimed more lives than in any other outbreak since the start of the epidemic, according to a UN report released last week. At the end of January, the UN said it had found no new cases of Ebola in Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad, Niger, El Salvador, Haiti, Somalia, Sudan, Eritrea, Libya, Yemen, Nigeria and Somalia. It also said there were no signs of a resurgence in attacks on hospitals, schools and other health facilities. A WHO spokesman said the agency was working closely with health authorities to find a way to prevent the spread of deadly diseases, including Ebola, as well as to reduce the number of deaths from the hemorrhagic fever that has hit the country in recent months. WHO says Ebola could spread as fast as 2.5 to 3.6 million people by 2014, up from 1.2 million in 2015. But WHO has yet to say how many people have died from Ebola and how quickly it spreads. On Thursday, a WHO official said that a total of 3,500 people had died in Ebola-affected areas in West Africa. According to WHO figures, this number is expected to rise to 4,600 by 2015, and could reach up to 5,200 by 2016."

The Luxembourg-based court thus sided with the German firm UsedSoft in a protracted legal battle with US software giant Oracle. The ruling made it clear that trade in used software was permissible even if the software had not been shipped on a physical medium such as a CD or DVD, but had been digitally downloaded from the Internet. UsedSoft's business model hinges completely on reselling used packages or legally obtained license keys for them. By reselling the keys to clients, the latter are then able to download the latest version of a given program directly from a company's Internet site and obtain all new updates and patches in the process. Legal clarity Oracle had sued UsedSoft over its business model, trying to prevent buyers of used software licenses from downloading programs again. But the European court ruled that the so-called principle of exhaustion applied whenever software was originally sold to a customer for an unlimited time span, not giving the maker of the software the right to prevent the resale of that software. \"The door for the trade in used software has been pushed wide open throughout the European Union,\" UsedSoft said in a statement, welcoming \"perfect legal safety on the market.\" The court in Luxembourg emphasized, though, that whoever resold pieces of original software and their accompanying licenses must erase every copy on their own computers in advance and was not allowed to keep a copy after resale. hg/mz (AFP, dpa)",

Oracle, the US's largest software maker, said the ruling was a \"significant step forward\" in its fight to protect the rights of users of its software, which it said infringes copyright law. In a statement, Oracle said it would appeal the decision, saying it did not have the authority to do so because it was \"incompatible with European law.\" \"This is an important step in our fight against copyright infringements,\" Oracle wrote in an open letter to EU member states, adding that \"it is the responsibility of the parties involved in this litigation to defend the interests of their users.\" Oracle has denied the allegations, but the company's lawyers have argued that Oracle's claims are not supported by evidence presented in court.

NASA's Mars rover, \"Curiosity,\" will wrap up a lengthy self-testing phase on Thursday, freeing it up to continue exploring the surface of the Red Planet. Mission manager Jennifer Tropser told reporters in a conference call on Wednesday evening that the plan, once the final checks were completed, was to \"drive, drive, drive\" until Curiosity discovers a rock suitable for analysis. She added that the instrument checks have delivered positive results. \"Through every phase of the check-out, Curiosity has performed almost flawlessly,\" Tropser said. \"The success so far of these activities has been outstanding.\" Many of the tests have concerned Curiosity's robotic arm. The 2.1-meter (7-feet) appendage will be used to pick out and sample rocks and soil. NASA is investigating whether Mars can sustain life, or whether it could in the past. The tests were designed to identify any damage sustained during its interplanetary flight and also to ensure that the arm still functioned properly on Mars, with its different temperatures and gravity. The Mars rover landed in the giant Gale Crater, near the Martian equator, on August 5; it has so far moved about 109 meters within the crater. The rover is traveling east, heading first to an intersection called Glenelg, where three types of terrain meet. This is likely to be the location for the first rock and soil samples, though NASA said Curiosity was unlikely to arrive there for several weeks. Curiosity's ultimate destination is the nearby Aeolis Mons or Mount Sharp, a 3-mile-high mound of rock rising out of the crater.

But first, let's get to the bottom of what's going on with Curiosity. First, we have to figure out what the mission's mission might be like. Then we need to determine whether it is a good one or a bad one. That's what we're looking at right now. We're still waiting for the data to come back. And then we'll see if we can get it back to Mars. So far we've had some good news, but we don't know for sure. What we do know is that Curiosity has done a great job of testing itself and is doing a really good job at it. There's no doubt about that. You can see it on the back of Curiosity's computer screen, where it can be tested on a wide range of subjects, such as the weather, climate, temperature, humidity and even the amount of dust that accumulates in its atmosphere. This is all part of a long-term plan to try to get Mars to behave more like a human being, rather than a robotic one, as is the case with most other Mars missions. However, there are still some hurdles to overcome. For one thing, it has to do with its ability to detect the presence of radioactive elements in water samples. Another hurdle is finding out if Mars is capable of detecting these elements. Finally, NASA is also looking into the possibility that Mars could be used as a testbed for Mars' next rover."

It will cost a lot of money to improve health and social infrastructures, especially in more developed countries where traditional families structures have changed dramatically. Surely, there's \"no typical older person,\" though. How does the WHO define aging? We tend to think of older people as physically and mentally frail. But that's not necessarily the case, not everywhere in the world. Old is a relative concept - especially in middle income to rich countries. For instance, some 70 year olds are as fit as some 20 year olds. Just think how many older folk are at your gym, and ask yourself whether you can keep up with all of them. But that still doesn't explain aging. What is it exactly? The WHO says that at a biological level, \"aging results from the impact of the accumulation of a wide variety of molecular and cellular damage over time.\" Basically, this puts people at a higher risk of disease and, of course, death. But aging can also be associated with \"life transitions,\" such as retirement or witnessing other people, such as friends and family, die around you. This can affect you psychologically and sometimes, as a result, physically. What sort of diseases come with old age? Some of the most common non-fatal conditions include hearing loss, cataracts, back and neck pain and osteoarthritis. Other conditions include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - which affects the lungs - diabetes, depression, and dementia. What needs to be done? The WHO is proposing a five-step plan of action, which includes: Committing to healthy aging and \"evidence-based policies to strengthen the abilities of older persons.\" Aligning health systems with the needs of older populations Developing systems for providing long-term care Creating \"age-friendly cities and communities Improving measurement, monitoring and understanding of \"aging issues\" worldwide. But don't forget: \"a longer life brings with it opportunities, not only for older people and their families, but also for societies as a whole.\"",
        "generated_story": "WHO's Population Aging Plan: Actions Now Need to be Taken The World Health Organization (WHO) has announced a new plan to reduce the number of people living in extreme poverty. The plan, which will be published in the coming weeks, is aimed at reducing the world's population by 1.5 billion people by 2050, according to a report released on Wednesday by the WHO. \"The WHO has decided to take action now to address the growing problem of increasing the population,\" the report said, adding that the plan would be implemented as soon as possible. However, it did not specify when or where the action would take place. In a statement released Wednesday, WHO said that it was \"not at the time of this announcement, but at a time when we need to make sure that we are taking action to tackle this problem.\" The WHO also said it would continue to monitor the effects of climate change on people's health, particularly in developing countries, such as China, India, Brazil and South Africa. According to WHO figures, the global population is expected to reach 2.6 billion by 2030, up from 2 billion in 2005. This is the first time since the end of World War II in 1945 that people have been living longer than the average age of a person in a developing country. At the same time, there is an increase in mortality among people aged 65 and older, as well as in people with pre-diabetes, who are more likely to die of old age than those with cancer, and who have a higher risk of developing chronic diseases like cardiovascular disease, diabetes and heart disease. These are all factors that contribute to the rise in global mortality rates. One of the main reasons for this is because people are aging faster than they would otherwise be if they had been born earlier in life. That's because the aging process is more complex than it is for people to live longer. It's not just the ageing process that is affecting people. There's also the fact that older people tend to have more children than younger people, making it more difficult for them to get older. As a result, more and more people die each year, leading to higher rates of death and disability. So, in order to prevent this from happening again, we have to act now. We've got to do something about it. And that's what we've been doing for a long time. What we're doing now is making sure we do everything we can to help people stay healthy, so that they don't get sick and die prematurely, or that their health doesn't deteriorate as quickly as it should. Our goal is to keep people alive and healthy and prevent more deaths and illnesses like cancer and AIDS from becoming more common. But we also want to give people the opportunity to adapt and adapt to their lifestyles and lifestyles, not to just live in an old, decrepit world. To do that, you need a plan that works for you and your family. You can't just sit around and wait for the next generation to come along and do it all over again. Do you have any idea how long it will take? What do you think about this plan? I think it's a good idea to look at it from a different perspective. If you're a scientist or a researcher, then you know that you can do a lot of research on the topic of ageing and how it affects your health. How long will it take you to develop a better understanding of your own body and health? It depends on how well you are able to cope with the changes that are happening in your body."

It is a reflection of his current inauspicious Formula One campaign that World Champion Michael Schumacher is only featuring in reports on this weekend's German Grand Prix at Hockenheim dues to his nationality. The home grown champion equaled his own record of 11 wins in a season at last year's race but this year he will be hoping to just get on the podium at the end. Schumi lies in third place some 34 points off the top spot and has a lot to do if he is to record his 85th career win. Ferrari's poor season to date is unlikely to get better with hopes dwindling that the 36-year-old will add to his sole victory of the season although the seven-time world champion characteristically refuses to rule it out. Schumi and Ferrari still in the fight \"Contrary to many other people's opinions, we have in no means written ourselves off, even though we have to admit that the situation has worsened recently, rather than improved,\" said the German, referring to the problems with this season's car. \"But that doesn't mean that it can't be improved again, and that's exactly what we're working on.\" The limelight is falling on two young pretenders to Schumacher's throne as Sunday's race approaches. The battle between McLaren's flying Finn Kimi Raikkonen and championship leader Renault's speedy Spaniard Fernando Alonso is diverting eyes from the world record holding German on his own turf. Kimi aims to keep heat on leader Alonso Raikkonen must finish the German Grand Prix for the first time in five attempts to close the gap on Alonso if he is to keep his own championship hopes alive. The Finn retired from last year's race because of a rear wing failure and this season has been plagued by technical problems which most recently cost him 10 places on the starting grid in each of the last two rounds. Despite those penalties for engine failure, the 25-year-old managed to finish second and third but he will have to increase his total of three race wins if he is to make a significant impression on the 26-point chasm that separates him from Alonso. \"The battle for the championship is still on and I am determined to get a good result and work on closing the gap,\" said the Finn. \"The (car) has good speed and we need to make the most of it this weekend.\" Montoya doing McLaren team mate no favors Raikkonen's car is obviously a fast one this season but he's not the only driver in a McLaren hot seat. Colombia's Juan Pablo Montoya is not to going to make way for his team mate while his own hopes of the title, however small, remain alive. \"I am really looking forward to racing again this weekend in Germany,\" said Montoya, who won at Hockenheim for Williams two years ago and got his first victory for McLaren in Britain two weeks ago. \"I enjoy racing at Hockenheim, I have performed well here and won in the past and I am aiming for a strong result like at Silverstone.\" Consistent Ferdy the man to beat at Hockenheim Championship leader Alonso, meanwhile, has been impressively consistent for Renault so far this season, winning five times and failing to score points only at the Canadian Grand Prix, where he crashed, and in Indianapolis. The Spaniard is setting the pace and the standard this season so, problems aside, Alonso will again be the man to beat at Hockenheim.",

Alonso, who finished fourth in Spain's F1 championship last year, will be looking to extend his winning streak to five races. He has already won three of his last four races, including the last two in Mexico and Canada, and has a four-point lead over Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel and Williams' Williams driver Felipe Massa. Ferrari, Mercedes and Ferrari have already clinched the top three spots in their respective constructors' championship groups, with Alonso leading the way with three races to go. McLaren, Ferrari and Toro Rosso are also in contention for a fifth title in a row, while Williams, Williams and McLaren are in third and fourth place, respectively. Hamilton, Alonso's team-mate, is the only other driver to have won more than one race in all four of them. Mercedes' Alonso is in pole position for Sunday's German GP, where he will take on McLaren's Williams teammate Nico Hulkenberg for his first win in four years. Fernando has been the most successful driver of all time with a total of seven wins and three podiums in five seasons. But he is also the fastest driver in Formula 1 history with four wins in seven races and one pole in each of those four seasons, along with two podium finishes in 2014, 2015 and 2016. Last year's title winner Michael Schumacher was the youngest driver ever to reach the podium, but that didn't stop him from making it to the final.

She will share the prestigious award with US compatriot Oliver Williamson. The jury from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said the Americans' research had shown how \"economic analysis can shed light on most forms of social organization.\" Ostrom, a professor at Indiana University, was honored for her \"analysis of economic governance,\" especially in relation to the management of common property or property under common control. The political scientist's work challenges the widely accepted belief that common property is poorly managed and should be either regulated by central authorities or privatized, it added. She carried out numerous studies showing how self-organization and local-level management work to keep common resources viable. Her studies included both natural resources, such as forests, and artificial structures, for example police forces. Ostrom told Swedish television that she felt \"great surprise and appreciation\" and was \"in shock\" about being the first woman to win the prize. The pros and cons of big firms In his work, co-prizewinner Oliver Williamson, of University of California, Berkeley, examines why large corporations tend to arise - and why they do not - based on the cost and complexity of transactions, according to the Nobel committee. \"He has taught us to regard markets, firms, associations, agencies, and even households from the perspective of their contribution to the resolution of conflict,\" the jury said. Williamson authored 'The Economic Institutions of Capitalism' in 1975, a landmark text of the 'new institutional economics' movement that questioned the idea of firms as simple profit-making machines. Last but not least The Nobel prize for economics is the only Nobel award that was not created by the will of Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel in 1896. It was actually founded by the Swedish central bank, the Sverige Riksbank, to celebrate its tri-centenary a year earlier. It was awarded for the first time in 1969 under its official name: the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel. But although it was the last \"Nobel prize\" to be created and the last to be announced each year, the prize is not a poor relation in monetary terms. Winners of the awards for peace, literature, medicine, physiology, chemistry and physics all receive 10 million Swedish crowns (969,000 euros). A good year for women This year was a record year for women laureates. German-Romanian writer Herta Mueller won the Nobel Prize for Literature. Australian-American Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider of the United States were awarded the prize for medicine. And Ada Yonath of Israel was one of three scientists recognized for her work in chemistry. Americans more or less swept the board this year. Nine of the 11 laureates were US citizens.

        "target": "The Sun Sets Slowly Over Brandenburg's Tropical Dream Having suffered many disappointments concerning publically funded projects, the state of Brandenburg hoped a tropical leisure center would offer a ray of hope. Instead the ailing concern is just bringing more gloom. The economically depressed eastern German state of Brandenburg has seen its fair share of bitter experiences when it comes to huge public investment projects since German unification in 1990. Against this background, state authorities were pleased when Malaysian businessman Colin Au built a huge tropical-feeling leisure center in Brandenburg without any subsidies. The center, which opened about a year ago, was to become a symbol of economic success in a region where unemployment still hovers around the 20 percent mark. But the leisure time park, which has already swallowed a little under 100 million euros ($120 million) in private investment, is now going to have to depend on public funding to avoid another economic fiasco in Brandenburg. State authorities in Brandenburg haven't been too successful in their public investment policy in the past 10 years, to put it mildly. A grand plan to build one of the world's most modern chip-producing factories there burst like a bubble in 2003. The much-talked about Brandenburg-Berlin International airport still seems light years away from being built. Line of failures looked to be ended by Au's vision Another beacon of economic hope disappeared in 2002 when a company planning to build gas-filled transport airships went bust despite considerable subsidies. But Au's vision for the abandoned dome which the airship company needed as a hangar offered Brandenburg another chance. In the middle of nowhere, he created what he named his \"Tropical Islands\" wonderland, sporting everything from sandy beaches, lakes and a Laguna to a Caribbean-style village. The economics ministry in Brandenburg was over the moon to see Au originally agreeing to build the facility without any state subsidies. And Au himself had no doubt at the time that he could well do without them. Overestimated visitor numbers tell sorry story But the center's first year in operation tells a different story. Colin Au, who has meanwhile left Brandenburg and transferred matters to a German management company, had expected some 1.5 million visitors to come to Tropical Islands within the first year, but only some 950,000 will have turned up by the end of 2005. It seems highly unlikely that visitor numbers will increase considerably in future, placing a question mark on the viability of the whole centre. But Brandenburg's economics ministry is certain that the park will be in the black as of 2008. To make the place more attractive, it has agreed to shell out 15 million euros in subsidies for yet another reconstruction and marketing effort. After all, the leisure time center has a workforce of about 500 and is thus the biggest employer in an otherwise depressed region marked by a high jobless rate. Tropical center down but not out...not yet \"We hope the money will help make the Tropical Islands resort better known throughout Europe according to the new marketing concept hammered out the management,\" ministry spokesman Steffen Kammrath said. \"This leisure time center is unique and has to be marketed as such. What you have there is a tropical and water world 12 months a year with a lot of attractive offers to spend a whale of a time there.\" Some commentators believe that state subsidies may prolong the center's life span, but will not be able to avoid its demise in the long run. But the idea of also making it more attractive for tourists from all over Europe seems unrealistic to them if the resort's management can't even get enough visitors from home to ensure a profitable operation.",

It's the first time the sun has set in a German city in more than a century. The tropical island resort is located on the eastern coast of the country, just a few kilometers (three miles) from the main airport in Berlin. There's a lot to see here, but it's not as if the weather is going to change overnight. \"The sun is setting slowly,\" Steffen Kammrath, the resort's managing director, told DW news agency. He added that it was \"a beautiful place to be.\" \"It's been a long time since I've been here,\" he said, adding that he was looking forward to seeing the island's beauty and culture again. But he also pointed out that there's still plenty of work to do, and that the area is still very much a tourist destination. In the past few years, it has become a popular destination for tourists and locals alike. Last year, there were over 1,000 visitors to the islands, which are part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Since then, visitors have been able to enjoy the sights and sounds of this island, as well as the sea and the mountains. However, this year there has been an increase in tourist arrivals, with the number of visitors dropping in from a year ago to a new high of over 2,500. And that's despite the fact that most of them come from Germany, a country with a high population of just over 3 million people. This year's visitors are expected to spend a total of 2.5 million euros ($2.1 million) at the destination, up from 1.6 million last year. On top of that, they're expecting a rise in visitors from all over Asia, including China, Japan and South Korea. They're also hoping for a return to Europe, where they'll have a better chance of making it back to their homeland. So far, so good, in fact, that they've managed to stay in touch with each other. That's good news for the tourism industry, because it means that more tourists are coming to Germany every year and more people are staying in Germany than in other European countries. What's even more good for business is that tourism is booming again, thanks to an influx of tourists from Asia and Latin America who are looking to make their way to South America and Europe."

        "target": "Bayern's Klinsmann Praises, Hoeness Attacks Hoffenheim The Bundesliga's two top teams don't play until Friday, but the mind games are already underway. Bayern's coach Juergen Klinsmann says Hoffenheim are legitimate contenders, but commercial manager Uli Hoeness disagrees. When the Bundesliga scheduled Bayern's home match against Hoffenheim in the league's unloved Friday night slot, they probably didn't imagine that it would turn out to be the match of the first half of the season. Indeed, few experts or fans thought that Hoffenheim, a first-division debutante located in a southern German village with 3,000 inhabitants, would give mighty Munich a run for its money. But it's the first week of December, and Hoffenheim top the table by three points. They also have a much better goal difference than their second-placed rivals -- and that has drawn praise from Bayern's coach, Juergen Klinsmann. \"I have the highest estimation of Hoffenheim because they've built the squad very ambitiously, rationally and with very good players,\" Klinsmann told DPA news agency. \"They can be proud of that.\" Klinsmann said he thought that the club could establish itself among the top three or four sides in Germany in the years to come and qualify for international competition next season. He also had words of praise for Hoffenheim's software billionaire patron, Dietmar Hopp, whose money has funded the club's ascent. \"There's nothing negative about it,\" Klinsmann said. \"He used to play for the club, is a soccer man through and through and helped the team get on its feet.\" Some fans have criticized Hopp and Hoffenheim for paying inflating salaries and luring talent away from other clubs instead of developing homegrown players. In fact, Hoffenheim's official salary budget is about average for the Bundesliga. Hoeness sounds his horn But while Bayern's coach was praising his opponents to the skies, Munich's commercial manager Uli Hoeness has been trying to play with their heads. On the heels of Bayern's convincing win over Leverkusen last weekend, Hoeness is back to taunting rivals. \"The performance we showed in the second half against Leverkusen will be enough against Hoffenheim,\" Hoeness told the German soccer magazine kicker. Hoeness also dropped a none-too-thinly-veiled hint that Hoffenheim's personnel expenditures were far higher than the officially released figures and scoffed at the idea that strategy would determine the outcome of Friday's match. \"Games are decided by the better players, not by tactics,\" Hoeness said. \"And of course, we've got better players than Hoffenheim.\" But that particular verbal attack may represent some wishful thinking of the manager's part. Hoffenheim coach Ralf Rangnick is one of only two current Bundesliga skippers with a winning record against Munich. Rangnick, whose team cruised past Bielefeld last weekend to keep Bayern three points back, reacted to Hoeness' remarks with a shrug. \"We're preparing for Munich exactly the same way we did against Bielefeld,\" Rangnick said. In any case, soccer fans in Germany know what they'll be doing Friday evening -- finding a bar with cable sports television to watch a top match that no one, before the start of the season, would have considered possible.",

The German side, which has won the league title three times in four seasons, are expected to finish the season on a high note thanks to a strong run of form and a positive attitude from coach Juergen Klinsmann, who has guided his side to four wins in five matches in all competitions this season, including two wins over Mainz and one draw at home to Bayern Munich on Saturday. Hoffengladbach coach Ralf Rangnick said on Tuesday that his team would continue to work hard to reach the top four, but that they would be \"extremely disappointed\" if they failed to achieve their goal-scorer target. He added that \"we're going to try and make the most of this opportunity and we'll see what happens.\" \"It's a great opportunity for us to get back on track and get the job done.

Although the number of farms has declined over the decades, production has actually increased -- especially at dairy farms. Modern automation technology and robotics are helping to keep both cows and farmers happy, but at the cost of jobs.",
        "generated_story": "Automation in the Dairy Cow Industry in Germany is a big problem for the dairy industry. Automation is one of the main reasons why the industry is suffering from a shortage of dairy products. Dairy products are increasingly being used as substitutes for meat. In Germany, for example, there is an increase in demand for milk products due to the rise in milk production. But there are also a number of other reasons, such as the fact that milk is more expensive to produce than meat, which is why it is so difficult to make milk from milk. This is also the reason why there have been a lot of complaints about the quality of milk produced by dairy cows. The problem is that the milk product is not as good as it used to be, so it's not the same as when it was made from beef. That's why we're seeing more and more milk being produced from cows, and that's because the cows are so much better at producing milk than the cow is. It's also because they are more efficient and less polluting. And because of this, they have a better chance of being able to sell milk at a lower cost to consumers, who are less likely to have to pay for it. Also, because milk isn't as expensive as beef, it has a higher cost of production compared to beef and is therefore less expensive for consumers to buy. So, in order to reduce the costs associated with milk consumption, dairy companies are going to need to invest heavily in technology to improve milk quality. They have already invested in research and development, but this will not be enough to meet the demands of their customers. As a result, milk companies will be forced to cut back on the production of cow milk, as well as other products that are not suitable for human consumption. \"The milk industry has been in a state of crisis for a long time now,\" said a spokesman for Dairy Farmers of America (DFA). \"It's a very difficult situation for dairy farmers to deal with. There are many factors that contribute to this. One of them is the lack of awareness that cows have about their health and well-being,\" the spokesman said. DFA also said that there was a \"very high level of concern\" over the impact of artificial milk on human health. However, the company is working on a solution that will allow cows to live longer and live healthier lives without having to go to work every day. According to a report by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the solution is \"to make cows more healthy and healthier.\" Dairy farmers, however, are still struggling to cope with the rising costs of growing milk and the high demand from the meat industry, according to industry experts. These factors have led to an increased demand in recent years for cow products, particularly in Europe, where the price of beef is much higher than in other industrialized countries. With this in mind, farmers are looking for ways to increase their production and reduce their costs by cutting down on animal waste. For this reason, dFA has decided to introduce a range of products and services, including refrigerators, meat thermometers and dairy milk powder. At the moment, this is only available to farmers and ranchers."

But if there is one person who might be able to mediate between the intransigent Syrian conflict parties, it's Lakhdar Brahimi. Lakhdar Brahimi, the United Nations special envoy for Syria, seemed very tired on Friday (24.01.2014). He had had a long day, which was actually supposed to be the first real day of negotiations at the Syria Conference in Geneva. \"Good afternoon,\" Brahimi told the assembled international press, before adding, \"or good evening, I don't know.\" At the Palais des Nations in Geneva, he presented the most important result of his attempts to mediate between the Syrian government and the opposition to the more than 250 journalists who had managed to get a coveted place at the press conference: \"Tomorrow we expect and we have agreed that we will meet in the same room.\" What Brahimi is declaring an achievement doesn't sound like much, but considering how irreconcilable the conflict parties have been, even that can be seen as a small success. Separate talks with Brahimi The two delegations were actually due to meet on the first day of negotiations in Geneva in order to agree on a timetable and on the subject and agenda of the talks. But emotions are running too high on both sides. Instead both delegations held separate talks with Lahkkdar Brahimi, both lasting just about an hour each In the morning. The Syrian government delegation had apparently been threatening to leave the conference. At least that is what the deputy foreign minister Faisal Mekdad had implied. \"We are here to start the negotiations,\" he told waiting journalists, \"but we found that the other party did not want to come.\" Before the conference, the opposition had explained that for its delegation, the formation of a transition government would be a central tenet of the negotiations. They emphasized that this topic should be discussed right at the beginning of talks and that the establishment of such a body should be initiated without delay. Social media and good old propaganda The representatives of the Syrian National Coalition that were present in Geneva neatly used all imaginable channels to make their views public. At #Geneva2, they tweeted: \"Forming a transitional body is our major priority,\" leaving people in no doubt that the Syrian National Council would not want to include Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Assad's government, on the other hand, is relying on classic propaganda and loyal state media representatives in Geneva. An impressive entourage of dominant journalists from state-run media outlets is constantly at hand, accompanying the government delegation and making sure they get their point across at press conferences. Lakhdar Brahimi even had a small altercation with a journalist from a Syrian state news agency, who made a political statement under the pretense of asking the UN mediator a question. \"Are there any signs that Saudi Arabia, Turkey and other countries would stop the support of terrorism in Syria?,\" she asked in somewhat shaky English, before Brahimi interrupted her. \"Please, please, there is no point in asking such questions!\" Such exchanges hint at the type of negotiating style the experienced diplomat and mediator Brahimi must have behind the scenes. 'Wish us luck' Lakhdar Brahimi described the preliminary talks that took place in Geneva as encouraging and asked for patience. He said that because the peace conference had come about at the last minute and the delegations had therefore only been appointed very recently, there hadn't been enough time to hold preliminary discussions - a task that the delegations were now catching up on. \"We never expected it to be easy and I'm sure it's not going to be,\" he said. \"But I think the two parties understand what is at stake. Their country is in very, very bad shape.\" He added: \"The huge ambition of this process is to save Syria. Nothing less than that.\" After appealing to the willingness of both parties to negotiate, he simply added: \"So wish us luck!\" Fight for freedom As the official delegations held talks with UN mediator Brahimi in the Palais des Nations, the European headquarters of the United Nations, hundreds of Syrian expatriates who had come from all over Europe protested outside, forming a sea of red, white and black Syrian flags on the Place des Nations. With their presence outside the UN gates they wanted to show that despite all the government propaganda, the Syrian National coalition has a lot of support from the Syrian people. Thirty-two-year-old Ziad Malki came to Geneva from Zurich to show his solidarity. Ziad knows how it feels to be deprived of his freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. In 2005, he was arrested at a demonstration in Damascus and says he was tortured during his time in prison. Now he is fighting for a new Syria from outside the country's borders. Ziad is sure that with Bashar al-Assad and his family, there will be nothing new. \"We don't want this man to be in",
        "generated_story": "Mediating with the Syrian National Coalition in Geneva The Syrian opposition has called on the United Nations to mediate with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Syrian Foreign Minister Faisal Mekdad said on Thursday that he and his Syrian counterpart had reached an agreement on Syria's future. \"The Syrian government has made it clear that it will not accept the terms of the Geneva peace accords,\" he said in a statement released by his office in Zurich. He added that \"the Syrian regime is not going to accept any terms that are not acceptable to the international community.\" \"It is unacceptable for the regime to impose its will on its own people, and that is why we are calling for an end to this process and for a cessation of all violence in the country.\" The UN envoy also said he would meet with representatives from the opposition, the Free Syrian Army (FSA) and the pro-opposition Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) to discuss the situation in Syria. The two sides have agreed to a ceasefire, but the SDF has yet to agree on a date for talks. A ceasefire has not been agreed on yet. On Thursday, Syrian state media reported that the ceasefire had been extended to include a truce between the government and opposition forces, which has been in effect since the beginning of this year. However, it is unclear whether the truce will be extended beyond the two-day truce, or if the cease-fire will take place at the end of March. At the same time, talks have been scheduled to resume on Friday, with talks set to continue on Saturday and Sunday. Both sides are expected to hold talks on Sunday and Monday, as well as on Tuesday, to try to reach a deal on how to end the conflict. There is no date yet, however, because of a lack of information on what is happening in Aleppo and where the fighting is taking place. In the meantime, there is still time for negotiations to be held in Switzerland, where there are currently no talks scheduled for this week. Meanwhile, a group of opposition activists have called for Assad to step down, saying they will continue to fight for his regime. They are also calling on his government not to allow the use of chemical weapons against civilians."

        "target": "Italy's navy to patrol with Libyan ships to curb human trafficking Italy wants to work more closely with Libya to limit the number of sea crossings by migrants and potential asylum seekers. But what are the consequences? Italy's prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni, does not want to wait any longer for EU countries to show solidarity in distributing asylum seekers throughout the bloc. On Thursday he announced in Rome that the Italian navy would be patrolling with Libyan ships just off the Libyan coastline. The aim, Gentiloni says, is to curb human trafficking and bring migrants back from the smugglers' boats to Libya. According to the Italian government's figures, 93,000 migrants have arrived in Italy so far this year. At least 2,000 have drowned in the attempt to cross the Mediterranean - the true figure is unknown. Italy has already threatened to stop allowing boats carrying rescued migrants to dock in Italian ports, or that it may issue migrants with documents that would allow them to travel on to other European countries. Rome has not yet implemented either policy, but the government has made clear that Italy will soon run out of options. The EU Commissioner for Migration Dimitris Avramopoulos acknowledged, again, in Brussels on Thursday that \"Europe continues to face high migratory pressures. And Italy more than (almost) any others.\" The European Commission issued a letter offering more aid and personnel to help manage migration better. Accommodation will soon be full The office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, wrote at the beginning of July that \"Close to 200,000 accommodation places are available for refugees and migrants across [Italy], but are nearly all full.\" The High Commissioner referred particularly to the numbers of people dying when he warned, \"What is happening in front of our eyes in Italy is an unfolding tragedy.\" The United Nations anticipates that another 100,000 migrants will come to Italy via Libya before the end of this year. The number of arrivals is already 20 percent higher than last year; and the number of dead, those who could not be saved, would rise accordingly. According to UN estimates, the Mediterranean remains the \"deadliest\" refugee route in the world. Italian government statistics say that around 600,000 people have arrived in Italian ports since the start of the crisis in 2014. It is unclear how many have since traveled on to Austria, France or Switzerland. Once migrants are registered in Italy and accommodated in camps, they are not held there. If, however, they leave the accommodation without giving notice, they forfeit their claim to subsistence and social services. Most of the migrants are from African countries, and many try to travel on to France, for example. 300 people are currently sleeping on the beach in Ventimiglia, on the French border, hoping to take a bus or train to France. However, the border is being policed by French officials. Migrants who are caught are sent back to Italy. Austria has announced that it too will close its border with Italy if the number of migrants starts to rise. Repatriation and distribution are difficult Last year 120,000 new asylum applications were made in Italy. Around 50 percent of these are rejected. The asylum seekers are then supposed to leave the country. However, the process of people either returning voluntarily or being deported is very slow. The interior ministry has therefore announced that it will reinforce repatriation programs. The redistribution of asylum seekers from Italy, as agreed by the European Union, is well behind target. Two years ago the aim was to resettle 120,000 people. So far, only 24,676 people have been redistributed, the EU Commission said on Thursday: 7,873 from Italy, and 16,803 from Greece. The numbers are low not just because of the reluctance of other EU countries to take the refugees in, but also because of Italian delays in the registration of possible candidates. Asylum seekers from Eritrea are the most likely to fulfill the criteria for redistribution. Around 25,000 are currently living in Italy, but only 10,000 have been registered with the EU Commission and the European Asylum Support Office as possible candidates. Migration Commissioner Avramopoulos has announced that Italy will be given more help and logistical support in this area.",

The commissioner said Italy has been \"in a state of crisis\" since the beginning of the year, when it received more than 1.5 million migrants. He added that it was not only Italy that was facing a crisis, but also Libya, which was also the source of many of those migrants, as well as Morocco, Tunisia, Sudan and Libya. According to the commissioner, \"the situation in Libya is unprecedented and unacceptable.\" \"It is the first time in our history that a single country has faced such an acute crisis,\" he said. Italy's interior minister, Filippo Grandi, said on Thursday that his government was working \"very hard\" to find a solution for the migration crisis. Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has called for an end to migration to Italy, saying it would be \"a disaster\" if the migrants were not allowed to return to their home countries, where they would no longer be able to receive asylum. Speaking to reporters in Brussels, Italian Interior Minister Paolo Gentiloni said his country would continue to cooperate with efforts to reunify migrants with their families in Europe. But he also called on the European Commission to take action against migrants who have fled the country in recent months, warning that they could face deportation if they did not return home by the end of this year.

Berlin is one of four cities in Germany that have been chosen as host cities for the 2010 and 2011 editions, along with Paris, London, Madrid, Milan, Berlin and Paris. In addition to Germany, other countries have also been invited to take part, including France, Spain, Italy, Portugal, Russia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The tournament is expected to draw more than 1.5 million spectators from around the globe, according to a report by the newspaper Deutschland-Zeitung. According to the report, a total of 2.4 million people will attend the competition, with the majority of them from the Middle East, Africa, Asia and Latin America. There will also be women from all over the continent competing for a chance to win a place at the finals. German media have reported that Germany will have the strongest female soccer team in world history, ahead of Russia, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Qatar. But the organizers have yet to announce a date for when the games will take place, and it is not yet known whether the teams will compete for spots at other tournaments. However, it has been speculated that there could be a strong possibility that the women would be able to compete at a higher level of competition than in previous years, when they were competing against each other. This year, however, there is no word yet on whether or not the players will play for Germany or Qatar, or whether they will try to get a spot in a tournament that is dominated by men's basketball, soccer, tennis, football and other sports. That's not to say that it will not be the case, but the fact that they are competing in an international competition is something that will make them more competitive than they have ever been before. And that's a good thing, because it gives them an opportunity to show off their skills in front of a crowd of thousands of fans. They can't wait to see what they can do."

Officials in Port-au-Prince said the accident occurred as thousands of revelers filled the streets of the city center of the Haitian capital in the early hours of Tuesday.

        "target": "Is China seeking regime-change in North Korea? The sudden reduction in aggressive rhetoric and actions by North Korea has led to suggestions that Pyongyang has realized it has pushed its only ally in the region to the brink of severing its friendship. The announcement in Pyongyang on May 13 of the promotion of Jang Jong-nam to \"minister of the People's Armed Forces\" came out of the blue. Until recently, the little-known commander of an army corps in coastal Kangwon Province, Jang has replaced Kim Kyok-sik, a four-star general with a long track record of loyal service to the regime. The reasons for 70-year-old Kim's replacement are not clear - as with most of the political maneuvers in North Korea - but it may have been his loyalty that cost him his position in the politburo. Kim was widely seen as a hawk in the regime and is believed to have been in command of the operation to shell the South Korean island of Yeonpyeongdo in November 2010, an incident that killed four people, destroyed civilians' homes and infrastructure and dramatically worsened the already strained relationship between Pyongyang and Seoul. By sacrificing Kim, analysts believe, North Korea is signaling that it is backing away from the confrontational stance it adopted after the United Nations imposed new sanctions in the wake of the nation's third underground nuclear test in February. And there are other indicators that Pyongyang is seeking to return to the status quo. The North's troops have been permitted to step down from the highest state of preparedness for war that was initially ordered when South Korea and the US began a series of annual military exercises. Missiles withdrawn Similarly, two Musudan intermediate-range missiles that were identified as being on mobile launchers being operated in eastern areas of the country have apparently been ordered to return to base. In late April, there was concern that test-launches of the missiles would be a further escalation by Kim Jong-un's government and a message that it would not bow to international pressure to halt its nuclear and missile development programs. But the analysts believe the tokens of Pyongyang's goodwill have come too late. \"For the North Korean leader, this is a very difficult time,\" Toshimitsu Shigemura, a professor at Tokyo's Waseda University and an authority on North Korean affairs, told DW. \"Timing is very important here and it is possible that China is moving to abandon Kim Jong-un. The atmosphere between the two nations is changing. China may have decided that it is time for a regime-change in the North, they will not permit the collapse of the country because they do not want chaos on their own borders.\" Further evidence that Beijing is slowly tightening the screw on its erstwhile ally comes as more state-run financial institutions sever their links with banks in North Korea. The latest institution to adhere to the government's orders to halt transactions across the border is the Bank of China, one of the four major banks in the country, which announced on May 7 that it would cease dealings with the Foreign Trade Bank of North Korea, which has been identified as being involved in Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs. Contingency plan in place Intelligence sources have passed on to DW information that Beijing has a contingency plan in place for when Kim Jong-un's control over the country crumbles. The reports confirm that China is indeed quietly encouraging regime change and is grooming Kim's brother, Kim Jong-nam to take over his role. At 42, Kim Jong-nam is the oldest son of Kim Jong-il, the dictator who ruled North Korea with an iron fist for 17 years until his sudden death in December 2011. Kim Jong-nam had been expected to assume the leadership after his father's death, but fell from favor spectacularly in 2001 when he was detained with two women and a boy aged 4 at Tokyo's Narita International Airport travelling on a forged Dominican Republic passport. He later admitted that he had wanted to visit Disneyland. He subsequently lived in Macau and Beijing, under the close watch of the Chinese authorities. The reports suggest that after Kim Jong-nam is installed in Pyongyang, his brother will be permitted to go into exile, probably in China. The tactic is not without its pitfalls, however, in part due to the efficiency of the campaign to deify their young leader as the future of the nation. Kim Jong-nam as 'new king' \"China may be dreaming of appointing Kim Jong-nam as the new king - and he is more preferable to the West than Kim Jong Un - but the problem is that he is not known in North Korea,\" said Ken Kato, director of Tokyo-based Human Rights in Asia. \"Many people in Japan know much about the North Korean 'Royal Family,' but this information is hidden in North Korea,\" he said. \"Even residents of Pyongyang know very little about Kim Jong-nam.\" Yet the reports are gaining credence among North Korea-watchers. Jun Okumura, a political analyst with the Eurasia Group, told DW that North Korea withdrawing",
        "generated_story": "North Korea's 'new king' Kim Jong-un is the new king of North Korea, according to a report released by the country's state-run Foreign Trade Bank (FTB). The report said the North Korean leader was the first person to be formally recognized as the leader of the nation's ruling dynasties. The FTB's Jun Okumura told DW that the report was based on an interview with Kim Kyok-sik, who was born in the South Korean capital of Yeonpyeongdo in 1980. \"He is a very strong leader, and he has a lot of respect for the people of his country,\" he said, adding that he was \"very happy\" with his new title. But he also pointed out that his father, Kim Il-sung, was also a strong supporter of democracy and the rule of law in his home country. He also said that Kim was a \"strong leader\" and \"a very good person.\" \"I think he's a great leader and a good man,\" said Toshimitsu Shigemura, a professor of political science at Waseda University in Tokyo, referring to Kim as \"the new leader.\" He added that \"he's the kind of leader who is going to make the world a better place,\" and said he would like to see Kim become the next president of a country that has been ruled by a dynastic regime since the end of World War II in 1945. According to the World Bank's World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Japan, the former Soviet Union's largest trading partner, it was Kim's father who had the most influence on his son's life. In the past few years, North Koreans have become more and more dependent on the West for their economic and political support. On the contrary, they've become increasingly reliant on China, which has given them access to billions of dollars in loans from the United States and other countries. They've also been able to access a large portion of China's foreign exchange reserves in exchange for a loan of up to 10 billion won ($4.6 billion) from Beijing. And they're also willing to lend money to South Korea and Japan to build up their own military. It's not just the Chinese who are interested in Kim, but also the US and its allies, such as Russia and China. So far, there have been no major breakthroughs in this area, with the help of Washington, Seoul, Tokyo and Washington. However, China is not the only country to recognize Kim and his regime as a new \"king.\" The United Nations has called for an end to Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program and increased sanctions against the regime. China has also called on Pyongyang to halt its ballistic missile tests, saying they are \"unacceptable\" to its nuclear program. Pyongyang has said it will not allow the tests to take place without the support of its own armed forces. Author: Kim Yong-nam (AFP, dpa, Reuters)"

The case has highlighted the army's problems with equipment and morale. The men sentenced to death on Wednesday were part of the special forces division ordered in August to retake three towns in Borno state, which had been taken over by the Islamist Boko Haram insurgents. Their lawyer, Femi Falana, said the 54 men were sentenced to death by firing squad and five had been acquitted. They were accused of conspiring to commit mutiny against the authorities of the 7th Division of the Nigerian army, which is on the frontline. The trial began on October 15 and was conducted behind closed doors. It is subject to approval by top military officials, but there has so far been no indication that senior officers oppose the court martial. They were not available for comment afterwards. There was a similar case in Nigeria in September, when 12 soldiers were sentenced to death for mutiny after firing on their commanding officer in the northeast city of Maiduguri. The 7th Division, based in Maiduguri, leads the offensive but there are numerous reports of troops refusing to deploy. Soldiers have regularly complained that they lack weapons, food, and other basic supplies to fight the Islamists, who are reported to have tanks, rocket-propelled-grenade launchers, and other heavy weaponry.

Zielke had previously been put in charge of implementing reforms in the company's private banking sector following the recession. His restructuring measures attracted 800,000 new customers to the bank and changed the image of the 146-year-old financial institution. The 53-year-old has an illustrious career across several German financial institutions to look back on, having started at the teller of a local branch in 1983. Zielke's crowning achievement The beleaguered German financial institution recorded a profit of more than a billion euros (more than $1.1 billion) last year. It was the first time in five years that Commerzbank had made such profitable gains, which it said would translate into paid dividends for shareholders. A good portion of the yields were achieved by a restructuring and expansion drive of Commerzbank's private banking arm under Zielke's leadership. However, some of that money will go to the German government, as it had to step in and rescue the bank in 2009 to the tune of 18 billion euros ($25 billion at the time) by chiefly acquiring more than 15 percent of the shares, effectively nationalizing part of Commerzbank's operations. ss/jlw (dpa, Reuters)",
        "generated_story": "Commerzbank CEO Martin Zielke to be Commerzank's next CEO The German bank's chief executive has been named to take over from Martin Blessing, who stepped down in February. The move marks the latest in a series of shake-ups at the world's largest bank. In a statement on Friday, the bank said it had decided to step down from its board of directors after a year-long search for a new CEO. \"We have decided that Martin will take the helm of the company and we are confident that he will be the right person for the position of CEO,\" the statement said. It did not elaborate on the reasons, but it did say that the CEO would be chosen based on his experience in the financial sector and his track record as CEO of Germany's biggest private banks. He will also be responsible for setting up the country's second-largest private bank, Deutsche Bank (DBKG), and for managing the balance sheet of German banks, according to a source familiar with the matter. Zilke, a former chief financial officer at Deutsche Boerse, is widely seen as a potential successor to Blessing. On Thursday, he was announced as the new head of bank capital markets in Germany, where he had been CEO since 2009. His appointment comes after the German banking giant announced on Thursday that it would no longer be able to pay the salaries of its top executives. A spokesman for Zeltner bank confirmed the news, saying it was \"deeply disappointed\" by the move, adding that \"the bank was unable to meet the expectations of our customers.\" The bank also said that a number of senior executives had resigned from the board, and that there was a \"serious lack of trust\" among board members. According to Reuters news agency, there were no immediate reports of any resignations or departures from board positions. However, one source told Reuters that one of those departures was due to \"a change in culture and a change of leadership\" at a bank that has struggled to cope with rising costs. Another source said the change was motivated by a desire to cut costs and to make sure that its employees were well-qualified for future roles."

In a document on combating AIDS, the Commission said that as of 2007, around 2.2 million people carried the virus in the EU and nearby countries, an increase of 700,000 from 2001. According to Commission figures, around 730,000 of these live within the EU's 27 member states. France, Italy, Spain and Portugal have relatively high infection rates - ranging from 0.4 percent to 0.5 percent. In the Baltic country of Estonia, the infection rate stands at around 1.3 percent. In neighboring Ukraine, around 1.6 percent of the population has been diagnosed with HIV, while in Russia around 1.1 percent are HIV positive. The Commission warned that now was not the time for Europe to drop its guard on preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS, adding that in some neighboring countries the number of people carrying the virus had doubled. EU Health Commissioner Androulla Vassiliou said political momentum in the fight against HIV/AIDS needed to be maintained, adding that people must \"take responsibility for themselves and their partners by talking about and practicing safe sex and going for HIV testing.\" A cure for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has yet to be found more than a quarter century after it was brought to public attention. However, efficient treatments exist to slow the evolution of the virus. dfm/AFP Editor: Chuck Penfold",

A new survey has found that one in four people in EU countries who have tested positive for HIV have been unaware that they have the disease. According to the latest figures, the number of people infected with the virus has risen by one-third since the beginning of 2015. The figures are the highest since data began to be available in 2004. In the past year alone, almost two-thirds of those infected have reported being HIV positive, according to a survey by the European Commission. This figure is higher than the national average of 1.6 percent, which is also the lowest among the 28 member states. Androulla Vassiliou, a spokeswoman for the Commission, told DW that the figures were \"involving a very high level of awareness.\" \"We are aware that there is an increase in awareness and awareness of HIV,\" she said. \"But we are not aware of this increase.\" The survey also showed that a third of all people who tested negative for AIDS were unaware their status was in danger of being exposed to HIV or AIDS. Although the survey did not reveal any new HIV diagnoses, it was the first time HIV testing had been performed on a person who was unaware he or she had the condition. It is not yet known how many people have HIV, but it is expected to rise to at least three percent within the next five years. Vasserou said the figure was \"very high\" and that it could rise as high as four percent by 2020. She also said that HIV tests were being carried out on people with high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels. However, she cautioned that this was not the case in all cases, adding that \"it is very difficult to know for sure whether someone has HIV and whether they will be able to live with it for a long period of time.\" In addition, there was a rise in cases where people were told they had HIV but were unable to test positive because of a lack of information about their condition, such as the type of test they were taking. There was also a drop-off in diagnoses for those who were not infected, as well as in those with low-grade HIV."

        "target": "A Delicious Accompaniment for Wine A regular companion of the fall season's wines is a treat called Zwiebelkuchen, literally, onion cake. It is a one-crust pie, eaten in most German wine regions during the fall wine season. Zwiebelkuchen is traditionally eaten with Federweisser, a young wine available in Germany in the fall. The link between the two is so strong that many Federweisser wines have a recipe for the onion cake on their labels. Here's a recipe for it: Ingredients: 1 packet yeast, active dry 1 teaspoon sugar 1 1/2 teaspoon salt 3 cups unbleached flour 1 tablespoon shortening 1 cup water (49 to 54 C / 120 to 130 F) 6 slices bacon -- diced 2 medium onions -- sliced 1/4 teaspoon cumin 1/2 teaspoon salt Pepper 1 egg yolk 1 cup sour cream Mix the yeast with the sugar, a teaspoon of salt and half a cup of flour. Blend in the shortening and warm water, then beat for two minutes. Add enough flour to make a soft dough, and then knead the dough until smooth and elastic, about five minutes. Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, then cover it and let it rise in a warm place for 30 minutes. Pat the dough into a lightly greased 12-inch pizza pan or onto a lightly greased baking sheet. Press up the edges to make a slight rim. Fry the bacon until crisp and drain it on absorbent paper. Add onions to the bacon grease, and cook slowly until tender, but not brown. Sprinkle the onions, bacon, cumin, half a teaspoon of salt and pepper over the dough. Bake the cake at 204 C (400 F) for 20 minutes. Blend the egg yolk and sour cream and pour the mixture over the Zwiebelkuchen. Bake it for another 10 to 15 minutes, until the cake is golden brown and the sour cream has set.

        "target": "Bayern blast five as Schalke draw Bayern Munich stamped their authority over the Bundesliga on Saturday, with a ruthless 5-0 drubbing of Hannover at home. Meanwhile, second-placed Schalke and third-placed Frankfurt were forced to share the points. With many critics saying Bayern might as well be given the giant Bundesliga dish already, perhaps the struggle for second is shaping up to be the more compelling battle. But Saturday afternoon's clash between second-placed Schalke and third-placed Frankfurt did not take a decisive turn, with the game ending in a 1-1 draw. Schalke drew first blood in the 11th minute, when Frankfurt's Stefan Aigner was dispossessed in midfield, and Lewis Holtby released Klaas-Jan Huntelaar in front of goal - the Dutchman's first in the Bundesliga since September. But the hapless Aigner waited just over 100 seconds to make amends for his error, when the Royal Blues allowed him a free header that left goalkeeper Lars Unnerstall with no chance. But neither side could make inroads in the second half, which allowed Dortmund to leap-frog both sides and claim second place. Bayern take command Meanwhile the imperious Bayern Munich dispelled any talk of winter form-dip - following last week's draw to Nuremberg - with a brutally efficient 5-0 win at home to Hannover. The Bavarians stormed to a 3-0 lead in just 37 minutes, celebrating a nifty overhead kick for star signing Javi Martinez in the fourth minute. Toni Kroos and Franck Ribery scored the next two against a Hannover side that were torn open at will. The overhead kick was the first for the 40-million-euro ($52-million) signing Martinez, and in the second half new defender Dante also opened his account with a straightforward header from a Kroos free-kick. The festival of football continued just four minutes later, when Mario Gomez - making first Bundesliga appearance of the season - slammed the ball into the net from a tight angle just 30 seconds after replacing Mario Mandzukic. Dortmund win The champions Dortmund, meanwhile, are still nine points behind Bayern after beating Mainz 2-1 away. It was a potentially tricky fixture in the town where J\u00fcrgen Klopp began his coaching career, and Mainz showed their brilliance in the fourth minute, when Elkin Soto knocked a dream ball into the path of Marco Caligiuri, whose volley fairly screamed into the top right corner. Dortmund's own star-Marco - national team player Marco Reus - leveled the scores just eight minutes later. Reus worked himself some room at the outer edge of the penalty area, and slotted a beautiful 17-meter effort into the far corner. And Dortmund's second goal, just before half-time, was equally aesthetic - a vertical ball bisected the Mainz defense perfectly down the middle, where Polish predator Robert Lewandowski got his eighth league goal of the season with a deft lob over the onrushing Christian Wetklo in goal. Allofs' homecoming Bremen's 1-1 draw at Wolfsburg had a special frisson of its own, as Wolfsburg's newly-minted sporting director Klaus Allofs faced the club he had served as general manager for over a decade. And there was some gesticulating from the Bremen bench in the general direction of the Wolfsburg management when the guests took the lead in the 35th minute. Just seconds after Wolfsburg missed several chances, Marko Arnautovic was left free in the box after Eljero Elia found space on the left and cut the ball back for the Austrian to finish. But Wolfsburg got their own back in the second half. In the 62th minute, Bremen were reduced to ten men when Lukas Schmitz was given second yellow card for a hard tackle on Adelino Vieirinha. Just two minutes later, Bas Dost took advantage of their guests' disorgnaization and smashed the ball into the goal after neat piece of play from Vieirinha. Dirty derby The Franconian derby between Greuther F\u00fcrth and Nuremberg was a cagey affair that ended in a frustrating 0-0 draw. The first half was marked mainly by a straight red card for Nuremberg's Markus Feulner after an ugly, flying lunge on Stephan F\u00fcrstner. But the home side's numerical advantage was short-lived - Sercan Sararer was also sent for an early ice bath after his high elbow on Javier Pinola was adjudged worthy of a second yellow card in the 61st minute. But the aggression in the tackles was not matched by ruthlessness in front of goal, and neither side could eke out any clear chances.",

The Wolfpack are coming off a 3-1 win over Mainz in their opening match of this season, and they will be looking to bounce back from a 2-0 defeat at home to Hannoffen on Sunday. Bayern Munich, who have lost three of their last four league games, have been on the back foot for the last few weeks. They have a tough task ahead of them, as they travel to Cologne on Wednesday to face the Bundesliga's top side. \"We've got a lot of work to do,\" said Bayern coach J\u00fcrgen Klopp, referring to the team's recent form and the way in which they've been able to win away games in recent years. On the other hand, they have to deal with the fact that they haven't won a league game in over a year and a half. That's not to say they don't have the talent to compete in Europe, but they're not going to give up on that, either,\" Klopp said after the match. In the second half, the Bavarian side took advantage of a lack of quality from their midfielders, with Mario Mandzukic and Klaas-Jan Huntelaar combining to create a number of chances. But it was the Dutchman who made the most of his opportunities in front of goal. He also had a couple of good chances in his first Bundesliga start, scoring a goal in a 4-2 win at Nuremberg on Saturday. It was his second Bundesliga win in as many games and he'll be hoping to make it three more this time around. After all, he's a very good player, so he can score goals in all competitions.

What can you do to improve your chances of getting into the top four? It's all up to you. If you can do it, then you've done it for a long time. There's no reason why you shouldn't be playing at the highest level. I think it's just a matter of time before you get a chance to shine. We'll see what happens.\" The match between the two sides is scheduled to kick off at 1:30 p.m. CDU (1530 GMT) in Cologne, Germany, on Monday. Hannovers, meanwhile, are expected to be in action in Germany's second division, where they'll face Schalke, a side that have already won the league title and are on course to reach the quarter-finals in four years' time for their first European title since 1990.

Now the country wants to keep a positive trade balance by having the value of the imported luxury cars matched by red wine exports. Porsche is currently enjoying record profits after a two-year downturn, but the export-reliant company has hit a pothole in Argentina. Buenos Aires-based Porsche importer Grupo Pulenta has signed an agreement obligating it to export several hundred bottles of red wine for each car it imports, the Argentine government announced Wednesday. Grupo Pulenta declined to comment when contacted by Deutsche Welle. Job creation During the past year, Argentina has held thousands of high-end vehicles in customs until companies agreed to export goods valued at the same amount. Most of those vehicles came from Germany. According to a spokeswoman for the Argentine embassy in Berlin, the country has been trying to safeguard domestic employment with a positive trade balance. \"Our government has negotiated with automakers to balance their imports of cars with an equivalent amount of exports,\" she told Deutsche Welle in a statement. \"Since March 2010 we have been working with the automakers and importers in order to increase local integration and reduce the trade deficit in this sector.\" Small market A Porsche spokesman said the company sells just short of 100 vehicles into Argentina each year. That compares to more than 40,000 sold worldwide during five months in 2010. \"For Porsche, Argentina is a rather small market,\" the spokesman told Deutsche Welle. \"Our importer, the Pulenta Group, also deals in wine. They have their own vineyards and export that wine. It has nothing to do with Porsche - we just have an import contract with them, and it seems they've found an individual solution with the Argentine government.\" Domestic production Volkswagen, which has an Argentine subsidiary producing the new \"Amarok\" pickup truck and transmissions, has thus far avoided mandatory exports. The company had reported an export surplus of 384 million euros ($545 million) for this year. Porsche's holding company owns 32.2 percent of Volkswagen, and the Porsche brand is intended to become integrated into Volkswagen's lineup. Daimler and BMW also have subsidiaries in Argentina.

The move comes as a result of a dispute between the two companies over the sale of wine in Argentina. In a statement on Thursday, the company said it would stop selling wine imported from Argentina and would instead focus on red wines. \"We are going to continue to sell wine from our country,\" the statement said, adding that the decision was made after discussions with the Argentine government. It did not elaborate on the details of the dispute, saying only that it was \"in the interests of Argentina.\" The company also said that Argentina would no longer allow wine to be exported to Germany, where it is not allowed to do so. According to a report by Deutsche Welle, Argentina is the world's second-largest wine consumer after the United States, followed by China and the European Union. Argentina, which has the largest wine market in Latin America, is one of only a handful of countries with a market share of more than 30 percent. However, it has been able to increase its production in recent years, thanks in large part to the expansion of its Amarok wine production plant in Buenos Aires. This has led to an increase in the number of new cars being built there, as well as new models being launched in other markets. But the move also comes at a time when other European carmakers are struggling to cope with rising prices in emerging markets such as China, India, Brazil and Russia. Volkswagen, for example, has struggled to keep up with demand for its German-made sports cars, while Daimler and BMW have been pushing for higher prices for their cars. BMW and Mercedes-Benz are among the companies that have made the most profit from their wine business. German car maker BMW has also made a concerted effort to cut costs by cutting costs and boosting production. Germany's Volkswagen is also looking at ways to improve its competitiveness in developing markets like Argentina by reducing its reliance on imported wine. VW, BMW, Mercedes and Audi have all said they are looking into the possibility of expanding their European operations, but Volkswagen has not ruled out a move to expand its presence in South America."

The announcement came a day after the head of Poland's ruling Civic Platform party, Jacek Rostowski, resigned over the scandal, which has rocked the country's political landscape. He had been a leading figure in the opposition since the 1990s, but his resignation came just days after he was accused of sexual misconduct with a minor.

        "target": "Beekeepers battle mites with technology Bees are useful, hard-working and vital for our ecosystem. Aside from making honey, bees pollinate most of our food crops. But summertime is also the season for one of the biggest threats to honey bees \u2013 the varroa mite. Dete Papendieck puts on a white veiled protective hat and takes out a metal jug with a beak-shaped spout. He sets fire to the container's contents \u2013 formic acid \u2013 and starts directing the smoke that is wafting at the beehives lined up in front of him in his garden on the outskirts of Bonn. The acid doesn't harm the bees, but it does kill the varroa mites, he says. And July, after most of the honey has been harvested, is the best time to treat his hives. The one millimeter-large varroa mite is a parasite that infests beehives and lays its eggs in the honeycombs, alongside the bees' larvae. \"It feeds on the bees' and the bee brood's blood, the so-called haemolymph,\" Papendieck explains. A third of bees killed in Germany Papendieck is an apiarist at the Bee Research Institute at the University of Bonn and he knows that the threat of mites is serious. If left untreated, varroa-infested colonies rarely survive a winter. In 2010, German beekeepers lost about 200,000 hives to the mite \u2013 one third of Germany's total bee population. And it is not just the honey and beeswax production that are affected by the mite. Many of our food crops depend on bees: Some 80 percent of all agricultural plants and 90 percent of fruit trees in Europe are pollinated by Apis mellifera, the European honeybee. Varroa introduced from Asia Had Dete Papendieck been a beekeeper forty years ago he would not have had to worry about mites. He says the varroa mite that was originally native to Asia, was introduced to Europe in the 1970s. \"It happened during a research project in which it was attempted to crossbreed the European honeybee with the Asian honeybee. The researchers were exchanging bee colonies between Europe and India, and that is how the mites came to Germany,\" Papendieck said. Unlike Asian bee species, the European honeybee cannot fight off the varoa mite by itself. According to Papendieck, bees easily transmit the mite to other beekeepers' hives in what apiarists call robbery. \"It happens when certain colonies are being robbed by other bees. Large numbers of bees from different colonies attack weak hives and steal their stocks. At the same time, parasites and diseases are exchanged\", he says. Researchers have been trying to breed varroa-resistant mites, but so far they haven't had much success. High-tech tools help fight the mite Klaus Maresch is also worried about his bees. He is an organic beekeeper from Bonn and he has been passionate about bees since he was a little boy. \"They are part of my family. When I open my hives and smell the honey and hear the buzzing of the bees it's like being in another world,\" he told Deutsche Welle. In addition to using formic acid to fight the mite, Klaus Maresch employs a high-tech tool \u2013 a special cylindrical scale that helps him determine when it is best to start the varroa treatment. \"Every day this hive scale sends data about the colonies to our server. The data, such as the temperature in the hive and the amounts of nectar and pollen collected, help me to find a good day to treat varroa,\" Maresch says. Maresch also makes the data about the activities in his hives available to fellow beekeepers who can treat their colonies accordingly. A driver's license for beekeepers? But it is not the mite that angers Maresch most. \"That's nature,\" he says, \"I feel angry about beekeepers who don't fight varroa. If the bees of neighboring beekeepers are infested, I also have a problem.\" The existing German pest regulation obliges beekeepers to treat their bees against varroa, but there are no strict controls. The majority of Germany's more-than-80,000 beekeepers are amateurs who keep between one and 20 colonies. This makes it difficult to impose and survey certain quality standards. Maresch, who sees himself as a kind of 'bee activist', would like to see the government introduce stricter rules. \"There should be a law that obliges every new beekeeper to learn about beekeeping before they are allowed to keep bees. They should get an education and there should be something like a driver's license for beekeepers,\" he says. In the mean time, Europe's bees are going to have to",
        "generated_story": "German beekeeper fights varoa mite with a high-tech hive scale The German beekeeping institute has developed a new technology to fight the pest. It's called a honey bee scale, and it's designed to protect bees from pests. The beekeepers at the Bee Research Institute in Bonn, Germany, have been working on the project for more than a year. They've been fighting a pest that has been spreading throughout the country for the past few years. \"It's a very big pest,\" said Dete Papendieck, head of the university's bee research institute, adding that the technology is \"very, very advanced.\" The project is part of a research project to study the effects of pesticides on honeybees, which can be used to control pests, such as bees, mites and aphids, according to a report in the German newspaper Deutsche Welle. Maresch and his team have already tested the technique in a laboratory in Germany. In a study published last month, the researchers found that it was effective in fighting pests that spread to other parts of Europe, including the Middle East, Africa, Asia and the Pacific. But they also found a problem with the honey bees that had spread throughout Europe in recent years, as well as in North America, where they were able to pollinate up to 1,000 times as much honey as they could in their native countries. A new technique is being developed to combat this pest, they said. According to the report, it could be applied to all honeybee species, not just the ones that are most commonly found in Europe. This technique, dubbed the \"Bee Hive Scale,\" is based on a technique developed by researchers at Germany's state bee institute in Bremen, in collaboration with researchers from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). The technique was developed in response to an increase in honey-producing bees and other pollinators, who are more susceptible to pests and diseases that can spread through the soil. Experts say it is the first step in reducing the risk of pests spreading into the wild."

        "target": "EU Mulls Warning Labels to Curb Alcohol Abuse While still targeting smoking, European Union's public health commissioner is considering adding alcohol to the list of vices the bloc should clamp down on. In a report commissioned by the European Commission, the London Institute for Alcohol Studies recommended raising the legal age to buy alcohol to 18 (in some countries, such as Germany, 16-year-olds can buy beer), lowering the permitted blood alcohol level while driving to 0.5, banning alcohol advertising on TV and in movies as well as adding warning labels to bottles as ways of preventing alcohol abuse across the bloc. Which of the methods EU Health Commissioner Markos Kyprianou actually introduces will be announced \"sometime in the autumn,\" according to a spokesperson. Other options include a 10 percent increase in the price of alcohol. Kyprianou has, however, hinted that he favors warning labels -- similar to those that appear on packs of cigarettes -- that make the dangers of alcohol clear. \"Drinking harms your unborn baby\" on bottles? Brewers and wine makers across Europe, however, have come out against placing \"Drinking Kills\" or other labels on bottles of beer. \"Warning labels are the completely wrong way to go,\" Peter Hahn, head of the German Brewers Association told Germany's Express newspaper. \"The do not deter people who have lost a sense of how much to drink and unsettle the people who enjoy a beer after work.\" Industry groups also opposed implementing EU-wide guidelines in countries with traditionally different ways of approaching drinking and drinking problems. \"Policies that do not consider cultural and regional differences, will fail to deal with the social problems, while at the same time generate a rising level of political objections,\" said Rodolphe de Looz-Corswarem of Brewers of Europe. Keeping social vices separate Green party EU parliamentarian Hiltrud Breyer meanwhile called on the alcohol industry to stop \"saber rattling\" before it sees the a final version of the EU's strategy to prevent alcohol abuse. German Consumer Affairs Minister Horst Seehofer said he would wait to see what Kyprianou's actual suggestions are before commenting. Other German politicians, however, were more willing to voice the opposition to putting a sip of wine on the same footing with a puff of a cigarette. \"People should not expect that a skull and crossbones end up on every bottle of beer and wine,\" German EU representative Karl-Heinz Florenz told Der Tagesspiegel newspaper, adding that when it comes to alcohol, each member state should be responsible for how it deals with alcohol abuse. The harm of \"passive drinking\" While cigarettes are a health risk from the first puff, moderate drinking can actually be healthy and there is no danger from \"passive drinking,\" Peter Liese, a German EU representative, told the paper. The commission's report disagreed with Liese's conclusion, saying alcohol abuse had a major role in as many as 200,000 deaths in Europe due to car accidents and disease and played a role in some 60,000 underweight births. The report also estimated the effects of alcohol abuse of costing the EU 125 billion euros ($161 billion) in 2003. Some 25 percent of men and 10 percent of women in Europe drink what the EU considers to be more than healthy amounts of alcohol and between 3 percent and 5 percent are suffering from alcoholism, according to EU statistics.",
        "generated_story": "EU warns against 'passive drinking' on bottles of beer The European Commission has warned against the use of alcohol in beer. The EU's consumer affairs commissioner, Peter Hahn, warned on Thursday of the dangers of drinking too much beer on a regular basis. \"There is a danger to the health and well-being of people who drink beer,\" he said in a statement released by the German Brewers Association (BBA). \"It is not the first time that alcohol has been used as a substitute for beer.\" The association's president, Karl-Heinz Florenz, said he was \"very concerned\" about the \"harmful effects\" on people's drinking habits. He added that \"it is very difficult for people to differentiate between beer and wine.\" \"We have to make sure that the beer we drink is balanced and balanced, and that there is no harmful effect on our health.\" But the association also warned that drinking alcohol on regular occasions could lead to \"serious health problems\" in the long run. In the case of wine, for example, it is \"a serious health problem,\" according to a spokesman for the Association of Brewers of Europe (BAE), which represents more than 1.5 million beer drinkers in Germany and the European Union (EU). The BAE is the largest beer trade association in Europe. It is one of only a handful of trade associations to have a representative in every EU member state. BBA President Hiltrud Breyer said the problem was not limited to beer, but that it was also a problem with wine and spirits, as well as with tobacco and tobacco products. According to breyer, beer is more likely to be consumed in high quantities than in low quantities, with the exception of alcoholic drinks, which are more often consumed with high alcohol content, such as wine or beer with a high concentration of sugar content. But he also said that beer should not be sold on the open market, where people can buy it at a discount, rather than at the convenience store. That is, if the alcohol is available in bottles, then it shouldn't be available at all, he added, adding that people should be able to drink it without having to pay a premium for it. However, the BABA's chief executive, Rodolphe de Looz-Corswarem, also cautioned against \"over-the-counter\" sales, saying it would be \"unacceptable\" for consumers to sell their beer in large quantities."

Steinmeier issued the plea as he began a tour of the region to sponsor a new peace plan aimed at calming the simmering tensions over Georgia's separatist regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. \"This is my appeal to break out of the spiral of violence. A lack of dialogue is not an option for the future,\" he said after meeting with his Georgian counterpart Eka Tkeshelashvili. Steinmeier, who chairs the so-called Group of Friends of the United Nations' Secretary on Georgia, is proposing a three-phase peace plan based on a mutual declaration of non-violence and repatriation of about 25,000 ethnic Georgians expelled from Abkhazia in the 1990s. Negotiations over the status of the two rebel regions, which have enjoyed de facto autonomy since the end of a civil war in 1994, was reserved for the final phase of negotiations. Tkeshelashvili said, \"The plan has great potential for success,\" but added that the most difficult thing would be to convince Russia. Peace talks remain distant The threat of armed conflict in the region last month has given urgency to international pressure for renewed peace talks, but Tbilisi, Moscow and the Russian-backed regions remain far apart on the basic premises for restarting peace talks. Officials in Tbilisi oppose a treaty on the non-use of force without guarantees on the return of refugees and the withdrawal of Russian peacekeeping forces base in the region. Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was skeptical of peace efforts Thursday. \"Signing of a treaty on the return of Georgian refugees to Abkhazia is unreal now, because such a return requires a calm situation,\" Lavrov was quoted as saying by news agency RIA-Novosti. \"We think that signing a treaty on the non-use of force without any preconditions is an absolutely unavoidable first step,\" he added. Experts see little hope for Steinmeier's plan Analysts do not expect anything conclusive from Steinmeier's trip, pointing to intransigence on the part of the Abkhaz President Sergei Bagapsh, who said he would \"not consider the plan.\" \"We are not going to discuss Abkhazia's status with anyone. We are building an independent, democratic state,\" Bagapsh was quoted by Georgian news agencies as saying. Speaking to journalists ahead of the meetings Thursday, Steinmeier admitted: \"We don't have any illusions about simple answers, but we cannot stand by without acting on this conflict. That would be irresponsible.\" From Tbilisi, the German minister is to travel to the Black Sea city of Batumi for talks with Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili and then to Abkhazia on Friday before ending his three-day tour in Moscow. Most citizens of the breakaway republics have been issued Russian passports and over 2,500 Russian peacekeeping troops patrol the region under a UN ceasefire agreement. In opposition to Georgia's bid to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Russia moved to strengthen diplomatic ties with the breakaway regions sharply aggravating tensions with the Georgian leadership in recent months.",

The G20 summit in Tbilisi on Thursday is expected to focus on the conflict in the South Ossetia region, which is part of Georgia's breakaway region of Abkhazia. According to a report by RIA-Novosti, the talks are set to take place between the two regions, with the aim of creating a \"new peace zone\" between Georgia and Russia. \"We are looking forward to the beginning of a new era of peace and stability in Georgia,\" the report said, adding that it would be \"a great honor\" for Georgians to be able to return to their homeland. However, it did not mention the possibility of reunification with their former Soviet neighbors. A UN envoy, Sergei Bagapsh, said he was \"very optimistic\" about the prospects for a peace deal between Russia and Georgia, but added that \"we are not ready to give up our sovereignty and territorial integrity.\" \"I am very optimistic that we can achieve this,\" he said in a phone interview from the Georgian capital, Batumi, where he is staying with his wife, Eka Tkeshelashvili, and their two children. He also said that he would like to see an end to violence between pro-Russian separatists and the Russian-Georgian alliance. In the end, he added, \"Georgians will have to decide for themselves whether they want to live in peace with Russia or not.\" In a statement released by GNA, G-20 foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said the group would continue to work closely with Georgia to find a solution to its long-term conflict. She also called on Russia to step up its support to Georgia in its fight against separatism, calling for the return of ethnic Armenian separatists who have seized large swaths of territory in recent years. Russia, however, rejected the idea, saying it was not a realistic solution. It is not the first time that a conflict has broken out between ethnic Armenians and ethnic Russians. On the other hand, Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly called for dialogue between Moscow and Moscow in order to prevent a repeat of events in 2008, when Russia annexed Crimea and annexed the Crimean peninsula. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Wednesday that Moscow was willing to help Georgia achieve its goal of ending its conflict with Moscow."

        "target": "Maldives revokes state of emergency citing improved security situation The president of the Maldives has lifted a state of emergency following an outcry from the international community. The government says the measures are no longer necessary because the security threat has subsided. The government said Tuesday it had rescinded the emergency measures \"with immediate effect\" and that \"all fundamental rights that were suspended have been restored.\" President Yameen Abdul Gayoom declared the state of emergency one week ago after the discovery of a homemade bomb and a stash of weapons near his official residence. The finding followed an explosion on Gayoom's speedboat in September - an incident the government labeled an assassination attempt. The president was not hurt in the blast, but his wife, an aide and a bodyguard were injured. The emergency regulations, intended to be in place for 30 days, gave security forces wide-ranging search and arrest powers, and suspended citizens' basic rights. They drew criticism from former colonial power Britain as well as the United States, the European Union and neighboring Sri Lanka. Reading out a presidential decree revoking the emergency, Attorney General Mohamed Anil said there was no longer a threat to the Indian Ocean atoll nation. He said investigations into the September blast and the recovery of weapons had made good progress. The foreign ministry said a number of people had been arrested. Lawmakers also used the security regulations to fast-track the impeachment of Vice President Ahmed Adeeb, who stands accused of plotting the alleged attempts on the president's life. Impact on tourism Attorney General Anil said pressure from the international community, as well as \"the possible adverse impact on Maldives tourism and the economy,\" had also played a role in ending the state of emergency. Foreign tourists visiting the tropical nation, known for its luxury tourist resorts, palm-fringed beaches and coral reefs, contribute close to a third of the country's gross domestic product. The Maldives has had a rocky road to democracy since holding its first multiparty election in 2008. The country's first democratically elected leader, current opposition chief Mohamed Nasheed, was forced to step down in 2012 after a mutiny by security forces. In March, he was jailed for 13 years on terrorism charges in a trial the United Nations said was illegal. President Gayoom is under intense international pressure to release him. Nasheed's opposition Maldivian Democratic Party welcomed Tuesday's announcement. But said declaring the state of emergency in the first place was a political move designed to stop a rally planned for last week calling for Nasheed's freedom. \"It appears that Yameen is willing to make up threats about the nation's security in order to settle political scores,\" the party said in a statement, referring to the president. nm/kms (AP, AF, Reuters, dpa)",

He added that the move was \"in the best interest of our country and our people.\" The emergency was lifted after a UN Security Council resolution called for an end to the conflict and the lifting of restrictions on travel to and from the islands. However, the UN has warned that a new round of sanctions could be imposed if the situation continues to deteriorate. On Thursday, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon issued a statement saying the \"immediate cessation of all travel and economic activities\" would not be lifted until the end of this month. A UN special rapporteur on human rights, Amnesty International, and other rights groups said the decision was an \"important step forward\" in dealing with a crisis that has gripped the region since the beginning of last year. Human rights activists have called on authorities to restore travel restrictions to all islands, including the capital, Male, as soon as possible. Opposition parties have also been calling for a general strike against the ruling party, accusing it of failing to protect the rights of women and minorities. President Mohamed Nasheed, who is also the party's candidate for prime minister, said on Wednesday that he was willing to meet with the opposition to discuss the issue. But he did not say whether he would attend a meeting with opposition leaders in his home country, where his party is based, or if he planned to attend the meeting.

If she is no longer chancellor after the upcoming parliamentary elections in 2017, then others will have to live with the consequences of Brexit. But that is not what she is actually thinking. It is not coincidental that foreign ministers and government leaders are visiting Berlin in the coming days. They want to discuss how things will continue. Berlin, under Merkel's chancellorship, has become a center of power outside of Brussels. Difficult international politics The Brexit decision has disrupted Europe's equilibrium. Germany has lost an important ally on European issues related to economic growth and budgetary discipline. Now, France presumably will be the next to raise its voice against Maastricht Treaty criteria. If the Netherlands and Denmark also decide to leave the EU, Germany will become isolated, as Eastern Europe is not as tight with Germany as it once was. Poland now plays a key role for the Balkan nations and the Visegrad Group (Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic and Slovakia). And Poland is still annoyed about Merkel's refugee policy. What about Germany's populists? They're giddy with glee as they feel that their anti-establishment policies have been validated. They are teaching potential AfD (Alternative for Germany) voters a lesson: \"Here, have a look: it's possible. There is always an alternative. Vote for us!\" Those are exactly the words that protest voters want to hear. Germany's AfD has forged ties with other right-wing parties in Vienna, Paris, The Hague and London. They are all pursuing a \"European\" plan to gain power. The recent Austrian presidential election was significant, as the populist candidate lost by a very narrow margin; in fact, the final election results are still undecided as they are being contested. The Brexit vote was also triggered by populist powers. Domestically difficult Many populists believe that the stronger populism becomes - no matter where - the more advantages there would be for individual parties of their persuasion. Many would also like to see Donald Trump as US president. That is how AfD may become even stronger in Germany, which also means that political majorities would fluctuate even more. Will there be enough seats after the next election for a Christian Democrat and Green coalition, or will yet another grand coalition made up of Christian Democrats and Social Democrats be formed? Can Angela Merkel change course? Can she counter the trend with a new political model in Europe and Germany? Or do we stand on the edge of a new era, a \"political revolution,\" as the AfD calls it? Until now, Europe has survived attacks on its currency (euro crisis), the principle of peaceful coexistence (Crimea crisis) and its open borders policy (refugee crisis). Merkel deserves credit for defending these values, despite mistakes that have been made along the way. The outcome of the Brexit crisis is, however, still open. Have something to say? Add your comments below.",
        "generated_story": "AfD and the Brexit Crisis in Europe The AfD is a far-right political party in the Netherlands. It is the latest in a long line of anti-European parties to take a stand against the European Union. The party's leader, Kay-Alexander Scholz, told DW that his party would not stand for a referendum on the EU's membership. \"We will not accept a no-deal Brexit,\" he said, adding that the party was \"not willing to compromise with the interests of the people of Europe.\" He added that it would be \"unacceptable\" for the government of Germany to accept an \"alternative\" approach to Europe. He said that \"if we accept the position of an alternative to the current one, then we will accept it.\" The Alternative for Germany party, which is backed by the Social Democrats (SPD) and Greens, was founded in 2015 by former Chancellor Angela Merkel and her conservative coalition partner, Peter Altmaier. In the end, the two parties were able to form a coalition government and form the governing coalition that would take over from Merkel's conservatives in September 2015. Since then, however, they have been unable to reach agreement on a number of key issues, such as immigration, refugees and social security. They have also struggled to find common ground with other parties, including the Green Party, Freedom Party (FP\u00d6), the Greens and others. On the other hand, there has been a lot of progress in recent months, as well as the formation of a new center-left government in Berlin. But there is still much work to be done, and there are still many things to do. First of all, it is important to understand that this is not an easy task. Second, we have to figure out how we are going to solve this problem. And third, how do we solve it? How do you solve the problem of migration? Do you have a solution for this? What is your solution? DW spoke to a member of parliament in The Hague, who said he would like to see a change in Germany's immigration policy. DW: Is it possible to get rid of people who don't agree with you? The answer is no. You can't just leave them behind. That's not the way it works. There are many solutions. What we need is for people to come together and work together. This is something that can only be solved through cooperation and cooperation. We need a common solution. I think we can do that by working together as a group, not as an individual party. How can we do this without the support of our own people? We have an open and transparent system of government, so that people can decide for themselves how they want to live their lives. If you're a person who doesn't like the idea of having to work for your own country, that's a problem for you, because it's something you've had to deal with for yourself. So, what are the solutions for that?"

        "target": "Reports: Merkel to run for fourth term as German chancellor German Chancellor Angela Merkel has confirmed that she will stand for the chancellery in the 2017 election, German media reports. The Christian Democrat Leader (CDU) first took office in 2005. After months of speculation, German Chancellor Angela Merkel reportedly told her fellow Christian Democrats (CDU) in Berlin on Sunday that she is prepared to lead the party into next year's election. An official statement is expected from Merkel at 7 p.m. local time (1800 UTC) on Sunday. The 62-year-old has faced a number of difficulties in recent months, from criticism over her handling of the migration crisis to falling support amid a rise in right-wing populist sentiment. Since taking office in 2005, however, Merkel has also been praised for navigating Europe's largest economy through the financial and eurozone crises. According to an Emnid survey published in the German newspaper \"Bild am Sonntag\" 55 percent of Germans are in favor of Merkel remaining head of the German government for another four years. Thirty-nine percent said they were against her re-election. Sign of stability Should she be elected next September, another full four-year term would put Merkel on a par with her mentor Helmut Kohl who set the post-war record and presided over the Fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. In light of the UK's shock vote to leave the European Union in June and Donald Trump's election last week as US president, Merkel's re-election is likely to be welcomed in many capitals as a sign of stability. During his final visit to Berlin this week, US President Barack Obama said that if he were able to, he would vote for his longtime partner and friend. In an interview with German magazine \"Spiegel\" and broadcaster \"ARD,\" Obama said: \"She has great credibility, and she is willing to fight for those values in a way that is very, very important.\" \"I'm glad that she's there and I think the German people should appreciate her. Certainly, I've appreciated her as a partner.\" Winning back votes With the less that a year until Germany heads to the polls, Merkel's CDU is now turning its efforts to wooing back disenchanted voters who have left the conservative camp to support the right-wing populists, Alternative for Germany (AfD). Formed as a Euro-sceptic party in 2013, the AfD won 4.7 percent of the popular vote in the last federal elections in 2013, just falling short of the 5 percent threshold required to enter the Bundestag - Germany's lower house of parliament. After benefiting from the rise in europsceptic, anti-immigration sentiment, seemingly sweeping across western Europe, the party now holds seats in nine of Germany's 16 states.",

The announcement comes as the country prepares to elect a new president. Chancellor Merkel, who has been in power since 2005, is set to take office in a snap election on Sunday. German media reported on Monday that Merkel would seek the second term of her conservative Christian Democrat Party (CDU) leader Helmut Kohl, whose CDU is seen as a possible successor to Merkel. \"We have a lot of work ahead of us,\" Merkel told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper, adding that she was \"very happy\" with the outcome of the election. Merkel is expected to run for a fourth term as chancellor next year, after a four-year term that began in 2009. She is also due to be sworn in as parliament's next speaker in September, and will be the first woman to hold the post of chancellor since the end of World War II in 1945, according to a report in the German daily \"Der Spiegel.\" The paper also reported that the chancellor would be seeking a fifth term, with a total of four years remaining on her term. In the past, Merkel had been able to secure a majority of votes in parliament, but now faces a difficult task in her quest to win back the support of voters who have long been skeptical of Merkel's ability to lead the conservative party. On Monday, she said she would not run again until she had secured the votes needed to form a coalition government with her center-left Social Democrats (SPD) party and the Greens, which are seen by many as far-right and anti-immigrant. Her party is currently in third place in opinion polls, behind only the SPD and Greens. It is not yet clear whether Merkel will win the next election, or whether she'll seek another term at the helm of a party that has suffered from a string of scandals in recent years.

The kneeling protest, to highlight social injustice, has stepped up a gear. Hundreds of National Football League (NFL) stars protested President Donald Trump's call for fans to boycott the league by refusing to stand for the US national anthem this weekend, starting Sunday's game between the Baltimore Ravens and Jacksonsville Jaguars. A number of other players locked arms in solidarity ahead of the game at Wembley Stadium in London. Jacksonville Jaguars' owner Shahid Khan, who last year donated one million dollars\u00a0(840,000 euros) to the Trump campaign, locked his arms with players - a rare scene, as owners almost never take to the field. US media reported that about 200 players on Sunday sat, knelt or raised their fists in defiance of Trump's comments. In one of the most memorable moments, singer Rico LaVelle took a knee and held up a fist at the last line of the Star Spangled Banner ahead of the game between the Detriot Lions and Atlanta Falcons. The protest came in response to Trump's tweets on Sunday morning urging fans to boycott NFL games to pressure the league into firing or suspending players to kneel in protest during the national anthem. In an early morning tweet, Trump posted: \"If NFL fans refuse to go to games until players stop disrespecting our Flag and Country, you will see change take place fast. Fire or suspend!\" \"NFL attendance and ratings are WAY DOWN. Boring games yes, but many stay away because they love our country. League should back US,\" he added. Later, the president said that his rant \"has nothing to do with race,\" despite the fact that the origins of the protest are to do with police brutality against minorities, especially African Americans. Trump said his comments were instead about \"respect for our country and respect for our flag.\" Trump's spat with US professional sports began at a Republican rally in Alabama on Friday, when the president attacked activist NFL players for kneeling or sitting during the national anthem, labelling them as \"sons of bitches.\" \"Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, 'Get that son of a bitch off the field right now... he is fired'?\" Trump told a crowd of cheering supporters. That day, basketball star Stephen Curry, the top player for California's Golden State Warriors, announced that he would not be attending a traditional White House reception honoring the National Basketball Association champions. The kneeling protest was started by former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick who refused to stand for the anthem back in 2016. Kaepernick's gesture came amid a spate of deadly police shootings of black men and was aimed at drawing more attention to treatment of minorities in the US. However, Kaepernick has since become a free agent, after failing to be signed by a new team for the new NFL season. NFL executives decry Trump's calls Trump also drew the ire of senior NFL executives and team owners. Responding to Trump's tweets, Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti, said he \"100 percent\" supported his players' decision to kneel during the anthem. Robert Kraft, the owner of the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots, who is also a close friend of Trump, said in a statement on Sunday that he was deeply disappointed by the president's comments in Alabama. Kraft defended players' rights to \"peacefully affect social change and raise awareness in a manner that they feel is most impactful,\" and said that sports were a unifying force in the US. \"Our political leaders could learn a lot from the lessons of teamwork and working together toward a common goal,\" he said. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, who has taken much of the heat for Kaepernick's failure to find a new team, was also quick to condemn Trump's comments. Read more: NFL player's refusal to stand for national anthem ignites online controversy \"The NFL and our players are at our best when we help create a sense of unity in our country and our culture,\" Goodell said. \"There is no better example than the amazing response from our clubs and players to the terrible natural disasters we've experienced over the last month.\" Denouncing Trump's remarks, Goodell said: \"Divisive comments like these demonstrate an unfortunate lack of respect for the NFL, our great game and all of our players, and a failure to understand the overwhelming force for good our clubs and players represent in our communities.\" But Trump hit back later on Sunday at a worsening furore, saying the row \"has nothing to do with race.\" Instead, he said: \"This has to do with respect for our country, and respect for our flag.\" At least seven NFL team owners donated at least $1 million each to Trump's presidential campaign last year. They include the owners of the New York Jets, New England Patriots, Dallas Cowboys, Washington Redskins, Jacksonville Jaguars, Houston Texans, Los Angeles Rams and Tampa Bay Buccaneers",

The statement came ahead of Sunday's game between the New York Jets and the Los Angeles Rams, which is set to be played at Wembley Stadium in London, England. Trump's comments came after the NFL suspended 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick for a game in which he refused to stand during his team's anthem before the game against the Atlanta Falcons on Sunday night. \"I don't believe in kneeling,\" Trump said in a tweet, referring to the protests that have taken place across the country in recent weeks. On Sunday, Trump called on NFL owners to reinstate the league's collective bargaining agreement with the players, saying it was a \"violation of our collective right to protest.\" The NFL's executive director, Steve Bisciotti, called the move \"unacceptable\" and said it would \"harm our national security.\" \"The NFL has a responsibility to protect the rights of its players,\" he said, adding that \"it is the right of every NFL team to do what is right in the name of football.\" Trump has also called for an end to protests at sporting events, such as the annual \"NFL All-Star Game,\" which takes place on Feb. 4 in Las Vegas, Nevada. He also said he would hold a press conference at the White House on Monday to discuss the issue. In his statement on Twitter, the president said: \"We have a duty to uphold the rule of law in our country, and we will stand up for our players and our values. We will not stand for anything that is disrespectful to our flag, our anthem, or the flag.\" He added that he was \"deeply disappointed\" by the response of NFL fans who had criticized him for his comments. NFL owner Robert Kraft, who is a former NFL commissioner, said the comments were \"inappropriate and unhelpful\" to those who have criticized his administration's handling of social media and other issues, including racial inequality, police brutality and racial profiling. President Trump also criticized NFL teams for failing to adequately protect their players from being targeted by racial and gender-based violence, a charge that has led to a number of players being fired from their teams over the past two seasons. Last year's NFL season was marked by protests, with more than 1.5 million people protesting in front of Goodell's office in Washington, D.C. More than 100,000 people took to Twitter to express their support for Kaepernick, calling him \"a traitor\" who was fired in protest of racial injustice and \"an enemy of America's values.\" In addition to his criticism of Trump, Kraft also expressed his support of President Barack Obama's decision to ban the use of profane language in public statements."

        "target": "Turkey, Greece seek NATO mission in Aegean, says German official Germany, Greece and Turkey will ask NATO to approve a maritime surveillance mission in the Aegean to combat illegal people smugglers. Greece had previously voiced reservations about the proposal. The proposed mission to be discussed at a NATO defense ministers meeting in Brussels on Thursday comes days after German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutolgu said they would raise the issue of refugees with the Alliance. According to a Reuters report citing a senior German official, initially reticent Greece has now given the green light for the operation, which could see NATO assets deployed in the Aegean in a mostly intelligence and reconnaissance role. Under the proposal, which would need to be approved by Alliance members, NATO maritime assets would provide information to national coastguards and the EU border agency Frontex to combat illegal smugglers using rickety boats to bring migrants to Europe. Turkey would then take back the refugees, as envisioned as part of a 3 billion-euro ($3.2 billion) EU-Turkey deal agreed to last year. According to German sources, the mission would not be similar to the NATO mission in the Mediterranean intercepting migrant boats making the dangerous run from Libya to Italy. However, NATO ships could intervene in emergency situations to save passengers. \"It is not NATO's remit to push back or stop refugee boats,\" the official told Reuters. The mission would use assets from the Alliance's standing naval group, a permanent reaction force deployed in the Mediterranean. The naval group's current flagship is the German combat support ship \"Bonn.\" Denmark has already said it would provide additional ships to the mission, according to the official. However, it is unclear whether NATO members will approve the mission which may fall outside the bounds of the Alliance's mandate. Complicating matters is a long-running maritime dispute between Greece and Turkey over sovereignty in the Aegean, where the two NATO members' jets regularly engage in dogfights. Turkey has taken in more than 2.5 million Syrian refugees, and is a major transit point for migrants from Asia and Africa. More than a million migrants and refugees reached Europe last year, many making the dangerous boat journey from Turkey to Greece by boat. So far this year, more than 340 have perished in the cold waters trying to reach Europe. cw/msh (AFP, dpa, Reuters)",

The move comes as the European Union's interior minister, Ahmet Davutolgu, said the move was part of a broader effort to tackle the problem of illegal migration. \"We are going to use this force as a means of stopping the flow of migrants and refugees into Europe,\" he said in a statement, adding that the new force would be deployed \"in coordination with our partners in Europe and in cooperation with the international community.\" The deployment comes at a time of heightened tensions between Turkey and the West over the ongoing conflict in Syria, which has claimed more than 1.5 million lives since the beginning of the conflict, according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM). The EU and Turkey have been at loggerheads in recent weeks over how to deal with illegal migrant flows into the bloc. In the past, Turkey has been accused of harboring hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees in its territory. Turkey denies the accusations, saying the migrants are fleeing persecution in neighboring Syria and Iraq. Germany, however, has said it will continue to cooperate closely with Turkey on the issue. Last week, German Chancellor Angela Merkel announced that Germany would join the NATO mission in Turkey. German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel, who is also NATO's chief of staff for external affairs, called on Ankara to take action against the smugglers."

        "target": "A borderline war The crisis in Syria is in danger of drawing in neighboring countries. Despite the Syrian government's immediate apology, the shelling on the Turkish border has led to concerns about possible escalation. These weren't the first incidents on the Syrian-Turkish border, but the fact that several people on the Turkish side were killed by Syrian shells on Wednesday (03.10.2012) has brought the conflict between the two countries to a new level. It has led the Turkish military to retaliate for the first time. Several people were killed when Turkey shelled Syrian territory. But neither Turkey, which is a member of NATO, nor Syria would benefit from a broader conflict. An adviser to the Turkish president tweeted, \"Turkey has no interest in a war with Syria.\" Volker Perthes, director of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs in Berlin, agrees: \"Assad has no interest in an escalation,\" he told DW. \"That can be seen from the fact that the Syrian information minister apologized and expressed his regret over the victims immediately after the attack on Turkish territory.\" Perthes doesn't think it's likely that the Syrian President, Bashar Assad, wants to provoke Turkey to intervene in Syria. \"That would only accelerate the fall of his regime,\" he said. It's not yet clear who was responsible for the shelling. According to Syria's ally, Russia, it was a \"tragic accident.\" Relationship damaged The armed incidents on the Syrian-Turkish border have been going on for months. According to Amnesty International, some 300,000 Syrians have left their country since the start of the uprising against Assad, and many of them have fled to Turkey. The relationship between the two countries, which used to be close, has deteriorated dramatically, and the Turkish government is now openly supporting the Syrian opposition. \"Turkey is itself a player in the Syrian conflict,\" said Perthes. \"It provides shelter for many refugees and it's through Turkey that supplies come for the opposition.\" NATO has lined up behind Turkey and told Syria to end its \"flagrant violations of international law.\" Call for 'great discretion' The German chancellor, Angel Merkel, has also positioned herself alongside Turkey. \"We call on all parties to show great discretion,\" she said in Berlin. The foreign minister, Guido Westerwelle, declared that everything must be done to deescalate the situation, so that the Syrian conflict did not turn into a conflagration in the region. Indeed, the Syrian crisis is not only spreading to Turkey, but also to Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon. According to Perthes, \"The neighboring countries are partly victims and partly instigators. Jordan too has taken in refugees and supplies the rebels. On the other hand, Iraq has tended to support the government of Bashar Assad.\" Even so, he said, all the neighboring countries had an interest in ensuring the conflict was confined to Syria. Appeal to the international community But the number of Syrian refugees is rising by the day. Ruth J\u00fcttner, a Middle East expert with Amnesty International, believes this will continue in future months. \"It's important that the countries bordering on Syria are supported by the international community in providing accommodation, medical and psychological care and schooling for children,\" she told DW. It's an appeal she directs especially to European countries. The shelling on the Syrian-Turkish border has made it more likely that there will be armed conflict between Syria and its neighbors. According to Perthes, \"It's probably the case that political resistance in Turkey to intervention in Syria is decreasing right now.\"",

He added that there was \"no reason to think that this would be the case in the long run.\" \"Turkey is not the only country that is willing to step up its support for Assad, but it is also not going to stand by and allow him to impose his will on Syria,\" the spokesman added.

Although they sent no representatives to Switzerland, Islamists have agreed to halt the fighting. The Islamist-backed militia alliance that took over Tripoli and installed its own government announced a ceasefire on Friday, following a breakthrough in Geneva-based peace talks. Despite not attending the UN-brokered meeting, the militias have agreed to \"a ceasefire on all fronts,\" according to a statement issued by Islamist group Fajr Libya (Libya Dawn). The only condition is that \"the other parties respect the truce.\" The announcement came hours after the United Nations declared that Libya's warring factions had agreed to a roadmap for forming a unity government. Nearly four years after a NATO-backed revolt saw Moammar Gadhafi removed from power, two rival governments each backed by different groups of militias have plunged the country back into chaos and threatened all-out civil war. After the elected government of Prime Minister Abdullah al-Thinni was forced out of Tripoli by Libya Dawn, it was forced to move to the far eastern city of Tobruk while Libya Dawn reinstated the old parliament known as the GNC. The fighting and violence has displaced hundreds of thousands of civilians, left hundreds killed and thousands wounded. Most foreign diplomats fled the country and shut their embassies last year. The Tobruk government, as well as a few other factions who favor a peaceful resolution, came to Geneva to work on \"confidence-building measures,\" which includes the release of detainees from both sides, opening closed ports and securing safe freedom of movement around the country. es/bw (AP, AFP, Reuters)",
        "generated_story": "Fajr Libya declares ceasefire after two days of peace talks The GNC has declared a ceasefire in Libya after a two-day ceasefire brokered by pro-Gaddafi rebels. The ceasefire was announced on Tuesday after talks broke down in the eastern city of Tobruk. \"We have reached an agreement with the regime of Moammar Gadhafi,\" said a statement released by the government in Tripoli. It was not immediately clear what the terms of the ceasefire were, but it was widely interpreted as a tacit recognition of a deal between the two sides to end the conflict. A ceasefire has been set up for the first time since the end of civil war in 2011, which lasted for a year and a half, according to a UN report released on Wednesday. At the same time, the UN has called for an end to the violence, saying it is \"unacceptable\" to continue fighting in a conflict that has claimed the lives of more than 1,000 people. According to UN figures, around 1.5 million people have fled the country in recent months, while around 2.4 million have returned to their homes. On Tuesday, a truce was declared between rebel groups and the state-run General National Council (GNC), which is responsible for overseeing the security of Libya's eastern regions. Both sides have said they will continue to hold talks until a new government is in place. In the past, they have been fighting each other on a number of issues, including the right to self-determination, as well as the rights of women and children to vote in elections. They have also called on the international community to recognize their rights and recognize the rule of law by a transitional government. However, there is still a long way to go before the new regime is able to form a government, and that will take some time before it can do so."

        "target": "France's conservatives: Combating the National Front with a swing to the right A staunch conservative is joining the race for the French presidency. Republican candidate Francois Fillon could turn into a big problem for right-wing extremist Marine Le Pen's National Front. France's Republicans are moving to the right: by choosing Francois Fillon, voters nominated a presidential candidate who has a reputation as a staunch conservative. The former prime minister has already announced that he intends to refocus politics with the traditional family in mind. Fillon takes a dim view of homosexual couples adopting children. He wants to introduce a cap on the number of refugees allowed into France, he intends to make it harder for foreign nationals to access the social welfare system, and he wants to put Muslim communities and mosques under government control. In addition, Fillon advocates a renationalization of school curricula. Fillon makes gains in FN territory Fillon's agenda could turn out to be a problem for the \"National Front\" (FN). The 62-year-old appeals to similar sentiments as the right-wing party's base: concern about foreign domination and loss of identity, fear of terrorism and crime. \"For a long time, FN was the only political force that addressed those fears,\" said Henrik Uterwedde of the German-French Institute (dfi) in Ludwigsburg. \"Now a politician has arrived on the scene who addresses those fears using a different language and makes them a political offer.\" In rural, Catholic France especially, where traditions still matter a great deal, the avowed Catholic Fillon strikes a chord with his proposals pertaining to family and society policies. He receives support from traditional Catholic groups who, for years, have been able to mobilize crowds for demonstrations against gay marriage. During the intraparty election campaign, Fillon predominantly traveled to France's villages and small towns - regions which FN leader Marine Le Pen had labeled the \"forgotten France,\" regarding herself as their foremost lobbyist. \"Fillon has made gains in an environment that is also canvassed by Le Pen,\" Andreas Jung, Chairman of the Bundestag's German-French parliamentary group, told German broadcaster rbb-Inforadio. \"He does not represent the lofty levels of Parisian politics, but rather provincial entrenchment. Fillon is committed to traditional values, like the family. Therefore, he may not only be capable of defeating Le Pen, but also of taking the lead during the first ballot.\" 'Most dangerous candidate for FN' Consequently, the FN camp is less than enthusiastic about the conservative's candidacy. \"Because of Fillon, we now have a strategy problem,\" Marion Marechal Le Pen, the FN leader's niece, recently told journalists. \"He is the most dangerous candidate for the National Front.\" Pollsters' findings appear to support that statement. Recent surveys establish Fillon as the current favorite in the French presidential election scheduled for next May. However, Fillon's election is not a foregone conclusion. By denouncing the conservative candidate as a member of the establishment, FN tries to win over those who are frustrated with politics and politicians in general. There is persistent opposition against his economic-liberal plans in particular. Fillon wants to abolish the 35-hour working week and raise the retirement age to 65 years. In addition, he wants to cut 500,000 jobs in the public sector and reform industrial law. Fillon is known as an admirer of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. \"Issues pertaining to liberal economic policy have always been heavily contested in France,\" said Uterwedde. \"Fillon's adversaries have already taken up their positions, criticizing what, in France, is called 'ultra-liberalism.'\" That was one of the nastiest words in French politics, he added. An offer for the left Fillon wants to raise VAT by 2 percent. This would predominantly hurt low-income households. Exactly that clientele, however, is wooed by FN with a program that is regarded as rather left-wing. The right-wing extremists are on a clear anti-globalization course, intending to seal off the French economy against foreign countries and exit from the European Union. The party is already trying to present Fillon as a symbol of anarchic, ultra-liberal capitalism. \"Francois Fillon will even go beyond EU demands for austerity and liberalism,\" David Rachline, Marine Le Pen's election campaign manager, wrote on Twitter. According to current polls, it is very likely that Fillon will have to face Marine Le Pen in a runoff election in May. The main hazard for the Republican candidate: his economic-liberal course could deter left-wing voters from choosing the conservative in order to avert Le Pen. \"Francois Fillon will have to start making offers, also to those voters who are closer to the center and more moderate,\" said France expert Uterwedde. \"And he will, prior to the runoff election at the latest, have to make offers to left-wing voters - without changing his original course.\"",
        "generated_story": "French presidential candidate Francois Fillon is the most dangerous candidate for the French presidential election, according to the German-French Institute of Politics. The conservative candidate, Marine Le Pen, is far more dangerous than the far-right National Front (FN) candidate. According to a poll released on Friday, the right-wing candidate has the highest chance of winning the election in France, with a majority of the vote in the Bundestag. \"Fillon has a lot to prove,\" said Andreas Jung, head of Germany's Rbb-Inforadio think-tank in Ludwigsburg. He added that the FN candidate had the \"most chance\" of becoming France's next prime minister, and that he would be able to win the popular vote if he were to be elected president of France. However, Jung said, \"the chances of him becoming the next French president are very low.\" \"If he wins the presidency, he will have a chance to make history,\" Jung told DW, adding that \"if he doesn't win, it will be very difficult for him to do so.\" The poll, conducted by the RBB-INFORADIO, was conducted in conjunction with the parliamentary election commission, which is run by former French Prime Minister Manuel Valls. It was the first time that a candidate from the center-left party had won a national election. In an interview with DW's Henrik Uterwedde, a professor of political science at the Ludwig-Maximilians University in Munich, Germany, said that it was \"very difficult\" to predict the outcome of this year's election because of a number of factors, including the fact that there are only a handful of candidates who have already won national elections in Germany and the United States, among other things. That's not to say that all candidates have the same chance, but it is not impossible that they can win. There is also the question of whether or not they are going to run for president, or whether they will run as a conservative or a moderate. If they do, there is a good chance they'll be in a better position than they were in 2015, when they would have been in third place. And if they're not, then it's a very different situation, because they have to compete against each other. They can't compete with one another, so they've got to come up with something that will make them both more popular and more appealing to voters. So far, they haven't. But that's the only thing that seems to matter to me. I don't know what to think about it. What do you think? Do you agree with me on this? I think I'm a little bit of both? What does it mean to you that you're running against a certain candidate? Does it matter who the candidate is? Is it really you who is going against the establishment? If so, what does that mean for you? It means that if you are a centrist, you have no chance at all. You can only run against someone who's very, very far ahead of you. This is why you should not be afraid to stand up for what you believe in.\""

        "target": "Berlin court rules Google Street View is legal in Germany A Berlin court has ruled that Google Street View is legal. But that doesn't mean the lawsuits will end, legal scholars say. A Berlin court has ruled that Google Street View is, in fact, legal in Germany. Last Tuesday, the Berlin State Supreme Court (Kammergericht) announced its decision in a court case from late last year, in which a woman had sued Google, fearing that photos of her, her family and the front of her house would be posted on Google Street View and would thus violate her property and privacy rights. The court ruled that it is legal to take photographs from street level, rejecting her argument that Google was trying to take unauthorized pictures. Part of her argument rested on the fact that Google used cameras mounted at three meters (9.84 feet) high, which could see over her two-meter-high hedge. However, the court did not find this argument convincing, given that the photographs were taken from the street, and not the sidewalk. Furthermore, because Google automatically blurs faces and license plates and did allow Germans to opt-out of the service to have their house obfuscated as well, the court did not find any potential violations. This is the first high-level court ruling, which cannot be appealed any further, regarding Street View since the service debuted in Germany at the end of last year. An ongoing debate Since Google announced plans to launch Street View in Germany last summer, debate around the service has become heated, with some politicians trying to stop it at every turn, while German Chancellor Angela Merkel famously said that she would not remove her house from Street View. In November 2010, the company announced that 244,000 German residents in the 20 cities had chosen to opt out of Street View - less than three percent of residents. However, in Germany and everywhere else, the company also allows people to report abuse, inaccuracies or request that something be blurred using an online tool. \"Our job is to develop services that respect these cultural differences,\" Peter Fleischer, Google's global privacy counsel told Deutsche Welle in November 2010. \"We try to anticipate them. We're all internationally-minded people ourselves. We try to guess how people will react to them. But a lot of these services are new and have never been on the market before, so we learn and we adapt as we go along.\" A 'landmark decision' European legal experts called the Berlin ruling a \"landmark decision,\" saying that this would now become part of German case law regarding property rights. \"Yes, other people are now warned: Don't sue Google simply claiming that Google Street View violates personality [or] property rights,\" wrote Thomas H\u00f6ren, a professor of media and communications law at the University of M\u00fcnster, in an e-mail sent to Deutsche Welle. But, he also warned that this decision was very narrow, focusing on the issue of property rights, and not on the larger issues of data protection from Google. \"The problem of Google Street View - to be honest - has never been a problem of personality rights or property rights, but the enormous risk of personal data compilations in cases where people use Google Street View for compiling personal profiles (such as building insurance companies; future employees, et cetera),\" he added. \"And this risk has not been considered by the Berlin courts.\" Similarly, Viktor Mayer-Sch\u00f6nberger, a professor at the Oxford Internet Institute, agreed that this case was \"limited in scope,\" adding in an e-mail, \"The plaintiff never alleged an actual invasion of privacy, just a potential one.\" Author: Cyrus Farivar Editor: Nancy Isenson",

The decision by the Berlin State Supreme Court on Tuesday will decide whether to allow the use of Google street-view technology in the country. German Chancellor Angela Merkel's government has said it will allow Google to use the technology to improve the lives of millions of people worldwide. \"We are going to let Google do what it has always done,\" Merkel said at a news conference in Berlin on Wednesday. She said the decision was a \"historic step forward\" for the Internet and that Google should be allowed to continue to offer its services to people in need. Google's Peter Fleischer, the German state's chief technology officer, argued that the move was necessary to protect the privacy of its users. He said Google must be able to make its products more accessible to users in other countries, such as the United States, Canada and the EU. In the end, he said, it was up to the users to decide for themselves whether or not they wanted to buy a product from Google, or whether they would have to pay for it themselves. But the court's decision is not the first time Google has faced criticism over its decision. It is the second time in less than a year that a German court has ruled in favor of a Google-owned search engine. On Tuesday, a Berlin state court ruled against the search giant, saying it had failed to provide sufficient information about the company's products and services. That ruling, which is expected to be announced later this year, was the latest step in an ongoing battle between Google and Facebook over the right to market their products. Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, Facebook and YouTube are among the companies that have been accused of violating the terms of service of their agreement. They have denied the allegations. A Google spokeswoman said that \"we do not comment on individual cases, but we are not commenting on specific cases.\" The company has not commented on whether the ruling will affect other companies."

        "target": "UK lawmakers propose jail sentences for reckless bankers A British parliamentary commission has completed its work on the overhaul of the domestic banking sector. Among other things, it proposed jail terms for bankers displaying grave malpractice and causing huge damage. Members of the UK's Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards agreed Wednesday that Britain needed a radical overhaul of its scandal-hit lenders. The panel, which was mostly composed of lawmakers, concluded in its final report that senior bankers must be made personally responsible for malpractice through the introduction of a new criminal offence of reckless misconduct. It would carry a prison sentence. The reputation of the country's banking sector had been damaged in recent years by a string of scandals, including Libor rate-rigging, credit insurance mis-selling and a controversy over staff behavior and bonuses in the run-up to the 2008 global financial crisis. The level of malpractice had been \"shocking and widespread,\" said the commission's chairman, Conservative party lawmaker Andrew Tyrie. RBS cut in two? \"Taxpayers and customers have lost out, and the economy has suffered,\" the 500-page report said. \"Under our recommendations, senior bankers who seriously damage their banks or put taxpayers' money at risk can expect to be fined, banned from the industry or in the worst cases go to jail.\" The commission called for bankers to sign up to a new code of conduct under which all key responsibilities within a bank would be assigned to specific senior officials who would be held responsible. The panel also proposed that more remuneration for bankers should be deferred for longer periods of up to ten years in order to \"reflect the longer run balance between business risks and rewards.\" The commission recommended that the government consider splitting the state-rescued Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) into a good bank and a bad one mopping up toxic assets. The report was published ahead of a key speech by Finance Minister George Osborne on his bank reform plans. hg/ipj (AFP, Reuters)",
        "generated_story": "Reprehensibility of Bank Mafia: A British parliamentary commission on banking standards has found that the banking industry is rife with fraud and corruption. A report released on Wednesday by the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards (PCS) found the practice of bank fraudsters to be widespread and widespread. The report, published in the British newspaper The Times, said it was \"deeply perplexing\" to see how widespread the problem was. \"We have a lot of fraud going on,\" said Andrew Tyrie, the chairman of the PCS, referring to the scandal that has engulfed the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) over the past few years. It is not the first time that a bank has been accused of financial fraud, but it is the latest in a series of scandals that have led to investigations into the bank's finances. In the wake of a scandal involving the sale of shares in RBS, a number of banks have been forced to close their books, including the UK's largest bank, HSBC, which is now the world's biggest lender by assets, according to a parliamentary report published last week. Barclays and HSBC are among the biggest banks in Britain, with a combined market capitalization of more than $1.5 trillion. But the banks are also the largest lenders in Europe and the Middle East, and they are the only banks that are not heavily regulated by central banks. They do not have access to capital markets, so they don't have the ability to lend and lend to each other. That is why they have to rely heavily on the financial services sector to survive and thrive in today's financial markets. This is a problem that can only be solved through the use of technology and innovation. There is no such thing as a banking system that is free of corruption, corruption or fraud. What is banking banking? The banking sector has a long history of corrupt practices and it's not just banks who are guilty of this, it has also been the case with banks such as HSBC and Lloyds Bank. These banks, however, have long had a reputation for being corrupt and unscrupulous in their dealings with the public. For example, when it comes to lending to individuals and companies, there is little evidence that they can be trusted to do the right thing by lending money to people who don\u2019t have any experience in banking. So the question of whether banks should be allowed to borrow money from other banks is something that will be debated and debated in parliament. If they do, then they will need to make sure that their customers are treated fairly and transparently, as well as being able to access the money they need. And that means that if they want to get their money back, they must be careful about what they spend it on."

But a leading think tank has warned against giving raises too soon. Germany's foreign minister and deputy chancellor, Guido Westerwelle, has added his support to comments made by Economics Minster Rainer Bruederle about increased wages for German workers. \"When the economy grows and this growth is substantial and sustainable, then the benefits of this upswing should be felt by the people who worked so hard for it,\" Westerwelle told the Hamburger Abendblatt newspaper in an interview. Westerwelle heads the free-market liberal FDP, which shares power with Chancellor Merkel's Christian coalition. Earlier this week, Bruederle, also an FDP member, said in light of Germany's currently growing economy, those economic gains should trickle down to employees in the form of higher wages. Merkel, who is also the head of the Christian Democratic Union, supported Bruederle's idea. \"That is something the chancellor sees the same way, letter for letter,\" said Merkel's spokesman, Steffen Seibert. Not so fast Earlier this week, analysts predicted growth of 3.5 percent this year and 2 percent in 2011. Germany's five leading economic think tanks also predicted that the number of unemployed would fall below 3 million next year, the lowest level since 1992. Despite the current rosy outlook for the German economy, not everyone is convinced that a growing economy should inevitably lead to higher wages. The president of the German Institute for Economic Research, Klaus Zimmermann, warned against reacting too quickly. \"I can't support the idea of a general wage increase, I think it is too dangerous,\" Zimmermann said in an interview with the Handelsblatt newspaper. Zimmermann wasn't opposed to the idea of raising wages, but said he was against across-the-board increases for all sectors and pointed out that not every industry is benefitting the same from the growing economy. \"We can't forget that the German economy did not resort to mass lay-offs when it wasn't going so well last year,\" Zimmermann said. Raising wages in some branches could be a good idea, Zimmermann said, as that would make those branches more attractive option to potential workers from outside of Germany.

The SPD's deputy chancellor, Rainer Bruederle, said on Thursday that she would oppose the general increase in the German wage. \"I don't think the SPD is going to allow this to happen,\" she said in a statement, referring to the party's coalition partner, the center-left FDP (FDP). \"The SPD has a lot of work to do, and I think it's time for the chancellor to make a decision on this,\" he said, adding that his party would not support such a move. German Economy Minister Guido Westerwelle said he was \"very disappointed\" by the government's decision to raise the wage for German workers by 0.4 percent in 2017. He also said that it would be \"unacceptable\" for Germany to have a wage increase of 1 percent for workers who earn less than 1 euro ($1.06) a year, which would amount to a 2.2 percent increase for those who receive no more than 2 euros a month. In a speech delivered in Berlin on Wednesday, Chancellor Merkel said Germany should be able to \"make the most of this opportunity.\" The chancellor's conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party has called for a 5 percent rise in wages for 2017-18, while the Greens and the Socialists have been pushing for an increase to 2 percent. Both the CDU and Greens have rejected the idea, arguing that higher wages are better for people who work longer hours and are less likely to lose their jobs. On Thursday, Merkel called on the federal parliament to pass a bill that would increase the national minimum wage to 3 percent from the current 3.6 percent level. Merkel, who is seeking a third term in office, has been criticized by her conservative coalition partners for failing to reach a deal with labor unions over the issue of collective bargaining rights. She has also been critical of unions, saying that they should not be allowed to discriminate against members of their own party. Her party is also opposed to raising the level of unemployment in Germany by 5.7 percent, a figure that is far higher than in other European Union countries. It is not clear whether the Chancellor will sign the bill, or not."

Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko was sworn into office on Friday in a lavish ceremony boycotted by Western diplomats. The previous day, the 56-year-old leader openly accused Germany and neighboring Poland of planning a coup against him. \"There were [in Germany and Poland] plans worked out for an overthrow of the constitutional order,\" Lukashenko said in the Belarusian capital, Minsk, on Thursday. \"This is not an invention of our intelligence agencies.\" Lukashenko, who came to power in 1994, was re-elected last month with 80 percent of the vote in what the opposition and international monitors said was a rigged election. Relations between the reclusive Belarusian government and the West have been strained ever since. 'Belarus question must be answered' German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said in a statement that the accusations were \"baseless\" and an attempt by Lukashenko to draw attention away from his own wrongdoing. \"The EU needs to find a clear political answer to events surrounding the presidential election and the continued incarceration of opposition politicians and their supporters,\" Westerwelle said. A wide-reaching crackdown against the regime's opponents followed Lukashenko's re-election. Hundreds of his critics were arrested and dozens threatened with long-term jail sentences. Poland also dismissed the accusations as absurd and said that relations with Minsk would not be normalized unless all political prisoners were released. Sanctions threat The situation in Belarus pushed the European Union to adopt a resolution on Thursday in support of economic sanctions against the country. The threats earned a sharp rebuke from Lukashenko, who promised the \"hardest possible reaction\" should the bloc impose sanctions against his country. At the same time, the Belarusian prime minister, Mikhail Myasnikovich, travelled to Moscow in a effort to shore up Russian support for Minsk during its standoff with the EU. That meeting ended with a Russian promise not to impose its own set of sanctions on Belarus over an unrelated spat over oil exports and a commitment to resume a nuclear power plant project shelved after the 1986 Chernobyl disaster.

The Belarusian government said on Tuesday that it would no longer allow candidates to run for president. \"We will not allow any candidate who is not a member of the opposition to enter the race for the presidency,\" said the head of Belarus' electoral commission, Guido Westerwelle, in a statement released by his office. He did not elaborate on the allegations, saying only that they were \"inaccurate\" and that he was not aware of any such allegations. In the run-up to the election, Belarus had promised to hold a referendum on whether or not to allow a new president to be elected. However, the government has said that the referendum would not be held until the end of this year. Opposition parties, however, have been calling for an early election and said they would hold an election in early 2018. They have also called for early elections, but have yet to set a date for that. On Tuesday, a parliamentary election was scheduled to take place in Belarus, with the first round of voting set to begin on March 1. Belarus is one of Russia's largest trading partners and the world's second-largest trading partner after the United States. It is the second time in less than a year that Belarus has had a president who has not run again. Last year's elections were marked by a series of scandals, including a scandal involving the sale of state-owned oil and gas assets to a Russian company, as well as corruption allegations against the company's chairman, Mikhail Myasnikovich, which is owned by the Russian state. Ukraine and Russia have long been at loggerheads over the handling of Ukraine's conflict in eastern Ukraine. Russia and Belarus have a long history of fighting each other, and Ukraine is no exception. But the two countries are also at odds over Ukraine, where President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly accused the West of meddling in its internal affairs. Moscow has denied accusations that Moscow meddled in Ukraine in order to influence the outcome of a disputed presidential election last year, accusing the Kremlin of interfering in that election. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow had \"no interest in interfering\" in this process, adding that Russia was \"not a party to any of these allegations.\" The Kremlin has also accused Belarus of violating international sanctions against Moscow over its actions during the Ukraine crisis."

Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government told the Supreme Court of India on Monday that the Rohingya were \"illegal\" immigrants. The hearing is taking place as Rohingya face severe violence in their native Myanmar. More than 400,000 Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh in the past few weeks to escape military and civilian reprisals that the United Nations has described as \"ethnic cleansing.\" Later on Monday, Myanmar's national security advisor said that his government was willing to welcome the refugees who had fled to Bangladesh back to their native Rakhine state, but that the details of the process still had to be worked out. \"We will make sure that everybody who left their home can return to their home but this is a process we have to discuss,\" Thaung Tun told Reuters news agency after a meeting with British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. It was unclear how this would affect the estimated 40,000 Rohingya believed to have settled in India, including 16,000 of whom are registered with the UN's refugee agency. Read more: Myanmar's Rohingya - A history of forced exoduses The Indian government told the court that it had intelligence data that showed links between some Rohingya Muslims and Pakistan-based terror groups and other international terror organizations. It argued that such links made them a \"serious threat to national security.\" The government also said there was a \"serious possibility of eruption of violence against Buddhists in India by radicalized Rohingya.\" Lawyer Colin Gonsalves, who in a separate case is representing about 7,000 Rohingya living in the northern Indian city of Jammu, countered the government's assertions. \"We just want to know: 40,000 people have been here, many of them for the last five years. Have you [the government] filed a single charge sheet, is anyone being prosecuted in the criminal court for being a terrorist? The answer is: no,\" he told DW. The court has adjourned the hearing in the matter to October 3. Lack of evidence India says it is not bound by the UN convention on refugees as it is not a signatory to the accord, but human rights activists disagree. \"The principle of non return of a person to a place where he will be executed or tortured has become a principle of customary international law which India follows,\" Gonsalves told DW. \"And it has attained the status of 'jus cogens,' which is a principle of law that no country can say is not applicable to it, such as torture and genocide.\" In a communication sent to all states in August, the Home Ministry [interior ministry] said the illegal migrants were more susceptible to terrorist recruitment efforts. But an investigation by Indian broadcaster NDTV found \"little evidence of the government claim.\" The investigation that was carried out at major Rohingya settlements in the country showed little involvement in criminal wrongdoing by the refugees. Lack of any evidence to support the government claim has led to speculations that the Rohingya were being targeted for their religion by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu-nationalist government. \"It is really unfortunate that the government is going back on its commitment to refugees which it has reiterated several times in the past merely because these Rohingyas are Muslims,\" said lawyer Prashant Bhushan, who filed the plea on behalf of two Rohingya men. \"I mean this is clearly a case of religious discrimination and an attempt to arouse a sort of feeling of... an anti-Muslim feeling or try and communalise the situation,\" he told reporters outside the courthouse. The UN's human rights chief last week deplored Indian government's move to deport Rohingya refugees. \"India cannot carry out collective expulsions, or return people to a place where they risk torture or other serious violations,\" Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein said. The Rohingya are an Indo-Aryan people, the vast majority of whom are Muslims. They usually migrate to India through a rather porous border to escape persecution in their native Rakhine state in Myanmar, where they have been denied citizenship rights. They are viewed by the local authorities as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. Myanmar's Buddhist majority is often accused of subjecting them to discrimination and violence.

Hundreds of people, the majority of them Rohingya, have been killed in the violence that has seen many homes destroyed and several villages burned down. Myanmar's government maintains the crackdown is part of a counter-terrorism drive, while the UN's al-Hussein has said that it \"seems a textbook example of ethnic cleansing.\"",

Indian Foreign Minister Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein told a news conference in Jammu, India, that \"the Rohingya are a grave threat.\" \"They pose an extremely serious threat,\" he said, adding that he was \"deeply concerned about the situation in Rakhine state, which is under the control of the Myanmar security forces.\" The statement came as the UN Security Council held a special meeting in New Delhi to discuss Myanmar's handling of Rohingya refugees. The UN's special envoy for Myanmar, Prashant Bhushan, said that Myanmar was taking steps to deal with the crisis. \"We are taking action to address the humanitarian and security needs of our people,\" the envoy said in a statement released by the Indian foreign ministry on Wednesday. India and Myanmar have been at loggerheads over the issue, with Myanmar accusing India of failing to provide adequate security to Rohingya in the run-up to last year's elections. Myanmar has also accused the United Nations of not providing adequate support for the refugees, saying that it was unable to meet its obligations under international humanitarian law. In a letter to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said India was working to find a way to resolve the conflict. He also called on the international community to support Myanmar in its fight against terrorism. Modi's government said it would continue to work with UN agencies to ensure the safety of its citizens. However, he also warned that India would not be able to guarantee the security of Myanmar if Rohingya were to return to their homes in India. 'We will not allow this to happen,' Modi wrote in his letter, referring to his government's commitment to providing security for Rohingya people."

Monday's announcement by Pat McQuaid, the president of the International Cycling Union, ratified recommendations in an October report from the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), which ordered Armstrong's Tour de France titles be wiped out. \"Lance Armstrong has no place in cycling,\" said McQuaid. Addressing his remarks to cyclists, McQuaid said the fight against doping was his priority. \"UCI is listening and is on your side. We\u2019ve come too far in the fight against doping to return to our past. Cycling has a future and something like this must not happen again.\" The scathing USADA report included testimony from 11 former teammates, accusing Armstrong of running the \"most sophisticated\" doping program in the sport's history. The USADA said it had collected evidence to prove the seven-time Tour de France winner had engaged in the biggest doping conspiracy to date. Effect on cycling and sponsorship Monday's decision comes as the sport of cycling reels from Armstrong's well-documented fall from grace. Organizers of the Tour de France will be trying to move on from the scandal as the race prepares to celebrate its centenary next year. Sponsors have been deserting Armstrong and the sport in general. Last week, Nike - one of Armstrong's main corporate sponsors - said it was terminating its relationship with the cyclist and accused him of deception. Trek, the company that made the bicycles Armstrong rode to seven titles, announced on the same day it would terminate its sponsorship contract - as did the beer maker Anheuser-Busch. The Dutch institution Rabobank ended its association with professional cycling after the doping allegations came to light, leaving 17 riders in need of a sponsor. Last week Armstrong also announced he would step down from his own charity, the Lance Armstrong Foundation, also known as Livestrong, a move believed to have been intended to limit the damage to the organization from the USADA report. Armstrong appears Lance Armstrong spoke briefly to thousands of riders in Texas at a benefit organized by his charity, the day before UCI's decision. \"I've been better, but I've also been worse,\" he said. \"Obviously it has been an interesting and difficult couple of weeks.\" jr/rc (Reuters, AFP, AP)",
        "generated_story": "Lance Armstrong stripped of Tour de France titles Lance Armstrong has been stripped by the International Cycling Union (IUCN) of his three Tour titles. The US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) said on Thursday that Armstrong had failed a drug test. Armstrong, who was banned from cycling for life in 2008 for doping, was stripped from his titles in 2009, 2010 and 2011, respectively. He was suspended for two years in 2011 and 2012 for failing an anti-doping test in which he tested positive for amphetamines. In 2012, Armstrong was also banned for one year in the United States for using banned substances in his home country of New Zealand. \"I was not aware that I had been banned,\" Armstrong said in a statement released by his foundation, which is owned by Anheuser-Busch, the world's largest brewer of beer, according to its website. A spokesman for the USADA said the company had no immediate comment on Armstrong's decision to step down from the Tour of France, but added that it was \"deeply regretful\" that he had not been given the opportunity to return to the sport he loved so much after his doping ban was lifted last year. 'I regret to inform you of my decision,' Armstrong told reporters at the end of a press conference in New York, adding that the decision was made \"in accordance with the rules of the competition.\" \"We regret that we were not able to make this decision,\" he said, referring to his decision not to renew his contract with Rabobank after a doping scandal broke out during the 2014 Tour. An investigation was launched into the case, and the U.S. government said it had found no evidence of any wrongdoing by Armstrong during his time on the road in 2006 and 2007, when he was still a member of Team USA. His suspension came after the team announced it would no longer be allowed to compete in next year's Tour, despite the fact that they had already won three of their last four races, including the 2009 and 2010 Tours. Lance's suspension comes as he faces a possible suspension of up to four years if he fails to complete his drug tests in time for his 2012 and 2013 Tour races. According to a report released Thursday, Lance will be suspended from all professional cycling until he completes his two-year doping suspension."

President Obama vowed to nominate a successor 'in due time,' despite political opposition. The 79-year old justice died in his sleep, presumably of natural causes, local media reported on Saturday. Scalia was visiting Texas for a hunting trip, and his body was discovered after he failed to appear for breakfast in the resort where he was staying. US President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama extended \"their deepest condolences to Justice Scalia's family,\" White House deputy spokesman Eric Schultz said. Texas Governor Greg Abbott described the conservative justice as a \"man of God, a patriot and an unwavering defender of the written Constitution and the rule of law.\" \"He was the solid rock who turned away so many attempts to depart from and distort the Constitution. His fierce loyalty to the Constitution set an unmatched example, not just for judges and lawyers, but for all Americans,\" Abbot said. Battle for the empty seat His passing is likely to open a new political front between President Barack Obama and the Republican Party, as Scalia's replacement could shift the composition of the court towards a more liberal persuasion. Several Republican lawmakers have already urged Obama to leave the decision to the next president who will be voted in later this year. \"The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court justice,\" Senate Republican majority leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement, referring to the upcoming November general election. \"Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president,\" McConnell concluded. President Obama, however, said he would fulfill his constitutional duty and nominate Scalia's successor \"in due time.\" \"These are responsibilities I take seriously, and so should everyone. They are bigger than any one party,\" he said. Decades of controversy Scalia joined the Supreme Court in 1986, becoming the first Italian-American to serve in the top judicial body. He was nominated by US President Ronald Reagan. Throughout his long carrier, Scalia voted in favor of privacy and protecting defendants' rights, but also against legalizing abortion, same-sex marriage and gun control. He also drew public attention for his theatrical flair and sharpness of tongue, as well as his alleged unwillingness to compromise. In June last year, the nine-person Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage with a five-to-four vote. Scalia, who was in the minority, commented he would \"hide my head in a bag\" if his own name were associated with the decision. He also said that the majority opinion was \"couched in a style that is as pretentious as its content is egotistic.\" dj/jm (AP, Reuters, AFP, dpa)",

US President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle spoke at a memorial service for the late conservative justice. \"We are deeply saddened by the sudden and unexpected loss of a justice of the highest court in the United States,\" Obama said in a statement. The announcement came after the US Senate voted to confirm Scalia to the high court, a move that was widely seen as a victory for conservatives and liberals alike. Scalia's death came just days after President Obama announced that he would be stepping down from his post at the end of his term as US supreme court justice, replacing Justice Anthony Kennedy with conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch. Obama has said he plans to nominate a new justice to fill the vacancy created by Kennedy's ouster. In his final days in office, Obama will be sworn in as the next US president. His successor, Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, will take the oath of office on Jan. 1. He is expected to announce his successor on January 1, when the Senate will reconvene in Washington, D.C. to consider a possible replacement for Justice Scalia, who died in February at age 80. A spokesman for Obama's campaign said the president was \"deeply saddened\" by news that Scalia had passed away peacefully at his home in Austin, Texas, just a few days before his scheduled retirement date. On Thursday, the White House said Obama would nominate conservative justices to serve on the court until a successor is found to be in place. It is unclear how long the term term for Scalia will last, but it is widely believed that it could be up to two years before he is replaced by a replacement."

I've spent the past few weeks in Mexico, visiting the city where I was born and raised. It was my first trip to the country since my parents moved here from Germany in the early 1980s. My first stop was Mexico. There, I spent a few days in a small town near the border with the Mexican state of Guadalajara. After that, it was on my way back to Berlin, where my family and I were able to spend some time together. We had a great time there, and we were very happy to see each other again. The next day, we went on our way to Mexico again, this time on a different plane. This time we stopped at a train station to take a look at the trains and buses that were on the way from Mexico to our home city. They were full of German tourists, so we decided to stop at one of those train stations and see if we could get a glimpse of what it's like to be a German-Mexican couple. \"It's a beautiful country,\" I said, \"and I think we're going to have a very good time.\" The train ride was a long one, but we managed to get through it all without any problems. In the end, the train came to a stop in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, which is about 40 kilometers (25 miles) north of Berlin. On the other side of town, there were a number of train stops. One of them was in Berlin for the opening of a new school for German students. Another was the Berlin-based school of philosophy, in which the students were taught German and German language. A third was an exchange course with a professor from the university, who had been studying German literature. He was also interested in German history, as he was fascinated by the idea of learning German. And finally, he got a chance to talk to me about the history of Germany and its role in shaping the modern world. What do you think? I don't know.

        "target": "Opinion: The pope's impossible mission in Mexico Pope Francis's trip to Mexico is a dangerous mission - a diplomatic as well as political balancing act, one that brings with it enormous expectations. Francis won't be able to meet them, says DW's Astrid Prange. Dead prisoners, disappearing students, refugees shot dead and murdered priests. Mexico has lived through one violent episode after the other. The mood in the nation is explosive. And now this: just a day before the pope is set to arrive, more than 50 people died in the largest prison revolt in the country's history. What meaning does the pope's presence hold on such an occasion? Only one thing is certain: Francis won't be able to resolve the problems of the world's second largest Catholic nation in just a five-day trip. The unrealistic demands placed on him are not something he can fill. Yet the pope carries with him an important message: you don't have to love your enemies but you do need to speak with them. And he's living the example himself by meeting with the Russian Orthodox Patriarch Kirill on a stopover in Cuba on his way to Mexico. Cuba all over again It's sensational! Bannings and mutual ex-communications are ancient history. Nearly a millennium after the split, the head of the Roman Catholic Church and the head of the Russian Orthodox Church are speaking to each other. It's not as if the two will become friends - their positions are far too different. Yet their centuries-old enmity feels out of place and in view of the massive worldwide persecution of Christians, almost unchristian. And both of these church leaders know this. In Mexico, efforts to stem the polarizing forces at play in society have not been successful. The extreme differences between rich and poor are dividing Mexican society. President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto has prioritized economic growth over dialogue with his critics - a group which includes students as well as teachers and union members who regularly protest against government policies. They demand an end to lawlessness and corruption. The presumed murder of 43 teaching students in Iguala in September 2014, a crime which remains unsolved, stands as a symbol of the lawlessness sweeping Mexico. The recent mutiny in a Monterrey jail serves as further proof of the country's shortcomings in regard to human rights and the rule of law. With a visit to Ciudad Juarez and the largest prison in Mexico, Francis will only make that deficiency more transparent. Even the pope of peace has enemies. The route he's chosen to take on his travels through the country has displeased the staunchly Catholic president. A meeting with the relatives of the Iguala victims is therefore hush-hush and participation in a holy mass remains secret. Considering the tense situation in the country, it's still possible that the pope's route will change once again. The church in the pillory Even within his own church, Francis has met with opposition. A meeting he requested with victims from the church's abuse scandal will not take place - a bitter disappointment for many former seminarians who were abused by Marcial Maciel, the founder of the Legion of Christ, and members of his order. It's just one example of how impunity continues even within the church itself. None of the perpetrators have yet to answer for their crimes in court. It appears as though the pope has accomplished more on the world stage than he has brought on reforms to the Vatican. Despite the revolutionary coming together of Cuba and the US and the revolutionary meeting with Patriarch Kirill, the revolution in Rome has yet to materialize. Do you have something to say? Add your comments below. The thread to this editorial closes in 24 hours.",
        "generated_story": "Pope's impossible mission in Mexico The pope has a difficult task ahead of him in his first visit to Mexico since taking office in January. Pope Francis has been criticized for his lack of faith in the Roman Catholic Church. In a letter to his Mexican counterpart, Cardinal Marcial Maciel, the pope is accused of failing to follow the teachings of the Legion of Christ, a Russian Orthodox Church of Mexico. The letter, which was sent to the Vatican on Sunday, was published by the Catholic news agency dpa. It said that the letter was \"inappropriate\" for the pontiff, who had been visiting Mexico for two weeks. \"The letter is inappropriate because it does not appear to be in compliance with the cardinal's teachings,\" said Prange, referring to Pope Benedict XVI's decision to visit Mexico in early February. But it is not the first time that a papal visit has come under fire. Last year, Pope John Paul II visited Mexico's capital city of Ciudad Juarez, where he met with President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto and other top officials, including the head of state, Juan Manuel Santos, and his wife, Astrid, as well as the mayor of Monterrey, Enrique Pena Nieto, were among those who criticized Francis' visit, saying that it was a \"disaster\" to travel to Latin America's most populous country and that he should not have been allowed to make the trip. On the other hand, he said, \"It is a very difficult trip for me, because I have a lot of work to do,\" adding that \"it is my job to help the people of this country.\" \"I have to work hard to get the message out to them that I am not going to give up on them,\" he added. 'I can't let them down' The Vatican has said it will continue to monitor the papacy, but it has not yet made a decision on whether or not it would be appropriate to send a pope to a country where there are so many people who don't believe in God and who do not want to live in a world where God is the center of their lives.\" In an interview with DW, Francis said he had \"no regrets\" about his visit. He said the visit was an \"important step\" in moving Mexico closer to its goal of becoming the world's third-largest economy, after Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Brazil. However, it did not address the question of whether the new pope would follow through on his promise to build bridges between the Church and the poor. Francis, however, has yet to say whether he will follow up his letter with a trip to Rome. His visit comes just a few days after his predecessor, Felipe Calderon, announced he was stepping down from his post at the end of last year to take a leave of absence in order to focus on the work of his new ministry."

        "target": "Report: Torture is a European problem too A day after Amnesty International published a report on Europe's collusion with the CIA's torture program, the Council of Europe published its own shocking survey of abuse in detention centers across the continent. Prison guards in several European countries carried out reprisals against detainees who talked to the Council of Europe's Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT), the new CPT report has revealed. The council considers this a violation of the spirit of cooperation between the CPT and the Council of Europe's member states. According to the CPT's 24th General Report, released on Wednesday, reprisals were carried out against prisoners in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Greece, Hungary, Moldova, Russia, Spain, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and Ukraine. \"Intimidation or retaliation against persons the CPT has interviewed may not only violate their human rights but also strikes a blow to the preventive mechanism established by the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture,\" CPT President Letif H\u00fcseynov said in a statement. \"I urge national authorities to respect their obligation to prevent, investigate and punish such actions.\" The report also highlighted several problems with the detention of juveniles around Europe, and proposed a series of practical measures to protect young people's rights when detained. Ad hoc visits The little-known CPT, now 25 years old, represents a unique approach to international torture prevention. A team of specialists make roughly 180 visits a year to all kinds of detention centers (including prisons, police stations, holding centers for immigration detainees, psychiatric hospitals, and even social care homes) all across the 47-member Council of Europe - one of the few international blocs that offer platforms for dialogue with Eastern European regimes considered to have poor human rights records, such as Russia, Azerbaijan, and Ukraine. The method combines the carrot of talks with government officials and the stick of ad hoc visits, which all members are committed to allowing into their prisons. Once inside, the CPT also has the right to interview any detainees it chooses - in private, though of course the detainees have the right to refuse. \"The first thing to say is how important the CPT is,\" said Carla Ferstman, director of Redress, a UK-based organization that helps torture survivors. \"As a result of their boot work over a very long period of time, the UN has set up a global system which in many ways mirrors the approach of the CPT.\" But given that the committee has no powers to enforce its proposals to governments, there are question marks over its effectiveness. \"In the report, they complain about how some of the recommendations they've made have not been implemented,\" said Ferstman. \"It's a sign that they're a little bit frustrated.\" But in the long run, she maintains, the CPT has more than proved its value. \"The dialogue that they are able to have is really important,\" she said. \"Looking long-term, they have been very effective.\" CIA collusion, asylum seekers The CPT's report comes a day after Amnesty International released its own report on European collusion with the CIA's torture program. While the CPT's report examines more prosaic day-to-day mistreatment, rather than mass rendition of terrorist suspects at the behest of the US, there are obvious links between the two, since some countries - such as Poland, Macedonia, and the UK - are highlighted in both reports. \"What is finally coming out in all of this is that the Europeans, despite all the criticism of the Bush and Obama administrations on the use of torture - so many of them connived,\" said Judy Dempsey, senior associate at Carnegie Europe. \"It's really a double standard. This report is quite damning and quite shameful, and it follows the Amnesty International one as well.\" The CPT's work also mentions the mistreatment of asylum seekers, a problem increasingly afflicting European countries that take in the largest number of asylum seekers - particularly Spain, Italy, and Greece. \"With Greece there are two things to remember,\" Dempsey told DW. \"A - the appalling situation of the prison system, and B - the lack of training among police of how to deal with asylum seekers. Awful things have happened. Parallel to this is the illegal detention centers. There have been lots of cases of terrible mistreatment over the last several years.\" \"Immigration detention is a growing issue,\" added Ferstman. \"In the UK, there was a whole parliamentary inquiry into one immigration detention center, where some of the women alleged that guards propositioned them in order to get quick treatment on their claims. Each country has its own history of torture.\"",

Every year, the East German city remembers its dead. DW's Naomi Conrad was on hand. As the tram trundled through Dresden's drab suburbs on Friday morning, a prim, elderly woman suddenly turned to her friend sitting on the seat beside her: \"You know, my mother never told me about the bombings.\" She shrugged, then, after a moment's pause, continued. \"It must have been such unspeakable hell that she just couldn't talk about it,\" the woman said. She was referring to February 13, 1945 - the morning, exactly 70 years ago, when Allied bombers swooped down on an unsuspecting city famous for its baroque architecture and that, until that point, had survived the war mostly unscathed. That was to change in the course of three dreadful days: As the bombs rained down on the city, its churches and palaces were turned to rubble. Up to 25,000 people - many of them refugees fleeing the advancing Soviet Red Army - died in the inferno that raged in the city for days. \"There was nothing left, nothing,\" a frail, bent man with a checkered cap recalled, \"just rubble and death.\" He was leaning on the balustrade of a viewing platform in Dresden's old gasometer, staring down at the 360-degree painting by the Iranian-German artist Yadegar Asisi; sirens howled from hidden speakers and strobe lighting illuminated the ruined churches and black smoke billowing from the burnt skeletons that were once buildings. The man swallowed, his voice hoarse, barely audible: \"It's so hard being here.\" The soundtrack and images, he said, \"bring back too many memories.\" 'So, so many dead' He was 15, he recalled, working on a school essay when the sirens began to wail. He never finished the essay. Instead, he ran for shelter with his family. When they returned home three days later, the roof had been blown off, the windows smashed. \"But we were lucky: We survived,\" he said. \"There were so, so many dead.\" His voice broke and, muttering an apology, he shuffled off. The bombings were intended to break the German population's morale - a decision that to many was incomprehensible, given that the war had long been decided and Dresden's economic and strategic importance was relatively minimal. Consequently, the death and destruction wreaked by the Allied bombers quickly became a tool, first for the Nazi propagandists in the last months of the war, then by the East German regime for its anti-West propaganda, and then later by neo-Nazi groups, who traditionally congregate on February 13. Even today, \"the debate continues about guilt and innocence, even about the exact number of victims,\" Dresden Mayor Helma Orosz told a packed audience, including delegations from abroad, gathered for a memorial service in the city's Frauenkirche, which in 2005 was rebuilt with the help of private donations after Germany's reunification, many of them from the United States and Great Britain. Call for peace \"War, hatred and violence begin in people's minds,\" Orosz said. \"We must resist any attempt at once again categorizing people based on their origin and skin color,\" she added, referring to what has often been described as a right-wing catchall movement called PEGIDA, generally translated as Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West, which has taken to the streets in Dresden since October. Later, on a platform overlooking thousands of people, many of them wearing white roses as a sign of peace while bracing the icy cold outside the church, Orosz called on Dresden to remember every victim of the Nazi terror - a plea that was reiterated by German President Joachim Gauck when he took to the microphone: \u201cWe don't want the pain that people suffered here to be misused by others.\u201d Behind him, the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, who, back in the Frauenkirche, had talked of the \u201cmiracle that peace in Europe represents,\u201d leaned in closer to his interpreter. Then, as evening fell over Dresden and church bells tolled, thousands - possibly as many as 10,000, according to the city's press office - lined up along Dresden's riverfront, holding hands to commemorate the dead and call for peace as police men dressed in black riot gear looked on. \"I can remember it all,\" Siegfriede Leonhard, a vivacious woman in her late 70s said. She was 7 when the bombs fell, she said, and had been coming to the commemorations in Dresden \"for at least 60 years.\" Sometimes, she said, stomping her feet to keep warm, she wondered whether she shouldn't remember at home, alone. \"",

The city was hit on February 13, 1945, by a series of Allied bombing raids on the German city. German Chancellor Joachim Gauck visited Dresden in February 1945 and met with the city's mayor, Helma Orosz, and his wife Naomi Conrad. They had just returned from a trip to the Soviet Red Army base in the Czech Republic, where they had been stationed for the duration of their stay in Dresden. After the war, the Germans were forced to flee their homes and flee to neighboring countries. In the months that followed, they returned to Germany, only to find that they were no longer able to return to their home country. \"We were unable to leave Dresden,\" said Yadegar Asisi, a professor of political science at Dresden's Frauenkirche, \"but we managed to get back to Dresden.\" The German capital, Dresden, was devastated by the bombing, which killed more than 1,000 people and wounded over 2,500 more. It was the first time Germany had suffered such an attack on a major city in its history. Nazi propaganda The bombing was carried out by anti-aircraft guns and bombs, but it was not until the fall of 1945 that Germany began to see the effects of its wartime policies on its own citizens. On February 14, 1941, Germany's war crimes tribunal convicted Adolf Hitler of crimes against humanity and sentenced him to life in prison. He was also sentenced to five years of hard labor and a fine fine of up to 10 years' imprisonment. His sentence was suspended for life. During his time in jail, he was released on parole in May 1945. Since then he has lived in exile in Germany and has worked as a freelance journalist for DW. At the time of his release, Hitler was still alive and well and had a reputation for being a tough man to deal with. Now he's back on his feet, fighting for his country's future. DW: What do you think about the bombings? Do you agree with me on this point? I don't think so. I think it's very important to me that we have a very strong sense of justice and justice in our own country and that justice is the highest priority. That's why I have to say that I'm very, very happy to be back in my country.\""

        "target": "Experts: Taliban have not changed strategy with Kabul restaurant attack The weekend attack on a Kabul restaurant frequented by foreigners came as no surprise to international organizations on the ground. Experts don't believe the Taliban have changed their strategy to target more civilians. Dramatic scenes must have played out in the restaurant: Guests sought cover under tables as a group of terrorists shot wildly into the dining rooms. News agencies report the restaurant owner tried in vain to fend off the attackers. He was among the more than 20 people who perished, most of whom were employees at international organizations. The attackers were also among the dead. During the evening dinner rush, at 7:00 p.m. Friday (17.01.2014), one of three Taliban members detonated his explosives-laden vest and blew a breach in the highly secured restaurant. Neither the man-high blast walls, nor the secured access points with armed guards could stop the attackers. The two remaining terrorists were killed later in a firefight with security forces at the scene. No change in Taliban strategy The suicide bombing on the popular Lebanese restaurant, Taverna Du Liban, in the high-end Kabul neighborhood of Wazir Akbar Khan was the worst attack so far in 2014. Afghanistan votes for a new president in April; and the international troops are scheduled to withdraw from the country by the end of the year. Although there are plans for a small contingent to remain in Afghanistan, President Hamid Karzai first has to sign a bilateral security agreement with the United States. But he continues to play for time. In this context, the Taliban may be targeting civilians more in order to drive out not just the military coalition, but the entire international community. Yet \"as horrible as this incident is, I don't see a change in strategy,\" said Thomas Ruttig, the co-director of the Afghan Analysts Network. Similar attacks have also been launched before, \"at least 12 to 15 times in the past eight years,\" Ruttig said. The worst attack was in 2012 at Qargha Lake, a popular weekend destination near Kabul. More than 20 people were killed, all of them Afghans. Extensive security precautions The Taliban, which normally doesn't miss an opportunity for fiery rhetoric, hasn't declared a change in strategy. A spokesman for the Islamist militant group said the attack was retaliation for a NATO airstrike in Parwan Province, a few kilometers north of Kabul. According to an assistant of the Afghan president, seven children and one woman died in the coalition strike. \"You have to carefully monitor the security situation,\" Nils W\u00f6rmer, head of the Konrad Adenauer Institute in Kabul, told DW. \"But I think it's a bit early to talk about a change in [Taliban] strategy.\" W\u00f6rmer's office lies just a few hundred meters from the site of Friday's attack. He could clearly hear the explosion, which shook the window panes in his office. \"It was immediately clear to me that something had happened,\" W\u00f6rmer recounted. But the Konrad Adenauer Institute was prepared. \"We had a relatively concrete warning in the last week related to our neighborhood, and we were very cautious,\" W\u00f6rmer said. He met with colleagues in his secured office. Like most of the international organizations, the Konrad Adenauer Institute is also integrated into the security networks. \"The security precautions are high,\" W\u00f6rmer said. \"But that doesn't exclude the possibility that something similar could happen again.\" But the Afghan security forces have succeeded in preventing many attacks in the past few months, he said. Kabul residents criticize Taliban An informal, impromptu poll by DW's Kabul correspondent, Hussein Sirat, suggested the Taliban are not winning Afghan hearts and minds with such attacks. \"Wherever the Taliban have killed civilians, they have not achieved their goal,\" said Mirwais, a pedestrian in the Kabul city center. Idris, another Kabul resident, seconded Mirwais' sentiment. \"The Taliban intimidate the people so that the security agreement won't be signed,\" he said. \"But the people won't bend to this intimidation.\" How the international organizations adapt to the tense security situation in Kabul will come after many conversations, analyses, and briefings in the following days. But W\u00f6rmer is not thinking about giving up. \"We have a clear agenda and long-term projects, which I considered to be very sensible,\" W\u00f6rmer said. \"I am of the opinion, as I was before, that what I'm doing here with the Konrad Adenauer Institute is worth the risks.\"",
        "generated_story": "Afghan Analysts Network: Taliban haven't changed strategy with Kabul restaurant attack Afghan analysts say the Taliban have not changed their strategy in the wake of the deadly attack on a restaurant in Kabul. The Afghan government has not made any changes in its approach to the attack, which killed at least 30 people and wounded more than 500. Afghan experts say there is no change in Afghanistan's strategy. \"The Taliban are not going to change their approach,\" said Nils W\u00f6rmer, a researcher at the Konrad Adenauer Institute in Parwan Province, in northern Afghanistan. He added that there was \"no change at all\" in Afghan security forces' response to Tuesday's attack. According to Afghan officials, the attacks were carried out by the Afghan Taliban, who control large swathes of Afghan territory, including the province of Qargha Lake, near the border with Pakistan. In a statement released on Tuesday, Afghan President Hamid Karzai said his government had made no changes to its strategy and that it would continue to work closely with the Kabul government. However, he did not rule out the possibility of a return to a more conventional strategy, such as a withdrawal of troops from the country's most heavily-populated provinces. But he also said that he was not ready to give up on the idea of an \"Islamic caliphate.\" \"I don't see any change,\" he said, adding that \"the Taliban will continue their fight against the Islamic State.\" The attack was the latest in a string of attacks on Afghan cities in recent months. Last week, gunmen attacked a hotel in western Kabul with a suicide bomber and a grenade launcher, injuring more people than they had in previous attacks, according to local media reports. Taliban spokesman Wazir Akbar Khan, however, denied that the attackers were planning to attack the hotel, saying that they were merely trying to provoke the government into a \"hard war.\" He said the gunmen were \"trying to create a situation in which they would be able to take advantage of any opportunity they have.\" Afghan media reported that Afghan authorities had opened an investigation into the restaurant's owners and employees, but that no charges had been brought against them. A spokesman for the Kandahar provincial government denied the allegations."

        "target": "Teabag filter cleans water with nanotechnology A new water filter developed in South Africa could provide millions of people with clean drinking water. The filter, about the size and shape of a teabag, would be inexpensive, easy to distribute and simple to use. Marelize Botes is conducting a final set of tests on a new type of diminutive water filter before industrial production can begin. The microbiologist pours water from a plastic bottle though a high-tech, teabag-sized filter before analyzing it in her in her laboratory at the University of Stellenbosch in South Africa. \"The filter is much cheaper than bottled water as well as any other filter on the market,\" she told Deutsche Welle. Instead of being filled with black or green tea, the bag contains active carbon granules and is made from nanofibers treated with biocide, which kills bacteria rather than simply filtering them from the water. Nanotech for pennies \"This project takes nanotechnology to the poorest of the poor people who live in this world, and it will make a difference in their lives,\" said Eugen Cloete, who in addition to inventing the filter is dean of the faculty of science at Stellenbosch University and chair of Stellenbosch University's Water Institute. With some 300 million people in Africa - and over a billion worldwide - living without access to clean drinking water, the need for such a filter is huge. When in mass production, the developers said they expect the teabag to cost just a few South African cents (under half a US cent and under a third of a euro cent). In addition to being inexpensive, Botes said, the filter is also easy to distribute to rural area and simple to use as it can be place in an adapter that fits on nearly any regular-sized plastic bottle. Each filter can clean one liter (one quart) of the most polluted water to the point where it is completely safe to drink. Once used, the filter can be disposed of and is biodegradable. African countries, led by Somalia, Mauritania and Sudan, were ranked to have the most vulnerable water supplies, according to a June report by UK-based risk consultancy firm Maplecroft. Decentralized use The filter's small size and light weight make it ideal for rural areas where other means of filtration do not exist, Cloete said. \"It is simply impossible to build purification infrastructure at every polluted stream,\" Cloete said. \"So we have to take the solution to the people. The water is cleaned right then and there when you drink from the bottle.\" The filter is now undergoing testing by the South African Bureau of Standards, after which Cloete and his team hope it can be rolled out to the United Nations and non-governmental organizations that have expressed interest in it by the end of the year. The project grew out of research into larger filters, according to Cloete. \"We were busy developing filters for larger applications, but when you do the tests in the labatory you do the tests on a much smaller scale,\" he said. \"The results we were getting on a smaller amount of water promoted me to think about a smaller application.\" Author: Joerg Poppendieck, Sean Sinico Editor: Anke Rasper",
        "generated_story": "South Africa launches Teabag-sized water filter for decentralized drinking in Africa The South African Bureau of Standards (BSA) has announced plans to launch a water filtration system for the country's water supply. The project is part of a broader effort to improve water quality in South Africa, which is struggling to cope with rising water prices in the wake of the global financial crisis. BSA's Water Institute, a research institute in Stellenbosch, announced on Thursday that it had launched a new technology for water purification. \"This technology is designed to reduce the amount of water used in drinking water by up to 30 percent,\" said Marelize Botes, the water scientist at Maplecroft in Johannesburg, adding that the technology would help reduce water use in low-income countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe. It will be available to all South Africans by the end of this year, according to a report from the Water institute. According to the report, it would be possible to install the system at a cost of $1.5 million (2.6 million euros) a year. In the past few years, water supplies have fallen by more than 40 percent, with the most recent figures showing a drop of 1.4 percent. But the new system is expected to be ready for use by 2020. A new water treatment plant is being developed in Kenya and Tanzania to provide water for drinking purposes. This is the first of its kind in sub-Saharan Africa and is intended to help meet the growing demand for clean water in developing countries. However, there is still a long way to go before this technology can be deployed in a country where the government is looking at decentralizing water distribution in order to meet a growing need for renewable energy sources. At the same time, new technologies are being introduced in other African countries, including the US, China, India and the European Union, where water is currently being used as a primary source of energy. There is also the possibility of decentralization in some African nations, as well as the creation of decentralized water systems. For example, in Nigeria, for instance, people have to pay a fee to have their water delivered to their homes, and that is not possible in many countries where there are no government-run water utilities. That is why it is important to develop a system that will allow people to use their own water, rather than relying on a private company to supply it to them. So far, however, this has not been implemented in any African country."

It's very easy and the best bit is, it can be reused. Maybe it will come back to you on your birthday. 1. All you need is a piece of fabric big enough to wrap your gift, a ribbon long enough to go right around it, and if you want to make a gift tag, you will also need a piece of old cardboard, a hole punch and another small piece of ribbon. Ready? 2. No, wait, we forgot the present. Get that, and you have everything you need. Spread the fabric on the ground and put your gift on top 3. Fold the fabric around the gift you are wrapping 4. With the last little bit, you don't tuck it under, but create a little flap on top 5. Fold that flap over like this 6. Take one end of the parcel and tuck the fabric inside, BEHIND the gift inside 7. You can take your time to wiggle it all inside. Make it as flat as you can 8. Once it is all inside, turn to the other end and do the same thing again 9. When you have done both ends, it should look like this. Your present is all tucked up inside and you don't need any tape to keep it closed 10. Now for the ribbon. Place the gift on top of it 11. Tie the bow 12. So it looks like this. Finished? If you want a gift tag, that comes now. If you don't you're done! 13. Cut a piece out of an old cardboard box and make a hole in it using a hole punch. Watch your fingers though ;) 14. Put a piece of short ribbon through your hole 15. Tie the tag to your gift 16. And you are finished! P.S. You can either ask your friend to reuse the fabric, and show them how to wrap with it, or if they don't like that idea, you can take it home with you to use again the next time. And remember, you don't have to buy the fabric. You can use an old pillow case, an old t-shirt or skirt, or whatever you want. You can even make your ribbon from an old t-shirt if you don't have any. Happy wrapping.",
        "generated_story": "How to Wrap a Present Without Using Paper or Tape The best way to wrap a present without using paper or tape is to simply wrap it in a plastic wrap. You can do this with a paper towel or a tape measure, but you won't be able to do it with paper. Paper and tape are the most common forms of paper used in wrapping presents, and they're not particularly difficult to use. However, they can also be used with tape. For example, if you're using tape, you can wrap your present in plastic. This method is called \"wrap,\" and it's a great way for people to see how their gifts are going to look. It's also great for those who don't want to spend a lot of money on paper, tape or scissors. If you've never used tape before, this method will work well for you. The only problem is that it doesn't look as good as it looks, so you have to be careful what you use and how you wrap the present. That's why we call it Wrap, because it gives you a good idea of what's going on in your life. We use tape and paper to hold the presents together and wrap them up. Then we use paper as a finishing touch. When we wrap our present, we put the paper on top of the tape so that we can see what we're doing with it. After all, that's what paper is for, right? We're wrapping our presents in paper and then putting them on the table. They're ready to go, just in case you need a little help with the wrapping. \"Wrap\" is the word for wrap, not the letter. Wrapping a gift is a very important part of wrapping your gift, especially when it comes to presents. Wrap your gifts with plastic, which can be easily torn down and used to make wrapping paper easier and more durable. Use tape when wrapping gifts, for example. Tape is also a useful material for wrapping gift wrapping, as well as for making sure that the material stays in the package. Using tape will also help you stay organized and secure the gifts you are wrapping them in. In order to keep them secure, wrap presents securely and securely. A wrap can easily be removed from the packaging and stored away for up to a year, or even longer. Wraping presents is not only easier for the recipient, it also allows the gift recipient to stay in contact with his or her loved ones for a longer period of time. There's no need to worry about how long it will take to unwrap presents that have been wrapped. Simply put, a wrap is just as easy as wrapping a package and you'll have a nice, clean, tidy package wrapped around your finger. Just wrap up your presents and put them away. Don't forget to take a picture of your wrapping tape with you when you go to the store. Have a look at the pictures below."

        "target": "European court overturns law requiring German-language skills for spouse visas The European Court of Justice has overturned a German law requiring foreign spouses from certain non-EU countries to take a language test before receiving a visa. The ruling primarily affects Germany's Turkish minority. The European Union's highest court on Thursday ruled in favor of a Turkish citizen, who was denied a visa to live in Germany with her husband, because she was illiterate and therefore unable to demonstrate basic German-language skills. According to the court, a lack of language skills shouldn't automatically lead to the rejection of an entry visa application. Instead, Germany must consider the unique circumstances of each individual case. The court went on to say that quickly granting visas for spouses improves the quality of life and promotes the integration of foreign residents. Specifically addressing the case of the Turkish plaintiff, the court ruled that the rejection of her visa had violated a bilateral treaty between Turkey and the EU. In 1970, Brussels and Ankara agreed not to tighten their residency laws for each other's citizens. Law only applies to some In 2007, Germany introduced the requirement that spouses from certain non-EU countries must demonstrate a basic grasp of German before being granted a visa to live in Germany with their husbands or wives. Spouses affected by the law are required to obtain a basic language certificate from recognized centers, such as Germany's Goethe Institute, proving that they have an A1 level, or \"Beginning German\" language ability. The German government claims that the goal of the language requirement is to prevent forced marriages as well as marriages made simply for the sake of obtaining a visa. Citizens of European Free Trade Association (EFTA) member states are exempt from the language requirement. That includes Iceland, Lichtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. In addition, citizens of Australia, Canada, Israel, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea and the United States also don't have to demonstrate German-language skills. slk/xx (AFP, AP, dpa, KNA)",

The law, which was passed by the European Union's lower house of parliament in Strasbourg on Thursday, was blocked by a lower court in Brussels. A German court ruled that the law violated the rights of spouses and children of Turkish citizens living in the EU. \"The law does not apply to Turkish marriages,\" the court said in a statement, adding that it did not violate the right of the spouses of EU citizens to marry in their home countries. However, the ruling was not the first time that a German-born Turkish married couple had to undergo a marriage certificate in order to be eligible for marriage licenses. It was the second time in less than a year that an EU member state, Germany, had been able to pass marriage certificates in its home country. In the past, marriages between Turkish and German citizens have been allowed to take place in other European countries, but the new law would not have allowed marriages to legally be legally recognized as marriages. According to the Goethe Institute in Berlin, this was in response to a request from the Turkish government to allow marriages with children to continue. But the German government rejected the request, saying it was \"incompatible with the principles of marriage and family law.\" The court also rejected an appeal by Turkish-German spouses, who argued that their marriages were incompatible with Turkish values and that they should not be subject to marriage license revocation. Germany's highest court, however, said it would continue to consider the case. German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel said the decision was based on \"a lack of evidence\" and not on a \"clear and convincing argument.\" \"It is not a question of whether or not there is evidence to support this claim,\" Gabriel told a news conference. He added that \"there is no evidence that this argument is supported by evidence from other countries.\" German Chancellor Angela Merkel has called on the government of Turkey to clarify its stance on marriage equality. She has also called for an end to visa-free marriage for married Turkish couples who have children under the age of 18 and are unable to leave their spouses' country of birth, according to German news agency dpa."

Bayern Munich cruised to a 3-0 victory at home against Bavarian rival FC Nuremberg on Sunday, closing the German soccer tables for the weekend. Striker Mario Gomez got things going in the 10th minute for Bayern and also scored the final goal in the 75th minute off a corner kick from Franck Ribery. Ribery came on as a substitute five minutes earlier, making his first appearance for the team since injuring his ankle in September. Near the end of the match, Gomez had an opportunity for his third goal on a penalty kicked but missed. Thirty points at break Phillipp Lahm successfully converted a penalty kick in the 57th minute to round out the scoring for Bayern. The victory for Bayern moved them into sixth place in the table with 19 points and has continued a slow shift in momentum following a rough start to the season. Bayern coach Louis van Gaal said after the game he hoped his team would have 30 points by the end of the first half of the season in five more matches.

It was Bayern's third win in as many games this season, with the win coming at the hands of FC Nuremberg, who have been without a top-flight player for the past two seasons. Bayern have won three of their last four league games, including the last three. On Sunday, they had to settle for a draw at home to Freiburg, which they lost to FC Augsburg in their first Bundesliga match since the end of last season. In the second half, however, Bayern were unable to find a way past the visitors, and the result was a disappointing result for their coach, Franck Ribery. \"It was disappointing for us,\" he said after the game, adding that he was \"very happy\" with his team-mates' performance. He added: \"I'm very happy for them. We had a lot of work to do and I'm really happy that we were able to get the three points we needed.\" The win was the club's fifth in a row and it was also their third in three games in all competitions. Facing a relegation battle, the German side managed to hold off the relegation threat from last year's Champions League, where they were knocked out by the likes of Manchester United, Manchester City and Real Madrid. But it wasn't enough to keep Bayern from falling to the brink of relegation. They needed a win to stay alive and that's exactly what they did. With the help of a goal from Mario Gomez and a couple of excellent crosses from the right, it looked as if they would have a shot on target. That's when the pressure began to mount on Bayern, but they didn't. After a few minutes, a free kick from midfielder Papy Djilobodji gave the hosts the lead with a powerful drive that put them in front for good. J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann's men were on course to win the Bundesliga title, although they could have done without the Senegal forward. Kicking off his third league game in four weeks, Kostas Manolas scored his first goal for his new club. His goal came on the stroke of half-time and he put the ball into the net to give Bayern a 2-1 lead."

The six that have been freed attended a news conference held by Prime Minister Fico in the capital, Bratislava on Sunday. Fico told reporters that the government was working to secure the release of the remaining two paragliders who are stiil in custody. \"Negotiations were fair and their result is the release of six out of eight detainees,\" Fico was quoted as saying on the government's website. He added that Slovakia had not made any \"financial commitments\" in the negotiation process.

They denied espionage - neighbouring Oman helped secure their release in 2011 by posting bail of 1-million US dollars (756,000 euros).

The six were released after a two-day manhunt in the eastern Iranian city of Isfahan. They were taken to a detention center in Bratislava, where they will be held for up to three months. Slovaker paragulider Josh Fattal was released from prison on Tuesday after being arrested on charges of espionage. Fathal, one of the six men, was taken into custody in a separate case in which he was accused of providing material support to the U.S. intelligence agency, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and was later charged with espionage and money laundering. He had been detained in an Iranian prison for more than a year and a half. His lawyer, Shane Bauer, said the charges against him were politically motivated, and that he would not be able to appeal the verdict. \"We are not going to stand by and let this happen,\" Bauer said, adding that his client, Robert Fico, \"would not stand for this.\" The two men are believed to be from Slovakia, which has a population of around 1.5 million, according to Slovakia's state-run news agency TASS. Slovakia is the only EU country that does not have a visa to travel to Iran. It is not the first time Slovakia has had to deal with the issue of visa-free travel. In the past, it has been the case for other EU countries, such as Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Japan, China, South Korea, Taiwan, Turkey and even the US. On Tuesday, Slovakia announced that it had released the men and women of a group that had traveled to Tehran to meet with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani. Iranian officials have said that they have no reason to believe that Iran is planning to extradite the three men to face charges related to their alleged involvement in spying. Iran's Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday that the arrests were \"inappropriate\" and \"unacceptable.\" Iranian media reported that Iranian state media had published a report on the arrest, saying that Tehran was trying to influence the outcome of an upcoming referendum on whether or not to impose sanctions against the country's nuclear program. A spokesman for Tehran's foreign ministry, Vladislav Frigo, told the Associated Press: \"The Iranian government has not made any official announcement regarding the release of these individuals, but we have not ruled out the possibility of their release.\" Fearing for his own safety, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said his country was \"very concerned about the safety of its citizens and the security of our citizens.\""

Just over two weeks ahead of the first round of voting in France's presidential election, all 11 candidates met for the second televised debate of the campaign. It was the first time in the history of French elections that the entire official ballot shared a television stage. This race for the Elysee is perhaps the most closely watched election in the history of the Fifth Republic in view of conservative candidate Francois Fillon's embezzlement charges, the deterioration of the left, political amateur Emmanuel Macron's surprise surge to the top, and the rise of Marine Le Pen's National Front. With so much media attention on the five main candidates, Tuesday's debate felt almost like a consolation for the six other candidates rarely in the spotlight. For French voters watching the televised debate at Cafe des Phares on Place de la Bastille, the saturated stage kept the candidates from detailed discussion of pressing issues. For those who are still undecided, the debate did little to bring them closer to choosing their pick for president. Vincent Couronne, a researcher, said it was good to see candidates who don't get as much media attention. However, 11 candidates at once for the political spectator was overkill. \"It wasn't very interesting. It's just one position after another. There's no real debate. It's not like when it was just five candidates.\" Boredom all round Charlotte Theuvenin and her friends, all students in their early 20s, tuned out early on from boredom and exasperation. \"It was too flat and too hypocritical. Fillon and Le Pen play with our money, then say they did nothing and that they are good for our country,\" she said. As though addressing the candidates in front of her on the TV screen, she added, \"How dare you talk about being president when you use our money for your own interests.\" Le Pen had come under fire over accusations that she misused public funds to pay bodyguards as parliamentary assistants. Francois Fillon of Les Republicains, meanwhile, is under investigation for allegedly paying family members more than 1 million euros ($1.1 million) for government work they never carried out. Frequently casting a blank stare at his opponents, Fillon also seemed bored, or at least more subdued compared to the first debate. Couronne said, \"Fillon seems to be not there. Probably because he knows all the small candidates can attack him on the criminal offenses he's accused of.\" Debate watchers cited Europe as the most important issue of this election, with many fearing Le Pen's promise to tear France out of the European Union in a so-called Frexit. Though no one at the cafe vocally supported Le Pen's plan, several acknowledged the EU is a pressure point for France. \"France's place in Europe in relation to Germany is a very important issue,\" said student Thibault Cirier. \"The general problem is France has lost its influence at the European level over the years, and that needs to be remedied, because France is one of the founders of Europe and should have a strong place in the union. The EU is also important for cohesion and to have a strong position internationally.\" Caf\u00e9 viewers say no to Le Pen Cirier was initially excited by Macron when he launched his campaign, but ultimately decided there was no substance. Now he says he will probably vote for far-left candidate Jean-Luc Melenchon. Kevser Taspinar also said she liked Melenchon for his fighting spirit and that \"he throws barbs.\" As a practicing Muslim who wears a headscarf, she said the most important issue for her is laicite, France's state institution of secularism. \"For me Hamon has the best interpretation of this. Maybe Hamon,\" Taspinar said hesitating. \"I'm still undecided, because there's Melenchon.\" Another viewer, Marie Dubois, said that although she really liked Melenchon, she had definitively decided on Macron. \"Melenchon has a way of putting humanity in politics and giving hope,\" she said. \"But Macron is the only possible candidate.\" With polls putting Le Pen and Macron in the second round on May 7, the undecided voters at this Paris cafe said they were certain which candidate they would not for vote for in that scenario. \"Definitely Macron. There is no way I am going to vote for Le Pen,\" Theuvenin said. \"I will never vote for that woman or Front National, no matter who is running against them in the second round.\" Tuesday was the final debate for Macron and Melenchon, two of the crowd-pleasers among the candidates. Both have pulled out of the third debate on grounds that it cuts too close to the first vote just two days later on April 23.",
        "generated_story": "French National Front candidate Jake Cigainero: 'No, No' French presidential candidate Francois Fillon has been accused of sexual harassment and assault. He has denied the allegations. \"I'm not a sexual harasser,\" he told DW in an interview published on Thursday. French President Emmanuel Macron has also accused the French far-right candidate, Marine Le Pen, of \"sexual harassment.\" \"He's a man of few words,\" Macron said in a video posted on his official Twitter account. The French president has repeatedly denied allegations that he has sexually harassed or assaulted women, and has called for an end to the sexual abuse allegations against him. Macron, who is running for president in November's presidential election, has said he will not tolerate any sexual contact between women and men. On Thursday, the president of France's largest newspaper, Les Republicains, published an article in which he accused Macron of sexually assaulting his wife, Marie Dubois, during a campaign stop in the Elysee neighborhood of Paris. In the same article, he also said that the former French prime minister, Jean-Luc Melenchon, should not be allowed to campaign with women in his party, because he would not stand for a second term in office if he were to win the presidency. And he's not the only candidate who has come under fire over the past few weeks. Last week, French media reported that Macron had threatened to ban women from entering the country if they did not give him the support he craved. A week later, Macron's conservative party announced that it would no longer allow women to enter the EU without their consent. It's unclear how long Macron will be able to stay in France, but it's possible he could be forced to step down from his position as leader of the party. France has a long way to go before a new president is even ready to take office. But the current president, Francois Hollande, will have to wait until the end of his term before he can make a decision on whether or not he wants to run for re-election next year. That would be the first time that a candidate from the center-left, which is currently in third place in polls, would face a possible presidential run-off. If he wins the election in May, it will almost certainly be his first term as president. However, there are doubts about whether he'll stick to his campaign promises of a \"zero tolerance\" approach to sexual assault and harassment of women. There's also the question of whether Macron is willing to stand up for women's rights, such as the right to choose between a woman with a disability and one without a criminal record. What do you think about that? The answer is clear: \"No. I don't believe in it at all.\" And that's why I'm writing this article. DW's Charlotte Theuvenin and Vincent Couronne are on the show.

And the news was good -- most of the numbers were down compared to the preceding year. Germany's streets were never particularly dangerous, but according to the Interior Ministry, they are now safer than at any time since statistics have been collected. Reported criminal offenses on the whole dropped by 1.4 percent over 2005 -- to a total of just over 6.3 million. \"The statistics show reductions in crime among children, adolescents and teenagers, as well as adults,\" said Sch\u00e4uble. He added that criminality among foreigners living in Germany also fell, saying that this development reflected Germany's efforts to integrate non-Germans. Drugs offenses were down 7.8 percent, followed by theft and street crime, which both declined by four percent or more. Youth violence Vandalism, on the other hand, was up 5.9 percent. Fraud rose slightly, as did violent crime -- among young people by an alarming 4.5 percent. Berlin Interior Minister Erhart K\u00f6rting said that was part of a decade-long trend in Germany. \"As many experts have pointed out,\" K\u00f6rting said, \"the potential for violence in society is increasing.\" The head of the German Police Officers' Union Konrad Freiberg also said those figures showed that German society was not truly getting safer. Frankfurt tops most-dangerous list Crime was down in Frankfurt am Main, but it's still the German city with the greatest number of criminal offenses person 100,000 people. Hanover was a close second, followed by D\u00fcsseldorf, Bremen and Berlin. The total percentage of criminal cases solved by German police also improved slightly from 55 to 55.4 percent. According to the study, Germany's safest place was Bergisch Gladbach, a city of 100,000 inhabitants in the west of the country -- coincidentally, model Heidi Klum's home town.",

The number of murders and murders has soared in recent years, according to the country's interior minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble. In a speech delivered in Frankfurt am Main on Thursday, the head of the German Interior Ministry said that crime was \"increasingly rampant\" and that there was a \"new level of criminality\" in German society. \"We have seen a rise in crime in the last few years,\" he said, adding that it was time for the government to step up its efforts to tackle the problem of mass murder and other forms of violent crime. He also pointed out that, in addition to mass murders, there were also cases of rape and sexual abuse of minors in which minors were found to have committed crimes, including rape, sexual assault and murder. This is not the first time that Germany has been accused of a crime, but it has not been the only time. There have also been cases where minors have been found guilty of sexual offenses, such as rape or murder, and there have even been accusations that the perpetrators of these crimes had committed sexual acts with minors. These allegations are part of an ongoing investigation into possible links between the police and minors, which has led to an increase in homicides and the spread of child pornography among young people. Police, prosecutors and prosecutors are also looking into the possibility that minors may be involved in such crimes. Last week, German Chancellor Angela Merkel announced that she would step down from her post as Chancellor of Germany in February, following a series of scandals involving the handling of classified information. She also announced plans to introduce a new anti-money laundering law that would make it easier for criminals to buy and sell fake bank accounts, as well as the creation of fake credit cards and credit card companies, among other things. Germany's crime rate has risen sharply since the beginning of this year, with a total of 1.6 percent of all crimes committed in 2016, up from 0.4 percent in 2015. But the rate of increase is expected to remain at a record high in 2017. According to a report by the Federal Statistics Office (FSD) in September, more than 2,000 people have died of drug-related crimes since 2015, compared to 1,500 in 2014. A new law is also in place to prevent the sale and circulation of counterfeit banknotes and counterfeit currency. However, it is unclear whether this law will be extended to other countries, or whether it will only be applied to countries with high crime rates."

        "target": "All or nothing for Bayern in Champions final Bayern Munich have one last chance to salvage a season that has otherwise been marked by their inability to beat Borussia Dortmund: a win against Chelsea in the Champions League final at their home stadium. All season long, Bayern Munich have been consumed with achieving one goal: reaching the final of the Champions League, held at their own Allianz Arena in Munich, and raising the trophy in front of their home fans. After finishing a distant second place to Dortmund in the Bundesliga and dismally losing to them 5-2 in the German Cup final, Bayern Munich are in a must-win situation Saturday against Chelsea. A loss would be the final straw in a disappointing season for a team that can't stand second place. A win for Bayern would mean redemption, to some extent, for their shortcomings in the league. Key players were rested down the stretch in the Bundesliga, especially before the two legs of Bayern's European semifinal against Real Madrid. That was an indication that Bayern had given up on the league and put all their eggs in one basket, hoping for a big payoff with the Champions League title. The same can be said for the German Cup final against Dortmund: true, Bayern essentially beat themselves by making mistake after mistake, but Bayern could, if they win Saturday, wipe the slate clean. Saving the season Win this match, and all will be forgiven in Munich. Lose, and it will be Bayern's second straight season without a piece of hardware, not to mention the heartbreak of losing the biggest match at Allianz Arena since it opened in 2005. \"We must not even think about [losing],\" said Bayern's Franck Ribery on Thursday. \"If we win the Champions League, then we can forget about not winning the league or the cup, nobody will care about that.\" Bayern are a team that thrives under pressure, and the high stakes of this match will be good for them. Chelsea are a team that showed in their semifinal upset of Barcelona that they can rise to a challenge, even if that challenge is simply holding on against a superior opponent. \"We are not the favorites of the game, we are playing away,\" Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech said on Thursday. \"It is very rare when you have the home team playing in the home stadium, using the home dressing room, so I think the advantage goes to Bayern Munich because of that. But we know we have a chance and we will fight for it.\" But this match will come down to the team that can better take advantage of holes that have been blown in each team's defense due to injuries and suspensions. Filling the gaps Between the two sides, seven starting players will miss out on the final. Chelsea saw Raul Meireles, Ramires, and Branislav Ivanovic each get their third yellow card in the second leg against Barcelona, and captain John Terry was given a straight red. Terry and Ivanovic are fixtures on Chelsea's backline, which was already at half-strength due to hamstring injuries suffered by Gary Cahill and David Luiz. Chelsea coach Roberto di Matteo hopes those two are fit enough for the final, since Chelsea will need all the help they can get in the back. For Bayern, David Alaba and Holger Badstuber - both defenders - and Luiz Gustavo, a defensive midfielder, are also suspended for picking up three yellow cards. The impact of the suspensions will hit Chelsea the most. In addition to a weakened back line, Meireles and Ramires are mainstays on offense, supporting strikers Didier Drogba or Fernando Torres. With Ramires out, Drogba could start as striker, with Torres moving to the wing. At any rate, there is more uncertainty in The Blues' lineup than there is in Bayern's, who will be able to rely on striker Mario Gomez and the dynamic-duo of Arjen Robben and Ribery on the wings as they have all season. Most of the question marks will still be defensive for both teams, but to think that this is an indication of a high-scoring affair on Saturday would be a discredit to both team's last lines of defense. Between the posts Neither side would be competing in the final if it wasn't for the heroics of the teams' keepers. Cech defended against wave after wave of attacks from Barcelona in the semifinal for Chelsea, and Manuel Neuer showed nerves of steel in Bayern's penalty shootout in the final leg against Real Madrid, blocking penalties from Madrid stars Cristiano Ronaldo and Kaka. Chelsea's best shot will be to come out of the gate at a sprint and gain an early advantage against Bayern, who will be doing everything they can to keep their long-cultivated dream-final in their control. Otherwise, Bayern's determination to salvage their season may be enough to carry them through to the trophy ceremony - at home, just like they planned it.

The former Manchester United and Real Madrid striker was the man to beat in Sunday's final. But it wasn't enough for Bayern Munich to win the Bundesliga title on Sunday. They had to settle for a 1-1 draw at the Allianz Arena in Munich, where they lost 3-2 to Barcelona on aggregate. That was Bayern's first ever defeat in a major European competition. It was also the first time in club history that they had lost to a German side. And it was their first defeat since 2006-07, when they were knocked out by Barcelona. \"It was a very disappointing result for us,\" said Raul Meireles, a former Bayern player who now works as an assistant coach for the club's youth team. 'We're going to have to work very hard to get the result we want' The Blues, meanwhile, are hoping to avoid a repeat of last season's disappointment, which saw them relegated to the second division. Manchester City, who have been relegated in recent years, were the clear favorites to make it back into the top four, but they failed to do so in their quest to reach the semi-finals. In the end, the Blues were able to pull off the upset, beating Barcelona 2-0 in extra time. However, they could not have done it without the help of their star striker, Andre Schuerrle, and coach Carlo Ancelotti, whose side were eliminated from the competition by Real in last year's quarter-final, was unable to cope with the pressure of a Bayern side that had dominated the league for so long. Real, in particular, had a difficult time finding a way past Bayern, as they struggled to keep up with their top-flight rivals. At the same time, Bayern had the advantage of having a strong squad in front of them, with a number of key players on the pitch, including the likes of Andrej Kramaric, Mario Mandzukic and Mario Balotelli, among others. Bayern also have a lot to prove in this final, having already beaten Real and Barcelona to qualify for next year\u2019s European Cup final in Germany. With a win over Barcelona and a draw against Real this weekend, it will be up to Bayern to decide whether or not they want to go on to play Real or Barcelona in next week's semifinals."

He allegedly possessed and exchanged \"a large quantity\" of child pornography. A high-ranking Vatican diplomat will face trial in the Holy See on charges of possessing child pornography in the US and Canada. Catholic priest Carlo Alberto Capella was indicted on Saturday after a Vatican investigation found he had allegedly possessed and exchanged \"a large quantity\" of child pornography during his diplomatic posting. His trial will start on June 22 in front of a Vatican magistrate. If convicted, he could be sentenced to between one and five years in prison and fined between \u20ac2,500 and \u20ac50,000 ($2,100 to $42,000). He is being held in the city's police barracks.

The church rejected the request and withdrew him in September to face investigation at home. Shortly afterwards, Canadian authorities issued an arrest warrant for allegedly possessing and distributing child pornography while visiting a church in Canada. The Capella case has hampered the Catholic Church's attempts to move on from its myriad of pedophile priest scandals. There has been particular focus in recent months on the Chilean branch of the Catholic Church ignoring and covering up of child abuse by pedophile priest Fernando Karadima during the 1980s and 1990s. Pope Francis wrote a letter to Chileans last week expressing \"shame\" for the affair despite previously defending one of the main alleged offenders behind the cover-up.

The charges stem from a complaint made to the Vatican last year by Archbishop Fernando Karadima, who is accused of sexually abusing minors in the 1970s and 1980s. In a letter to Cardinal George Pell, the archbishop of Buenos Aires said the charges were \"inappropriate\" and \"unacceptable.\" The letter, which was sent to Catholic bishops in Argentina, Chile, Canada and the United States, was received by Cardinal Pell on Monday. It was the first time that a cardinal had been charged with sexual abuse of minors by a member of the Roman Catholic Church. \"This is a serious and serious offense,\" said Francis, adding that it was \"a serious violation of cardinal cardinal discipline.\" \"It is an offense that the cardinal should be punished,\" Francis added. Francis also said he would seek an \"immediate and full pardon\" for the priest's conduct in connection with the case. He also called on the pope to provide a \"clear and unequivocal statement\" on whether or not he intended to prosecute the accused priest. Pope Francis has called for an end to accusations of child abuse and sexual misconduct by priests and bishops, as well as the expulsion of bishops and lay ministers from the Church for failing to comply with a papal order to stop the abuse. Vatican spokesman George Papadopoulos said in an interview on Sunday that \"the Vatican will continue to investigate allegations of abuse, including the sexual exploitation of children under the age of 12.\" Capellis, a former priest in Chile for more than 30 years, has denied any wrongdoing. Last year, he was stripped of his priestly post by Pope Benedict XVI, and was placed under house arrest for life without parole. On Sunday, Francis said that his decision was based on \"concerns\" about the church's handling of allegations against him and his co-accused, Cardinal Angelo DiNardo, over allegations he had sex with underage girls in his parish. Di Nardo said his church had \"zero tolerance\" toward child sex abuse in its churches, but he did not rule out the possibility of a return to church if the allegations were proven to be true."

Moscow-based news agency RIA quoted Siluanov as saying that the emergency fund would be set up next year with money originally earmarked for the State Pension Fund and leftover funds from this year's budget. According to RIA, Moscow was planning to devote \"at least 100 billion roubles\" (2 billion euros) to the fund, which will mainly be aimed at helping cash-starved Russian banks and key oil companies. \"These 100 billion roubles will be added to the reserve next year, which will allow us to help companies,\" RIA quoted Siluanov as saying. \"We are planning to create a reserve of significant size.\" Just last week, the European Union and the United States imposed a third round of sanctions on Moscow for Russia's involvement in the Ukraine conflict. The latest sanctions target the Russian banking sector as well as key energy firms and arms manufacturers. As one of several companies that have asked for government help, Russia's oil giant Rosneft said it would need 1.5 trillion roubles ($39.70 billion) in aid to keep exploring for oil. Siluanov also told RIA news agency that the decision to stop transferring money to the Pension Fund would hand the budget an extra 309 billion roubles.

Russian state oil giant Rosneft (RIA) said it would set aside $1 billion ($1.6 billion) for the fund, which is meant to be used to pay off debts incurred by Russian companies in the wake of the conflict in eastern Ukraine. \"The fund will be established in accordance with the Russian constitution,\" the state-run RIA news agency reported, citing a source close to Siluanov, who said the plan was \"in the best interests of Russia and its citizens.\" The fund is expected to have a total of 1.5 billion roubles ($2.4 billion), according to a statement from the SPSF, a state investment fund that manages state assets in Russia. In addition, it will also be able to invest in companies that have suffered from sanctions, such as Russia\u2019s largest oil refiner Gazprom, in order to reduce their exposure to the crisis. Russia is also set to introduce a tax on the sale of shares in oil and gas companies worth up to 30 billion rubles ($4.7 billion).

        "target": "Heidi hits the Big Screen Heidi, the world famous girl from the Swiss Alps who first appeared in a novel 121 years ago, has hit the big screen in a fresh look. A century after the death of Heidi inventor Johanna Spyri, the lovable Alpine heroine is being portrayed in a new film which replaces grassy slopes and mountainous range with city skyscrapers and city streets. The $ 3.5 million \"Heidi\", funded by the Z\u00fcrich-based film company Vega and directed by German film maker Markus Imboden, is to be launched in Germany on Thursday. The making of the film was one of the highlights of a past year of events including exhibitions, lectures and fireworks celebrating the July 7 2001 centenary of the death of Spyri, whose novel \"Heidi\" sold 20 million copies and has been translated in 50 languages worldwide. It is thought to be one of the most successful books of all times. The book has inspired 17 films, including Shirley Temple\u2019s Oscar winning portrayal of Heidi in 1937 and a Japanese cartoon series. Imboden\u2019s remake is the 18th \"Heidi\" film. Blue hair in Berlin According to Vega, \"the film was transmitted to today\u2019s world without losing sight of the original novel\". But Imboden\u2019s new movie is far from the charming original, with its rosy-cheeked, curly-headed Heidi, delicate Clara and goat-tending shepherd Peter\u2019s frail old grandmother. In the first film, Heidi, who lives happily with her grandfather in a tiny hut in the Swiss Alps is plucked from her contented life by her Aunt Dete to live in a stiff, rich family in the bustling metropolis, Frankfurt. Heidi becomes so home-sick, she starts to sleepwalk and is eventually sent home. But not before she causes confusion in the otherwise prim household and brings laughter in the life of the disabled and homely, Clara. The Heidi in the latest film has blue hair, surfs the net and roams the streets of Berlin. Friend and shepherd Peter sheds his rustic pastimes and whizzes down streets on his mountainbike. Clara is not the weak, lame young girl of the Spyri novel, but a moody Britney Spears wannabe. Aunt Dete is a modern-day stylist living fashionably in the German capital. The new surroundings are a far cry from the tranquil days of cow milking, goat- tending and flower-plucking in the verdant meadows of the Swiss Alps. Transforming the Heidi myth According to a Berlin daily, the remake is a \"refreshing Heidi\", adding that the script writers had managed to transform the Heidi \"myth\" into an independent, self-assured girl and not into a \"transfigured mountain heroine\". However, it is just this portrait of a naive and charming alpine heroine that has made Heidi so popular all over the world. Heidi has become a well-known Swiss brand worldwide. Some 60,000 tourists \u2013 half from Japan \u2013 are said to visit the picturesque wine-growing village in Graubuenden, which boasts the original Heidi House and other Heidi related attractions such as winding mountain trails and pastures. Imboden\u2019s film, which is to be launched in Germany on Thursday, will also open elsewhere in Europe, and may reach fans in Japan and South Korea too.

The media was quick to report them as \"honor killings.\" We have to rethink that term, writes Gouri Sharma. When news broke that Samia Shahid, a British-Pakistani woman, had been found dead while visiting relatives in Pakistan at the end of July, mainstream media outlets were quick to report it as an honor killing. It was the second time in two weeks that the media had reported a killing of a woman this way - the first being the murder of Pakistani social media star Qandeel Baloch. There are strong similarities between the cases. Both were murdered in places where they would have felt they were at their safest - in their family homes. It's likely they knew their killers - in Baloch's case, her brother has admitted to strangling her, and Shahid's father and cousin have already been questioned. And as more reports emerge about Shahid's death, it's clear that both were killed because they didn't behave in a way deemed acceptable in a conservative, patriarchal society. 'Deeply offensive' term The debate around terminology in \"honor killings\" isn't new, and after Baloch's murder there were members of the media - such as ABC Australia journalist Juanita Phillips - who decided against using the term, calling it \"deeply offensive\" and referring to it as a \"family killing\" instead. And there are outlets, like the Guardian, that already use inverted commas with the word honor. But some commentators argue that more needs to happen if media consumers are to gain a better understanding of the problem. \"I think an important step for the media would be to refuse to give weight to the term 'honor crimes,'\" said UK-based freelance journalist Shehnaz Khan. \"While it is imperative to highlight that these crimes and murders stem from the roots of misogyny and therefore a false sense of 'honor,' there is absolutely nothing but'shame' within them, as murder is nothing but dishonorable.\" \"The word 'honor' can sometimes carry an almost positive connotation that we are inclined to automatically accept just because it's not happening to us, when the reality is, this a huge problem affecting thousands of girls and women across the world,\" she added. Naming the issue But this isn't a view shared by all journalists. Ruby Hamad, a writer at Australia's Daily Life newspaper, said that the first step in dealing with the issue is naming it. \"There are some deeply patriarchal societies that still limit women's freedom according to old tribal concepts of honor, where, unfairly, the behavior of women reflect on their entire family,\" Hamad said. \"By naming these 'honor killings,' we are acknowledging the role that this misogynistic concept of honor plays, not only in the murders themselves but in these entire societies, and how it entraps both men and women.\" Through the eyes of the perpetrator? There are other issues with the term though. Some have argued that by framing it as such, media outlets are showing the crime through the eyes of the perpetrator - and not through the victim - as they should. And with such cases regularly hitting the headlines, framing is important. The United Nations estimates that around 5,000 women - predominantly from Asia and the Middle East - are killed annually in honor-related crimes, a figure that women's advocacy groups say is closer to 20,000 worldwide. This raises an important cultural element for the media to consider - how far does the term play into cultural stereotypes? \"When honor is considered the most important thing in life, then all family members become expendable,\" Hamad said. \"The collective outweighs the rights of the individual. Does this feed into cultural stereotypes? Perhaps. But that doesn't mean we should pretend that this cultural context isn't there.\" Looking for answers - and alternatives There have been many alternatives put forward by women's advocacy groups, including hate crime, misogynistic murder, femicide and shame killings. But which one should we pick? Al Jazeera for one has decided which one they won't use. \"We are always updating our style guidelines to convey a deeper and more authentic understanding of world affairs. Recent events in Pakistan ignited a healthy debate in Al Jazeera on the term 'honor killings' in particular. Our editors are currently studying alternatives to the term, but'misogynistic murder' is not one of them,\" said an Al Jazeera spokesperson. Terminology in the media matters, and for murders as complex as these, it's the media's responsibility to find a name that better fits the crime. Only then will it become easier to work towards a solution.",

        "target": "Myanmar Junta Announces Amnesty The junta in Myanmar, also known as Burma, announced an amnesty for more than 7,000 prisoners on Friday, including a few political detainees. The amnesty came on the 21st anniversary of the brutal crackdown of a student-led pro-democracy movement in 1988 and the subsequent seizure of power by the current junta. Journalists were invited to Yangon\u2019s notorious Insein prison on Friday as the authorities released the first batch of prisoners. At least 600 inmates were freed as part of an amnesty for over 7,000 inmates nationwide. Among those released in Yangon were two journalists and 25 political prisoners -- rights groups say this is only 1 percent of the total number of political prisoners held by the military regime. Maung Zarni, a research fellow at the London School of Economics, was \u201chappy for the prisoners who were part of the release\u201d. \u201cThis is a very positive personal development and I am happy they have been released but we need to understand that the junta is using the prisoners\u2019 release as a public relations exercise. It is the 21st anniversary of the military coup so they are using this as a way to pacify political discontent in the country.\u201d Amnesty comes ahead of next year\u2019s polls Myanmar's director general of prisons, Zaw Win, said that the prisoners had been freed so they could take part in next year's polls. In recent months, rights activists, pro-democracy activists and Western countries have cast doubt on the credibility of the planned elections as many key political activists are still in detention. This includes pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who recently began a new 18-month period of house arrest after being found guilty of violating her house arrest order in a widely condemned trial. \u201cThe whole Suu kyi trial is rather unlawful,\u201d said Zarni. \u201cBecause the country does not have an independent judiciary, the judges are just puppets who dance to the tune of the top leadership.\u201d Junta is holding on tightly In 1990, Suu Kyi\u2019s National League for Democracy won Myanmar\u2019s last general election by a landslide. But the junta never recognised the results and has since tightened its control over the country. The 2008 constitution, which was drafted and approved by the military generals, which guarantees the army 25 percent of parliamentary seats, is yet another sign of its desire to consolidate power. \u201cThe military is going to be in power for a long time,\u201d warns Zarni, \u201cbecause they have got control of all the political and economic institutions in the country as well as the entire state of Burma. So with or without elections, this is likely to remain the same.\u201d New Democratic Party formed Meanwhile, a new political party has been formed in Myanmar. The Democratic Party is headed by Mya Than Than Nu, who is the daughter of the country\u2019s first democratically-elected prime minister, U Nu. The party has proposed a power-sharing deal with the military, which would give 40 percent of power to politicians and 60 percent to the military rulers. Harn Yawnghwe, the director of the Brussels-based Euro-Burma Office, doubts the new party stands a chance: \u201cIt is possible that they they would be able to get some votes. But it is not likely, even if they were able to contest the elections freely, that they will be able to form a new government because the military is not prepared to let any party rule.\u201d Democrats should exploit elections He thinks the only way out for the democratic forces in Myanmar is to use the upcoming elections wisely and \u201cto take part in them even if they are against them. I think we have to look at the elections as a process which will lead to democracy -- maybe in few more years.\u201d The National League for Democracy has indicated that it will not take part in the polls unless all Myanmar\u2019s political prisoners, including Suu Kyi, are released. Suu Kyi\u2019s lawyers have filed an appeal against the extension of her house arrest and the court is expected to give a ruling on October 2. But few are hopeful that the junta will amnesty her anytime soon. Author: Disha Uppal Editor: Anne Thomas",

        "target": "A quarter of deaths caused by environmental degradation, says UN A new United Nations report warns that pollution and global warming are causing millions more deaths than conflicts. The UN's environment agency has called for an urgent roll-back on harmful substances and fossil fuels. In its report \"Healthy Environment, Health People,\" the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), the World Health Organization and several other environment organizations said that, in 2012, an estimated 12.6 million deaths were attributable to deteriorating environment conditions. The largest numbers of deaths took place in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific regions, followed by sub-Saharan Africa, where around a quarter of deaths were likely caused byair pollution, chemicals, climate change and a lack of access to sanitation. \"By depleting the ecological infrastructure of our planet and increasing our pollution footprint, we incur an ever-growing cost in terms of human health and well-being,\" said UNEP Executive Director Achim Steiner. He added that humanity's life support systems had been compromised by globalization and powerful economic interests. The report was released during UN climate talks in the German city of Bonn which are drawing up rules pertaining to the Paris agreement, which seeks to lower carbon emissions. The document suggested that several drivers were responsible for the threat to human health, including ecosystem disruption, climate change, inequality, unhealthy and wasteful lifestyles, along with unsustainable consumption and production. Worsening effects UNEP estimated that an extra 250,000 deaths could occur each year between 2030 and 2050 as a result of climate change, leading to malnutrition, malaria, diarrhea and heat stress. Between them air pollution and a lack of access to clean water and sanitation cause almost 8 million premature deaths each year. Environmental impacts are responsible for the deaths of more than one quarter of all children under the age of five, the report states. UNEP called for governments to act to remove harmful substances from working environments, reduce the use of carbon fuels and rely instead on renewable energy, and change lifestyles to allow a more sustainable use of the world's resources. The report also called for a bigger investment to protect the planet's natural ecosystem. UNEP predicted a further increase in emerging zoonotic diseases (spread between animals and humans), and called on developing countries, in particular, to prioritize prevention methods. \"Never before have so many animals been kept by so many people - and never before have so many opportunities existed for pathogens to pass through the biophysical environment and wild animals to livestock and people,\" the report warned.",
        "generated_story": "A quarter of deaths due to environmental degradation, says UNEP The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned of a \"significant increase\" in the number of people dying from environmental problems. The UN Environment Program (UNEP) warned on Thursday that the world's worst environmental problem was rising. According to a report released by the UN, more than one-quarter of all deaths from climate change are attributable to the effects of environmental pollution on human health and the environment. \"We have seen a significant increase in deaths in recent years,\" the report said, adding that it was \"increasingly difficult to predict the future.\" The report, which was released in Bonn, Germany, on Wednesday, said the increase was due in large part to increased levels of greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation and other forms of deforestation. It also said that more people were dying of heat-related diseases than from natural causes, such as heat waves, drought, floods and earthquakes, as well as from human-caused diseases like typhoid, dengue and cholera. In a statement released on its website, the WHO said: \"This is the highest level of human mortality since the end of World War II, and it is a clear indication that environmental conditions are becoming more and more severe in developing countries.\" \"It is not just the climate that is causing the deaths, it's the human conditions that are causing these deaths,\" said WHO Director-General Achim Steiner. He added that \"it is very difficult for people to cope with the consequences of their own actions, especially when they are living in extreme poverty and suffering from a lack of access to basic health care.\" He also pointed out that many of the people who die from the disease are women, children and people with disabilities who are not able to access basic medical care because they cannot afford to live in a climate where their bodies are exposed to high temperatures and high humidity. These are all factors that contribute to people's health problems, he said."

He wants new names for plant-based dishes. Germans shouldn't be biting into a \"vegan sausage\" or cutting a slice of \"vegetarian schnitzel,\" German Minister for Food and Agriculture Christian Schmidt told the daily \"Bild\" newspaper on Wednesday, adding that names traditionally used for meat-based dishes should not be applied to plant-based foods. \"I don't want anyone to pretend that these pseudo-meat dishes are actual meat dishes,\" Schmidt said. The minister said manufacturers should come up with distinct names for plant-based meat-substitutes. Schmidt also said meat was part of a healthy and balanced diet and belonged on the menu in schools and kindergartens. Soy? Steak? Soy-steak? Schmidt's statements echo demands from the German Farmers Association and German Butchers Association. Both lobbying groups have asked for a ban on terms such as \"vegetarian ham\" or \"soy steak.\" Schmidt's call for plant-based foods to have their own name was also made in October in the state of Lower Saxony, a state with many large livestock farms. The German Vegetarian Association, however, argued against the proposal. A spokesperson for the organization said that \"names that are used for animal-based products should without a doubt also be legal to use for vegetarian substitute products.\" More meatless 'whatever-you-want-to-call-thems' The market for vegetarian and vegan dishes has grown steadily in the past few years in Germany, partly at the expense of the meat industry. According to a research paper by the Institute for the Study of Trade (IfH), revenue for vegetarian and vegan products in Germany was 454 million euros ($474 million) in 2015 and grew by more than 100 percent between 2010 and 2015. In the same time period, the demand for meat products fell by almost 10 percent. mb/sms (dpa, epd)",

The decision comes as a surprise to the German farmers association, which represents more than 1.5 million farmers in the Lower Saxony region. \"We have decided that we are going to stop selling these products,\" said Christian Schmidt, the head of the association's meat division, in an interview with German newspaper Bild. He added that the decision was made \"in the interest of preserving the meat and preserving it for future generations.\" \"This is the first time we have been able to sell our meat in Germany,\" Schmidt said, adding that he was \"very happy\" with the results. But, he added, \"It's not just about meat anymore. It's about vegetables, it's also about the whole plant. We have a whole new crop of vegetables that are growing in our country, and we want to preserve them for the future,\" he said. In a statement released on Friday, Germany's agriculture ministry said it would not be buying meat from farmers, but would instead sell it from the farmers' market. Schmidt also said that there would be no meat sales at farmers markets and that farmers would have to pay a premium for their products, as well as the cost of producing them. This is a change from previous years, when farmers were allowed to buy meat directly from their customers. However, Schmidt pointed out that this was not the case with meat, saying that \"meat is not a substitute for meat.\" In other words, meat has to be bought from a farmer's market in order to make it into a meat-free product. For example, beef is now sold in supermarkets, while pork is sold at a farmers market, where it can be split between two types of meat. And, of course, there's the beef. There are also the sausage and sausage varieties, such as beef, lamb and lamb. These are all products which are not available in meat markets. They're not even available on the supermarket shelves. Instead, they're available at supermarkets and bakeries across the country."

Harper, who led the Conservatives to victory in the 2015 federal election, announced his resignation on Thursday. The announcement came after a series of events in which Harper was accused of sexual misconduct and sexual assault. \"I regret to inform you that I have to step down,\" Harper said in a statement released by his office. He also said he would not seek re-election to a second term in office, which would see him take over the leadership of his party from Justin Trudeau, the Liberal Party's leader. In the past, Harper had been the party's longest-serving leader, having served as party leader from 2006 to 2011. His term ended in 2011, when he was forced out of office by a court ruling that he had acted in breach of party rules. Since then, he has presided over a number of major political developments, including the formation of a new federal government and the creation of an electoral commission to evaluate the country's electoral prospects. During his tenure as premier, Canada's largest economy grew by 1.6 percent, compared to the national average of 2.7 percent for the United States, and Canada was the world's fastest-growing industrial economy, according to figures compiled by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Harper's government has been criticized by some quarters for its handling of key issues, such as immigration, climate change and human rights. On Thursday, it was announced that Harper would no longer be able to run the government as a member of parliament and that his term would be up in two years. A spokesman for Harper told the Canadian Press that the announcement was made \"in good faith.\" \"We are very happy with the outcome of this election,\" the spokesman said, adding that \"it was a very good result for Canada.\" Harper is also expected to take a leave of absence from the federal cabinet to focus on his health care and education programs, as well as his plans to reform the Canada Pension Plan (CPP), which he co-founded in 2006. Canada is one of only three industrialized countries to have a government with a population of more than one billion people. Prime minister Harper and his wife, Sophie, have been at loggerheads since the end of last year. They have had a difficult time reconciling their differences over how to deal with each other, but they have come to an understanding that they are not mutually exclusive."

He was due to return to Ireland on Monday to face charges related to his involvement in the Rio de Janeiro Olympics. The 27-year-old Dubliner, who is also a member of the Irish delegation to the Olympics, was arrested in Brazil on Thursday on suspicion of participating in an act of terrorism. \"I am not guilty of any crime, I am innocent,\" he said in a statement released by his lawyer, Juliana Leal de Melo, adding that he had \"nothing to hide\" from the Brazilian authorities. Ireland is one of three countries that have banned Irish athletes from competing in international competitions, including the 2012 London Games and the 2016 Rio Olympics in France. Dublin has also banned Ireland from participating at the 2014 and 2016 Olympic Games, which are scheduled to take place in South America, the European Union, Asia and Latin America. A spokesman for Ireland's Olympic council said that Ireland had been invited to participate, but that it was not yet clear whether Ireland would be able to attend the games. In an interview with The Irish Times on Friday, Ireland\u2019s national Olympic committee said it would not comment on the case. \u201cWe have no comment at this time,\u201d the spokesman said, referring to an ongoing legal dispute between Ireland and Brazil over the extradition of a Dublin man who was charged in connection with the murder of an Irish woman last year. Hiccup was released on a bail of \u20ac2.5 million (1.6 million euros) after a two-day trial in which he pleaded guilty to two counts of first-degree murder and one count of conspiracy to commit murder. His bail was set at \u20ac500,000 ($1 million) and he is due back in court in Dublin later this month, according to a court document. It is unclear whether he will be allowed to appeal his conviction, or if he has a lawyer who can assist him in his defense."

Twenty years later, relations between Libya and Europe have done an about-face. The Berlin disco \"La Belle\" was packed as usual on the night of April 5, 1986. Among its guests were many US soldiers, who were certainly not thinking of politics, the Middle East or strained relations between the United States and Libya. But reality caught up with them: a bomb detonated near the dance floor that night, killing two Americans and a Turkish woman. Over 200 people were injured. A Berlin court ruled that Libya and its intelligence services were responsible for the bombing. In 2001, following a nearly four-year long trial, the judges convicted a Libyan diplomat and three others to prison sentences between 12 and 14 years. The big oil-exporting country in the meantime was busy working on its reputation. Already in the 1990s, Tripoli began striving to improve its relations to the European Union. Financial reparation opened the door to Europe In 2004, the Gaddafi International Foundation for Charity Associations and the legal representatives of the German La Belle victims settled on $35 million in compensation. This opened the door to Europe. Just a few weeks later, Germany's chancellor at the time, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, visited Moammar Gadhafi in a traditional Bedouin tent outside of Tripoli. Britain's Prime Minister Tony Blair also paid Gadhafi a visit. A few months earlier, in April 2004, the European Union had welcomed the Libyan leader to Brussels. It was Gadhafi's first official visit to Europe in 15 years. Bernd Westphal, the German ambassador to Libya, said bilateral relations had been through difficult times. \"The German Embassy in Tripoli today is working for a quick return to the liveliness of close relations between Germany and Libya,\" Westphal said. \"We want to build on our traditional friendship with Libya and we want to strengthen the political, economic and cultural cooperation between our two countries and peoples.\" Business interests booming in Libya In the past few years, Libya has moved from being the supporter of international terrorism to an attractive economic partner for the West. European business representatives have been increasingly knocking on Libya's door. Even the United States is showing increased interest in the northern African nation. Washington is pleased that Libya announced at the end of 2003 that it would discontinue its efforts to develop and produce weapons of mass destruction. Libya's ambassador to Germany, Said Abdulaati, said political and economic relations between Libya and Germany were \"excellent.\" Libya is one of Germany's strongest trading partners in northern Africa. Last year, Germany exported goods to Libya worth 657.7 million euros ($805.7 million), according to the German Federal Statistics Office. \"The economy is the driving power in German-Libyan relations,\" said Abdulaati in an interview with the Arab-German association for trade and industry. But Germany isn't the only European country making deals in Libya. France last month signed an accord with Libya on peaceful nuclear research. \"This accord represents a qualitative leap in relations between the two countries and proves that Libya has transformed its weapons of mass destruction into constructive weapons,\" Public Works Minister Maatuk Maatuk said at the signing ceremony in March. \"We are telling the world that we are moving towards the development of Libyan nuclear technology for peaceful purposes.\" This week, the Netherlands' Economics Minister Laurens Jan Brinkhorst will visit Libya to negotiate gas and oil agreements. It will be the first high-level visit by a Dutch official since Gadhafi took power in 1969.",

The Social Democrats (SPD) and Christian Democrats (CDU) have ruled the small northern city-state of Bremen in a coalition for the past 12 years. But after winning state elections on Sunday with 36.8 percent, the SPD is now flirting with the idea of ditching their previous coalition partners to rule together with the Greens, who made their best-ever showing in a German state poll with 16.4 percent. Bremen's state SPD leadership is to hold talks later on Wednesday with the CDU, which polled 25.7 percent. After an SPD meeting in Bremen, Mayor Jens B\u00f6hrnsen made the first signal he could be favoring the Greens. He said that during the campaign he had deliberately abstained from mentioning the possibility of a renewed CDU coalition because \"after 12 years it shouldn't automatically be continued.\" Bremen's acting head of government and CDU member Thomas R\u00f6wekamp, however, warned against an SPD-Green coalition. \"The majority of people don't want a red-green experiment, but a continuation of the grand coalition,\" he said. Both the SPD and CDU conceded heavy losses in the election, which showed a swing towards the Greens and the Left Party, which scored an unexpected 8.4 percent to win representation in a western German state legislature for the first time in its brief history. Block reforms? If Bremen's SPD decide in favor of the Greens, this would affect the ability of Chancellor Angela Merkel's grand coalition of CDU and SPD to push ahead with reforms requiring constitutional changes, such as stage two of Germany's urgently needed federalism reform. The federal Bundesrat, which is made up of state cabinet members, has to approve the majority of legislative bills passed by the lower chamber, the Bundestag, before they become law. Also, any proposed constitutional changes require two-thirds of all votes in order to be passed by the Bundesrat. The CDU and SPD currently hold 47 of the Bundesrat's 69 seats, which is one seat more than the necessary two-thirds majority. But without Bremen, the number held by the grand coalition would fall to 44 seats, meaning they would need the cooperation of one of the small opposition parties for any constitutional changes. Internal strife Earlier in the week, Chancellor Merkel called for unity within her ruling left-right coalition after the losses in Bremen set the stage for more infighting between the two parties. Merkel also warned the SPD against moving to the left after it lost some five percent points. The chancellor said the outcome showed the SPD had made a mistake by attacking the coalition and campaigning on promises of a minimum wage, which she believes will hamper efforts to fight unemployment of just under 10 percent. \"The result showed that this strategy did not pay off,\" Merkel told a press conference.",

The CSU and Greens, which form the governing coalition, are expected to announce the deal at a special meeting of their parliamentary group on Monday.

US General Philip Breedlove said Russian forces were still operating inside Ukraine. Speaking to reporters after a meeting with NATO military chiefs in Lithuania's capital Vilnius on Saturday, US General Philip Breedlove expressed \"sincere hope\" about a renewed peace plan, agreed to earlier in the day in the Belarusian capital Minsk, by separatists and representatives from Ukraine's and Russia's governments. The new pact, including an artillery buffer zone, was a move to strengthen a peace plan signed earlier this month, also in Minsk. However, Breedlove said violence levels in Ukraine in recent days were as high as prior to the earlier ceasefire. \"The ceasefire is still there in name, but what is happening on the ground is quite a different story,\" Breedlove said, adding that Russian forces were still operating in Ukraine, although he could not pinpoint how many. \"The fluidity of movement of Russian forces and Russian-backed forces back and forth across that border makes it almost impossible to understand the numbers,\" he said. A convoy from Russia consisting of about 170 trucks arrived in Ukraine on Saturday, with a reported cargo of humanitarian aid. Previous aid convoys sent from Russia were met with outrage in Kyiv, as it was suspected they may have been used to provide support to the pro-Moscow separatists in eastern Ukraine. Russia has repeatedly denied such accusations. The separatists have said they want to break from Kyiv and have already declared \"people's republics'\" in Donetsk and Luhansk. This week Ukraine's parliament passed a bill which paves the way for more autonomy for those areas.

'The ceasefire has not been renewed for a number of months and we have not seen any sign of a ceasefire. We are not going to give up on this ceasefire,' he said, adding that the US would continue to work with Russia to ensure that Ukraine's territorial integrity is maintained and that it does not fall into the hands of separatist forces. The UN Security Council, however, has called for an end to the fighting, saying it is not a \"one-sided conflict.\" \"We have to see what happens,\" the UN's special envoy for Ukraine, John Bolton, said in an interview with the Associated Press. He also called on Russia and Ukraine to respect the sovereignty of their respective territories, which have been divided over the past two years by ethnic and sectarian conflict. NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen has also said that Russia should not be allowed to dictate the terms of any ceasefire with regard to Ukraine. In a statement released on Friday, NATO said it had agreed to extend the truce until the end of March. However, the statement did not address the question of whether or not Moscow would allow the Ukrainian government to resume negotiations with Moscow on a new peace deal. Russia, in particular, is opposed to any such deal, and has rejected the idea of an extension of talks between Moscow and Kyiv. Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly said he will not allow any deal to be reached without a deal between the two sides. Moscow, meanwhile, says it has no plans to impose a freeze on any talks with Ukraine unless Moscow agrees to a cessation of hostilities."

The move follows a political protest at the first such match. In a statement released on Friday, the German football association (DFB) announced that the games would be rescheduled for 2018 and that talks would take place between them and their Chinese counterparts in order explore how to move forward. \"To the regret of all parties involved, the project has not received the broad approval that had been expected,\" the DFB said. \"In fact, the project was used by a handful of spectators to send messages that were considered hurtful by the Chinese team, officials, the Chinese Football Association's support staff and Chinese spectators.\" Protests in opening match The first of the arranged matches, against TSV Schott Mainz of the fourth-tier Regionalliga S\u00fcdwest was interrupted midway through the first half when the Chinese players left the field because a small group of activists had unfurled Tibetan flags. The team later returned to the field after the flags had been taken down, before succumbing to a 3-0 defeat. On Monday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry strongly criticized the protest. Initially, it had been thought that the Chinese side would play in the Regionalliga S\u00fcdwest - a regional division of Germany's fourth tier which has only 19 teams but the plan was revised so the matches would just be friendlies. This followed an agreement signed in 2016 between the German FA and the Chinese government to help boost the sport in the Asian country, where the Bundesliga is increasingly popular.

The cancellation of the team, which had been scheduled to play against TSV Schott Mainz on Saturday, is the latest in a series of cancellations by German football associations over the weekend.

China's football federation said on Sunday that it would not comment on the incident, saying it was a \"technical matter.\" The country's Football Confederation said it had no immediate plans to hold a press conference in response to Saturday's cancellation. German media reported that a number of Chinese players had also been arrested in connection with the protests, with one of them, Ronny Zimmerman, claiming to be a fan of President Xi Jinping's regime in Beijing.

German auto club ADAC says costs associated with owning a car have risen more than 40 percent since 1995. In 2010, German car owners had to pay a high price for their mobility, according to ADAC, which cited record-high fuel prices as the major cost factor. \"For drivers, 2010 will go down in history as the most costly year ever,\" ADAC said in a statement. High taxes The cost of acquiring and operating a car has risen 42 percent since 1995, compared to a 24 percent increase in the general cost of living. Due to tax increases and higher production costs, fuel prices soared 86 percent over the 15-year period. In 2010 alone, the average price for a liter of super gasoline was more than 1.40 euros ($1.84) - the highest the average price ever. According to ADAC, urban singles spent an average of 3,340 euros on their cars in 2000. Five years later, that figure had jumped to 3,900 euros. By the end of 2010, their expenses reached 4,380 euros, or 1,000 euros more than a decade earlier. Driving is also pricey for four-person families with two cars. According to the automobile club, their annual costs have risen 30 percent over the past 10 years from 5,940 euros to 7,740 euros. Taxes account for the lion's share of gasoline and diesel prices. The German government's mineral oil and value added taxes account for nearly 88 cents of the 1.35-euro price of a liter of fuel. Low toll revenue While the German government reaps more revenue year for year from vehicle-related taxes, income generated by its highway toll for trucks is expected to fall this year for the first time since the haulage charges were introduced in 2005. The government predicts this year's toll revenues will amount to 4.2 billion euros, down from 4.3 billion euros in 2009. Author: John Blau Editor: Sam Edmonds",
        "generated_story": "German Auto Clubs: The Most Costly Year in History The most costly year in history for German auto clubs is the most expensive year ever. ADAC, the German Automobile Clubs Association (ADAC), estimates that the average German car club costs more than $1,000 a year to run than any other club in the country. The average cost of running a car in Germany is around $2,500, according to a study published in January by the research group ADac. That's a staggering figure for a German club, which was founded in 1887 and has since become one of the world's largest car clubs. It's also the highest costliest year for any German automobile club. In the first half of 2016, German automotive clubs had a total turnover of $4.6 million, compared to the same period last year. This is a record for the largest year-on-year increase in car sales in a single year, with an increase of 1.5 percent year on year over the past five years. Last year's record was $3.4 billion, a figure that is almost twice that of 2007, when the club was first established in 1787. Since then, it has grown to $5.7 billion. But the biggest increase is due in part to increased competition from the likes of BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Audi and Porsche, as well as a rise in demand for new cars and SUVs. \"We have a lot of competition, and we have to compete against each other to win. We are not going to let the competition get to us. And that's the main reason why we can't compete with the rest of Europe,\" said the study's senior author, Andreas K\u00fcbler, adding that \"the competition is fierce.\" The study also found that car owners are more likely to sell their cars at a discount than they are to buy a new one, because they have more money to spend on the latest models. However, this doesn't necessarily mean that they will be able to afford the new models, since the current model is more expensive than the old model. For example, BMW has been selling its cars for around \u20ac1.2 billion (2.8 billion euros) since it was launched in 2005. According to German news agency dpa, that figure is expected to rise to \u20ac3 billion in 2016."

But many of the parliamentarians whose vote will finally set Brexit on its wayhave voted against their hearts, as well as their minds. It was a vote against their minds, because the withdrawal from the EU will almost certainly, at least on a short to medium term basis, have negative repercussions for the British economy. And it was a vote against their hearts, because for many, a view of the future, divorced from Brussels and increasingly reliant on an unpredictable US President Donald Trump, is somewhat alarming. In recent days, many members of parliament have described it as \"a catastrophe.\" No vote \"against the will of the people.\" Of course there are \"Brexiteers\" who believe that a Britain independent of Brussels will be able to return to its former greatness, once it is no longer held back by the \"Little Europeans.\" But they are in the minority - the majority of parliamentarians already declared their support for remaining in the EU during the referendum campaign. Yet despite this, Theresa May's government was able to push its legislative proposal through the House of Commons without any great difficulty. The predominant view, also amongst members of the two leading parties, is that to hinder Brexit and to fail to support the government in its endeavors to do so, would be to go \"against the will of the people.\" Anti-EU newspapers have targeted Brexit opponents. And those who have publically come out in support of the EU have had to reckon with death threats.

Polls are showing that her strategy is gaining increased support. There is no turning back now. The British are now looking for clarity on the repercussions of their withdrawal from the EU. They want the negotiations with the EU to start as soon as possible. It was an historical misjudgement by David Cameron that he could win the referendum.

'We are not going to give up' The UK government has said it will continue to work closely with EU leaders to ensure that its citizens have the opportunity to make informed decisions about their own country's future. But it is also important to note that this process is far from over. There is still a long way to go before the end of this year's negotiations can be concluded, and that is why we are now in a position where we can move forward with a deal that will allow us to get on with our lives. That's why I am calling for an orderly and orderly withdrawal of UK citizens' rights and freedoms. I think it's important that all of us in this country are treated with respect and respect, not just those who voted against us, but also those that voted in favor of it. And that's what this referendum is all about: the right to decide what kind of future we want for our country. We want to see a free, fair and open Europe and a stable and prosperous future for all. So far, so good."

He is also the author of several books on water conservation and environmental issues. His work has been published in a number of magazines, including \"The New York Times\" and \"Vanity Fair.\" He has also published a book on the subject, \"Water Conservation,\" in which he and his wife create a series of environmentally friendly products that can be used to clean up the environment. The book is based on his experiences as an artist, publisher and editor in chief of the magazine. It was launched in 2006 and has since become one of Germany's most popular magazines. Klaus has published more than a dozen books in the past five years, most of which have been translated into English, French, German, Spanish and Spanish. In 2006, Klaus published his first volume of work on Water Conservation and Environmental issues, and in 2007, he launched a second volume. Since then, the book has become a hit in Germany, where it has sold over 1,500,000 copies in print, online and on audiobook format. Its main focus is environmental sustainability, with a focus on reducing water pollution and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. \"This is the first time that we have done this,\" Klaus said in an interview with the German newspaper \"Der Spiegel.\" \"We have a lot to learn from this book,\" he said, adding that he hopes to expand his work into other areas of environmental protection, such as energy conservation, climate change, energy efficiency and energy security. 'We are going to do everything we can to make sure that the water we use in our homes is safe and clean,' Klaus added, referring to the fact that there are no chemicals in water that are harmful to human health and well-being. \u201cWe will be doing everything possible to protect our home and our environment,\u201d Klaus told the paper. But he added that it would be \"difficult\" for him to find a solution that would work for his family, friends and neighbors who are in dire need of clean water, as well as for those who don\u2019t have the means to get clean drinking water and are unable to afford the expensive and time-consuming costs associated with cleaning up after a disaster like the one that occurred at the end of World War II, which killed hundreds of thousands of people in Europe and the Middle East."

        "target": "A Brief History of the Seaside Holiday These days, millions take seaside holidays for granted as one of life's pleasures. But 200 years ago, a dip in the sea was more a test of courage. Hardly anyone could swim. As late as the 18th century, many Europeans still thought of the sea as the realm of Satan: storm-tossed and inhabited by terrifying monsters. \"Unlike the mountains, the coasts were terra incognita as a holiday spot,\" says Manfred B\u00e4tje, director of the Bade-Museum on the North Sea island of Norderney. Anyone who set foot in the water was \"stepping into the unknown\". Brighton showed the way That only began to change after the British aristocracy discovered the healing power of salt water. As early as 1780, Brighton, England's biggest and oldest seaside resort, was a bustling spa. Philosopher and physicist Georg Christoph Lichtenberg (1742-1799) of G\u00f6ttingen gave Germans the starting signal with his 1793 essay \"Why doesn't Germany have any large public seaside resorts?\" In it, he called for the creation of a resort in Cuxhaven on the North Sea. He received support from the most notable German physician of the time, the Prussian king's court physician, Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland. But things turned out somewhat differently. Germany's first seaside resort was indeed built in September, 1793, but in Heiligendamm on the Baltic Sea. Four years later, permission was granted for construction of Germany's first resort on the North Sea, on Norderney. \"For the first bathing season on July and August of 1800, only around 250 guests turned up. Now, the nearly 6000 residents host a good 530,000 bathers annually, plus around 230,000 day-trippers,\" B\u00e4tje reels off the figures. Romanticist inspiration In the 19th century, the landscapes of Caspar David Friedrich, such as his famous Chalk Cliffs on R\u00fcgen (1818), gave seaside holidays added impetus. From then on, the sea was no longer a voracious beast. From the shore, the cultivated, modern European contemplated the vast melancholy of the deep. \"The calm sea became an embodiment of unspecified yearning, the waves an expression of vitality and dynamism,\" soliloquizes museum director B\u00e4tje. But the journey to the sea long remained an arduous, time-consuming one. It took the mail coach a good thirty hours to cover the distance from Hamburg to the North Frisian town of Aurich over bumpy, muddy roads. The express cab from Bremen only took about 16 hours to reach the East Frisian town of Norden - including six changes of horses along the way. \"It wasn't comfortable,\" explains B\u00e4tje. Not until the introduction of seaside tourist steamers out of Hamburg and Bremen to the islands and the expansion of the railways did the journey become easier. Strict bathing rules At first, it was primarily the well-to-do bourgeois and nobility who were able to afford a seaside holiday. Victorian-era society is known for its extreme prudishness, and the beach was not exempt. Bathing machines were essentially changing cabins on wheels that could be rolled into the surf. The sexes were kept strictly separated. Wet swimsuits could not be allowed to cling, thus revealing the body's contours. Women sported baggy flannel garments with bloomers underneath that swiftly became waterlogged to where the bather was risking her life. Hardly anyone really knew how to swim anyway. \"Most bathers wouldn't stay in the water any more than two minutes, often just seconds at a time. The English had a rule: 'Three dips and out',\" quips archivist Manfred B\u00e4tje, whose Bade-Museum is housed in a building for a former wave pool, just a few steps from Norderney's Weststrand, where, during the summer months, vacationers sunbathe in wicker beach chairs and on blankets, cooled by a salty sea breeze. Sunbathing first came in style early in the 20th century, and the first true swimsuits were produced in the United States. \"Starting in 1919, today's bathing culture gradually began to take shape,\" B\u00e4tje looks back. At the same time, ideals of beauty were in flux - such as the attitude towards tan skin, which had long been regarded as a mark of farmers and manual laborers. B\u00e4tje: \"People were still cultivating their genteel pallors.\" Water, Waves, Wellness Today, the sun worshipers are the devout masses, and seaside holidays are their pilgrimages. The North Sea resorts alone count some 12.9 million overnight stays annually. Health is once again a primary concern: sea air, sea water, sea salts and the algaes and mud used in",
        "generated_story": "A Brief History of the Seaside Holiday in Germany In the 19th century, the seaside holiday was a popular tourist attraction. It was popular with tourists from all over the world, from Germany to the United Kingdom. But it was also popularly known as the \"Holiday in Europe,\" as well as for the British, French, German, Dutch and Dutch holidaymakers. The British were particularly popular in the 17th and 18th centuries, as were the Dutch, Germans and English, who were all born in England and came to Germany at the end of World War II. Today, there are more than 1.5 million people who visit Germany every year, and the most popular holiday is the Chalk Cliffs on R\u00fcgen, which is one of Germany's most famous tourist attractions. There is also the Bade-Museum in Bremen, where the German ambassador to England, Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland, was born. He was the first German to visit the site in 1815. His father, Caspar David Friedrich, worked as a ship's captain for many years, but he died before he could leave for England. In 1873, he was awarded the Order of Merit for his services to German seafaring. Since then, Germany has become a tourist destination, with many of its attractions and attractions located on the seafront. \"It's a wonderful place to be,\" he said, \"but it's also a place where people come to enjoy the sea, because it gives them a chance to experience the beauty of nature.\" The German state of Norderney has a reputation for being a welcoming place for visitors, particularly those who come from the East. A few years ago, when the Germans were still living in Hamburg, they were able to take advantage of this opportunity to spend time with their families and friends. Over the years they have become more and more aware of each other's culture and traditions. They are also more open to new ideas and new experiences. For example, during the summer of 1857, a group of German seamen went on a cruise to Cuxhaven. This was followed a year later by a similar trip to Brighton. During this time, some of them came back to Hamburg to stay with the family for a couple of days. After the cruise ended, many Germans returned to Cologne and spent the next few days at sea. On the other hand, it wasn't long after that that they returned home to find their loved ones, including their children and grandchildren, all of whom were visiting Germany from other countries. Some of these visitors were German-speakers, while others came from England or the Netherlands, or even from Scandinavia, to see the sights and sounds of their own country and culture. Many of those visiting the coast were also Germans, so it is not unusual for them to have a good time."

He also called on the public to stay away from the area where the incident took place, saying that it was a \"very serious situation.\" \"The situation is very serious, and we are very, very concerned,\" he said. A spokesman for the White House said the president's office did not have any further details on what prompted the decision to lift the lockdown, which was lifted in response to an incident earlier this week at Camp Springs, a medical facility near the Maryland-Virginia border. Officials said there were no immediate reports of any injuries, but they added that a number of people were being treated for minor injuries. Military spokesman John Kirby told reporters that no one was in danger and that military personnel would be allowed to leave the site at this time. However, military officials said they were aware of the situation and would continue to monitor it closely. Obama, who has been in Washington for more than a year, said he had not been briefed by the Pentagon about what had happened. 'We are extremely concerned for our soldiers' Obama spoke at an event in Ohio on Thursday, in which he called for an end to the \"war on terror\" that has gripped the country for years. President Obama also spoke out against the recent spate of attacks on military installations in Europe and the Middle East, calling for stricter security measures at military bases across the globe."

        "target": "Threat of the Punjabi Taliban is growing Deutsche Welle talks to Pakistani political expert Hasan Askari Rizvi about the growing ties between militants in northwest Pakistan and Punjab province. At least four gunmen disguised in police uniforms raided a hospital in Pakistan's eastern city of Lahore on Monday night, claiming at least five lives. Local officials said the gunmen were trying to free a militant, who was being treated there after being captured during attacks on two mosques last Friday. The police said the gunfight at Jinnah Hospital had lasted around 45 minutes but the gunmen had managed to flee. Friday's twin attacks on the minority Ahmadi community left more than 90 people dead. They were claimed by a group, which identified itself as the Punjabi wing of the Taliban. Deutsche Welle spoke to political expert Hasan Askari Rizvi in Lahore, where there has been a wave of violence in recent days. DW: Who are the \"Punjabi Taliban\"? It is a kind of a pejorative term, which includes a host of groups. Initially in Punjab, you had two types of militancy: One, the groups that focussed mainly on Indian-administered Kashmir and there were other types of groups that focussed on Pakistan. Those were the sectarian groups targeting mainly the Shias, and there were some Shia groups targeting the Sunni leadership. Over the years a lot of factions have broken away from these groups and these small entities are functioning more or less autonomously. They have trainings in the tribal areas because these are secured for them and certain parts are not under Pakistani control so these groups go there. They operate with the Pakistani Taliban based in tribal areas against the Pakistani troops in the region. They also have an autonomous agenda, which they pursue in Punjab, as they have been doing in the past days. These groups also play host or are a kind of a local link to Taliban suicide bombers who come into the main part of Pakistan from the tribal areas (let's say to Punjab). If they have to target some place, they park themselves with these Punjab groups, and then do it. All these factions and groups that have broken away from traditional militant groups and are functioning in close collaboration with tribal area Taliban are often described as the \"Punjabi Taliban\". Why do you think these militants are resurfacing now? They have always existed here and there and generally the trend is that they undertake a couple of operations, one after the other. Then the government comes in and takes action against them. Then they just disappear or become sleeping groups and suddenly after a couple of months they resurface. That's the standard pattern. The last major incident in Lahore was in the first week of March. Then there was nothing in April and now towards the end of May you have this kind of incident. Do you think the government should have taken stronger action against them? They should have but the problem is that the Punjab government has a kind of ambiguous approach and I think there is some element of denial within the leadership also. These groups also have some sympathy if not support at the societal level and that makes it difficult for the government to go against them openly. They need to work together and to emphasise to the people that they are terrorists. They use different names and Islam but actually their agenda is terrorism. Somehow the government of Punjab has been rather confused and ambiguous regarding these groups. Interview: Disha Uppal Editor: Anne Thomas",
        "generated_story": "Punjabi Taliban threat grows in Pakistan The Pakistani Taliban have seized control of a hospital in northwest Pakistan, raising fears of an attack by the group. The militants are believed to be linked to the Lahore-based militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), which has claimed responsibility for the attack on the Jinnah Hospital. Pakistan's government has warned that the militants could launch attacks on hospitals in the country's northwest. \"We have to act now,\" a senior government official told Deutsche Welle in an interview published on Tuesday, adding that it was \"very important\" for Pakistan to take action against the Taliban. In the past few months, Pakistan has seen a rise in militant activity, with the death toll from the attacks rising to more than 1,000. Last week, the Pakistani government said it had killed at least 30 people in a suicide bombing in Lahoret, killing at the request of the Punjabis, who claim the hospital as their own. Pakistani Foreign Minister Hasan Askari Rizvi said on Monday that his country was facing a \"serious and growing threat\" from Pakistan. He added that Pakistan was also facing an \"increasingly high level of terrorist activity\" in its northwest, which he described as \"a very dangerous situation.\" \"Pakistan is a very volatile country, and we have a lot of terrorists in our country,\" he said, referring to a group of Pakistani militants who have been fighting for years against Pakistani security forces, including the Pakistan army and the Indian army. According to Pakistani media reports, some of these militants have killed hundreds of civilians in recent years, while others have carried out suicide attacks.

Tito Vilanova has died at the age of 45. May he rest in peace,\" the statement said. Vilanova had first been diagnosed with a tumor in a saliva gland in November 2011, while he was an assistant to then-Barcelona head coach Pep Guardiola. He had been battling against recurring cancer ever since and had been admitted to a Barcelona hospital last week. He led Barca to the Primera Liga title last season, his only campaign as head coach, when the Catalans earned a record-tying 100 points. Last July he stepped down due to his ongoing health problems.

The Catalan football federation said in a statement that the 64-year-old coach had died of cancer. \"Tito has been battling cancer for more than a year and a half, and he is no longer able to compete in the Primera Liga,\" said Guardiola, referring to the Spanish league's top division. He added that he had been diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer and that his prognosis for the disease was \"very good.\" \"He has a long history of fighting cancer,\" Guardiola said, adding that \"it is very difficult for him to continue to fight this disease.\" He also said he would like to thank the club's fans for their support in his fight against cancer, which has forced him out of football for a number of years. In the past, the Catalan club has had to cope with the loss of one of its best players in recent years, who has battled cancer since he was 15 years old. Last year, he suffered a heart attack and died at the age of 37. His wife, Maria, was hospitalized in Barcelona, where he spent the last two years of his life, according to a hospital report released on Friday. Barcelona have been without a player since the end of last season, when they were relegated from the top flight of Spanish football. Guardiola's side, however, are still in contention to win the league next season. They are currently in fourth place, behind only Real Madrid, Barcelona and Real Sociedad, with only one point separating them from top-flight club Barcelona. A spokesman for Barcelona said the team was still looking into the possibility of a possible return to play in 2018-19, but that it was too early to say whether that would be the case. According to Barcelona's website, \"the club is still working on a plan to return the player to his former club.\" The club said it would not comment on the report. Former Barcelona star Vilnava, now a coach at FC Bayern Munich, died on Saturday, a day after undergoing chemotherapy for prostate cancer in an intensive care unit at a Barcelona hospital. Police said they had found no evidence of an attack on his body, although they have not ruled out a return. Catalan media reported on Sunday that Vilavilla had undergone surgery to remove a large amount of blood vessels from his prostate gland, as well as a liver and pancreas. It was not immediately clear whether the cancer had spread to other organs."
