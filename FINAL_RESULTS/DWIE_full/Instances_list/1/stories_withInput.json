        "target": "Myanmar Junta Announces Amnesty The junta in Myanmar, also known as Burma, announced an amnesty for more than 7,000 prisoners on Friday, including a few political detainees. The amnesty came on the 21st anniversary of the brutal crackdown of a student-led pro-democracy movement in 1988 and the subsequent seizure of power by the current junta. Journalists were invited to Yangon\u2019s notorious Insein prison on Friday as the authorities released the first batch of prisoners. At least 600 inmates were freed as part of an amnesty for over 7,000 inmates nationwide. Among those released in Yangon were two journalists and 25 political prisoners -- rights groups say this is only 1 percent of the total number of political prisoners held by the military regime. Maung Zarni, a research fellow at the London School of Economics, was \u201chappy for the prisoners who were part of the release\u201d. \u201cThis is a very positive personal development and I am happy they have been released but we need to understand that the junta is using the prisoners\u2019 release as a public relations exercise. It is the 21st anniversary of the military coup so they are using this as a way to pacify political discontent in the country.\u201d Amnesty comes ahead of next year\u2019s polls Myanmar's director general of prisons, Zaw Win, said that the prisoners had been freed so they could take part in next year's polls. In recent months, rights activists, pro-democracy activists and Western countries have cast doubt on the credibility of the planned elections as many key political activists are still in detention. This includes pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who recently began a new 18-month period of house arrest after being found guilty of violating her house arrest order in a widely condemned trial. \u201cThe whole Suu kyi trial is rather unlawful,\u201d said Zarni. \u201cBecause the country does not have an independent judiciary, the judges are just puppets who dance to the tune of the top leadership.\u201d Junta is holding on tightly In 1990, Suu Kyi\u2019s National League for Democracy won Myanmar\u2019s last general election by a landslide. But the junta never recognised the results and has since tightened its control over the country. The 2008 constitution, which was drafted and approved by the military generals, which guarantees the army 25 percent of parliamentary seats, is yet another sign of its desire to consolidate power. \u201cThe military is going to be in power for a long time,\u201d warns Zarni, \u201cbecause they have got control of all the political and economic institutions in the country as well as the entire state of Burma. So with or without elections, this is likely to remain the same.\u201d New Democratic Party formed Meanwhile, a new political party has been formed in Myanmar. The Democratic Party is headed by Mya Than Than Nu, who is the daughter of the country\u2019s first democratically-elected prime minister, U Nu. The party has proposed a power-sharing deal with the military, which would give 40 percent of power to politicians and 60 percent to the military rulers. Harn Yawnghwe, the director of the Brussels-based Euro-Burma Office, doubts the new party stands a chance: \u201cIt is possible that they they would be able to get some votes. But it is not likely, even if they were able to contest the elections freely, that they will be able to form a new government because the military is not prepared to let any party rule.\u201d Democrats should exploit elections He thinks the only way out for the democratic forces in Myanmar is to use the upcoming elections wisely and \u201cto take part in them even if they are against them. I think we have to look at the elections as a process which will lead to democracy -- maybe in few more years.\u201d The National League for Democracy has indicated that it will not take part in the polls unless all Myanmar\u2019s political prisoners, including Suu Kyi, are released. Suu Kyi\u2019s lawyers have filed an appeal against the extension of her house arrest and the court is expected to give a ruling on October 2. But few are hopeful that the junta will amnesty her anytime soon. Author: Disha Uppal Editor: Anne Thomas",

The group, which has been fighting for the right to vote, said it had arrested more than 1,000 people in the past two months. The number of arrests has risen to around 2,500 since the end of the military's rule in 2014, Amnesty said, adding that the number has increased to 3,600 since then. \"This is the first time we have seen a political prisoner being released from prison,\" Amnesty's Harn Yawnghwe told reporters in Yangon on Thursday. He added that he hoped to see the release of thousands more prisoners by the time the new government came into power in early 2019. Amnesty also said that it would be \"impossible\" for Myanmar's new president to release all of its political detainees, including those who had been imprisoned since 2011. According to the group's website, the detainees were released on July 1 after a three-day period of detention in which they had not been allowed to return to their homes for three years. Insein said he was \"very disappointed\" with the arrest, saying it was a \"disgrace\" that they were being held for so long. But he also pointed out that many of them had fled to other countries, such as the United Kingdom, where they lived for several years before returning to Myanmar. U Nu, who is also the head of Amnesty, told Amnesty that \"we are not going to let this happen again.\" \"We will not allow this to happen,\" he said. Zaw Win, a former military intelligence officer, was arrested in 2011 and sentenced to five years in prison for his role in setting up the country's secret police. His sentence was later reduced to one year and three months, but he still faces a long prison term. It is not clear how long he will be out of prison and whether he'll be able to continue his work as a police officer. Many of his colleagues are still in jail, and many have been convicted of crimes against humanity. They are also accused of being involved in human rights abuses, torture and other crimes. Some have even been charged with attempted murder, while others have faced charges of torture, rape and murder for their alleged involvement in an armed struggle against the Myanmar military. On Thursday, he received a five-year prison sentence for crimes committed against civilians and was released in absentia on August 11, 2011, after being arrested on a charge of inciting a riot. Since then, his sentence has continued to rise and he has appealed for leniency in return for a release. However, it is unclear whether his release will have a positive impact on his future, given that his imprisonment is likely to last for at least a year. If he is released he could face a life sentence of up to 10 years, at which point he would have to face the death penalty if he were to be released. That is, if his conviction is upheld by a court of law. For now, however, there is no way he can be freed from his jail sentence. There is still hope for him to go back to his post as president of Myanmar, though he may be forced to step down as soon as his term ends in 2019, when he's due to take a leave of absence from the post of prime minister. I am not sure what the future holds for my country. Mya Than Than Nu is a member of parliament. She was elected to parliament in 2012. Her husband, Aung San Suu Kyi, is currently serving a term of two terms as speaker of a parliamentary committee. When she was first elected in 2013, she said she would seek a new term in parliament, as well as an extension of her term as Prime Minister, in order to ensure that she could continue to lead the National League for Democracy (NLD) in power. This year, her party has won a majority of seats in Parliament and is expected to win the general election in May. Last month, NLD leader Maung Zarni was jailed for two years for alleged links to a terrorist organization. A recent court ruling that convicted him of murder and attempted genocide against his wife and two children was overturned by an appeals court. (Reuters, AFP, dpa, Reuters, AP)The ruling party's main opposition party, The Myanmar People's Party (PDP) has accused the government of failing to protect the rights of Rohingya Muslims, ethnic minorities and the Rohingya minority. Opposition parties have accused her of using excessive force against them, accusing the opposition of trying to undermine the constitution and of attempting to suppress the movement of minorities. Most of these people have denied the charges against her. At the same time, they have also denied any involvement with any political party or any other party in any way that could be used to try to influence the outcome of elections in future elections. These allegations have led to her removal from power struggles for political"

        "target": "US duo shares Nobel Prize for Economics US researcher Elinor Ostrom is the first woman to win the Nobel prize for economics since it was created in 1968. She will share the prestigious award with US compatriot Oliver Williamson. The jury from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said the Americans' research had shown how \"economic analysis can shed light on most forms of social organization.\" Ostrom, a professor at Indiana University, was honored for her \"analysis of economic governance,\" especially in relation to the management of common property or property under common control. The political scientist's work challenges the widely accepted belief that common property is poorly managed and should be either regulated by central authorities or privatized, it added. She carried out numerous studies showing how self-organization and local-level management work to keep common resources viable. Her studies included both natural resources, such as forests, and artificial structures, for example police forces. Ostrom told Swedish television that she felt \"great surprise and appreciation\" and was \"in shock\" about being the first woman to win the prize. The pros and cons of big firms In his work, co-prizewinner Oliver Williamson, of University of California, Berkeley, examines why large corporations tend to arise - and why they do not - based on the cost and complexity of transactions, according to the Nobel committee. \"He has taught us to regard markets, firms, associations, agencies, and even households from the perspective of their contribution to the resolution of conflict,\" the jury said. Williamson authored 'The Economic Institutions of Capitalism' in 1975, a landmark text of the 'new institutional economics' movement that questioned the idea of firms as simple profit-making machines. Last but not least The Nobel prize for economics is the only Nobel award that was not created by the will of Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel in 1896. It was actually founded by the Swedish central bank, the Sverige Riksbank, to celebrate its tri-centenary a year earlier. It was awarded for the first time in 1969 under its official name: the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel. But although it was the last \"Nobel prize\" to be created and the last to be announced each year, the prize is not a poor relation in monetary terms. Winners of the awards for peace, literature, medicine, physiology, chemistry and physics all receive 10 million Swedish crowns (969,000 euros). A good year for women This year was a record year for women laureates. German-Romanian writer Herta Mueller won the Nobel Prize for Literature. Australian-American Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider of the United States were awarded the prize for medicine. And Ada Yonath of Israel was one of three scientists recognized for her work in chemistry. Americans more or less swept the board this year. Nine of the 11 laureates were US citizens. The most prominent of those was US President Barack Obama, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for his \"extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples.\" jg/AFP/dpa/Reuters Editor: Sam Edmonds",
        "generated_story": "Nobel Prize for Economic Sciences: the first woman to win it in 1968 The Nobel prize for economic sciences in memory of Alfred Nobel has been named after the Nobel Prize winner, who was born in Sweden in the year of his birth. The Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded the prize in April 1968 to Elinor Ostrom, a professor of economics at the Sverige Riksbank in Stockholm, Sweden. She won the award for economics in November 1968, when she was the youngest woman ever to receive the prestigious prize. In a ceremony marking the 50th anniversary of Nobel's birth, she said she had been inspired by the work of her father. \"I was inspired to write a book about the economics of the world,\" she told the Swedish newspaper, \"The Economic Institutions of Capitalism.\" \"It was a great honor for me to be able to contribute to the development of economic theory in a way that I never had before. It was an honor to have been given to a woman, and it was also a privilege to give her the opportunity to make a contribution to society through her work as an economist.\" The prize was awarded to women who have worked in economics for more than 50 years. Women of all ages are eligible for the prizes, but the most prestigious is the one for women. Nobel laureate Ada Yonath was one of Sweden's first women to take the Prize, which was first awarded in 1967. Her Nobel-prize won in 1972 for her research on the economic institutions of capitalism, in which she worked as a statistician and economist. On the other hand, the second prize won by a man in his 50s was given in 1973 to an American woman named Carol Greider. Both Nobel laureates were women in their 20s and 30s, respectively. They were also women of middle- and upper-middle-class backgrounds. Their work was published in English, German, French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch, Russian, English and German. Many of them were born and raised in Germany, Israel and the United States, where they were educated as well as in other European countries. Some of their parents were German and Jewish, while others were from the Middle East and North Africa. For the third time in history, women have won Nobel prizes for their work in economic science, particularly in areas such as economics, politics and politics. This year's award was named for Nobel Laureate and Nobel Peace Prize laureate, Nobel alumnus Elizabeth Blackburn. Since the end of World War II, Blackburn has worked on a number of projects, including the creation of a new economic institute in Israel. But she has also been involved in many other fields of study. Among them is economics and political science. When she won her first prize, her husband, Oliver Williamson, died in 2006. He was 86. After her death, he was buried at his home in Berlin, Germany. At the age of 87, his wife, Elina, was married to her son, Olaf Nobel, an Austrian-born German-Jewish man who worked at a German bank. His wife and their two children had a son and a daughter who were both born there. Oliver and his daughter, Ada, also worked for a company that was based in London, before they moved to Sweden and settled in New York City. While they are still married, they have two sons and two daughters. One is a lawyer. Another is an economics professor at Indiana University in California, Berkeley. A third is professor emeritus of business administration, specializing in political economy and economics. And he has a PhD in business management from Stanford University. All three of these fields are related to business, finance and finance. If you want to know more about this, you can read the full list of winners and winners here.

'We don't have the money to pay for this kind of thing.' \"But we do have enough money in our bank,\" he said in an interview with the Economist magazine, adding that he would like to spend more time with his children. That's a good thing, because it would give them a chance to work on their future careers.

        "target": "'One in three' unaware they are HIV-positive The number of people living with HIV/AIDS in the European Union and neighboring countries has increased by nearly a third, with one in three unaware they have the virus, the EU Commission warned Monday. In a document on combating AIDS, the Commission said that as of 2007, around 2.2 million people carried the virus in the EU and nearby countries, an increase of 700,000 from 2001. According to Commission figures, around 730,000 of these live within the EU's 27 member states. France, Italy, Spain and Portugal have relatively high infection rates - ranging from 0.4 percent to 0.5 percent. In the Baltic country of Estonia, the infection rate stands at around 1.3 percent. In neighboring Ukraine, around 1.6 percent of the population has been diagnosed with HIV, while in Russia around 1.1 percent are HIV positive. The Commission warned that now was not the time for Europe to drop its guard on preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS, adding that in some neighboring countries the number of people carrying the virus had doubled. EU Health Commissioner Androulla Vassiliou said political momentum in the fight against HIV/AIDS needed to be maintained, adding that people must \"take responsibility for themselves and their partners by talking about and practicing safe sex and going for HIV testing.\" A cure for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has yet to be found more than a quarter century after it was brought to public attention. However, efficient treatments exist to slow the evolution of the virus. dfm/AFP Editor: Chuck Penfold",
        "generated_story": "EU's HIV-positive people are unaware of their status The European Union's health commissioner has warned that one in three people living with HIV/AIDS in the EU and neighboring countries is unaware they are living in a country with a high risk of contracting the disease. According to a new study by the European Commission, a quarter of EU citizens live in countries with high rates of HIV and AIDS. The study, published last year, found that the number of people who live with the virus is up to three times higher than in other EU countries. This is despite the fact that most of the 28 EU member states do not recognize their HIV status, according to the report. In addition, more than one-third of those who have tested positive for HIV say they have no symptoms at all. Androulla Vassiliou, the commission's head of health, said the study's findings were \"unprecedented\" and showed that many people were unaware that they had HIV. \"It's not just a disease, it's an illness,\" she said, adding that \"it's something that can be transmitted through the body.\" The report also said that in some countries, HIV is considered a form of AIDS, and that it can cause serious health problems, such as kidney failure, liver failure and even death. It also shows that people with AIDS are more likely to be exposed to HIV than people without HIV, which is the most common cause of death in Europe. There is a growing concern that HIV can spread to other people, as well as to others, who may not be able to live without it. That's why the Commission has called for a national public health strategy to tackle the problem. But it is also calling for an end to stigmatization for those living under the age of 30. A new report from the World Health Organization (WHO) has found a significant increase in HIV cases in EU nations, including the United States, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands. WHO has also called on the government to take action to prevent HIV from spreading to people in those countries where it has been reported that there are high levels of transmission. EU health ministers have also urged the health authorities to make it easier for people to get tested for the HIV virus in their country of origin. However, there is still a long way to go before that goal is reached. For example, if a person who is HIV positive is found to have an HIV infection, he or she will have to undergo tests to determine if he has a positive test. These tests will be carried out at the end of next year. If the test results are positive, they will then be sent back to their home country, where they would be tested in order to confirm the status of an individual who has contracted the illness. They will also be screened by a health professional who will assess whether the person has HIV or if they do have a negative history of infection. So far, this has not been done, but the results have not yet been confirmed by WHO, WHO and other health experts. What is known is that this is not the case in many European countries and countries that are not aware of this fact? The EU has already taken steps to address the issue. Last year the bloc agreed to reduce the use of condoms in its health services, saying it would not allow HIV to enter the country's territory. Since then, health officials have been unable to do so because of a lack of awareness among the public about the risks of using condoms. Many of these measures have already been taken, however, many of them are still being implemented. Some countries are also considering a ban on condom use, while others are looking for ways to protect themselves from HIV infections. One in five people have HIV as a condition of treatment, for example in France and Italy. Another one is expected to receive treatment within the next two years, after which the WHO will decide whether they should be allowed to carry out their own HIV tests. Other countries have yet to approve the tests, though, that could take years to implement the new guidelines. Among the measures being taken are measures aimed at preventing the spread of infections and to improve the quality of life for their citizens. At the same time, some European health agencies have said they expect to see a rise in cases of high HIV levels, particularly in areas where HIV has become more common in recent years. On the other hand, several European governments have taken a step toward reducing the burden of carrying out tests on HIV patients, with some of which are already in place. European Health ministers, meanwhile, have expressed concern over the impact of drug use on their patients and their treatment options. (Reuters, AP, AFP, dpa, Reuters)The EU's Health Commissioner for Health and Human Rights Commissioner, Dr. Peter van den Heuvel, told DW, in an interview with DW last month that more tests are planned for this year's edition of The Lancet on Tuesday. He said it will take at least a year to find out if the drug is safe to use condoms, because the"

The spokesman said more help was needed, but could not give exact numbers \"due to pending assignments.\" Recent soccer violence raises concern Swiss media has been questioning the security preparations for Euro 2008 after a spate of violence at recent games. In the latest incident, seats were ripped out and a goal post wrenched from the ground after St. Gallen faced the prospect of relegation following a 2-0 defeat to Bellinzona on May 20. St. Gallen was the third incident in a month that saw violent clashes with police who twice resorted to rubber bullets and tear gas. While Switzerland is seen as a low risk country in terms of hooliganism, violence has been on the increase in recent years and estimates claim there are around 400 hooligans and 600 sympathizers. Swiss Sports Minister Samuel Schmid said that hooliganism cannot be ruled out, reported German news agency DPA. But he expressed his belief that extra measures such as more policing, restrictions on alcohol -- which he has called \"a catalyst for violence\" -- and video surveillance will help keep trouble at bay. Private firms to boost European police The private security companies will be responsible for patrolling the stadiums and their surroundings, as well as the public viewing areas, team hotels and trainings areas. An international police force will manage the rest. Switzerland has committed some 31,200 police officers and soldiers.

The private firms have been asked by the German security agency DPA (DPA) to prepare for a possible terror attack on Europe's biggest sporting event, which is scheduled to take place at the end of the year. \"We are going to do everything we can to make sure that we are prepared for this event,\" said Urs Stadler, head of security at Prisec in St. Gallen, Switzerland. According to a statement from the Swiss government, the firms will provide \"technical assistance\" to the security agencies. They will also provide information on the threat posed by terrorist attacks on European sporting events, such as the Olympics and the Paralympics, as well as information about how to protect yourself and your country from such attacks. In addition to providing technical assistance, they will be providing security for athletes and other sports teams, who are expected to compete in a number of sports events across Europe, including the World Cup and Eurovision. Some of these events are scheduled for the first half of next year, when the European Union (EU) is due to convene in Brussels. It is also expected that the EU will host a Euro-wide security conference in Strasbourg, France, later this month, with the aim of securing the continent's financial future. Germany's Bundesbank said on Thursday that it would provide financial assistance to countries that have failed to secure their borders. German media reported on Friday that German authorities were preparing for an attack by terrorists in Syria, Iraq, Iran and Libya, but that they had not yet been able to prevent the attack. However, German news agency dpa (dpa, AP) reported that security experts had been called in to assess the situation, adding that there was \"a lot of concern\" about the possibility of terrorism attacks, and that some of them could be prevented from taking place in their own country. This is the second time in less than a year that a private firm has been invited to participate in security drills in Germany, after the US and Britain, where they were invited by President Barack Obama to attend a NATO summit in Munich in July. A spokesman for German President Angela Merkel said the government was ready to meet with German officials to discuss the issue, although she did not say whether it was an issue of national security. But she added that \"it was a matter of time before we had a chance to get to know each other.\" The German government has also asked the private sector to step up its security efforts, saying it is \"comprehensive and responsible\" in order to ensure the safety of its citizens and their families. For example, it has said it will not allow the use of drones, drones and drones to carry out attacks in its own territory. That is not the case in other countries, however, because it's not possible to use drones in any way. There are also concerns that drones can be used to spy on people, especially when they are carrying out reconnaissance missions. Last week, a German police officer was killed by a drone while trying to track down a suspected terrorist who was attempting to enter a building in Bellinzona, near the border with Syria. He was shot and critically wounded by an unidentified assailant in an apparent attempt to shoot him down, according to police spokesman Samuel Schmid. Police have also been deployed to try and arrest the suspect. Authorities have said they have launched an investigation into the incident, in which a man was found to have attempted to kill two people. Investigators are still looking into possible links between the attacker and a suicide bomber who fled the scene of an explosion at a Swiss ski resort in January. Officials in Switzerland have warned that such an incident could endanger the lives of thousands of people and could lead to an increase in violence. Meanwhile, Germany is preparing to launch a counter-terror operation against the terrorist threat that has plagued the country for years. At the same time, there are plans to strengthen its anti-terrorism campaign. Security experts have already been working closely with police and intelligence agencies to monitor the activities of foreign nationals who may be involved in terrorist activities. Experts say they expect the attacks to be carried out by law enforcement agencies as soon as possible. Reuters, citing unnamed sources, said security officials in Berlin, Berlin and Paris, that police are working on a joint operation to find out what is going on. If the investigation is successful, police will have to issue a warrant for his arrest, if the man is found guilty of attempted murder, or if he is charged with a crime, for which he has pleaded guilty to murder. Prosecutors are currently investigating the death of another man who is suspected of being a member of terrorist organizations.

Steinmeier issued the plea as he began a tour of the region to sponsor a new peace plan aimed at calming the simmering tensions over Georgia's separatist regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. \"This is my appeal to break out of the spiral of violence. A lack of dialogue is not an option for the future,\" he said after meeting with his Georgian counterpart Eka Tkeshelashvili. Steinmeier, who chairs the so-called Group of Friends of the United Nations' Secretary on Georgia, is proposing a three-phase peace plan based on a mutual declaration of non-violence and repatriation of about 25,000 ethnic Georgians expelled from Abkhazia in the 1990s. Negotiations over the status of the two rebel regions, which have enjoyed de facto autonomy since the end of a civil war in 1994, was reserved for the final phase of negotiations. Tkeshelashvili said, \"The plan has great potential for success,\" but added that the most difficult thing would be to convince Russia. Peace talks remain distant The threat of armed conflict in the region last month has given urgency to international pressure for renewed peace talks, but Tbilisi, Moscow and the Russian-backed regions remain far apart on the basic premises for restarting peace talks. Officials in Tbilisi oppose a treaty on the non-use of force without guarantees on the return of refugees and the withdrawal of Russian peacekeeping forces base in the region. Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was skeptical of peace efforts Thursday. \"Signing of a treaty on the return of Georgian refugees to Abkhazia is unreal now, because such a return requires a calm situation,\" Lavrov was quoted as saying by news agency RIA-Novosti. \"We think that signing a treaty on the non-use of force without any preconditions is an absolutely unavoidable first step,\" he added. Experts see little hope for Steinmeier's plan Analysts do not expect anything conclusive from Steinmeier's trip, pointing to intransigence on the part of the Abkhaz President Sergei Bagapsh, who said he would \"not consider the plan.\" \"We are not going to discuss Abkhazia's status with anyone. We are building an independent, democratic state,\" Bagapsh was quoted by Georgian news agencies as saying. Speaking to journalists ahead of the meetings Thursday, Steinmeier admitted: \"We don't have any illusions about simple answers, but we cannot stand by without acting on this conflict. That would be irresponsible.\" From Tbilisi, the German minister is to travel to the Black Sea city of Batumi for talks with Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili and then to Abkhazia on Friday before ending his three-day tour in Moscow. Most citizens of the breakaway republics have been issued Russian passports and over 2,500 Russian peacekeeping troops patrol the region under a UN ceasefire agreement. In opposition to Georgia's bid to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Russia moved to strengthen diplomatic ties with the breakaway regions sharply aggravating tensions with the Georgian leadership in recent months.",
        "generated_story": "A New Peace Plan for the Separatist Regions of Tbilisi, Abkhazia and South Ossetia Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Bagapsh has proposed a new peace plan for Georgia. The new plan would include the creation of two independent regions in the former Soviet republics, with the goal of reunifying the two regions after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. It would also include a return to democracy for all Georgians, including those who had been living in exile in Russia since the fall of Soviet-backed Georgia in 1989. But it would not be the first time that the new region would have to be partitioned into two separate regions. \"We are not going to allow this to happen,\" the Foreign Ministry said in a statement, adding that \"we will not allow it.\" The proposal would be based on an agreement between the Georgian government and the Russian Federation, which has been in power since 1991, and which was signed by President Mikhail Saakashvili and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev in 1994. In the past, the conflict between Russia and Georgia had led to a series of violent clashes between Georgian and Russian forces. Since then, however, tensions have escalated. On Tuesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that he would step down from his post as foreign minister in order to take over the role of foreign affairs minister. He also said that Russia would no longer be a guarantor of Georgia's future, but that it was willing to work with Georgia to ensure that its future was secure. Russia has said it will continue to monitor the situation in Georgia, as well as in other neighboring countries, such as Russia, Iran and North Korea. Moscow's foreign ministry said on Tuesday that Moscow was ready to make a deal on the future of Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan. However, it did not rule out the possibility of a conflict in Syria. According to the Kremlin, \"Russia is prepared to do whatever it can to prevent a situation like this from ever happening again.\" Russia is also ready for a possible peace deal between Georgia and Russia. Putin's spokesman, Sergei Lavrov, told RIA-Novosti news agency that his country's new foreign policy was \"very much in line with what we have been talking about for some time now.\" \"It's a very difficult situation,\" he said, referring to an ongoing dispute between Moscow and Moscow over who should be allowed to rule the region. Tensions have also been rising in parts of southern and eastern Ukraine, according to Russian state media, where the government of President Ilham Aliyev, who was elected in 2014, has repeatedly denied any involvement in any such conflict, saying he had no knowledge of it. His comments came in response to questions about whether he was aware of any possible conflict with Russia in his own country and whether Russia had any plans to intervene militarily in that country. Lavrov also called on Russia not to interfere in Ukraine's internal affairs, calling for an end to its military intervention in Crimea, a move that has raised fears of an escalation of tensions between Russian and Georgian troops. Russian officials have said they have not seen any signs of Russian meddling in this conflict and that they are \"not prepared for any kind of conflict.\" Moscow has also rejected the idea that Georgia could become a \"part of Russia\" again, accusing it of being an \"interventionist state\" in its own right. This is not the case, though, of course, because Russia doesn't have the right to meddle in politics. For example, Russia does not recognize the independence of Crimea as part of its territory and has not recognized the territorial integrity of that territory. That's not a problem in itself, since it is an independent state. What is the point of this plan? It is a matter of time before Russia decides whether or not it wants to impose its will on Georgia or whether it has the power to act unilaterally. If it does, then Russia will have no choice but to use its influence to influence the outcome of negotiations. There is no doubt that there will be an attempt to find a way to resolve the crisis. And that's something that is very important for Russia to consider. After all, this is what the current situation is all about, right now, in terms of Ukraine and Ukraine. At the same time, there are a lot of things that need to change. One thing is for sure: Russia won't be able to control the border between South and East Asia, so long as it continues to have a strong presence in eastern and southern regions, especially in areas that are still under the control of separatist forces, like the North Caucasus. So, what is Russia doing? Russia can't intervene in these areas, at least not at the moment. Nor can it do anything to stop it from doing so. Last week's meeting between Putin and President Petro Poroshenko in Moscow, for instance, was an important step toward the end of his term in office. President Putin has called for talks with Moscow to try to reach a solution to this problem. A new negotiations with"

        "target": "Bayern's Klinsmann Praises, Hoeness Attacks Hoffenheim The Bundesliga's two top teams don't play until Friday, but the mind games are already underway. Bayern's coach Juergen Klinsmann says Hoffenheim are legitimate contenders, but commercial manager Uli Hoeness disagrees. When the Bundesliga scheduled Bayern's home match against Hoffenheim in the league's unloved Friday night slot, they probably didn't imagine that it would turn out to be the match of the first half of the season. Indeed, few experts or fans thought that Hoffenheim, a first-division debutante located in a southern German village with 3,000 inhabitants, would give mighty Munich a run for its money. But it's the first week of December, and Hoffenheim top the table by three points. They also have a much better goal difference than their second-placed rivals -- and that has drawn praise from Bayern's coach, Juergen Klinsmann. \"I have the highest estimation of Hoffenheim because they've built the squad very ambitiously, rationally and with very good players,\" Klinsmann told DPA news agency. \"They can be proud of that.\" Klinsmann said he thought that the club could establish itself among the top three or four sides in Germany in the years to come and qualify for international competition next season. He also had words of praise for Hoffenheim's software billionaire patron, Dietmar Hopp, whose money has funded the club's ascent. \"There's nothing negative about it,\" Klinsmann said. \"He used to play for the club, is a soccer man through and through and helped the team get on its feet.\" Some fans have criticized Hopp and Hoffenheim for paying inflating salaries and luring talent away from other clubs instead of developing homegrown players. In fact, Hoffenheim's official salary budget is about average for the Bundesliga. Hoeness sounds his horn But while Bayern's coach was praising his opponents to the skies, Munich's commercial manager Uli Hoeness has been trying to play with their heads. On the heels of Bayern's convincing win over Leverkusen last weekend, Hoeness is back to taunting rivals. \"The performance we showed in the second half against Leverkusen will be enough against Hoffenheim,\" Hoeness told the German soccer magazine kicker. Hoeness also dropped a none-too-thinly-veiled hint that Hoffenheim's personnel expenditures were far higher than the officially released figures and scoffed at the idea that strategy would determine the outcome of Friday's match. \"Games are decided by the better players, not by tactics,\" Hoeness said. \"And of course, we've got better players than Hoffenheim.\" But that particular verbal attack may represent some wishful thinking of the manager's part. Hoffenheim coach Ralf Rangnick is one of only two current Bundesliga skippers with a winning record against Munich. Rangnick, whose team cruised past Bielefeld last weekend to keep Bayern three points back, reacted to Hoeness' remarks with a shrug. \"We're preparing for Munich exactly the same way we did against Bielefeld,\" Rangnick said. In any case, soccer fans in Germany know what they'll be doing Friday evening -- finding a bar with cable sports television to watch a top match that no one, before the start of the season, would have considered possible.",
        "generated_story": "Hoffenheim's Commercial Manager Reacts to First Half of the Bundesliga Season The Bundesliga's commercial manager has reacted to the first half of this season's Bundesliga season with a statement. \"We are very happy with the way we have started the season,\" said Ralf Rangnick, the club's chief commercial officer, in an interview with German newspaper Der Spiegel. He added that he was \"very happy\" with how the league has turned out so far, adding that the team's success has been \"a great success.\" \"It's been a great season for us,\" he said, referring to his first season in charge at the helm of a club that has struggled to find the right balance in recent years. But he also pointed out that there is still a lot of work to be done in terms of marketing and promotion, particularly in the transfer market, as well as the recruitment of new players and new faces. The team is also looking to strengthen its squad, with Uli Hoeness set to take part in a number of training sessions on Wednesday and Thursday, and the squad is expected to have a strong squad for the upcoming Bundesliga campaign. Hoffenerheim have already announced that they will be bringing in new coaches and a new technical director, Raff Rangelnick. Rangingnick said that his team would be working hard to get the best out of their new coach Juergen Klinsmann, who was brought in as their first-choice coach in 2014. H\u00f6ness said he had been impressed with his ability to work with young players, but that it was difficult for him to make the most of his time at Leverkusen, where he spent the last two seasons as a youth coach at Bielefeld. On the other hand, he added, \"I think we are going to do a good job of working with youth players,\" and that's what I'm looking forward to. In addition to that, I think that we will also be able to bring in some new talent, which is something that is very important to us. We are also very excited about the prospect of having a young player in our squad who can contribute to our team and be a key part of our future success. I can't wait to see what the future holds for our young squad.\" The club has already made several changes to its roster, including the addition of young striker and midfielder Uwes van der Merwe (pictured above), who is now in his second season as head coach of Bayern Munich's youth team. Vidal, however, has not yet made an official announcement about his plans for his new team, saying he will not be making any decisions until he is fully fit to play in Germany. Last season, Hoffenheimer were relegated from the top flight of German football, after losing to Schalke and Bayern last season. However, on the pitch, they have been in good form, having won three consecutive Bundesliga titles and drawing two draws in their last four matches. At the same time, there were also a handful of games in which they had a chance to win a Bundesliga title. That was not the case last year, when they lost to Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach and Hannover 96. This time around, though, their chances of reaching the Champions League final were not as good as they were hoped for. With the exception of one match, Bayern have managed to reach the quarter-finals in only their second Bundesliga appearance in three seasons. They are still in contention for a place in Europe's top division, although they face a tough task to achieve that goal. Bundesliga leaders Bayern are the only team that have yet to qualify for next year's World Cup and are currently in danger of missing out on a spot in Group E. Bayern's squad will have to wait until the group stages of next season to decide whether they want to go through the qualification phase. After all, it's still only a matter of time before they can make a decision on their next coach, Jupp Heynckes, is due to step down in January. If they do, then they'll need to improve their squad in order to avoid a relegation battle. For now, this is a difficult task for them. It's not easy, because they've already lost a few key players to come back into the starting lineup. And they're still not quite ready to give up their best chance of winning the title, despite the fact that their current coach is already a very good coach. Nevertheless, that doesn't mean they don't have the resources to keep up with their plans. A few of them are already struggling to stay on top of things, too. Their new manager, former Bayern coach Jens Meyer, said on Tuesday that \"we are not ready for that. There's no doubt about it.\" He also said they are looking for new signings to help them get their feet under them, especially if they decide to stick around for another year.

        "target": "EU risks taking sides in Polish dispute, says deputy foreign minister The European Commission has launched an unprecedented procedure to review Poland's rule of law. The move has been questioned by officials, with some saying it places the EU at-risk of taking sides in an internal dispute. The European Commission's decision to launch the rule of law procedure on Warsaw puts the EU's executive institution at-risk of taking sides, Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Konrad Szymanski told reporters in the European Parliament. \"I have the impression that the [European] Commission risks taking a role as a side in a political dispute inside Poland,\" Szymanski noted. On Wednesday, European Commission Vice President Frans Timmermans - a former Dutch foreign minister - announced the move, marking the first time the EU has used the mechanism. Timmermans said that the move was aimed at entering \"into a dialogue with the Polish authorities, to clarify the facts in an objective way and help find solutions if necessary.\" He added that the procedure is focused on seeking answers regarding the new right-wing Polish government's actions not to apply two judgments by the country's constitutional court, and the reasons behind the president and vice-president's terms were shortened. Preserving rule of law However, Poland's deputy foreign minister said that the European Commission was informed of the reasons behind the government's actions. \"We would insist that the questions are phrased precisely because we have provided much information to the Commission in recent days and we are not entirely clear as to what the Commission is still not clear about,\" Szymanski noted to reporters at the European Parliament. New media laws, giving the government the power to hire and fire senior figures at state broadcasters, were also called into question by Timmermans. The controversial legislation prompted mass pro-democracy protesters in the European country. \"The rule of law is one of the EU's fundamental values. Making sure the rule of law is preserved throughout the Union is a key part of the European Commission's responsibilities,\" Timmermans wrote on his official Facebook page. The Rule of Law Framework was created two years ago as a response to criticism that the 28-nation bloc had not adequately responded to possibly-authoritarian moves taken by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban during his tenure. ls/jil (Reuters, AFP, dpa)",
        "generated_story": "European Commission risks taking sides in Poland's political dispute The European Commission is considering whether to intervene in a dispute between Poland and Hungary over the future of the European Union, Frans Timmermans has said. The EU's top diplomat, Konrad Szymanski, said on Wednesday that it was considering intervening in the country's ongoing political crisis. \"We are not going to take sides,\" he told reporters in Brussels, adding that the Commission would not intervene until the situation was resolved. Hungary, Poland, Hungary and the Netherlands have all rejected the proposal, which would have put the EU at odds with the government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who has been in power for more than a decade. Poland has repeatedly rejected calls for a referendum on the bloc's membership, saying it would be a \"disaster\" if it did not take place. On Wednesday, the Polish Foreign Ministry said it had decided not to participate in any referendum, citing a lack of coordination between the two countries. According to the ministry, it will instead take part in negotiations with Poland on a new EU-wide agreement on how to resolve the dispute. It also said that Poland would continue to cooperate with EU member states in their efforts to find a solution to a long-running dispute over EU membership. In the past, EU leaders have taken a number of tough stances against Poland over its continued involvement in international politics. For example, they have called on Poland to step down as a member state, but have refused to do so. They have also called for the withdrawal of all EU ambassadors from Poland until a deal is reached between them and Poland. This is the second time in less than two years that Hungary has asked for an extension of its membership in Europe's single bloc. Last week, Hungarian Foreign Minister Kostas Zemlianicz (pictured above) said Poland should not interfere in its internal affairs. He added: \"Poland is not the only country that should be involved in this dispute, and we have to make sure that we do not allow it to happen again. We will not let this happen.\" Poland is currently embroiled in an ongoing dispute with its EU partners over whether it has the right to vote on its future as part of a bloc that includes the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Japan, China, Russia, Turkey and China. At the same time, there is a growing sense of unease among EU citizens about the possibility of an EU withdrawal from the region. There is also concern that this could lead to an escalation of tensions between EU countries and other countries, such as Russia and Iran, that could further destabilize the continent's relationship with Russia. That is, if Poland doesn't withdraw from NATO and its allies, then it may not be able to get out of this mess. But it is unlikely to be the first time that such a move will happen, given the current political situation in Ukraine, where the Ukrainian president, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, has made it clear that his country has no intention of withdrawing its support for EU members. Orban's government, however, is in no position to back down from its stance on this issue, according to foreign ministers and diplomats who have met with him in recent weeks. A spokesman for Orbans said he was not aware of any plans to withdraw his support. However, he did say that he had no reason to think that a decision was imminent in light of recent developments in relations between Ukraine and Russia in which the latter's president was accused of violating EU sanctions against Moscow over Ukraine's annexation of Crimea in 2014. Both countries have said they are prepared to accept the terms of that agreement and that they will continue their cooperation with Moscow in future, despite the fact that Moscow has not yet made any formal request to cancel the deal. Meanwhile, a Polish foreign minister has also expressed concern about a possible EU move to impose sanctions on Moscow, accusing Moscow of trying to influence the outcome of elections in Russia's eastern neighbor's elections next month. Moscow is expected to retaliate against the move, as well as other European countries that have been criticized by the Kremlin for not doing enough to prevent it from happening. Russia has accused Poland of being a victim of Russian interference in elections, while Moscow denies the allegations. Ukraine is one of several countries which have accused Russia of attempting to meddle in European elections this year, including the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Slovakia, of meddling in Ukrainian elections. And it's not just Russia that has raised the issue of whether Moscow will intervene, either. Russian President Vladimir Putin has denied the accusations that Russia is meddling and said Moscow's actions were \"unacceptable.\" The Russian ambassador to Poland was also critical of Moscow on Tuesday, when he spoke to reporters at the end of his visit to Moscow. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the Russian president's visit was aimed at preventing Moscow from interfering with a planned meeting between Moscow and Moscow to discuss the matter. Putin's spokesman told the press conference in Warsaw on Monday that \"Russia is likely to continue its involvement. I think the Russians are also"

        "target": "Turkey, Greece seek NATO mission in Aegean, says German official Germany, Greece and Turkey will ask NATO to approve a maritime surveillance mission in the Aegean to combat illegal people smugglers. Greece had previously voiced reservations about the proposal. The proposed mission to be discussed at a NATO defense ministers meeting in Brussels on Thursday comes days after German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutolgu said they would raise the issue of refugees with the Alliance. According to a Reuters report citing a senior German official, initially reticent Greece has now given the green light for the operation, which could see NATO assets deployed in the Aegean in a mostly intelligence and reconnaissance role. Under the proposal, which would need to be approved by Alliance members, NATO maritime assets would provide information to national coastguards and the EU border agency Frontex to combat illegal smugglers using rickety boats to bring migrants to Europe. Turkey would then take back the refugees, as envisioned as part of a 3 billion-euro ($3.2 billion) EU-Turkey deal agreed to last year. According to German sources, the mission would not be similar to the NATO mission in the Mediterranean intercepting migrant boats making the dangerous run from Libya to Italy. However, NATO ships could intervene in emergency situations to save passengers. \"It is not NATO's remit to push back or stop refugee boats,\" the official told Reuters. The mission would use assets from the Alliance's standing naval group, a permanent reaction force deployed in the Mediterranean. The naval group's current flagship is the German combat support ship \"Bonn.\" Denmark has already said it would provide additional ships to the mission, according to the official. However, it is unclear whether NATO members will approve the mission which may fall outside the bounds of the Alliance's mandate. Complicating matters is a long-running maritime dispute between Greece and Turkey over sovereignty in the Aegean, where the two NATO members' jets regularly engage in dogfights. Turkey has taken in more than 2.5 million Syrian refugees, and is a major transit point for migrants from Asia and Africa. More than a million migrants and refugees reached Europe last year, many making the dangerous boat journey from Turkey to Greece by boat. So far this year, more than 340 have perished in the cold waters trying to reach Europe. cw/msh (AFP, dpa, Reuters)",

The deployment is part of a NATO-led effort to tackle illegal smuggling across the Mediterranean Sea. Frontex, the European Union's border agency, said on Wednesday that it would deploy troops to the border with Syria and Iraq. \"We are going to be there until the end of the month,\" the German Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutolgu said in a statement, adding that the deployment would be a \"significant step forward\" for the alliance. He also said that NATO would continue to work closely with Turkey to prevent the flow of migrants and refugees into Europe. Germany, France, Britain, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands have all joined NATO in its efforts to fight illegal immigration. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is NATO's head of mission in Europe, has called for an end to illegal migration to Turkey, which has been a major source of tension between the two countries for years. Last year, Germany and France launched a joint operation to stop illegal migrants from entering the country. Turkey's military, however, did not respond to requests for comment, saying it was too early to make a decision on whether or not to deploy the troops. In the meantime, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said he would not allow any migrants to enter Turkey without a permit. According to Turkish officials, Erdogan's decision was made in response to a request for information on the situation in Syria. Erdogan, meanwhile, called on Germany to step up its role in fighting the illegal influx of refugees and asylum seekers from the Middle East and North Africa. But he also warned that Turkey was not ready to give up the fight against the migrants. On Wednesday, Turkey announced it had deployed an additional 1,000 troops, including 2,500 soldiers, to help with the search and rescue of Syrian refugees. However, it also announced that Turkish troops would remain in Turkey until at least mid-January, when they would return to their home country of Syria, where they will be able to take part in an anti-smuggling operation. This is the first time Turkey has sent troops into Syria since the conflict began in 2011, and it is not clear how many of them have been killed or wounded. Turkish military officials have said they have not yet seen any evidence of an attempt by Turkish forces to capture the refugees, but they are hopeful that this will not be the last. They are also hoping for a quick response from Turkey. NATO is also looking for ways to counter the threat posed by the Islamic State (IS, formerly known as ISIS) and other terrorist groups, such as al-Qaeda and IS-affiliated groups in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) in order to deter the spread of IS. EU member states have also expressed concern about the presence of such groups on Turkish soil, as well as the possibility that they could be used as a means to destabilize the region. Some EU members have expressed their concern over the lack of cooperation between Ankara and Ankara, while others have voiced their support for Turkey and its NATO allies. At the same time, some EU countries have criticized Turkey for not doing enough to protect its citizens. For example, EU foreign ministers have accused Turkey of using chemical weapons against its own citizens, a charge Ankara has rejected as \"unacceptable.\" The EU has also criticized Ankara for using excessive force against Syrian civilians, accusing it of violating international law and violating the sovereignty of its borders. Ankara also accused the EU of failing to provide adequate protection to Syrian Kurds, an accusation Ankara denies. It has accused Ankara of trying to use the military as an excuse for its actions against IS, claiming that IS is a terrorist organization. Brussels has responded by saying that Ankara's actions are not a threat to Europe and that \"it is only a matter of time before the Syrian regime is overthrowing the Assad regime.\" Turkey is one of several countries that have joined the NATO alliance, according to EU officials. European officials say they expect Turkey will cooperate with NATO on its mission to retake territory from IS in northern Syria next year. Meanwhile, Russia and Turkey have pledged to cooperate on a number of fronts. Russia, China, Iran and Iran are among those who have launched counter-insurgency operations against ISIS in recent months. Moscow has vowed to retaliate against Turkey if it fails to do so. Europe's EU partners are already working with Ankara to try and prevent any further escalation of tensions between Moscow and Tehran. Berlin and Brussels have agreed to strengthen cooperation with Moscow on this issue, despite the fact that Russia has not done anything to address the issue of human rights violations. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish Prime Minister Yevgeni Kosovar have repeatedly denied the allegations of Russian meddling in Syrian airspace and said it has no intention of doing anything about it. Despite the criticism of Moscow, Moscow is unlikely to act against Russia's involvement in this conflict.

        "target": "Opinion: The pope's impossible mission in Mexico Pope Francis's trip to Mexico is a dangerous mission - a diplomatic as well as political balancing act, one that brings with it enormous expectations. Francis won't be able to meet them, says DW's Astrid Prange. Dead prisoners, disappearing students, refugees shot dead and murdered priests. Mexico has lived through one violent episode after the other. The mood in the nation is explosive. And now this: just a day before the pope is set to arrive, more than 50 people died in the largest prison revolt in the country's history. What meaning does the pope's presence hold on such an occasion? Only one thing is certain: Francis won't be able to resolve the problems of the world's second largest Catholic nation in just a five-day trip. The unrealistic demands placed on him are not something he can fill. Yet the pope carries with him an important message: you don't have to love your enemies but you do need to speak with them. And he's living the example himself by meeting with the Russian Orthodox Patriarch Kirill on a stopover in Cuba on his way to Mexico. Cuba all over again It's sensational! Bannings and mutual ex-communications are ancient history. Nearly a millennium after the split, the head of the Roman Catholic Church and the head of the Russian Orthodox Church are speaking to each other. It's not as if the two will become friends - their positions are far too different. Yet their centuries-old enmity feels out of place and in view of the massive worldwide persecution of Christians, almost unchristian. And both of these church leaders know this. In Mexico, efforts to stem the polarizing forces at play in society have not been successful. The extreme differences between rich and poor are dividing Mexican society. President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto has prioritized economic growth over dialogue with his critics - a group which includes students as well as teachers and union members who regularly protest against government policies. They demand an end to lawlessness and corruption. The presumed murder of 43 teaching students in Iguala in September 2014, a crime which remains unsolved, stands as a symbol of the lawlessness sweeping Mexico. The recent mutiny in a Monterrey jail serves as further proof of the country's shortcomings in regard to human rights and the rule of law. With a visit to Ciudad Juarez and the largest prison in Mexico, Francis will only make that deficiency more transparent. Even the pope of peace has enemies. The route he's chosen to take on his travels through the country has displeased the staunchly Catholic president. A meeting with the relatives of the Iguala victims is therefore hush-hush and participation in a holy mass remains secret. Considering the tense situation in the country, it's still possible that the pope's route will change once again. The church in the pillory Even within his own church, Francis has met with opposition. A meeting he requested with victims from the church's abuse scandal will not take place - a bitter disappointment for many former seminarians who were abused by Marcial Maciel, the founder of the Legion of Christ, and members of his order. It's just one example of how impunity continues even within the church itself. None of the perpetrators have yet to answer for their crimes in court. It appears as though the pope has accomplished more on the world stage than he has brought on reforms to the Vatican. Despite the revolutionary coming together of Cuba and the US and the revolutionary meeting with Patriarch Kirill, the revolution in Rome has yet to materialize. Do you have something to say? Add your comments below. The thread to this editorial closes in 24 hours.",

The Vatican has said that the pope's visit was \"impossible\" and that it would be impossible for him to travel to the country. \"The pope is not going to be able to go to Mexico,\" said Marcial Maciel, a Catholic priest in Monterrey, in an interview with DW. He said he would visit the city in the coming days, but that he had no idea what he was doing there. In the meantime, he said, \"I will be visiting Mexico.\" The pope has also been accused of not being faithful enough to attend the Vatican's annual conference in Rome, where he will meet with Pope Benedict XVI and Pope Juan Manuel V.

On the other hand, the Pope is expected to spend the next few days visiting his hometown of Iguala, near the Mexican border with Mexico City, and visit his wife and two children, Astrid Prange and her husband, Juan Carlos, as well as his family and close friends. They will also be meeting with the head of state, Enrique Pena Nieto, for the first time since the end of World War II, when he is due to return from a trip to Rome in November. But there is still a lot of work to do before he can return to his home country of his birth. It will take a while, however, before the pontiff can make his way back to their home state of Chiapas, with a visit from the Russian Orthodox Church (DRC), which he has long been close to. His visit comes just a few weeks after he visited Mexico and met with President Mauricio Macri, whose wife, Maria, was killed in a car accident in which she was critically injured. Francis was also invited to speak at a meeting of Mexican bishops and lay people in Ci\u00d3\u0080\u0099s town of Tlaxcala on Sunday. According to an official statement, Francis had been asked to leave Mexico in order to \"visit the Holy Land,\" but it was not immediately clear whether he intended to make the trip. Instead, it is likely that his visit would take place at the same time as the visit to Italy, Germany and the United States. That's because the two countries have a long-term relationship. For the past few years, they have been at loggerheads over how to deal with each other. Last year, both countries' presidents had a strained relationship with one another. Since then, their relationship has become strained and strained. One of their closest allies, President Nicolas Maduro, has called for an end to relations between the US and Mexico. Another is President Donald Trump. Both have expressed concern about the relationship between Trump and Mexican President Felipe Calderon (pictured above), who has repeatedly called on the president to step down from his post as a candidate for re-election next year. 'I don't want to lose my job,' said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity. This is a difficult situation for many Mexicans, especially those who do not know what the future holds for their country's future. However, many of them are hoping for a change of government, including the new president. President Trump has vowed to continue his efforts to improve relations with Russia and China, saying he wants to strengthen ties with both the West and Russia. And he's not alone in that regard. Many Mexicans are concerned that Trump's policies will make it difficult for Mexico to get the job done. Some are even calling for more sanctions on Russia, Iran and Iran. Others, though, are more open to it. Most recently, Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, criticized the move by President Xi Jinping. Russia has accused the Kremlin of trying to influence the election in favor of sanctions against Iran, accusing it of meddling in elections. Iran has denied the accusations. Meanwhile, some in Russia have accused Iran of attempting to meddle in election meddling, while others have said it's too early to say whether the sanctions are being imposed on Iran's nuclear program. Moscow has rejected the idea that Iran could be involved in any way at all. So, there's a sense of unease over the possibility of a nuclear deal between Tehran and Tehran. There's no doubt that this is something that will not happen, given the recent tensions between Moscow and Washington. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and Iranian President Bashar al-Assad have also expressed concerns about a possible confrontation with Iran during his government. Putin"

        "target": "US Supreme Court Justice Scalia dies at 79, setting off succession showdown Justice Antonin Scalia, an outspoken conservative and the longest-serving member of the US' top court, has passed away in Texas. President Obama vowed to nominate a successor 'in due time,' despite political opposition. The 79-year old justice died in his sleep, presumably of natural causes, local media reported on Saturday. Scalia was visiting Texas for a hunting trip, and his body was discovered after he failed to appear for breakfast in the resort where he was staying. US President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama extended \"their deepest condolences to Justice Scalia's family,\" White House deputy spokesman Eric Schultz said. Texas Governor Greg Abbott described the conservative justice as a \"man of God, a patriot and an unwavering defender of the written Constitution and the rule of law.\" \"He was the solid rock who turned away so many attempts to depart from and distort the Constitution. His fierce loyalty to the Constitution set an unmatched example, not just for judges and lawyers, but for all Americans,\" Abbot said. Battle for the empty seat His passing is likely to open a new political front between President Barack Obama and the Republican Party, as Scalia's replacement could shift the composition of the court towards a more liberal persuasion. Several Republican lawmakers have already urged Obama to leave the decision to the next president who will be voted in later this year. \"The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court justice,\" Senate Republican majority leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement, referring to the upcoming November general election. \"Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president,\" McConnell concluded. President Obama, however, said he would fulfill his constitutional duty and nominate Scalia's successor \"in due time.\" \"These are responsibilities I take seriously, and so should everyone. They are bigger than any one party,\" he said. Decades of controversy Scalia joined the Supreme Court in 1986, becoming the first Italian-American to serve in the top judicial body. He was nominated by US President Ronald Reagan. Throughout his long carrier, Scalia voted in favor of privacy and protecting defendants' rights, but also against legalizing abortion, same-sex marriage and gun control. He also drew public attention for his theatrical flair and sharpness of tongue, as well as his alleged unwillingness to compromise. In June last year, the nine-person Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage with a five-to-four vote. Scalia, who was in the minority, commented he would \"hide my head in a bag\" if his own name were associated with the decision. He also said that the majority opinion was \"couched in a style that is as pretentious as its content is egotistic.\" dj/jm (AP, Reuters, AFP, dpa)",
        "generated_story": "Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia dies in sleep in Texas The death of Supreme Court Chief Justice of the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, Greg Abbott, has been confirmed as the nation's most conservative justice. \"We are deeply saddened by the loss of our most revered jurist,\" Abbott said in a statement released by his office. Abbott was referring to Scalia's death as \"a tragedy for our country,\" adding that he was \"deeply saddened\" to learn of his death. He said the death was the result of an \"unfortunate event\" in the life of Scalia, who died in his sleep at the age of 80. The court's chief justice, Justice Anthony Kennedy, had been serving as a federal appeals court judge in Washington, D.C. Since Scalia died, the country has seen a number of changes in its judicial system, including the creation of a new bench of justices. Justice Kennedy was one of those justices who had served on the court for more than a century. Kennedy died at age 80, while Kennedy served as his chief of staff. President Barack Obama's successor, Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, was named to fill the vacancy created by Kennedy's sudden death in February. Obama has said he will not seek re-election in 2020, but he has not ruled out a run-off for a second term. In the meantime, he is expected to seek a third term in office, which would give him the opportunity to serve as an appellate judge. His death came just days after his wife, Michelle Obama, announced she was stepping down from her position as US attorney general. She said she would not be able to continue her work as she did when she retired from the federal bench. Scalia was a staunch conservative who supported the Constitution and the separation of church and state. But he had also been an outspoken critic of abortion rights, saying that it was wrong to allow abortion to be allowed in states where abortion is legal. And he also said that abortion should be legal in all cases, not just in cases where it is not legal to do so. That's not the case in this case. It's the first time that a US justice has died from a heart attack, and it's been a long time since abortion was allowed to take place. On Friday, President Obama announced his intention to nominate a replacement for Scalia to replace the late conservative Justice Samuel Alito. Both Obama and Obama have called for an end to abortion in their states, as well as for repeal of Roe v. Wade and other abortion restrictions. They have also called on states to legalize abortion, abortion and contraception in order to protect the rights of people who are terminally ill, such as those who have been denied access to a doctor. Republicans in Congress are also calling for changes to the constitution to make it easier for people to access abortion. Democrats, meanwhile, have vowed to repeal the abortion ban. Republican lawmakers have said they will continue to oppose abortion until they have a chance to change the law. Last week, they voted in favor of repealing the Eighth Amendment, a move that would have made it harder for abortionists to get a vote. Now, Republicans are calling on voters to reject abortion nationwide. Many of them, however, say they want to see a constitutional amendment passed by Congress to end abortion access for women and minorities. Abortion rights are a major concern for many Americans, particularly women, especially those with young children. This is especially true in conservative states like Texas, where there are so many young women who don't have the means to obtain abortions and who do not have legal representation. There's a lot of pressure on Republicans to pass a law that will make abortion illegal. However, there's also the question of whether abortion can be legalized in other states. Some Republicans have expressed concern about the possibility of legalizing abortion on state and federal grounds, with some saying it would be a good idea to try to limit the practice. Others have questioned the wisdom of overturning the Roe decision. One Republican senator, Senator John Cornyn, said abortion could be the most effective way to achieve that goal. Another Republican lawmaker, Sen. Ted Cruz, told reporters that the Republican-controlled Texas Senate is considering a bill to overturn the ban, calling it a \"historic step forward.\" \"I think it will be an important step,\" Cruz said, adding, \"It's very important that we have to move forward with this. I think that's something we can do. We need a change in our constitution,\" he said. Texas is the only state that has the right to have an abortion law, according to conservative media outlets like Breitbart News. Other Republicans, though, are more likely to back down on abortion laws. Senator Ted Kennedy of Arizona, for example, is a Republican who is also a conservative. A conservative Republican Senator from Arizona has also expressed his support for repealing abortion bans. John McCain, an Arizona Republican, voted against the bill, citing concerns over the issue. McConnell said on Thursday that \"it's too late.\" The Texas'says"

        "target": "Commerzbank appoints Martin Zielke as new CEO Commerzbank has named Martin Zielke as its next chief executive officer, taking over from current CEO Martin Blessing on May 1. The 53-year-old will be leading Germany's second biggest lender. After successfully weathering the Great Recession, Commerzbank's board of directors appears to want to signal a continuation in its growth trend with Martin Zielke's appointment as the new CEO as of May 1. Outgoing head Martin Blessing announced last year he would not renew his contract. Zielke had previously been put in charge of implementing reforms in the company's private banking sector following the recession. His restructuring measures attracted 800,000 new customers to the bank and changed the image of the 146-year-old financial institution. The 53-year-old has an illustrious career across several German financial institutions to look back on, having started at the teller of a local branch in 1983. Zielke's crowning achievement The beleaguered German financial institution recorded a profit of more than a billion euros (more than $1.1 billion) last year. It was the first time in five years that Commerzbank had made such profitable gains, which it said would translate into paid dividends for shareholders. A good portion of the yields were achieved by a restructuring and expansion drive of Commerzbank's private banking arm under Zielke's leadership. However, some of that money will go to the German government, as it had to step in and rescue the bank in 2009 to the tune of 18 billion euros ($25 billion at the time) by chiefly acquiring more than 15 percent of the shares, effectively nationalizing part of Commerzbank's operations. ss/jlw (dpa, Reuters)",
        "generated_story": "Commerzbank CEO Martin Zielke to take over as CEO Germany's largest bank is set to announce its next chief executive on Thursday. The German bank has announced the appointment of the country's first ever chief financial officer. \"We are going to be the first bank in the world to do so,\" said Martin Blessing, head of investment banking at Commerz Bank. He said the bank's board would look into the matter, adding that it would be \"very difficult\" to find the right person for the job given the current economic situation in Germany, which is still in its early stages of recovery. But it will be difficult to say for certain what will happen next, given that the company is in a difficult financial position, and that there is a lot of uncertainty about the future of its business model. In the end, the CEO will have to decide whether to stay on or leave the board, he said. Martin B Blessing said on Wednesday that he would remain in his position until the financial crisis was over, but he also said he was not interested in taking over the reins at the same time as the new CEO. According to the Wall Street Journal, a number of senior executives have already said they would like to step down from their positions within the next few months. Blessing said in an interview with the newspaper that Berenberg had been approached by the German finance ministry for a job as a financial adviser, saying he had \"no interest in going into this position at all.\" \"I don't think I would want to go into that position. I think that's a very difficult position to fill,\" he told the paper. A new board of directors has been set up to oversee the firm's future, according to a person familiar with its plans. It is not clear whether this is the case, however, whether the chairman will remain on board or whether he will take on the role of CEO of a bank that is struggling to recover from the Great Recession, or if he'll be replaced by someone who is more experienced and knows what he's doing,\" the person added. Mignon said it was \"not a surprise\" that a new chairman would have been chosen at a time when the stock market was at its lowest level since the crisis began in 2008, when he took over from his predecessor, Jens Stoltenberg, who had stepped down in January 2009. 'I'm very happy that Martin is stepping down,' the banker said, referring to his role as chairman of Deutsche Bank (DBK). \"He's the most experienced person I've ever worked with in my entire career and I'm looking forward to working with him,\" Besson told Reuters. However, it is unclear if the former CEO would take up the post, as he has no experience in financial markets and has never held a position in banking, banking or finance. His appointment comes after a series of scandals in recent years, including a string of failed mergers and acquisitions, in which he is accused of failing to protect the interests of investors and the banks he once controlled. On Thursday, Bisson confirmed that his company was in talks to buy a majority stake in Deutsche Boerse, an investment bank with a history of investing in German banks and a German-language newspaper, Deutsche Welle, with whom he worked for more than 30 years. That's not the only thing that has changed, though, because the lender is now a major player in Europe's banking industry. There's also the fact that many investors are now looking for someone to run the business, such as Bancroft and Deutsche Telekom (DTK), which has a strong reputation for being a leading lender of financial stability. And there's no shortage of people who are willing to invest in this sector. This is one of those companies that can do that, for example, if they are able to make a profit on their own, that will make it easier for investors to get their money's worth out of their pocket. Businesses are also expected to benefit from this, too. For now, there are no plans to sell their shares, at least not for now. At the very least, they will need to focus on finding a buyer for their stock. If they do, this will give them the opportunity to expand their business and expand into new markets. (Reuters, AP, AFP, dpa, Reuters)Blesson: \"This is an exciting time for us. We're looking to see if we can find a way to turn around the fortunes of German banking and finance companies. You've got to have a good idea of what we're doing, right? You know what I mean? We've already seen the results of this. When you think about it, you can see that we've had a tough time with this company. So, let's take a look at what's going on. What do you know? If you're a banker who's been doing well, then you've done a bit of good things for you. After all along the"

        "target": "A quarter of deaths caused by environmental degradation, says UN A new United Nations report warns that pollution and global warming are causing millions more deaths than conflicts. The UN's environment agency has called for an urgent roll-back on harmful substances and fossil fuels. In its report \"Healthy Environment, Health People,\" the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), the World Health Organization and several other environment organizations said that, in 2012, an estimated 12.6 million deaths were attributable to deteriorating environment conditions. The largest numbers of deaths took place in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific regions, followed by sub-Saharan Africa, where around a quarter of deaths were likely caused byair pollution, chemicals, climate change and a lack of access to sanitation. \"By depleting the ecological infrastructure of our planet and increasing our pollution footprint, we incur an ever-growing cost in terms of human health and well-being,\" said UNEP Executive Director Achim Steiner. He added that humanity's life support systems had been compromised by globalization and powerful economic interests. The report was released during UN climate talks in the German city of Bonn which are drawing up rules pertaining to the Paris agreement, which seeks to lower carbon emissions. The document suggested that several drivers were responsible for the threat to human health, including ecosystem disruption, climate change, inequality, unhealthy and wasteful lifestyles, along with unsustainable consumption and production. Worsening effects UNEP estimated that an extra 250,000 deaths could occur each year between 2030 and 2050 as a result of climate change, leading to malnutrition, malaria, diarrhea and heat stress. Between them air pollution and a lack of access to clean water and sanitation cause almost 8 million premature deaths each year. Environmental impacts are responsible for the deaths of more than one quarter of all children under the age of five, the report states. UNEP called for governments to act to remove harmful substances from working environments, reduce the use of carbon fuels and rely instead on renewable energy, and change lifestyles to allow a more sustainable use of the world's resources. The report also called for a bigger investment to protect the planet's natural ecosystem. UNEP predicted a further increase in emerging zoonotic diseases (spread between animals and humans), and called on developing countries, in particular, to prioritize prevention methods. \"Never before have so many animals been kept by so many people - and never before have so many opportunities existed for pathogens to pass through the biophysical environment and wild animals to livestock and people,\" the report warned.",
        "generated_story": "A quarter of deaths due to environmental degradation in Germany have been linked to climate change, UNEP says. The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Wednesday that the number of people who died in the past two years had risen to a quarter. According to the WHO, more than half of the deaths were caused by the effects of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). The WHO said in a statement that it was \"extremely concerned\" about the increase in deaths from greenhouse gases. \"We are very concerned that we are going to have to do something about it,\" said WHO's Achim Steiner, who heads the UN Environment Program (UNEP) in Bonn, Germany. He also said that there was a \"very high level of concern\" for the health of children and the environment, which he said was the main cause of death in his country. It is not clear how many of these deaths are related to global warming, but it is clear that a lot of them are attributable to human-caused environmental pollution, such as the presence of toxic chemicals in air, water, soil and soil. This is the second time in as many years that people have died from exposure to toxic gases, according to WHO statistics. In the first case, a child died after inhaling toxic fumes from an air-conditioned air conditioner. Other cases were reported in other countries, including France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece and Spain. Some of those deaths, however, were attributed to pollution from the air and water. A WHO spokesman said the agency was not aware of any link between the pollution and human health. However, he added, \"we do not believe that this is an isolated incident, and we have no reason to think that such a situation could be the case.\" The United Nations Environment Programme, an international organization that monitors the environmental impact of human activities, said it had received a report on the issue in 2015. UN officials said they had not been able to determine the exact causes of a rise in human deaths. They said there had been an increase since the 1990s, when the world's largest environmental organization, UNESCO, was formed to combat the problem. But the report did not specify the cause, nor did it say how much of an impact it would have on children's health, particularly those who suffer from asthma and other respiratory diseases, or whether it could have had a direct impact on their lives. That said, it did acknowledge that many people were suffering from health problems, especially those with asthma, because they were exposed to hazardous gases and had to be treated for them. There were also reports that children were being treated at hospitals, schools and hospitals. And there were reports of injuries to their mothers and fathers, as well as those of their children. These reports came as a result of poor hygiene and a lack of access to adequate medical care for children, health workers and their parents. At the same time, many children suffered from poor nutrition and were unable to get to school, leaving them without food, shelter and proper nutrition. Many children died because of inadequate nutrition, while others were left to fend for themselves, experts said. For example, one study found that one in five children was born without adequate nutrition in their home country of Germany, where the average age of one child was 16 years old. Another study, published last year, showed that 90 percent of newborn babies died at birth, after being born prematurely. Experts said this was an indication that child mortality was rising, given the high rate of infant mortality in Europe, Africa, Asia, Latin America and Asia. One study suggested that about one-third of babies were born in countries with high levels of obesity and diabetes, with the exception of China, Japan and India. Germany is also among the countries that have the highest rates of childhood obesity among children under five years of age. France has been the most affected by this trend, saying it's the only country with a high obesity rate, followed by China and Japan. Meanwhile, France and Germany are the third country to report that its children are suffering the worst from obesity, diabetes and high blood pressure. Both countries have also reported that they have seen a drop in obesity in recent years. Europe has also experienced a decline in its child-weighted children who are now in school and have a low birth rate. Despite this, there is no evidence that obesity is a major cause for obesity. So, what can be done to prevent obesity? It's not easy to blame the obesity epidemic, says one expert who has studied the disease. What can we do to reduce the burden on our children? If we can't find a cure, we need to make sure we don't become obese. We can only hope for a better diet. I'm not sure what we're doing to improve the quality of life in our own country, I think it will be a good place to start a family. You can read more about this in this article.

        "target": "Opinion: Yet another crisis for Merkel A summery turquoise blazer and fresh makeup could not hide the fact that Angela Merkel was \"not amused.\" Now she is needed as a champion in the fight against populist forces, DW's Kay-Alexander Scholz writes. Britain-EU divorce proceedings will probably last about two years. Until then, the status quo must be maintained, German Chancellor Angela Merkel emphasized in her press statement. If she is no longer chancellor after the upcoming parliamentary elections in 2017, then others will have to live with the consequences of Brexit. But that is not what she is actually thinking. It is not coincidental that foreign ministers and government leaders are visiting Berlin in the coming days. They want to discuss how things will continue. Berlin, under Merkel's chancellorship, has become a center of power outside of Brussels. Difficult international politics The Brexit decision has disrupted Europe's equilibrium. Germany has lost an important ally on European issues related to economic growth and budgetary discipline. Now, France presumably will be the next to raise its voice against Maastricht Treaty criteria. If the Netherlands and Denmark also decide to leave the EU, Germany will become isolated, as Eastern Europe is not as tight with Germany as it once was. Poland now plays a key role for the Balkan nations and the Visegrad Group (Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic and Slovakia). And Poland is still annoyed about Merkel's refugee policy. What about Germany's populists? They're giddy with glee as they feel that their anti-establishment policies have been validated. They are teaching potential AfD (Alternative for Germany) voters a lesson: \"Here, have a look: it's possible. There is always an alternative. Vote for us!\" Those are exactly the words that protest voters want to hear. Germany's AfD has forged ties with other right-wing parties in Vienna, Paris, The Hague and London. They are all pursuing a \"European\" plan to gain power. The recent Austrian presidential election was significant, as the populist candidate lost by a very narrow margin; in fact, the final election results are still undecided as they are being contested. The Brexit vote was also triggered by populist powers. Domestically difficult Many populists believe that the stronger populism becomes - no matter where - the more advantages there would be for individual parties of their persuasion. Many would also like to see Donald Trump as US president. That is how AfD may become even stronger in Germany, which also means that political majorities would fluctuate even more. Will there be enough seats after the next election for a Christian Democrat and Green coalition, or will yet another grand coalition made up of Christian Democrats and Social Democrats be formed? Can Angela Merkel change course? Can she counter the trend with a new political model in Europe and Germany? Or do we stand on the edge of a new era, a \"political revolution,\" as the AfD calls it? Until now, Europe has survived attacks on its currency (euro crisis), the principle of peaceful coexistence (Crimea crisis) and its open borders policy (refugee crisis). Merkel deserves credit for defending these values, despite mistakes that have been made along the way. The outcome of the Brexit crisis is, however, still open. Have something to say? Add your comments below.",

The party's leader, Kay-Alexander Scholz, told DW that he was \"very concerned\" about the future of Europe. \"I am very concerned about Europe's future,\" he said, adding that his party would not be able to take a position in the European Union without the support of other parties. He said that the party was not ready for a change of government, but that it would be willing to work with the EU to find a way out of the current political crisis. But he added that there was still a lot of work to be done in order to make sure that Germany was a better place to live and work than it is now. In the end, he pointed out, \"We are not going to give up on Europe, we are committed to Europe and we will continue to fight for the interests of our people and for our country.\" The new party, the Green Party, was founded by former German Chancellor Angela Merkel in 2005. It has since grown to become the largest party in Germany, with more than 1,000 members, and it has won a number of seats in parliament in recent years. However, it still has a long way to go before it can become a party of its own, as the Social Democrats (SPD), the main opposition to the new government in Berlin, have been unable to form a coalition government since the election of Donald Trump as US president in November. And it's not just the SPD that is struggling to get a foothold in German politics. There are also the Greens and Greens, which have also been in opposition for years, who have called for an end to Merkel's rule of law. They say that she should be allowed to rule the country, not the other way around, because she is the head of her own party and they want to keep her in power for as long as possible. That is, until the next election, when they will have to decide whether or not to run for re-election. For the first time in their history, they are calling on voters to vote for their own candidate, rather than for her to stand down. This is not a new position for them, of course. After all, there are many other European countries with similar policies, such as France, Germany and Italy, where they have a majority of voters in both the French and German parliament. So, what do you think? What are you hoping to see? Read more: Germany's new populist party aims to change the way Europe is governed by a single party - the Christian Democratic Party (CDU) - in a bid to win back voters who voted for Merkel as Chancellor of Germany in 2015. If the CDU does not win the presidency, Merkel will be forced to step down from her post as party leader next year, according to a report by the German daily Die Welt (DWD) in The Hague. She is also expected to seek a second term in office in 2017, after which she will take the oath of office as chancellor. Her party has already lost its parliamentary majority in several European Parliament elections this year. On Sunday, she said she would seek to strengthen her position as a member of parliament, while also seeking a third term as prime minister. Merkel has said her party will not stand for another two years as she seeks a fourth term, saying she wants to stay in government until she has the chance to elect a successor to her father. What's next? How will the left-wing party react to Trump's election victory? The SPD's stance on the matter is unclear, however, at the moment. Many of them are in favor of a more moderate approach to politics, including the right to govern - and that's a good thing, given that many of their members are from the center-left, right-leaning parties in other countries, like the United States, France and Germany. Some of these parties have already said they would support the president's candidacy. Meanwhile, many others have expressed concern about how the US-EU relationship with Germany could be affected by Trump and his policies on immigration and other issues. These include the rise of populism, immigration, migration and immigration. Germany has been one of several countries that have seen a rise in populist parties, particularly in its rightwing coalition of parties that are opposed to globalization and globalization. At the same time, some of those who support Trump have voiced concern over the possibility of Trump becoming president. With the exception of Austria, this is an area that has experienced a resurgence in popularity, in which the Left has gained a significant amount of support from within the ruling coalition. How can this be achieved? \"The Left's position is that we need to do something about it,\" Merkel said in an interview with DW, referring to their support for Trump. We have not yet seen any signs of change in this regard. I'm not sure what to expect from Chancellor Merkel, for example, that this week"

The lockdown was lifted by the Pentagon, which said in a statement that the incident was an isolated incident and that no one was injured. Officials said the lockdown had been lifted because of the threat of an imminent attack by an unknown assailant. \"There was no threat to the public,\" Obama said at a news conference in Washington, D.C. in response to a shooting at Joint Base Andrews. He also said that there were no reports of any injuries. Obama was briefed on the situation and said he would not comment further until the investigation was complete. In the meantime, the White House said Obama would meet with military officials to discuss the matter. According to Obama, \"we will continue to monitor this situation closely.\" The president also spoke to reporters after the shooting, saying that he was \"deeply concerned\" about the possibility of a terrorist attack. However, he did not say whether the attack was related to terrorism or whether it was a case of mistaken identity. On Friday, Obama visited the base, where he has been stationed for the past three years, and met with the military's chief of staff, Vice President Joe Biden. During the visit, President Obama spoke about \"the importance of protecting our troops and our allies\" in the Middle East, Africa, Asia and Latin America. Biden also called for a \"strong response\" from the United States to prevent a repeat of last year's deadly attacks on US troops in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and Yemen. US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Saturday that \"there is no danger to our soldiers, our people, or our country at large.\" \"We will not allow any further attacks,\" he said, adding that it would be \"a matter of time before we have a clear picture of what is going on in this country,\" which has seen a number of deadly incidents in recent years. Last week, a gunman opened fire on a military training base near the Maryland border, killing two soldiers and wounding three others, according to Pentagon spokesman John Kirby. A spokesman for Obama told reporters that an \"active shooter situation\" was under investigation, but that officials had no reason to believe that a civilian was responsible for an attack, Kirby said. Reuters, AP, AFP, Reuters and the Associated Press were not immediately able to confirm the report. President Donald Trump has called on military leaders to step down from his post as US defense secretary, following a series of events in which the president has spoken out in support of his administration's efforts to protect the country's troops. His comments came after a day of military exercises in Iraq and Afghanistan that have seen thousands of troops deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq. At the same time, US Secretary of State John Kerry has also condemned the attacks, calling them \"an act of terrorism.\" Obama also praised the response by military commanders in his first visit to Washington since taking office in January, when he visited Afghanistan. But he also expressed concern over the recent spate of attacks by Islamic State (IS) militants, who have claimed responsibility for several attacks in Europe and North Africa. Both Obama and Biden have said they have not seen any such attacks since he took office. They have been briefed by Pentagon officials, however, on what they believe to be a lack of information about what has happened in Syria. While Obama is expected to visit the site on Sunday, his spokesman, John Carney, said there will be no further comment on whether he will attend the event. Meanwhile, military spokesman Brigadier General John Kelly said military personnel will remain on leave until a decision is made on how to respond to an incident involving an IS-linked militant group and a suspected terrorist group. Carney said \"it is very important to me that we do not have any information on this incident that could lead to further escalation of tensions between the two countries,\" referring to what he called the \"war on terror\" that has taken place. NATO Secretary-General J. Edgar Hoover said last week that US forces are preparing to take action against ISIS militants and other terrorist groups, including the Taliban, in an interview with The Washington Post. John Bolton, head of NATO's Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the newspaper that Obama's trip to Iraq was not an attempt to \"ensure the safety of US soldiers. I think it's a good opportunity to reassure the American people that this is not the first time we are going to have to do so. It's not clear what the next step is. We are still working to find out if there is any imminent threat from IS and IS. There are no indications that IS is planning to carry out its attacks. This is a very sensitive issue, given the current situation. That's something that I'm not aware of at this time. What we know of is the fact that they are not prepared to talk about in any way at all. When asked about it, Biden said it is unclear whether they will"

        "generated_story": "Klaus Staeck Artist and Publisher of \"No Detox Water\" has won an award for his work. The artist and publisher of the magazine has been named the best-selling artist in the country. He is also the author of a series of books on the subject. His latest book, \"The Art of Water,\" is set to be published in October. It is based on a collection of short stories and essays by his friends and colleagues. In the first issue, he won a $1,000 prize for best artist, and the second issue features a short story about his life as a writer and illustrator. According to the book's cover, the story was inspired by the fact that he was able to write a book on water and how it affects the environment. \"It's a story of water,\" he said, adding that \"it's not about water, it's about the water itself.\" \"Water is water. Water is not water.\" The story is told through the eyes of people who have never had the opportunity to read it, but who are willing to pay the price for it. Klaus Stieck Artistic Director, Artisanal, Arts and Crafts, said he is \"very pleased with the success of this book.\" He also said that it was \"a great success\" for the company, which he hopes to expand to include more artists, writers and other artists. But he also added that the title \"no detox water\" is a bit of an oxymoron, because it doesn't give you the chance to see the world as it really is. And it also has the potential to make you feel like you're part of something bigger than you really are. For example, if you were to buy a water bottle, you would have to get a permit from the government to use it for water treatment. You would also need to have a license to sell the product. That would be a huge step up from what you already have in your own home, in terms of quality and quantity. This is the kind of thing that makes you want to go back to your home town and spend the rest of your life there. There is no doubt that this is one of those times when you are going to find yourself in a situation where you have no choice but to live in an environment where water is so scarce and so toxic that you don't even know what to do with it.\" Author: Stefan Klaasen, who works as an artist at the artist's label, says he has a lot of experience in water conservation and has worked on many projects in his career, such as the one he did with his own company in Germany, France, Italy and Spain, where he developed the idea of creating a \"water purification system\" that has helped to reduce the amount of pollutants that can be released into the atmosphere. However, his most recent book was published by a company he co-founded in 2009. KLAASEN is an independent publisher based in Vienna, Austria, with a portfolio of more than 100 titles, including a number of magazines, books and books. Most of these titles have been published since the beginning of 2009, when he first began working on his first book. They are aimed at young people, especially young children, as well as young adults, to help them understand the importance of drinking water in their daily lives. One of his main goals is to create a sustainable water supply for themselves and their families, so that they can have access to clean water when they need it and not be dependent on bottled water for long periods of time. As a result, many people have become disillusioned with water scarcity and water shortages in Europe, particularly in countries like the United States, Europe and Asia. These issues have led to a lack of awareness among younger people about how to protect themselves from water pollution and pollution. So he decided to take a different approach to water use. With the help of some help from his father, Klaus has created a new company called \"KLAOSEN,\" which aims to provide water purifying solutions for people suffering from chronic diseases, diseases and environmental issues. Since then he's been working to improve the quality of life for himself and his family. Now he wants to focus on building a better life and a more sustainable future for their children and grandchildren. I think that's something that will help him to achieve his dream of becoming a successful entrepreneur. After all, I'm not the only one who is interested in becoming an entrepreneur in this field. My father was a chemist and he grew up in Switzerland. When I was in my early 20s he worked for many years, my father and I had a very successful business career. We've been in business for over a decade now and we've had to work with him for a long time to develop a business model for our children. At the end of that time, we're hoping that we can make a positive change in our lives and our families. What do you think he can do? \"I'm very optimistic about this year"

        "target": "Rethinking the term 'honor killing' The murder of 28-year-old Samia Shahid comes less than two weeks after Qandeel Baloch was killed by her brother. The media was quick to report them as \"honor killings.\" We have to rethink that term, writes Gouri Sharma. When news broke that Samia Shahid, a British-Pakistani woman, had been found dead while visiting relatives in Pakistan at the end of July, mainstream media outlets were quick to report it as an honor killing. It was the second time in two weeks that the media had reported a killing of a woman this way - the first being the murder of Pakistani social media star Qandeel Baloch. There are strong similarities between the cases. Both were murdered in places where they would have felt they were at their safest - in their family homes. It's likely they knew their killers - in Baloch's case, her brother has admitted to strangling her, and Shahid's father and cousin have already been questioned. And as more reports emerge about Shahid's death, it's clear that both were killed because they didn't behave in a way deemed acceptable in a conservative, patriarchal society. 'Deeply offensive' term The debate around terminology in \"honor killings\" isn't new, and after Baloch's murder there were members of the media - such as ABC Australia journalist Juanita Phillips - who decided against using the term, calling it \"deeply offensive\" and referring to it as a \"family killing\" instead. And there are outlets, like the Guardian, that already use inverted commas with the word honor. But some commentators argue that more needs to happen if media consumers are to gain a better understanding of the problem. \"I think an important step for the media would be to refuse to give weight to the term 'honor crimes,'\" said UK-based freelance journalist Shehnaz Khan. \"While it is imperative to highlight that these crimes and murders stem from the roots of misogyny and therefore a false sense of 'honor,' there is absolutely nothing but'shame' within them, as murder is nothing but dishonorable.\" \"The word 'honor' can sometimes carry an almost positive connotation that we are inclined to automatically accept just because it's not happening to us, when the reality is, this a huge problem affecting thousands of girls and women across the world,\" she added. Naming the issue But this isn't a view shared by all journalists. Ruby Hamad, a writer at Australia's Daily Life newspaper, said that the first step in dealing with the issue is naming it. \"There are some deeply patriarchal societies that still limit women's freedom according to old tribal concepts of honor, where, unfairly, the behavior of women reflect on their entire family,\" Hamad said. \"By naming these 'honor killings,' we are acknowledging the role that this misogynistic concept of honor plays, not only in the murders themselves but in these entire societies, and how it entraps both men and women.\" Through the eyes of the perpetrator? There are other issues with the term though. Some have argued that by framing it as such, media outlets are showing the crime through the eyes of the perpetrator - and not through the victim - as they should. And with such cases regularly hitting the headlines, framing is important. The United Nations estimates that around 5,000 women - predominantly from Asia and the Middle East - are killed annually in honor-related crimes, a figure that women's advocacy groups say is closer to 20,000 worldwide. This raises an important cultural element for the media to consider - how far does the term play into cultural stereotypes? \"When honor is considered the most important thing in life, then all family members become expendable,\" Hamad said. \"The collective outweighs the rights of the individual. Does this feed into cultural stereotypes? Perhaps. But that doesn't mean we should pretend that this cultural context isn't there.\" Looking for answers - and alternatives There have been many alternatives put forward by women's advocacy groups, including hate crime, misogynistic murder, femicide and shame killings. But which one should we pick? Al Jazeera for one has decided which one they won't use. \"We are always updating our style guidelines to convey a deeper and more authentic understanding of world affairs. Recent events in Pakistan ignited a healthy debate in Al Jazeera on the term 'honor killings' in particular. Our editors are currently studying alternatives to the term, but'misogynistic murder' is not one of them,\" said an Al Jazeera spokesperson. Terminology in the media matters, and for murders as complex as these, it's the media's responsibility to find a name that better fits the crime. Only then will it become easier to work towards a solution.",
        "generated_story": "Rethinking Honor Killings: A Cultural Perspective Read more: Pakistan's 'honor killings' A cultural perspective on the subject of honor killings has been published by the Guardian. It is the first book in a series of essays by journalist Juanita Phillips. The book, \"Honor Killing,\" is set to be published in the next few weeks. In it, Phillips argues that the country's \"honour killings\" have become a symbol of injustice, and that it is time to change the way we treat people. Shehnaz Khan, who was killed in Pakistan in 2008, is one of the few people who has written a book on honour killings. He is also the author of a new book called Honor killing: Honor Killing, which examines the role of honour killing in Pakistani society. According to Phillips, honor killing is a form of punishment for crimes committed by people of different ethnicities. \"It is not acceptable for a person to commit such a crime,\" she writes. Her book is based on her experiences as a child and her experience as an educator in her home country of Pakistan, where she grew up. As a Pakistani, she was raised by her father and had a close relationship with her mother. After her death, the family moved to Australia and settled in Sydney. They have since moved back to the UK, but their relationship has not been as strong as it once was. Their relationship is still strained, however, as they have a long history of violence in their own country. For example, when they were children, they would often be killed by their parents, their relatives, or their friends and relatives. This was the case for many of them. But in this case, it was a case of revenge killing, with the murder of their mother and their father being the victim of an attack on a school bus in Lahore, Pakistan. And it's not just the parents who are responsible for the deaths. There are also those who have been convicted of other crimes, such as rape, murder, attempted murder and torture. These are all cases where the perpetrator was convicted and sentenced to life in prison for their crimes. Many of these crimes were committed in an attempt to protect the lives of innocent people, including those of children who had been murdered by police, soldiers and civilians. However, there were also cases in which the perpetrators were convicted for killing their loved ones. One of those cases involved the death of one person, a young Pakistani man who died in his own home in Karachi in 2006. His father was also convicted in that case and is now serving a life sentence for that crime, according to a report from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). The case is currently being investigated by an Australian court. A Pakistani court is expected to rule on whether or not the charges should be brought against the accused and whether they are guilty of any crime. If the prosecution is found to have violated the law, then it will be referred to as the court of public opinion and the courts will have to decide whether the punishment is appropriate. That would be a huge step forward in terms of justice and justice for all the victims, especially those whose families have suffered the most in recent years. At the same time, many families are still grieving the loss of relatives and friends who were killed during the war. Some families of Pakistani children have also been left traumatized by these killings, while others have expressed their grief over the fact that their children were not spared the pain of being killed. While the Pakistani government has yet to make a final decision on what to do about the killing of this young man, this is an important step in addressing the issue. Pakistan has long been a country that has suffered from a lack of respect for its own people and its people for generations of its citizens. Since the 1990s, people have sought to distance itself from this kind of treatment of young people in order to preserve the memory of all its past victims. Now the government is trying to find a way to remove the stigma of killing children from their families. To do this, we need to take a closer look at what happened to them and what they did wrong. We have already seen a number of cases that have gone unpunished. I think that's a very important part of what we have done. You can read more about this in our book. (Reuters, AFP, AP, dpa) (AFP, Reuters) \"We are not going to give up on Pakistan,\" says journalist Samia Shahid, adding: \"I think we should do the right thing and we will do everything we can to prevent this from happening again.\" She adds: 'We will continue to fight for our children's rights, because we do not want them to suffer the consequences of our own actions.\" \"This is something that should not be allowed to happen again,\" said the BBC's journalist and author, Ruby Hamad, referring to her interview with \"The New York Times\" and other media outlets. What do you think is wrong? Is it a good thing that we are doing? The Guardian"

        "target": "A Brief History of the Seaside Holiday These days, millions take seaside holidays for granted as one of life's pleasures. But 200 years ago, a dip in the sea was more a test of courage. Hardly anyone could swim. As late as the 18th century, many Europeans still thought of the sea as the realm of Satan: storm-tossed and inhabited by terrifying monsters. \"Unlike the mountains, the coasts were terra incognita as a holiday spot,\" says Manfred B\u00e4tje, director of the Bade-Museum on the North Sea island of Norderney. Anyone who set foot in the water was \"stepping into the unknown\". Brighton showed the way That only began to change after the British aristocracy discovered the healing power of salt water. As early as 1780, Brighton, England's biggest and oldest seaside resort, was a bustling spa. Philosopher and physicist Georg Christoph Lichtenberg (1742-1799) of G\u00f6ttingen gave Germans the starting signal with his 1793 essay \"Why doesn't Germany have any large public seaside resorts?\" In it, he called for the creation of a resort in Cuxhaven on the North Sea. He received support from the most notable German physician of the time, the Prussian king's court physician, Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland. But things turned out somewhat differently. Germany's first seaside resort was indeed built in September, 1793, but in Heiligendamm on the Baltic Sea. Four years later, permission was granted for construction of Germany's first resort on the North Sea, on Norderney. \"For the first bathing season on July and August of 1800, only around 250 guests turned up. Now, the nearly 6000 residents host a good 530,000 bathers annually, plus around 230,000 day-trippers,\" B\u00e4tje reels off the figures. Romanticist inspiration In the 19th century, the landscapes of Caspar David Friedrich, such as his famous Chalk Cliffs on R\u00fcgen (1818), gave seaside holidays added impetus. From then on, the sea was no longer a voracious beast. From the shore, the cultivated, modern European contemplated the vast melancholy of the deep. \"The calm sea became an embodiment of unspecified yearning, the waves an expression of vitality and dynamism,\" soliloquizes museum director B\u00e4tje. But the journey to the sea long remained an arduous, time-consuming one. It took the mail coach a good thirty hours to cover the distance from Hamburg to the North Frisian town of Aurich over bumpy, muddy roads. The express cab from Bremen only took about 16 hours to reach the East Frisian town of Norden - including six changes of horses along the way. \"It wasn't comfortable,\" explains B\u00e4tje. Not until the introduction of seaside tourist steamers out of Hamburg and Bremen to the islands and the expansion of the railways did the journey become easier. Strict bathing rules At first, it was primarily the well-to-do bourgeois and nobility who were able to afford a seaside holiday. Victorian-era society is known for its extreme prudishness, and the beach was not exempt. Bathing machines were essentially changing cabins on wheels that could be rolled into the surf. The sexes were kept strictly separated. Wet swimsuits could not be allowed to cling, thus revealing the body's contours. Women sported baggy flannel garments with bloomers underneath that swiftly became waterlogged to where the bather was risking her life. Hardly anyone really knew how to swim anyway. \"Most bathers wouldn't stay in the water any more than two minutes, often just seconds at a time. The English had a rule: 'Three dips and out',\" quips archivist Manfred B\u00e4tje, whose Bade-Museum is housed in a building for a former wave pool, just a few steps from Norderney's Weststrand, where, during the summer months, vacationers sunbathe in wicker beach chairs and on blankets, cooled by a salty sea breeze. Sunbathing first came in style early in the 20th century, and the first true swimsuits were produced in the United States. \"Starting in 1919, today's bathing culture gradually began to take shape,\" B\u00e4tje looks back. At the same time, ideals of beauty were in flux - such as the attitude towards tan skin, which had long been regarded as a mark of farmers and manual laborers. B\u00e4tje: \"People were still cultivating their genteel pallors.\" Water, Waves, Wellness Today, the sun worshipers are the devout masses, and seaside holidays are their pilgrimages. The North Sea resorts alone count some 12.9 million overnight stays annually. Health is once again a primary concern: sea air, sea water, sea salts and the algaes and mud used in",
        "generated_story": "A Brief History of the Seaside Holiday in Germany The Chalk Cliffs on R\u00fcgen are the site of a spectacular seaside holiday in the German Alps. Author: Christoph Lichtenberg and Caspar David Friedrich The chalk cliffs are one of Germany's most famous tourist attractions. It's a place where people can relax and enjoy the sun and the sea. But it's also where they spend their summers. In the winter, people spend a lot of time on the beach. They spend much of their time at the coast, which is one reason why many people come to Germany for the summer holidays. This year, however, there were a number of visitors who came to Bremen to spend time with their families and friends. Many of them were German, but many also came from other European countries, such as the Netherlands, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Spain, Italy and Russia. Some of these visitors were from the Baltic states, while others came mainly from Germany. There were also visitors from Britain and other countries who were visiting the area in search of warmer weather. \"It was a great time of year for German people,\" said the author, who was born in Hamburg and grew up in Cuxhaven. His father, a German-born architect, was also a tourist, and he spent his childhood there. He died in a car accident in his early 20s, leaving his wife and three children with him. The couple had been married for a year when he was 12 years old and had two children. Since then, they have had three sons and two daughters. Their father died when they were young and their mother had to take care of her two older brothers. After the war, their father was forced to leave the family home in order to care for his sick mother. When he returned to the country, he said, \"I had no idea what I was going to do with my life. I just wanted to be able to go back to my childhood and be happy.\" The author also said that he had never seen a sea-side holiday as a child, so he thought it would be a good idea to write a book about it. And he did, in fact, write about his own experiences. As a young boy, his mother was the first person he met on his first day of school. Now he is a father of three, with his two younger brothers and a younger sister. For the rest of his life he has been a part of many German families, including his father and his sister's family. From the time he came home to his family, it was always his dream to visit his parents and have them stay in their home town of Norderney, where he lived for many years. At the age of 16, Hufeland's parents moved to a small town near the Bade-Museum in Hockenheim in northern Germany to escape the harsh winters and to make a new life for themselves. During his time there he worked as an archaeologist, studying the history of German archaeology and archeology. A few years ago he became a professor at a local university in Brighton, learning about the subject of archeological excavations and how to excavate the remains of ancient sites. Then he went on to become a geologist and became an archeologist. Today he continues to work on a research project to find out what he can do to improve the preservation of historic sites around the world. On his last visit to Britain he visited the island of Heiligendamm and found the ruins of an ancient church. Haffeland said he would like to learn more about how the church was built, as well as how it is used to commemorate the anniversary of World War II. 'I am very happy to see that I am not the only one who has lived in this country,' he told the historian, adding that there are many places in Europe that have been visited by people from all walks of life who are still alive and well. However, this is not exactly the case in Britain. That's not to say that they are not aware of what is going on, because they don't know what they're doing there, or why they've been there for so long. What is it that has happened is that the people of this area are so fascinated with the idea of having a culture that is so different from those who have lived here for thousands of years? In his book \"The Seven Wonders of Europe\" he describes how he began his career as \"the first man to discover the wonders of our world.\" He also describes his experiences as being born and raised in Berlin, an area that was once a UNESCO World Heritage site. According to him, that's why he decided to open a museum there in 1882. These days the museum has become an important tourist attraction for people who want to travel to Europe, especially those with a passion for history and culture.

        "target": "Ex-Euro Olympic boss Hickey released on bail in Brazil The former European Olympic Committee president Patrick Hickey - awaiting trial over an alleged ticketing scam - has been released on bail in Rio. The 71-year old can now leave the country for medical treatment. Brazilian judge Juliana Leal de Melo - who serves on a court overseeing amateur and professional sports - authorized the release of Hickey's passport upon payment of 1.5 million real ($435,000) bail. Hickey could now have medical treatment, the Rio state court system said in a statement. Reported to have a heart condition, Hickey was arrested three months ago during the Rio de Janeiro Olympics on ticket scalping charges. He is awaiting trial, though has not been imprisoned. Hickey has denied any wrongdoing. He is one of 10 people facing charges of ticket scalping, conspiracy and ambush marketing related to the Olympics. Hickey said he would fight \"each and every one\u201d of the Rio Games ticket-touting charges he faces. Hickey, who was also the head of the Olympic Council of Ireland, was released from custody last month, but must remain in Brazil until the case is heard. \"For clarity, I am not under house arrest as, like with so many things with this case, has been misreported by the media,\u201d Hickey said in a statement on Monday. Hickey was arrested on 10 August at a luxury beachfront hotel during the games. The authorities told Reuters last week that they believe the ring had operated for around eight years and was preparing for other Olympic events such as the 2020 Tokyo Games. jbh/bw (AP, AFP)",
        "generated_story": "Ireland's Patrick Hickey freed on bail in Rio de Janeiro Olympic Court has freed Ireland's Olympic Council of Ireland (OCI) chief executive Patrick \"Patrick\" Hickey has been freed from jail after being charged in the Rio Olympics. The Dublin-born Irishman was charged with two counts of first-degree murder and one count of attempted murder in connection with the 2014 Olympic Games in Brazil. He was sentenced to three years in prison on Thursday. \"I am very happy that I have been released from prison,\" he said in a statement released by the European Olympic Committee (EOC) on Friday. Hicskey's bail was set at \u20ac1.5 million ($2.4 million) and he is expected to appear in court in Dublin on Monday. His lawyer, Juliana Leal de Melo, told the court that he was not guilty of any crime, but that the charges against him were \"unfounded.\" \"It is a very sad day for Ireland,\" she said, adding that she was \"very happy\" to be freed. She added that \"it is very difficult for me to get out of jail in such a short period of time\" and that it would be \"difficult\" for him to return to Ireland. Ireland is one of the few European countries to have an Olympic-level athlete who has not been convicted of a crime. It is the first time that Ireland has ever been accused of being a member of an international criminal organization, and it is also the second time in as many years that Dublin has had to deal with a criminal prosecution. In the past, Ireland had faced charges of failing to register as a foreign country when it came to the Olympics, which it did in 2002. However, this time around, it was Ireland who was acquitted of all charges, with Ireland being the only country to do so, according to a court document obtained by The Irish Times. On Thursday, the EOC said it had found no evidence of wrongdoing in relation to its decision to extradite the former Irish Olympic council chief to Dublin, where he had been serving a two-year jail sentence for fraud, money laundering and tax evasion. Dublin's chief prosecutor said he would appeal against the conviction, saying he did not have the authority to make a decision on the matter. But he also said the case would not be brought to trial because the prosecution had failed to prove that there was any link between Ireland and the country's criminal activities. 'I have no intention of making a case against Ireland,' he added. A trial date has yet to set for next year's Rio Games, in which the trial is scheduled to take place at the International Court of Arbitration for Sport (ICAS) in Sao Paulo, Brazil, on June 14. Prosecutors have said they will seek a sentence of up to 10 years for the crimes committed during the last two years. They have not ruled out the possibility of trial, however, as they are still awaiting the outcome of that case. Irish President Patrick Healy has also been granted bail and is due back in Ireland on July 1, 2018, after a three-day trial on charges related to his alleged involvement in an attack on a police officer and a man who shot a policeman in his car during a traffic stop at a bus stop near the Olympic Stadium. According to court documents, he has pleaded guilty to all counts, including assault, attempted robbery and attempted kidnapping, for which he faces a maximum penalty of life in jail if convicted in absentia. Court documents also say he will be sentenced on May 19. After the hearing, a judge ruled he should be allowed to stand trial for crimes against humanity and other offenses committed by his countrymen. Following the verdict, prosecutors will decide whether or not to charge him with any charges.

Europe, Asia, Africa and Latin American countries have also condemned the arrests of several athletes and their families in recent months. Many of them have expressed concern over the arrest of two men, who were arrested on suspicion of attempting to obstruct justice. Most of those arrested have pleaded innocent and are being held without bail, while others are due to face trial later this year. Germany and Italy have all been acquitted in this case, although the EU has said that they were not aware of what happened to their athletes.

        "target": "Reports: Merkel to run for fourth term as German chancellor German Chancellor Angela Merkel has confirmed that she will stand for the chancellery in the 2017 election, German media reports. The Christian Democrat Leader (CDU) first took office in 2005. After months of speculation, German Chancellor Angela Merkel reportedly told her fellow Christian Democrats (CDU) in Berlin on Sunday that she is prepared to lead the party into next year's election. An official statement is expected from Merkel at 7 p.m. local time (1800 UTC) on Sunday. The 62-year-old has faced a number of difficulties in recent months, from criticism over her handling of the migration crisis to falling support amid a rise in right-wing populist sentiment. Since taking office in 2005, however, Merkel has also been praised for navigating Europe's largest economy through the financial and eurozone crises. According to an Emnid survey published in the German newspaper \"Bild am Sonntag\" 55 percent of Germans are in favor of Merkel remaining head of the German government for another four years. Thirty-nine percent said they were against her re-election. Sign of stability Should she be elected next September, another full four-year term would put Merkel on a par with her mentor Helmut Kohl who set the post-war record and presided over the Fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. In light of the UK's shock vote to leave the European Union in June and Donald Trump's election last week as US president, Merkel's re-election is likely to be welcomed in many capitals as a sign of stability. During his final visit to Berlin this week, US President Barack Obama said that if he were able to, he would vote for his longtime partner and friend. In an interview with German magazine \"Spiegel\" and broadcaster \"ARD,\" Obama said: \"She has great credibility, and she is willing to fight for those values in a way that is very, very important.\" \"I'm glad that she's there and I think the German people should appreciate her. Certainly, I've appreciated her as a partner.\" Winning back votes With the less that a year until Germany heads to the polls, Merkel's CDU is now turning its efforts to wooing back disenchanted voters who have left the conservative camp to support the right-wing populists, Alternative for Germany (AfD). Formed as a Euro-sceptic party in 2013, the AfD won 4.7 percent of the popular vote in the last federal elections in 2013, just falling short of the 5 percent threshold required to enter the Bundestag - Germany's lower house of parliament. After benefiting from the rise in europsceptic, anti-immigration sentiment, seemingly sweeping across western Europe, the party now holds seats in nine of Germany's 16 states.",
        "generated_story": "Merkel's re-election bid comes amid growing populist sentiment in Germany Chancellor Angela Merkel is set to seek a second term in office. She is expected to win a third term as Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany, a position she has held since she took office in 2009. But she faces a difficult task in the coming months as she prepares to run for a fourth term. German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who was elected chancellor in 2010, faces an uphill battle in her bid to become Germany's first female head of state. The country's conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) face a tough challenge from Donald Trump's populist Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which is seen as an alternative to Merkel's CDU. Merkel, however, has vowed to continue to fight for her conservative policies. \"We are going to keep fighting,\" she said in an interview with the German newspaper Bild am Sonntag, adding that she would \"fight to the end\" for the right to govern. In the past, Merkel has been able to secure a majority of votes in a number of parliamentary elections, including the Bundestag and the lower house of parliament. Last year, she won the most votes of any chancellor since the 1990s, when she was first elected as chancellor. Since then, though, the party has struggled to gain traction with voters, with many of them turning out to oppose her. On Sunday, Chancellor Merkel announced her intention to step down from her post as party leader, following the fall of Berlin Wall in 1989. After a series of failed attempts to form a coalition government, her party is now set for an election campaign in which it will face off against the US, Britain, France, Germany and Japan. It is not yet clear whether Merkel will run again, but it is widely expected that a new coalition will be formed to take over the reins of power from Merkel. Germany is also facing a backlash from the far-right AfD, an anti-immigrant party that has campaigned for years on a platform of social and economic reform. Many of those who have been in power for more than a decade have said that they would like to see a change in government. They have also called on Merkel to stand down as the next chancellor, and to make the country a more stable and prosperous place to live and work in. That would be a welcome change for many Germans, as it would give them a chance to get to know each other better. For the first time in their political history, they will have the opportunity to work together to change the way they think about the future of their country, rather than to be governed by a single party. This could be the case if they are unable to find a way out of a political crisis that is so deeply rooted in German society. If they do, it could make it difficult for them to reach a consensus on what they want to do with their own country and how they should live their lives in order to achieve that goal. There is a growing sense of unease among Germans that the current political climate is becoming too polarizing and that this could lead to a decline in economic growth and a rise in unemployment, especially among young people. As a result, many people have become disillusioned with Merkel and her Christian Democrat Party (CSD), which has lost its majority in parliament in recent years. Some have accused her of being too soft on refugees and migrants, while others say she is too hard on migrants and refugees. However, this has not been a problem for other parties, such as Merkel herself. Her party's support for migrants has also been growing, in part because of her commitment to refugees, asylum seekers and other migrants from other parts of Europe who are fleeing war-ravaged countries, particularly in Africa and Latin America. And it's not just migrants who want a better life in Europe. These migrants are not the only ones who need protection, according to German media, because they don't have a lot of money to pay their way to Germany. A new generation of migrants will also be forced to leave their home country. More than 1.5 million migrants have already left the EU and are now seeking asylum in other EU member states. Most of these migrants come from countries like the United States, where they live in poverty and unemployment are high. At the same time, there are also concerns about migration, migration and migration. With the rise of immigration, that could mean that more people are leaving the European Union and leaving their homes in poorer countries. So far, no one is willing to give up their dream of becoming a member of NATO. What do you think? What are you waiting for? How can you say no to Trump? \"I think that's a very good thing,\" Merkel said on the campaign trail, referring to her comments in Berlin on Sunday. 'I'm very optimistic that we can get a solution to this problem. I think we'll have an easy solution. We'll see what happens when we have more migrants to come back to Europe.\" The German government is hoping that"

        "target": "France's conservatives: Combating the National Front with a swing to the right A staunch conservative is joining the race for the French presidency. Republican candidate Francois Fillon could turn into a big problem for right-wing extremist Marine Le Pen's National Front. France's Republicans are moving to the right: by choosing Francois Fillon, voters nominated a presidential candidate who has a reputation as a staunch conservative. The former prime minister has already announced that he intends to refocus politics with the traditional family in mind. Fillon takes a dim view of homosexual couples adopting children. He wants to introduce a cap on the number of refugees allowed into France, he intends to make it harder for foreign nationals to access the social welfare system, and he wants to put Muslim communities and mosques under government control. In addition, Fillon advocates a renationalization of school curricula. Fillon makes gains in FN territory Fillon's agenda could turn out to be a problem for the \"National Front\" (FN). The 62-year-old appeals to similar sentiments as the right-wing party's base: concern about foreign domination and loss of identity, fear of terrorism and crime. \"For a long time, FN was the only political force that addressed those fears,\" said Henrik Uterwedde of the German-French Institute (dfi) in Ludwigsburg. \"Now a politician has arrived on the scene who addresses those fears using a different language and makes them a political offer.\" In rural, Catholic France especially, where traditions still matter a great deal, the avowed Catholic Fillon strikes a chord with his proposals pertaining to family and society policies. He receives support from traditional Catholic groups who, for years, have been able to mobilize crowds for demonstrations against gay marriage. During the intraparty election campaign, Fillon predominantly traveled to France's villages and small towns - regions which FN leader Marine Le Pen had labeled the \"forgotten France,\" regarding herself as their foremost lobbyist. \"Fillon has made gains in an environment that is also canvassed by Le Pen,\" Andreas Jung, Chairman of the Bundestag's German-French parliamentary group, told German broadcaster rbb-Inforadio. \"He does not represent the lofty levels of Parisian politics, but rather provincial entrenchment. Fillon is committed to traditional values, like the family. Therefore, he may not only be capable of defeating Le Pen, but also of taking the lead during the first ballot.\" 'Most dangerous candidate for FN' Consequently, the FN camp is less than enthusiastic about the conservative's candidacy. \"Because of Fillon, we now have a strategy problem,\" Marion Marechal Le Pen, the FN leader's niece, recently told journalists. \"He is the most dangerous candidate for the National Front.\" Pollsters' findings appear to support that statement. Recent surveys establish Fillon as the current favorite in the French presidential election scheduled for next May. However, Fillon's election is not a foregone conclusion. By denouncing the conservative candidate as a member of the establishment, FN tries to win over those who are frustrated with politics and politicians in general. There is persistent opposition against his economic-liberal plans in particular. Fillon wants to abolish the 35-hour working week and raise the retirement age to 65 years. In addition, he wants to cut 500,000 jobs in the public sector and reform industrial law. Fillon is known as an admirer of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. \"Issues pertaining to liberal economic policy have always been heavily contested in France,\" said Uterwedde. \"Fillon's adversaries have already taken up their positions, criticizing what, in France, is called 'ultra-liberalism.'\" That was one of the nastiest words in French politics, he added. An offer for the left Fillon wants to raise VAT by 2 percent. This would predominantly hurt low-income households. Exactly that clientele, however, is wooed by FN with a program that is regarded as rather left-wing. The right-wing extremists are on a clear anti-globalization course, intending to seal off the French economy against foreign countries and exit from the European Union. The party is already trying to present Fillon as a symbol of anarchic, ultra-liberal capitalism. \"Francois Fillon will even go beyond EU demands for austerity and liberalism,\" David Rachline, Marine Le Pen's election campaign manager, wrote on Twitter. According to current polls, it is very likely that Fillon will have to face Marine Le Pen in a runoff election in May. The main hazard for the Republican candidate: his economic-liberal course could deter left-wing voters from choosing the conservative in order to avert Le Pen. \"Francois Fillon will have to start making offers, also to those voters who are closer to the center and more moderate,\" said France expert Uterwedde. \"And he will, prior to the runoff election at the latest, have to make offers to left-wing voters - without changing his original course.\"",
        "generated_story": "French presidential candidate Francois Fillon is the most dangerous candidate for the French presidential election, according to a poll by the German-French Institute of Political Economy (Rbb-Inforadio) and a leading expert on French politics, Andreas Jung, has said. \"The French president is a very dangerous man,\" Jung said, adding that he believes he has the best chance of becoming the next president of the European Union (EU) in 20 years. He also believes that the current president, who was elected in 2010, will be able to win a second term in office. The poll, which was conducted in the autumn of 2015, is due to be held on Sunday, and it is expected that Fillion will win the first round of voting. If he wins, he will face a tough challenge from the far-right National Front (NFP) candidate Marion Marechal Le Pen, whose party is currently in third place in France's presidential vote. Fonseca, a conservative who has been campaigning in Germany since the 1990s, said he was \"very disappointed\" with the results of last year's election. But he also said that his party would not allow him to run again, saying that it would be \"a disaster\" if he were to lose the election to the right-wing candidate, Marine le Pen. Uterwedde, an expert in political economy at the Rbb Institute in Ludwigsburg, told rbb in an interview published on Friday that \"fillon has a lot to prove in this election.\" \"He's a man of few words, but he's also a person of many qualities,\" he added, referring to himself as \"the father of all politicians,\" and to his father, Jean-Francois. On the other hand, the left-leaning party's candidate is far more likely to make a strong case for a third term as president. In addition to being a staunch defender of democracy and human rights, French President Emmanuel Macron is also known for his tough stance on the issue of women's rights and the rights of minorities, including women, minorities and women. And he is not afraid to speak his mind, as he said in a recent interview with a German magazine, \"Le Monde\" (AFP, dpa) \"I think it's very important for France to have a woman who is willing to stand up for what she believes is right and right,\" said the author of a new book on women in politics. It was written by a French-German-American Institute researcher, Hans-Georg Schaffner, in which he argued that French women should not be allowed to vote for candidates who don't stand for equal rights in their own country, such as those who are against abortion and gay marriage, because they are too young and too old to understand the importance of their right to choose between the sexes. For the second time in three years, Fionn has won the presidency of France and Germany, where he won a majority of seats in parliament in 2012 and 2013, when he lost the presidential elections to Francois Hollande in 2015. That's because of his strong support for women and minorities in his own party and his anti-immigration stance. His party, National National Party (PN) is now in second place behind the Social Democrats (SPD), which is in fourth place, after the Greens and Socialists. However, it has lost its parliamentary majority in recent years and is facing an uphill battle to regain the support of conservative voters in November's parliamentary elections, with polls showing it losing its majority. A number of candidates have already announced their intentions to enter the race, while others are still undecided on whether they will run for re-election. Many of them have expressed doubts about their chances of winning the nomination, however, even if they do not have the votes to do so. So far, there is little sign that they have any intention of doing so, at least not yet. Some of those candidates are expected to take the oath of office, though. They are not going to give up their positions until the end of this year. At the same time, they may be forced to step down from their posts in order to stay in power. There is no doubt that France will have to decide whether or not they want to continue with their current leader, or whether to keep him as their candidate. After all, France is still the only country in Europe that has had a female president for more than a century. This is because the country is one of Europe's most conservative countries, like Germany and France, that is where the vote is being held, rather than the United States, for which it was once held in 2011 and 2012. French voters have been divided over the past few months. Last week, polls showed that voters were split over who would win in June's general election and who will take part in next month's elections. Most of these voters are in favor of Macron's party. Only a handful of people have said they would like to see a candidate who could be given the chance"

Minister wants ban on meat names for plant-based foods Terms like \"vegan sausage\" and \"vegetarian schnitzel\" confuse consumers and need to be replaced, according to German Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt. He wants new names for plant-based dishes. Germans shouldn't be biting into a \"vegan sausage\" or cutting a slice of \"vegetarian schnitzel,\" German Minister for Food and Agriculture Christian Schmidt told the daily \"Bild\" newspaper on Wednesday, adding that names traditionally used for meat-based dishes should not be applied to plant-based foods. \"I don't want anyone to pretend that these pseudo-meat dishes are actual meat dishes,\" Schmidt said. The minister said manufacturers should come up with distinct names for plant-based meat-substitutes. Schmidt also said meat was part of a healthy and balanced diet and belonged on the menu in schools and kindergartens. Soy? Steak? Soy-steak? Schmidt's statements echo demands from the German Farmers Association and German Butchers Association. Both lobbying groups have asked for a ban on terms such as \"vegetarian ham\" or \"soy steak.\" Schmidt's call for plant-based foods to have their own name was also made in October in the state of Lower Saxony, a state with many large livestock farms. The German Vegetarian Association, however, argued against the proposal. A spokesperson for the organization said that \"names that are used for animal-based products should without a doubt also be legal to use for vegetarian substitute products.\" More meatless 'whatever-you-want-to-call-thems' The market for vegetarian and vegan dishes has grown steadily in the past few years in Germany, partly at the expense of the meat industry. According to a research paper by the Institute for the Study of Trade (IfH), revenue for vegetarian and vegan products in Germany was 454 million euros ($474 million) in 2015 and grew by more than 100 percent between 2010 and 2015. In the same time period, the demand for meat products fell by almost 10 percent. mb/sms (dpa, epd)",
        "generated_story": "German Butchers Association: No more'vegetarian sausages' and no more' schnitzel' The German farmers' association has announced that it will no longer be producing \"vegatarian\" meat. The decision comes as a shock to the German farmer's association, which has been in the news for the past few days for a number of reasons. First, it's the end of meat production in Germany. Second, there's no need for meat to be produced in this country. This is the first time in German history that meat is being made in a meat-free environment. It's also the last time meat will be made from beef, pork, fish and eggs. In fact, meat producers in Lower Saxony and Upper Bavaria have decided to stop producing meat in order to make meat for their own consumption. \"Meat production is going to continue to decline,\" said Christian Schmidt, the head of the local German Butcher Association. He added that \"meat production will continue at the same rate as in other parts of Germany.\" He also said that the meat industry would not be able to produce meat at all without the help of local meat processors. But he also pointed out that there was no reason to believe that this would be the case, since meat was already being produced at a very low cost. However, he said, \"It's not that we don't have meat, but we do need meat.\" \"We have to get meat out of our meat,\" Schmidt told Bild, adding that he was \"very happy with the results of this decision.\" The news also came as news broke that a German meat processor had been forced to cut meat from his meat and sell it to a local butcher. Schmidt said the decision was made after \"a lot of discussion and discussion\" about the future of beef and pork. According to German news magazine Bild (link: dpa, AFP) \"This is a decision that will have a positive impact on the industry, and we are very pleased with it.\" But it is not just meat that has gone down the drain. There are other meat products, too, such as meatballs and fish, as well as pork and beef. For example, beef is now available for purchase at supermarkets, while pork is available at farmers markets across the country, with meat being sold for $1.50 per pound (around $2.20) and meat made at meatpacking plants. Meat is also available to purchase from meat packing companies, including meatpackers, wholesalers and produce companies. And meathouses are not allowed to sell meat directly to consumers, according to Schmidt. That's a big change from what they used to do when they were growing up, when meat came into the market. Now meat companies are required to provide meat substitutes, so meat can only be sold in meat warehouses, rather than in restaurants. So meat has to go through the process of being cut. If meat isn't cut, then meat must be cut to fit into meat packages, or meat should be frozen and stored in an oven. With meat coming from the slaughterhouse, that means meat won't be available on meat machines for years to come, Schmidt added. Meanwhile meat sales are expected to increase by at least 10 percent in 2017, compared to last year, after meat prices rose by 1.5 percent from a year earlier. Food prices have fallen by 20 percent since the beginning of 2015, making meatmeat sales down from $3.75 to $4.15 a pound in 2014. meat processing companies have also reported a decline in sales, although the number is still down to around 1 percent, from around 2.3 million in 2015. A new report from German newspaper Bild said meat wholesaling companies had reported an increase in demand for beef products in recent months, due to low prices and a shortage of substitutes. Germany's meat market has also seen a sharp drop in its meat price, however, despite the fact that beef has fallen from its peak in 2016 to about $7.7 billion. Since then, farmers have struggled to find a new meat supplier. They have been unable to meet the needs of their customers, though, they have had to rely on their meat suppliers to keep meat on hand. As a result, many meat plants have become increasingly scarce, leaving meat stocks in their hands. Many meat stores are now being closed. Some meat mills are also closing their production facilities. These are the only ones that are open to meat exports, for example. You can find meat outlets that can be sourced from Austria and Germany, Germany and the Netherlands, where meat exporters are struggling to compete for jobs. Most meat firms are still operating in Austria, Switzerland and Switzerland. German Meatpacking firms have said they are looking to expand their sales to more than 100,000. Austrian meat traders have already started to see a rise in beef sales this year. Austria is one of Europe's largest meat producer, Austria's biggest meat importers, in addition to beef production, has become a major source of about 30 percent"

Twenty years later, relations between Libya and Europe have done an about-face. The Berlin disco \"La Belle\" was packed as usual on the night of April 5, 1986. Among its guests were many US soldiers, who were certainly not thinking of politics, the Middle East or strained relations between the United States and Libya. But reality caught up with them: a bomb detonated near the dance floor that night, killing two Americans and a Turkish woman. Over 200 people were injured. A Berlin court ruled that Libya and its intelligence services were responsible for the bombing. In 2001, following a nearly four-year long trial, the judges convicted a Libyan diplomat and three others to prison sentences between 12 and 14 years. The big oil-exporting country in the meantime was busy working on its reputation. Already in the 1990s, Tripoli began striving to improve its relations to the European Union. Financial reparation opened the door to Europe In 2004, the Gaddafi International Foundation for Charity Associations and the legal representatives of the German La Belle victims settled on $35 million in compensation. This opened the door to Europe. Just a few weeks later, Germany's chancellor at the time, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, visited Moammar Gadhafi in a traditional Bedouin tent outside of Tripoli. Britain's Prime Minister Tony Blair also paid Gadhafi a visit. A few months earlier, in April 2004, the European Union had welcomed the Libyan leader to Brussels. It was Gadhafi's first official visit to Europe in 15 years. Bernd Westphal, the German ambassador to Libya, said bilateral relations had been through difficult times. \"The German Embassy in Tripoli today is working for a quick return to the liveliness of close relations between Germany and Libya,\" Westphal said. \"We want to build on our traditional friendship with Libya and we want to strengthen the political, economic and cultural cooperation between our two countries and peoples.\" Business interests booming in Libya In the past few years, Libya has moved from being the supporter of international terrorism to an attractive economic partner for the West. European business representatives have been increasingly knocking on Libya's door. Even the United States is showing increased interest in the northern African nation. Washington is pleased that Libya announced at the end of 2003 that it would discontinue its efforts to develop and produce weapons of mass destruction. Libya's ambassador to Germany, Said Abdulaati, said political and economic relations between Libya and Germany were \"excellent.\" Libya is one of Germany's strongest trading partners in northern Africa. Last year, Germany exported goods to Libya worth 657.7 million euros ($805.7 million), according to the German Federal Statistics Office. \"The economy is the driving power in German-Libyan relations,\" said Abdulaati in an interview with the Arab-German association for trade and industry. But Germany isn't the only European country making deals in Libya. France last month signed an accord with Libya on peaceful nuclear research. \"This accord represents a qualitative leap in relations between the two countries and proves that Libya has transformed its weapons of mass destruction into constructive weapons,\" Public Works Minister Maatuk Maatuk said at the signing ceremony in March. \"We are telling the world that we are moving towards the development of Libyan nuclear technology for peaceful purposes.\" This week, the Netherlands' Economics Minister Laurens Jan Brinkhorst will visit Libya to negotiate gas and oil agreements. It will be the first high-level visit by a Dutch official since Gadhafi took power in 1969.",

German Foreign Minister Gerhard Schr\u00f6der said in a statement that the country's relations with the European Union had improved markedly since the end of the civil war in 2011. \"We have made significant progress in the past few years,\" he said, adding that \"we have also made a significant improvement in our relations to the EU and to our own people.\" The German foreign ministry said it had made \"significant progress\" in its efforts to improve the situation in Libya, but that it was still too early to make any major progress. The new German embassy in Tripoli, which is located in Berlin, is the first in Europe to open a new diplomatic mission to Libya. According to a report by the German Federal Statistics Office (FSO) in Brussels, the new mission will be based in Tunis, Tunisia. It is expected to be open for business from the beginning of next year, with a focus on the future of Libya's relationship with Europe. Berlin's Foreign Ministry said the mission would be expanded to include other European countries as well as the Middle East, Africa and North Africa. Germany, however, has not yet made an official statement on its role in supporting the Libyan government. In the meantime, Berlin is working closely with Brussels on a plan to expand its diplomatic presence in Benghazi, where it is believed to have been founded by former Libyan President Moammar Gadhafi, who is now in exile in Turkey. For the time being, Germany is not involved in any negotiations with Libya over the transfer of power. However, it does have a role to play in ensuring that Libya is able to maintain a stable and stable political and economic environment in which it can continue to prosper. This is one reason why Germany and other EU countries are so eager to work together to help Libya achieve its goal of a peaceful, prosperous and prosperous future. At the same time, there is a growing sense of unease among the international community about the current state of affairs. There is also growing concern about a lack of cooperation between NATO and its allies, including the US, Britain, France, Italy, Spain, Japan, China, Russia, Turkey, and even the UK. Many of these countries have expressed concern that this will not be possible for Libya to achieve the desired outcome. That is, they are not willing to give Libya a fair chance of success. They want to ensure that its future is secure. But that doesn't mean they will give up on it. On the other hand, that does not mean that they won't work with other countries, such as France and Germany. If they don't, then they may have to do something about it, too. After all, Europe has a lot to learn about how to deal with its own problems. As a member of NATO, this is something that is very important to me. I think it's important that we have the right to know what is going on in this country. And I'm not just referring to NATO as a NATO ally. We're also talking about NATO. NATO is an ally, not a partner. You can see that in my own country, NATO has an obligation to protect the interests of all of its NATO allies. So we're not going to allow NATO to interfere with NATO's operations in eastern Europe, even if it means that NATO can't intervene militarily. What's more, we need to look at what's happening in other parts of Europe and how we can help our allies and partners. How do we do that? The EU is trying to find a way to get the best possible solution to this problem. With the help of Brussels and Washington, Libya has become a very difficult place to live in. Europe needs to take a step back and think about what it will take to solve the problem of terrorism and extremism. EU member states like Britain and France are the most important partners in that area. These countries and their allies are also the ones that are most affected by this situation. European states are particularly concerned about this, for example, because they have so much influence in their own internal politics. One of them is Europe's largest trading partner, Brussels. Brussels is particularly worried about Libya because it has the largest population of EU citizens, a country that has never had a strong military presence and a large number of people who are in conflict with each other. Since the fall of Gaddafi's regime, many of our friends and allies have come to rely on NATO for their security and security. From Brussels to London, I've been in touch with my friends in London and Berlin. Here's what I can tell you about Europe in general: The European Commission is looking for a solution that will help us to understand how Europe can be a better partner for the region, rather than just a temporary solution. Most of us are already working on this issue. (AFP, Reuters, AP, dpa, AFP/AFP/dpa)The EU/Reuters"

        "target": "EU Mulls Warning Labels to Curb Alcohol Abuse While still targeting smoking, European Union's public health commissioner is considering adding alcohol to the list of vices the bloc should clamp down on. In a report commissioned by the European Commission, the London Institute for Alcohol Studies recommended raising the legal age to buy alcohol to 18 (in some countries, such as Germany, 16-year-olds can buy beer), lowering the permitted blood alcohol level while driving to 0.5, banning alcohol advertising on TV and in movies as well as adding warning labels to bottles as ways of preventing alcohol abuse across the bloc. Which of the methods EU Health Commissioner Markos Kyprianou actually introduces will be announced \"sometime in the autumn,\" according to a spokesperson. Other options include a 10 percent increase in the price of alcohol. Kyprianou has, however, hinted that he favors warning labels -- similar to those that appear on packs of cigarettes -- that make the dangers of alcohol clear. \"Drinking harms your unborn baby\" on bottles? Brewers and wine makers across Europe, however, have come out against placing \"Drinking Kills\" or other labels on bottles of beer. \"Warning labels are the completely wrong way to go,\" Peter Hahn, head of the German Brewers Association told Germany's Express newspaper. \"The do not deter people who have lost a sense of how much to drink and unsettle the people who enjoy a beer after work.\" Industry groups also opposed implementing EU-wide guidelines in countries with traditionally different ways of approaching drinking and drinking problems. \"Policies that do not consider cultural and regional differences, will fail to deal with the social problems, while at the same time generate a rising level of political objections,\" said Rodolphe de Looz-Corswarem of Brewers of Europe. Keeping social vices separate Green party EU parliamentarian Hiltrud Breyer meanwhile called on the alcohol industry to stop \"saber rattling\" before it sees the a final version of the EU's strategy to prevent alcohol abuse. German Consumer Affairs Minister Horst Seehofer said he would wait to see what Kyprianou's actual suggestions are before commenting. Other German politicians, however, were more willing to voice the opposition to putting a sip of wine on the same footing with a puff of a cigarette. \"People should not expect that a skull and crossbones end up on every bottle of beer and wine,\" German EU representative Karl-Heinz Florenz told Der Tagesspiegel newspaper, adding that when it comes to alcohol, each member state should be responsible for how it deals with alcohol abuse. The harm of \"passive drinking\" While cigarettes are a health risk from the first puff, moderate drinking can actually be healthy and there is no danger from \"passive drinking,\" Peter Liese, a German EU representative, told the paper. The commission's report disagreed with Liese's conclusion, saying alcohol abuse had a major role in as many as 200,000 deaths in Europe due to car accidents and disease and played a role in some 60,000 underweight births. The report also estimated the effects of alcohol abuse of costing the EU 125 billion euros ($161 billion) in 2003. Some 25 percent of men and 10 percent of women in Europe drink what the EU considers to be more than healthy amounts of alcohol and between 3 percent and 5 percent are suffering from alcoholism, according to EU statistics.",
        "generated_story": "German Brewers Association warns against \"passive drinking\" in bottles of beer The European Commission has warned against the use of alcohol in beer. The EU's head of consumer affairs, Horst Seehofer, warned on Wednesday that alcohol consumption could lead to an increase in the number of people who drink alcohol. \"We have to be very careful,\" he said in an interview with the German newspaper \"Express\" on Thursday. He also warned that \"alcohol consumption is a serious problem in Europe.\" \"It's not just about alcohol, it's about the quality of the beer itself,\" said Hiltrud Breyer, a spokesman for the Brewers' Association of Europe (BAE). \"There's a lot of risk to the health and well-being of those who consume alcohol,\" BAE president Rodolphe de Looz-Corswarem told the paper. In addition, the association's president, Karl-Heinz Florenz, said he was \"very concerned\" about \"the potential for alcohol to cause harm to people's health.\" He added: \"I'm very concerned that people will be drinking alcohol that is harmful to their health, and I'm not going to allow that to happen to them.\" BEE president Peter Hahn said the EU should take a closer look at the issue, adding that it would be a \"huge mistake\" to try to prevent people from consuming alcohol on a regular basis. But he also pointed out that there was no evidence to suggest that beer consumption was linked to a higher risk of cancer, which is the main cause of death for people with cancer. And he added that the European Union should also take steps to protect the public from alcohol-related diseases, such as smoking, alcohol abuse and obesity, as well as the spread of diseases like hepatitis C and HIV, among other diseases. This is not the first time that this has been the subject of public debate in Germany. It's the second time in a row that a German beer is being sold on the market. Last year, Germany sold more than 1.5 million cases of alcoholic drinks, according to German news agency dpa (AFP). The average age of a beer sold is 21.6 years old. That means it can be sold for as little as $2.50 a bottle, or for up to $3.75 a year. According to industry association DPA, that number has risen to 24.7 percent in recent years, up from 16.4 percent a few years ago, when it was 20.3 percent, in 2015. Since then, there have been several cases in which alcohol sales have fallen by 20 percent or more, but the average price has remained the same. There have also been some cases where people have bought more alcohol than they need to drink. These are the cases that have caused the most harm. For example, beer sales are down by 30 percent since the beginning of 2015, compared with a similar period in 2014. A recent study by the University of Nottingham found that 80 percent of German consumers drank alcohol at least once a week, while the rest drank less than a cup a day. However, this trend has not been seen in other European countries, including the United States, France, Spain, Italy and the Netherlands, where alcohol is sold at a much higher rate than in many other countries. Some of these cases, however, are not related to alcohol and are more likely to come from the US, Europe and Asia. Many of them are from countries like Germany, Austria, China, Japan, India and China. They all have their own drinking habits that are very different from those of other nations. So what does this mean for beer drinkers? It means that they are drinking more and more beer in their homes, rather than drinking less and less. What do you think? What does it mean to you? Do you want to know? Read more: How to avoid drinking in your own home? How can you tell if you're drinking too much beer? Is it a good idea to have a glass of wine? If so, how much is it worth it to your family and friends? The answer is that you should be aware of what you drink? You don't know. If you do, you shouldn't drink beer at all. You should drink it, too, because that's how you feel about it. Why should you be able to enjoy it? That's what I think is so important to me. I would like to see more of this in my home country. How do I know what to do? Well, let's see how I can make sure that I do that? I'd be happy to tell you about my family, friends and my friends. We all know how important it is for you to get a taste of our own beer when you've had a drink, right? Let's just say that we're not drinking enough beer and then we'll be OK with that. All you can do is drink a little bit more wine and enjoy the taste? We're going out of course"

        "target": "All or nothing for Bayern in Champions final Bayern Munich have one last chance to salvage a season that has otherwise been marked by their inability to beat Borussia Dortmund: a win against Chelsea in the Champions League final at their home stadium. All season long, Bayern Munich have been consumed with achieving one goal: reaching the final of the Champions League, held at their own Allianz Arena in Munich, and raising the trophy in front of their home fans. After finishing a distant second place to Dortmund in the Bundesliga and dismally losing to them 5-2 in the German Cup final, Bayern Munich are in a must-win situation Saturday against Chelsea. A loss would be the final straw in a disappointing season for a team that can't stand second place. A win for Bayern would mean redemption, to some extent, for their shortcomings in the league. Key players were rested down the stretch in the Bundesliga, especially before the two legs of Bayern's European semifinal against Real Madrid. That was an indication that Bayern had given up on the league and put all their eggs in one basket, hoping for a big payoff with the Champions League title. The same can be said for the German Cup final against Dortmund: true, Bayern essentially beat themselves by making mistake after mistake, but Bayern could, if they win Saturday, wipe the slate clean. Saving the season Win this match, and all will be forgiven in Munich. Lose, and it will be Bayern's second straight season without a piece of hardware, not to mention the heartbreak of losing the biggest match at Allianz Arena since it opened in 2005. \"We must not even think about [losing],\" said Bayern's Franck Ribery on Thursday. \"If we win the Champions League, then we can forget about not winning the league or the cup, nobody will care about that.\" Bayern are a team that thrives under pressure, and the high stakes of this match will be good for them. Chelsea are a team that showed in their semifinal upset of Barcelona that they can rise to a challenge, even if that challenge is simply holding on against a superior opponent. \"We are not the favorites of the game, we are playing away,\" Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech said on Thursday. \"It is very rare when you have the home team playing in the home stadium, using the home dressing room, so I think the advantage goes to Bayern Munich because of that. But we know we have a chance and we will fight for it.\" But this match will come down to the team that can better take advantage of holes that have been blown in each team's defense due to injuries and suspensions. Filling the gaps Between the two sides, seven starting players will miss out on the final. Chelsea saw Raul Meireles, Ramires, and Branislav Ivanovic each get their third yellow card in the second leg against Barcelona, and captain John Terry was given a straight red. Terry and Ivanovic are fixtures on Chelsea's backline, which was already at half-strength due to hamstring injuries suffered by Gary Cahill and David Luiz. Chelsea coach Roberto di Matteo hopes those two are fit enough for the final, since Chelsea will need all the help they can get in the back. For Bayern, David Alaba and Holger Badstuber - both defenders - and Luiz Gustavo, a defensive midfielder, are also suspended for picking up three yellow cards. The impact of the suspensions will hit Chelsea the most. In addition to a weakened back line, Meireles and Ramires are mainstays on offense, supporting strikers Didier Drogba or Fernando Torres. With Ramires out, Drogba could start as striker, with Torres moving to the wing. At any rate, there is more uncertainty in The Blues' lineup than there is in Bayern's, who will be able to rely on striker Mario Gomez and the dynamic-duo of Arjen Robben and Ribery on the wings as they have all season. Most of the question marks will still be defensive for both teams, but to think that this is an indication of a high-scoring affair on Saturday would be a discredit to both team's last lines of defense. Between the posts Neither side would be competing in the final if it wasn't for the heroics of the teams' keepers. Cech defended against wave after wave of attacks from Barcelona in the semifinal for Chelsea, and Manuel Neuer showed nerves of steel in Bayern's penalty shootout in the final leg against Real Madrid, blocking penalties from Madrid stars Cristiano Ronaldo and Kaka. Chelsea's best shot will be to come out of the gate at a sprint and gain an early advantage against Bayern, who will be doing everything they can to keep their long-cultivated dream-final in their control. Otherwise, Bayern's determination to salvage their season may be enough to carry them through to the trophy ceremony - at home, just like they planned it.

        "generated_story": "Bayern Munich beat Real Madrid in the Champions League final Manchester City beat Borussia Dortmund 2-1 on aggregate on Wednesday night. The German champions had to settle for a 1-0 win at the Allianz Arena, but they couldn't have done it without the help of their star striker. Bayern Munich were unable to find a way past the hosts, who had won their last three games in all competitions. But they were able to do so with a goal from the penalty spot and a penalty from substitute Didier Drogba. That was Bayern's only goal of the game, and it was the first time they had ever won a major trophy in their history. It was also their first ever win over a top-flight side. They were also the only side to reach the quarter-finals for the second time in three years. \"It was a very difficult game,\" said Raul Meireles, the head coach of Bayern, \"but we managed to get through to the semi-final.\" \"We had a lot of chances,\" he said, adding that he was \"very pleased with the way Bayern handled the situation.\" The Blues, meanwhile, were without their best player in recent years, as they failed to score a single goal in seven games, losing just once in that competition. In the end, they lost 3-2 at home to Manchester United, their only chance of reaching the last 16. And that was after a poor performance from their goalkeeper, Petr Cech, in which they conceded three goals in five minutes. For the German side, this was their biggest win in a long time and they will be looking forward to a repeat of last year's title triumph, which saw them win the Bundesliga and the Europa League, respectively. At the same time, Bayern will have to make sure that they don't let their fans down again. Last season's German Cup final was won by Bayern in front of a crowd of 12,000. This season, however, it has been a little more difficult for them. After a disappointing start to their campaign in Germany's top flight, last season they have struggled to maintain their form in Europe's premier competition, where they are currently second-placed in Group A behind Barcelona and fourth-place Barcelona. However, that doesn't mean they won't be back next season. On the other hand, there is still a chance they can get back into the top four, if they want to be the best side of Europe. As for their chances of winning the title again this year, Chelsea are the favorites to win it all, with Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and Romelu Lukaszczy\u0144ska all set to take the trophy on Sunday. With the result, though, Mourinho's side will face a tough task in next week's Bundesliga final, when they hope to improve on the form they showed against Bayern. Despite their recent form, Jose Mourinho and his team-mates are still looking to build on their title success. There is no doubt that the Blues are going to have a difficult time getting back on track, especially after the defeat to Real on Tuesday night in Munich. Although they did have the chance to qualify for next weekend's final at Wembley Stadium, manager Jose Manuel Neuer has said he is confident his side can make it through the knockout stages. His side are in good shape, too, despite the fact that Bayern have already won the league twice this season and are on top of Group E. Chelsea have been the defending champions for several years now, having won three consecutive Bundesliga titles, while Real have won four of them all since the 1990s. Their last four matches have seen them reach their highest ever Bundesliga title, a record they reached in 2012 and 2013. Yet they still have only one trophy to show for that achievement: the 2006 World Cup, won in 1990. Now they face Barcelona, whom they beat 4-3 on home soil, on Saturday. United are hoping to lift their fourth consecutive trophy, after beating Bayern on away goals on penalties in Wednesday's draw at Old Trafford. City are also looking for an eighth consecutive win, although they could be a step closer to reaching their third consecutive European final in four years as well as the fourth in succession. Jose Enrique, Franck Ribery and Fernando Torres are expected to step up their efforts to become the next coach in charge of this summer's tournament. David Silva is the man to lead the charge in his first season as Bayern coach. Rafael Benitez's men are now in third place in Serie A, ahead of Roma, Juventus and Inter Milan in fourth place. Meanwhile, Atletico Madrid have also been relegated to Group B, Barcelona are third with seven points from three matches in six seasons. Barcelona's Luis Suarez is also in contention for another title bid, following a win against Real in 2014. Spain's Diego Costa has also reached the semifinals in 2013, beating them in 2011 and 2012. Madrid and Barcelona have both been eliminated by a narrow margin of 0.5 percent to claim their fifth place,"

        "target": "UN chief warns Nepal parties over instability The UN Secretary General has voiced disappointment over the failure of divided parties to meet a deadline to draw up a constitution. Security forces are on high alert amid fears of unrest. UN leader Ban Ki-moon expressed \"deep regret\" on Monday that political leaders had failed to make progress on a constitution in Nepal, expressing concern about instability within the country. Security forces were put on high alert, with riot police patrolling streets after calls by the opposition for the resignation of Maoist Prime Minister Baburam Bhattarai. \"Nepal has entered an uncertain constitutional and political period,\" Ban warned in a statement read by his spokesman Martin Nesirky. \"The government and the political leaders, as well as leaders of various communities, need to demonstrate the courage and wisdom to come together to address the challenges the nation faces,\" the statement added. Repeated deadlines expired Politicians were to have agreed upon a new framework for the country's political future by Sunday. However, the representation of ethnic minorities and castes within a federal structure has proved a major sticking point in efforts to draw up a secular constitution. Bhattarai on Sunday said that parliament, elected in 2008 after a decade of civil war, would be disbanded after repeated deadlines had been broken. New elections are due to be held in November, but the opposition has criticized the premier's unilateral decision to call the poll. The country's Hindu monarchy, which ruled for centuries, was abolished after Maoist rebels gave up arms and won elections in 2008. Some 16,000 people died in the civil war between 1996 and 2006. rc/msh (AFP, AP)",
        "generated_story": "Nepal elections in Nepal are in the midst of unrest The UN has warned that the country's elections are likely to be a disaster for democracy and human rights. The election is scheduled to take place on Sunday, the UN Secretary-General Martin Nesirky said in a statement. \"The country is facing a serious political crisis,\" he said, adding that it was \"a very difficult time for the people of Nepal to decide whether to participate in elections.\" \"We are facing an extremely difficult situation,\" Ban Ki-moon said at a news conference in Kathmandu, Nepal's capital. He added that he hoped the election would be peaceful, but that \"the situation is not going to change overnight.\" The United Nations has called for a peaceful election, which will be held by the end of the year. But it is unclear whether the elections will go ahead as planned, as the government has said it won't be able to hold elections until after the next general election in November. In the past, elections have been held on a number of occasions, including in 2009 and 2010, when elections were held in an attempt to elect a new prime minister. Since then, however, it has been difficult to predict the outcome of elections, and the situation has become increasingly tense. On Wednesday, a UN peacekeeping mission in neighboring Nepal announced it would hold a referendum on whether or not to allow elections to proceed. It is expected that a majority of voters will vote in favor of an independent candidate, while a minority of candidates will not be allowed to run for re-election, according to UN officials. Ban said he would not rule out the possibility of a presidential election if the results were to go against his own party's wishes. Bhattarai, who heads the Nepal Peace and Development Commission (NEPDC), said his government was committed to a fair and transparent election process. However, he also said that there was no guarantee that any candidate would win a seat on the National Assembly, despite the fact that they were elected by a large majority in parliament. According to the Nepalese government, no candidate has yet been elected to parliament and that is a major concern for his or her supporters. Many of his supporters have also called on him to step down from his position as UN secretary-general, saying he was not ready to give up his post as he had promised to do so. Nepal is currently embroiled in political turmoil, with many of its elected officials saying they had no idea what was going on in their country. Some of them have said they would vote against the new government's plan to make it more transparent and fair. They also say they want to ensure that all candidates are given the opportunity to demonstrate their commitment to democracy. That is the main reason why they have not been given a chance to speak out, they say. There is also a strong sense of responsibility for their actions. This is something that has not always been the case in other countries, such as India and China. At the same time, there are concerns that elections could be delayed because of political instability in India, where the current government is in power for several years. For the first time since independence in 1947, India has had a president who has refused to recognize the legitimacy of democracy in his home country, President Ram Nath Kovind, says he has no intention of stepping down as president of India. India is one of many countries in which democracy is at the center of international attention. While the Indian government does not have the authority to impose its own laws on Nepal, many people have expressed concern about the political situation in this country and are calling for an election that could lead to an increase in violence. These concerns are not new, though, because the constitution has already been amended to protect the rule of law in several countries. One of those countries is India's largest trading partner with the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which has a long history of independence from the British and French governments. Another is China, whose economy is suffering from a lack of economic growth and a shortage of skilled labor. Despite this, this is still a country with a relatively low level of investment in its economy. And it's not the only country where people are worried about corruption, corruption and corruption. As a result, some of these problems have become a problem for many Nepalis who don't have a lot of money to invest in developing countries and have little experience in politics. So, what can we do? Let's hope that Nepal has the right to vote on this issue. What do you think? What are you waiting for? Is there a solution to this problem? Do you have any idea of what the future holds for Nepal? Are you prepared for elections? If so, how can you be sure? I think that's a very important question. Is it a matter of time before elections can be decided? How long will it take for people to get elected? It's up to us to find out. I'm sure that we will have to see what happens next year's election results will depend"

        "target": "Oracle loses court fight over software resale rules A European court has ruled that it's permissible to resell software licenses even if the package has been downloaded directly from the Internet. It sided with a German firm in its legal battle with US giant Oracle. The European Court of Justice on Tuesday ruled that used software licenses may generally be resold by individuals or companies. The Luxembourg-based court thus sided with the German firm UsedSoft in a protracted legal battle with US software giant Oracle. The ruling made it clear that trade in used software was permissible even if the software had not been shipped on a physical medium such as a CD or DVD, but had been digitally downloaded from the Internet. UsedSoft's business model hinges completely on reselling used packages or legally obtained license keys for them. By reselling the keys to clients, the latter are then able to download the latest version of a given program directly from a company's Internet site and obtain all new updates and patches in the process. Legal clarity Oracle had sued UsedSoft over its business model, trying to prevent buyers of used software licenses from downloading programs again. But the European court ruled that the so-called principle of exhaustion applied whenever software was originally sold to a customer for an unlimited time span, not giving the maker of the software the right to prevent the resale of that software. \"The door for the trade in used software has been pushed wide open throughout the European Union,\" UsedSoft said in a statement, welcoming \"perfect legal safety on the market.\" The court in Luxembourg emphasized, though, that whoever resold pieces of original software and their accompanying licenses must erase every copy on their own computers in advance and was not allowed to keep a copy after resale. hg/mz (AFP, dpa)",
        "generated_story": "The European Court of Justice has ruled that it's permissible to resell software even if it has been downloaded from a computer. The court ruled on Tuesday that the European Union's law on reselling software does not apply to companies that sell it to the public. \"This is an important step in the right direction,\" the court said in a ruling that is expected to be made public by the end of the year. It's the first time the EU has made the law clear that resellers of software are not allowed to sell the software to anyone without the consent of a court. In a landmark ruling, the Court ruled in favor of companies such as Oracle, Microsoft, SAP and SAP, which have sold software for more than a billion euros ($1.4 billion) since 2009. Oracle has said it will not sell software that has not been used in more recent years. SAP has also said that its software is not available for sale on the Internet, but rather on its own servers in Germany and the United States, where it sells software from Oracle and other companies. Microsoft and Oracle have said their software was not used for the purpose of selling software, and that they will continue to do so even after the case is decided by a European court of justice in Luxembourg. According to court documents, Oracle's software can be sold for up to $2.5 billion (about $3.6 billion), but it must be resealed to a third party. That would be the equivalent of paying for a car or a house, according to an EU court ruling. Apple, Google and Microsoft have all said they don't want to pay for software they sell to third parties. Google, Apple and Amazon have also been accused of copying software used by third-party software companies, including Oracle. Amazon has denied the allegations, saying it would not be able to profit from the sale of such software. And Oracle is also facing a legal challenge from Germany's Federal Court in Strasbourg over a similar case in which it was found to have violated EU law by using software it had bought from another company, used as part of its cloud-based software platform, called \"UsedSoft.\" The case, however, is still pending before a German court, with the aim of making it easier for companies like Oracle to use the company's cloud platform for sales and marketing purposes. EU courts have already ruled against the use of Oracle software in some cases, while the US court has upheld the decision in other cases. Read more: EU judges rule that software should be free of copyright infringement in EU cases The EU's legal system is designed to protect the rights of people who use it, rather than to restrict it from being sold to others. This is a major step toward protecting the privacy of users. But it also means that companies can't sell their own software without having to register with a judge. For example, if a software company is using the same software as a reseller, it should not have to provide a copy of an operating system, as long as it doesn't infringe on a user's computer's privacy rights. If a company does that, then the user must have a valid reason to buy it. However, this is unlikely to happen in this case because it could be difficult to get a license from an individual company that owns the computer, or if the license is revoked, because of legal issues. So, for now, there's no clear legal basis for resealing software and therefore no legal grounds for doing so. As a result, European courts are likely to take a different approach to dealing with this issue. There's also the issue of how to deal with software sales, particularly in countries like Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Japan and Spain. All of these countries have different rules on how they can sell products to other countries. One of them is to make sure that users have access to information about the products they're using, so that's what the courts can do. Another is that you can only sell a product to another country, like Apple or Google. After all, that means you're not going to receive a patent for that product, even though you've already sold the product. A similar rule was made against Oracle in 2008, when it came out that Oracle had a contract with Apple. Since then, many companies have been forced to stop selling their products. These companies are still operating under the terms of that contract, though, they have the legal right to re-enter the market. What's more, these companies do not need to give up their intellectual property rights in order to keep their customers' data. They're also not legally entitled to access the data they've been given, since they cannot sell them to someone else. With the exception of Luxembourg, Germany is the only country in Europe which has a law that allows companies to purchase software on their behalf. Last week's ruling was upheld by an appeals court in Brussels, after an appeal by German courts. (AP, Reuters, AFP, dpa, AP) The decision by European judges is based on an"

        "target": "NASA's 'Curiosity' readies to hit the Martian road The US space agency has said its Mars rover appears to be working \"flawlessly,\" with a lengthy period of instrument checks almost complete. The Curiosity rover will soon re-start its sluggish search for signs of life. NASA's Mars rover, \"Curiosity,\" will wrap up a lengthy self-testing phase on Thursday, freeing it up to continue exploring the surface of the Red Planet. Mission manager Jennifer Tropser told reporters in a conference call on Wednesday evening that the plan, once the final checks were completed, was to \"drive, drive, drive\" until Curiosity discovers a rock suitable for analysis. She added that the instrument checks have delivered positive results. \"Through every phase of the check-out, Curiosity has performed almost flawlessly,\" Tropser said. \"The success so far of these activities has been outstanding.\" Many of the tests have concerned Curiosity's robotic arm. The 2.1-meter (7-feet) appendage will be used to pick out and sample rocks and soil. NASA is investigating whether Mars can sustain life, or whether it could in the past. The tests were designed to identify any damage sustained during its interplanetary flight and also to ensure that the arm still functioned properly on Mars, with its different temperatures and gravity. The Mars rover landed in the giant Gale Crater, near the Martian equator, on August 5; it has so far moved about 109 meters within the crater. The rover is traveling east, heading first to an intersection called Glenelg, where three types of terrain meet. This is likely to be the location for the first rock and soil samples, though NASA said Curiosity was unlikely to arrive there for several weeks. Curiosity's ultimate destination is the nearby Aeolis Mons or Mount Sharp, a 3-mile-high mound of rock rising out of the crater. Mount Sharp is about 4.3 miles (7 kilometers) away from Curiosity's landing site.

        "generated_story": "Curiosity's self-testing has been a success - and so far, so good - NASA's Mars rover Curiosity has had a good run. The rover, which was launched in 2009, is now testing the results of self testing. It's the first of its kind in the world, and it's a big step forward for the space agency. Scientists have been testing Curiosity for several years now, with the goal of getting the rover up and running by the end of the year. They've been able to test it for a number of promising features, including its ability to detect the presence of bacteria in its environment. But the most promising feature is the fact that it has a very low chance of being detected by humans. In fact, the Curiosity rover has already tested more than 1,000 bacteria, according to a NASA press release. \"The results are very promising,\" said Jennifer Tropser, Curiosity's lead scientist. She said the team is \"very optimistic\" about the success of their experiment, adding that \"it's going to be a long, long time before we get to the point where we can start testing it again.\" \"We're very optimistic,\" she said, noting that the test results will be published in a few weeks, when Curiosity is scheduled to return to Earth. So far so promising, in fact. We've already seen a lot of positive results from the tests, but we're still waiting to see what the next step is for Curiosity. I think we'll see how it goes from there. There's no doubt that Curiosity will have a great impact on the future of space exploration, as well as on our own exploration of Mars and other planets. And that's not to say that there won't be more tests to come, either. For the time being, there's been no shortage of tests -- and even more good news for scientists who are still trying to figure out how to use the instruments. One of those tests is to determine whether the instrument can be used to identify bacteria that are present in Mars' atmosphere. Another test is planned for next year, at the beginning of September. If the experiment is successful, it could lead to an even bigger success for NASA. NASA is also looking into the possibility of using Curiosity as a testbed for future missions, such as the Mars 2020 rover. That would be an important step in getting Curiosity up to speed on Mars, since Mars is a relatively new planet and the Earth's atmosphere is still relatively warm and dry. However, that doesn't mean it can't also be tested for bacteria from Mars. Researchers are also hoping to get a better understanding of how the spacecraft works -- which is why they've had so much success with their own instruments, for example. This is one of several tests that have already been carried out on Curiosity, a rover that is currently being used by NASA to study the Martian atmosphere and how its atmosphere interacts with its surroundings. On the other hand, they're also testing how well it works with other spacecraft, like the Hubble Space Telescope and Mars itself. These tests are being done by a team of scientists at NASA, who have spent years studying the planet's magnetic field and monitoring its temperature and humidity. Some of these tests have even been performed on a small scale, while others are conducted on Earth, using instruments designed to simulate the atmosphere's temperature, humidity and temperature. At the same time, these instruments are testing whether they can detect bacteria and viruses in their environment, or if they are working on other instruments that could be harmful to human health. All of this testing, however, should be done in an effort to make sure that they don't contaminate the water and soil samples. As a result, scientists are hoping that this test will help to improve the quality of water samples collected by Curiosity and its crew. According to researchers, this is something that will make it more difficult for humans to do, given the current state of science in space. After all, most of them are already well-prepared to work on their instruments -- but it will take a while before Curiosity can do that. With the help of a couple of new instruments and a new instrument, researchers are confident that Mars will do well in this field, too.

The Curiosity team will try to find out. Is it working? If so, what will they do with it? Will it be useful for Mars? Is there a way to learn more about Mars or the environment? We'll have to wait and see. Will Curiosity do its own tests? I'm not sure, because the mission is already a little bit of an experiment. How do I know? Well, I'd like to know. Let's see if the data is accurate. Here's what I can tell you. Curiosity already has some good things to try and get the best results out of it. You can we"

        "target": "A borderline war The crisis in Syria is in danger of drawing in neighboring countries. Despite the Syrian government's immediate apology, the shelling on the Turkish border has led to concerns about possible escalation. These weren't the first incidents on the Syrian-Turkish border, but the fact that several people on the Turkish side were killed by Syrian shells on Wednesday (03.10.2012) has brought the conflict between the two countries to a new level. It has led the Turkish military to retaliate for the first time. Several people were killed when Turkey shelled Syrian territory. But neither Turkey, which is a member of NATO, nor Syria would benefit from a broader conflict. An adviser to the Turkish president tweeted, \"Turkey has no interest in a war with Syria.\" Volker Perthes, director of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs in Berlin, agrees: \"Assad has no interest in an escalation,\" he told DW. \"That can be seen from the fact that the Syrian information minister apologized and expressed his regret over the victims immediately after the attack on Turkish territory.\" Perthes doesn't think it's likely that the Syrian President, Bashar Assad, wants to provoke Turkey to intervene in Syria. \"That would only accelerate the fall of his regime,\" he said. It's not yet clear who was responsible for the shelling. According to Syria's ally, Russia, it was a \"tragic accident.\" Relationship damaged The armed incidents on the Syrian-Turkish border have been going on for months. According to Amnesty International, some 300,000 Syrians have left their country since the start of the uprising against Assad, and many of them have fled to Turkey. The relationship between the two countries, which used to be close, has deteriorated dramatically, and the Turkish government is now openly supporting the Syrian opposition. \"Turkey is itself a player in the Syrian conflict,\" said Perthes. \"It provides shelter for many refugees and it's through Turkey that supplies come for the opposition.\" NATO has lined up behind Turkey and told Syria to end its \"flagrant violations of international law.\" Call for 'great discretion' The German chancellor, Angel Merkel, has also positioned herself alongside Turkey. \"We call on all parties to show great discretion,\" she said in Berlin. The foreign minister, Guido Westerwelle, declared that everything must be done to deescalate the situation, so that the Syrian conflict did not turn into a conflagration in the region. Indeed, the Syrian crisis is not only spreading to Turkey, but also to Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon. According to Perthes, \"The neighboring countries are partly victims and partly instigators. Jordan too has taken in refugees and supplies the rebels. On the other hand, Iraq has tended to support the government of Bashar Assad.\" Even so, he said, all the neighboring countries had an interest in ensuring the conflict was confined to Syria. Appeal to the international community But the number of Syrian refugees is rising by the day. Ruth J\u00fcttner, a Middle East expert with Amnesty International, believes this will continue in future months. \"It's important that the countries bordering on Syria are supported by the international community in providing accommodation, medical and psychological care and schooling for children,\" she told DW. It's an appeal she directs especially to European countries. The shelling on the Syrian-Turkish border has made it more likely that there will be armed conflict between Syria and its neighbors. According to Perthes, \"It's probably the case that political resistance in Turkey to intervention in Syria is decreasing right now.\"",
        "generated_story": "German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle says Turkey's response to the Syrian conflict is \"not likely\" The German Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday that it would not respond to a possible Turkish military intervention in the country. \"Turkey is not likely to respond in any way at all,\" German foreign ministry spokesman Volker Perthes told DW, adding that the German government had \"no plans\" to intervene militarily in Syria. Germany's foreign minister, Angel Merkel, said in an interview with DW that she was \"confident\" that Turkey would respond \"in the best way possible\" in order to prevent an escalation of the conflict between the two countries. But she also said that \"the Turkish side will not be able to act in a way that is acceptable to us.\" \"We are not going to react to an intervention by Turkey,\" she said, referring to President Bashar Assad, who has been in power for more than two decades. The Turkish government, however, has not commented on the possibility of a Turkish intervention, according to German news agency DW. In the past, it has said it was willing to take part in military operations against Assad's regime, but that this was not the case with Turkey. On the other hand, the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, had said earlier this month that he would be ready to step in if the situation was to change. However, he did not specify when or how he might do so, and said he had no plans to make such a move. He added that his country was prepared to do \"whatever it takes to protect its citizens\" and \"to protect the interests of its own people and its people.\" Germany, which has long been a staunch ally of Turkey, is also a strong supporter of Syria's president Bashar al-Assad. Last week, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said her country would take a \"strong stand\" against the Assad regime if it were to be allowed to continue its military operation. She said she would \"open the door to dialogue\" with the president and his government if they agreed on a ceasefire. For now, though, Germany is sticking to its position on Syria, as long as it does not use chemical weapons against civilians. It has also called on Turkey to provide humanitarian aid to Syrian refugees in need of humanitarian assistance. According to DW's German Institute for International and Security Affairs, Turkey \"will not hesitate to use its armed forces to help Syrian civilians in their search for refuge in Turkey.\" In a statement published on its website on Monday, she added: \"It will be very difficult for us to see how Turkey will respond. We will have to wait and see what Turkey does in response.\" The statement was made in light of recent developments in Aleppo, Syria and Iraq, where a number of civilians have been killed in clashes between Turkish troops and Syrian government forces. At the same time, Turkish President Recep Erdogan has called for an \"immediate ceasefire\" between Syrian and Turkish forces, saying it is necessary to ensure the safety of Syrians and their families. Turkey has repeatedly rejected the idea of an international ceasefire and has refused to recognize the terms of any such ceasefire, despite repeated warnings from the US and the European Union that such an agreement could be reached. This is the first time that Germany has made a commitment to cooperate with other countries, including the United States and Russia, in its efforts to resolve the crisis. That is, of course, not to say that Ankara will take any action against Syria in this way. There are many reasons for this. One of them is that there is a lack of coordination between Ankara and Damascus, for example, over the issue of how to deal with a humanitarian crisis, such as the humanitarian situation in northern Syria that has become so acute in recent years. And there are also concerns about the role of Russia and Iran in dealing with this conflict. As for Syria itself, this is an area of concern for many Syrians, particularly in Germany. Many of those who have fled to Syria are fleeing to Turkey in search of safety and security, while others are hoping for a better life in Europe. Some of these Syrians have also fled their homes in other parts of Europe as well. They are particularly concerned about what is happening in neighboring countries like Germany and France. So far, they have not had a chance to reach out to them. These are the main reasons why they haven't reached an understanding of what the future holds for their country's future. After all, their situation is very different from that of Iraq and Afghanistan. Since the end of World War II in 1991, when the war began, many people have come to believe that Syria was a very dangerous place for them to live and work in peace and stability. Nevertheless, there's a lot of mistrust between Turkey and Ankara. I think it's important that we have a clear sense of responsibility for our own security situation, given the fact that they are both in conflict with each other. When it comes to humanitarian crises, I don't think we will see any kind of response from Turkey at the moment, we can't be"

        "target": "Armstrong stripped of Tour de France titles Cyclist Lance Armstrong has been stripped of his seven Tour de France titles and banned from cycling for life, in a much-anticipated ruling by the sport's international governing body. Monday's announcement by Pat McQuaid, the president of the International Cycling Union, ratified recommendations in an October report from the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), which ordered Armstrong's Tour de France titles be wiped out. \"Lance Armstrong has no place in cycling,\" said McQuaid. Addressing his remarks to cyclists, McQuaid said the fight against doping was his priority. \"UCI is listening and is on your side. We\u2019ve come too far in the fight against doping to return to our past. Cycling has a future and something like this must not happen again.\" The scathing USADA report included testimony from 11 former teammates, accusing Armstrong of running the \"most sophisticated\" doping program in the sport's history. The USADA said it had collected evidence to prove the seven-time Tour de France winner had engaged in the biggest doping conspiracy to date. Effect on cycling and sponsorship Monday's decision comes as the sport of cycling reels from Armstrong's well-documented fall from grace. Organizers of the Tour de France will be trying to move on from the scandal as the race prepares to celebrate its centenary next year. Sponsors have been deserting Armstrong and the sport in general. Last week, Nike - one of Armstrong's main corporate sponsors - said it was terminating its relationship with the cyclist and accused him of deception. Trek, the company that made the bicycles Armstrong rode to seven titles, announced on the same day it would terminate its sponsorship contract - as did the beer maker Anheuser-Busch. The Dutch institution Rabobank ended its association with professional cycling after the doping allegations came to light, leaving 17 riders in need of a sponsor. Last week Armstrong also announced he would step down from his own charity, the Lance Armstrong Foundation, also known as Livestrong, a move believed to have been intended to limit the damage to the organization from the USADA report. Armstrong appears Lance Armstrong spoke briefly to thousands of riders in Texas at a benefit organized by his charity, the day before UCI's decision. \"I've been better, but I've also been worse,\" he said. \"Obviously it has been an interesting and difficult couple of weeks.\" jr/rc (Reuters, AFP, AP)",
        "generated_story": "Lance Armstrong stripped of Tour de France titles by International Cycling Union Lance Armstrong has been stripped by the International Olympic Committee (IUCN) of his two world cycling titles. Armstrong, who has won the Tour of France twice, was stripped on Sunday of two of the three titles he won in 2009 and 2010. He won three of those titles in 2010 and 2011. In 2011, Armstrong won two more in 2011 and 2012, the first time he had won a world title in the same year. But in 2013, he lost his third in a row. \"I am very disappointed,\" Armstrong said at the time, adding that he and his wife, Pat McQuaid, \"are disappointed with the outcome of this year's Tour. I am disappointed that I was not given the opportunity to compete again in 2012.\" Armstrong also lost three more races in 2014 and 2015, when he finished fourth in both the 2012 and 2013 Tours. The two victories came at a time when the world's top cycling team, Anheuser-Busch, had been unable to reach the podium for the second time in three years. This time around, it was the United States that was able to claim the title, which was handed to Armstrong on Saturday. It was Armstrong's second consecutive victory, after the 2013 edition, in which he was runner-up to Michael Schumacher. However, his victory was overshadowed by a series of disappointing finishes in 2015 and 2016, including a third-place finish in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and a fourth place in Paris-Roubaix, France. Both of these victories were won by Armstrong himself, but they were also handed out to other riders who had failed to finish the race, such as Lance's brother, Lance, or his team-mate, Chris Armstrong (pictured above). Armstrong was also stripped from his three other world titles after he failed a doping test in 2008 and 2009. His father, Patrick, is also a former professional cyclist and the father of Lance. They were both banned from cycling for doping in 2006 and 2008, respectively, for failing to pass a drug test. Since then, they have been barred from competing in other cycling events, as well as in several other races. Lance has also been banned for life from the sport of cycling, although he has not been fined for his doping past, according to the IOC. That means he will not be allowed to race again until the end of next year, if he fails to meet the criteria for a World Tour title. US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) has said that the USADA is not aware of any doping violations and that it will investigate the allegations against Armstrong. According to a report in The New York Times, there is no evidence that Armstrong had any involvement in doping, though it is possible that there may be a link between his father's drug use and other doping offenses. There are no allegations of doping at this stage in his life, however, because the U.S. anti-doping agency does not have the authority to make such an assessment. Instead, its decision is based on the findings of an independent investigation by an international panel of experts. If the results of that investigation are found to be true, then Armstrong will have to step down as a professional rider in order to avoid a ban on cycling. And that would be an extremely difficult situation for him, since he would have had to give up his title as an amateur cyclist. After all, cycling is a sport that requires a lot of hard work and dedication, so it's not something that is easy to get into, especially when you have a team of athletes who have never competed before. So, that's why I'm not going to comment further on this matter. For now, I'll just say that this is the most important thing I can think of: the fact that Lance is an American cyclist, a cyclist who is well-known for having a good sense of what he's doing and has a great passion for cycling and who wants to improve his cycling career. (AP, AFP, dpa, Reuters) \"It's a matter of time before we get to know Lance,\" he said in an interview with The Associated Press, referring to him as \"the most famous cyclist in cycling.\" \"He's the best cyclist I've ever seen,\" said the American-born Armstrong Foundation's chief executive officer, Tim Clark. Clark said he believes Armstrong is \"a very good cyclist,\" but he doesn't think he'll ever get the chance to win a title again, given his track record of being a top rider. 'I don't want to lose my title,\" Clark told the AP. A spokesman for Rabobank declined to confirm the report, saying the investigation is still ongoing, citing a lack of information on his whereabouts and whether he'd be eligible to participate in any future races, rather than just compete in another sport. As a rider, Clark is one of a handful of teams that have already won multiple world championships in recent years, with a number of all the"

        "target": "Bayern blast five as Schalke draw Bayern Munich stamped their authority over the Bundesliga on Saturday, with a ruthless 5-0 drubbing of Hannover at home. Meanwhile, second-placed Schalke and third-placed Frankfurt were forced to share the points. With many critics saying Bayern might as well be given the giant Bundesliga dish already, perhaps the struggle for second is shaping up to be the more compelling battle. But Saturday afternoon's clash between second-placed Schalke and third-placed Frankfurt did not take a decisive turn, with the game ending in a 1-1 draw. Schalke drew first blood in the 11th minute, when Frankfurt's Stefan Aigner was dispossessed in midfield, and Lewis Holtby released Klaas-Jan Huntelaar in front of goal - the Dutchman's first in the Bundesliga since September. But the hapless Aigner waited just over 100 seconds to make amends for his error, when the Royal Blues allowed him a free header that left goalkeeper Lars Unnerstall with no chance. But neither side could make inroads in the second half, which allowed Dortmund to leap-frog both sides and claim second place. Bayern take command Meanwhile the imperious Bayern Munich dispelled any talk of winter form-dip - following last week's draw to Nuremberg - with a brutally efficient 5-0 win at home to Hannover. The Bavarians stormed to a 3-0 lead in just 37 minutes, celebrating a nifty overhead kick for star signing Javi Martinez in the fourth minute. Toni Kroos and Franck Ribery scored the next two against a Hannover side that were torn open at will. The overhead kick was the first for the 40-million-euro ($52-million) signing Martinez, and in the second half new defender Dante also opened his account with a straightforward header from a Kroos free-kick. The festival of football continued just four minutes later, when Mario Gomez - making first Bundesliga appearance of the season - slammed the ball into the net from a tight angle just 30 seconds after replacing Mario Mandzukic. Dortmund win The champions Dortmund, meanwhile, are still nine points behind Bayern after beating Mainz 2-1 away. It was a potentially tricky fixture in the town where J\u00fcrgen Klopp began his coaching career, and Mainz showed their brilliance in the fourth minute, when Elkin Soto knocked a dream ball into the path of Marco Caligiuri, whose volley fairly screamed into the top right corner. Dortmund's own star-Marco - national team player Marco Reus - leveled the scores just eight minutes later. Reus worked himself some room at the outer edge of the penalty area, and slotted a beautiful 17-meter effort into the far corner. And Dortmund's second goal, just before half-time, was equally aesthetic - a vertical ball bisected the Mainz defense perfectly down the middle, where Polish predator Robert Lewandowski got his eighth league goal of the season with a deft lob over the onrushing Christian Wetklo in goal. Allofs' homecoming Bremen's 1-1 draw at Wolfsburg had a special frisson of its own, as Wolfsburg's newly-minted sporting director Klaus Allofs faced the club he had served as general manager for over a decade. And there was some gesticulating from the Bremen bench in the general direction of the Wolfsburg management when the guests took the lead in the 35th minute. Just seconds after Wolfsburg missed several chances, Marko Arnautovic was left free in the box after Eljero Elia found space on the left and cut the ball back for the Austrian to finish. But Wolfsburg got their own back in the second half. In the 62th minute, Bremen were reduced to ten men when Lukas Schmitz was given second yellow card for a hard tackle on Adelino Vieirinha. Just two minutes later, Bas Dost took advantage of their guests' disorgnaization and smashed the ball into the goal after neat piece of play from Vieirinha. Dirty derby The Franconian derby between Greuther F\u00fcrth and Nuremberg was a cagey affair that ended in a frustrating 0-0 draw. The first half was marked mainly by a straight red card for Nuremberg's Markus Feulner after an ugly, flying lunge on Stephan F\u00fcrstner. But the home side's numerical advantage was short-lived - Sercan Sararer was also sent for an early ice bath after his high elbow on Javier Pinola was adjudged worthy of a second yellow card in the 61st minute. But the aggression in the tackles was not matched by ruthlessness in front of goal, and neither side could eke out any clear chances.",
        "generated_story": "Bayern Munich host Wolfsburg in the first leg of the AFC Champions League on Wednesday night. The Bavarians will be hoping to avoid a repeat of last season's first-leg defeat to Borussia Dortmund, which they lost 3-0 at home to Hannover on aggregate. \"We are going to have a very difficult game,\" said German coach J\u00fcrgen Klopp, who has been in charge of Bayern Munich for the past three seasons. But he has also had to deal with the fact that his side have not been able to win in their last three matches. That's not to say that the Bavarian side are not capable of winning the league, but it is not the case that they are the only team who can do that. In the Bundesliga, however, they have been the most successful side in recent years. They are also the best team in Europe, with a record of 10 wins and three draws in a row. Last year's Bundesliga title was won by Bayern, while last year they were the second-biggest in Germany, behind only Manchester United. This season, Bayern have won three of their past four league matches, including the last four, and are looking to build on that success. On Wednesday, the German champions will travel to Mainz, where they will face a tough challenge from the Dutchman Stefan Aigner. After a difficult start to the campaign, German fans have come together to cheer for their team. Aigninger's side, meanwhile, have struggled to find a way past the relegation zone, having lost their opening two games in all competitions. Their last two Bundesliga games have seen them struggle to keep up with their opponents, though, as they failed to reach the quarter-finals in 2014 and 2015, respectively. At the same time, their recent form has shown no signs of letting up. For the Germans, it's been a long time since they had a chance to get back into the top-flight, so it was a good time to take a step back and reflect on the way things have turned out so far this season. As well as the result of that, there is a lot of good news for Bayern's fans, too. It's a great chance for them to see the team they've been waiting so long for. And they'll be looking forward to their first game back since the end of August, when they face off against the reigning Bundesliga champions at the Allianz Arena in Bavaria. If they do, then they should be in good position to make it through the group stages. However, that doesn't mean they won't have to wait until the very last minute to do so, because they know they can win the next game. Germany's top scorer Mario Mandzukic has scored three goals in his last five Bundesliga appearances and has a goal to his name on his list of all-time Bundesliga top scorers. He also has three assists in this campaign. His goal against Hannovers was his second in as many games, giving him a total of six in that campaign and his first in two seasons with Dortmund. When he scored the winner, he became the youngest player in Bundesliga history to score a Bundesliga goal in club history. Since then, his tally has risen to 10 goals and is now up to 13 in total. With the help of a number of young players, this is the highest ever for a German team, according to Bundesliga statistics. So far so good, in terms of goals scored and assists, only one of them has ever been scored by a Bayern player. There is no doubt about the quality of his form, although he is still very good at his job. Nevertheless, a few things are missing from his squad. One of those is his ability to create chances for his teammates. Another is that he can be a central figure in any team's attack, especially when he's in possession. Other than the likes of Mario Gomez and Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, Germany have yet to concede a single goal. Meanwhile, other teams are struggling to match their level of form. Bundesliga leaders Bayern are in danger of missing out on a third consecutive title, after losing their previous two matches to Dortmund and Hoffenheim on Tuesday and Aug. 14. Bayern will have their hands full with three games to play in Group E. German Bundesliga side Bayern can't afford to lose to a team that has struggled for form this year. Ahead of Wednesday's game, Dortmund are expected to be on top of Group C, ahead of Schalke and Bayern on Thursday. Schaller is due to return from injury on Friday. Second-placed Frankfurt are likely to face the defending champions on Saturday. Third-division side Frankfurt have already been eliminated from Group A. Despite their poor form in last week's Europa League group stage win over Hanns-Kanz-Wolfsburg, Frankfurt can only hope to improve their chances of reaching the knockout stage. Both sides are currently on their way to Europe's elite division. Mainland hosts Hannsburg are on course to qualify for next season"

        "target": "Is China seeking regime-change in North Korea? The sudden reduction in aggressive rhetoric and actions by North Korea has led to suggestions that Pyongyang has realized it has pushed its only ally in the region to the brink of severing its friendship. The announcement in Pyongyang on May 13 of the promotion of Jang Jong-nam to \"minister of the People's Armed Forces\" came out of the blue. Until recently, the little-known commander of an army corps in coastal Kangwon Province, Jang has replaced Kim Kyok-sik, a four-star general with a long track record of loyal service to the regime. The reasons for 70-year-old Kim's replacement are not clear - as with most of the political maneuvers in North Korea - but it may have been his loyalty that cost him his position in the politburo. Kim was widely seen as a hawk in the regime and is believed to have been in command of the operation to shell the South Korean island of Yeonpyeongdo in November 2010, an incident that killed four people, destroyed civilians' homes and infrastructure and dramatically worsened the already strained relationship between Pyongyang and Seoul. By sacrificing Kim, analysts believe, North Korea is signaling that it is backing away from the confrontational stance it adopted after the United Nations imposed new sanctions in the wake of the nation's third underground nuclear test in February. And there are other indicators that Pyongyang is seeking to return to the status quo. The North's troops have been permitted to step down from the highest state of preparedness for war that was initially ordered when South Korea and the US began a series of annual military exercises. Missiles withdrawn Similarly, two Musudan intermediate-range missiles that were identified as being on mobile launchers being operated in eastern areas of the country have apparently been ordered to return to base. In late April, there was concern that test-launches of the missiles would be a further escalation by Kim Jong-un's government and a message that it would not bow to international pressure to halt its nuclear and missile development programs. But the analysts believe the tokens of Pyongyang's goodwill have come too late. \"For the North Korean leader, this is a very difficult time,\" Toshimitsu Shigemura, a professor at Tokyo's Waseda University and an authority on North Korean affairs, told DW. \"Timing is very important here and it is possible that China is moving to abandon Kim Jong-un. The atmosphere between the two nations is changing. China may have decided that it is time for a regime-change in the North, they will not permit the collapse of the country because they do not want chaos on their own borders.\" Further evidence that Beijing is slowly tightening the screw on its erstwhile ally comes as more state-run financial institutions sever their links with banks in North Korea. The latest institution to adhere to the government's orders to halt transactions across the border is the Bank of China, one of the four major banks in the country, which announced on May 7 that it would cease dealings with the Foreign Trade Bank of North Korea, which has been identified as being involved in Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs. Contingency plan in place Intelligence sources have passed on to DW information that Beijing has a contingency plan in place for when Kim Jong-un's control over the country crumbles. The reports confirm that China is indeed quietly encouraging regime change and is grooming Kim's brother, Kim Jong-nam to take over his role. At 42, Kim Jong-nam is the oldest son of Kim Jong-il, the dictator who ruled North Korea with an iron fist for 17 years until his sudden death in December 2011. Kim Jong-nam had been expected to assume the leadership after his father's death, but fell from favor spectacularly in 2001 when he was detained with two women and a boy aged 4 at Tokyo's Narita International Airport travelling on a forged Dominican Republic passport. He later admitted that he had wanted to visit Disneyland. He subsequently lived in Macau and Beijing, under the close watch of the Chinese authorities. The reports suggest that after Kim Jong-nam is installed in Pyongyang, his brother will be permitted to go into exile, probably in China. The tactic is not without its pitfalls, however, in part due to the efficiency of the campaign to deify their young leader as the future of the nation. Kim Jong-nam as 'new king' \"China may be dreaming of appointing Kim Jong-nam as the new king - and he is more preferable to the West than Kim Jong Un - but the problem is that he is not known in North Korea,\" said Ken Kato, director of Tokyo-based Human Rights in Asia. \"Many people in Japan know much about the North Korean 'Royal Family,' but this information is hidden in North Korea,\" he said. \"Even residents of Pyongyang know very little about Kim Jong-nam.\" Yet the reports are gaining credence among North Korea-watchers. Jun Okumura, a political analyst with the Eurasia Group, told DW that North Korea withdrawing",
        "generated_story": "North Korea's 'new king' Kim Jong-un has become the new king of North Korea. The North Korean leader is expected to be sworn in as the country's new leader by the end of the year. But he has yet to take the oath of office, which will be handed over to his younger brother, Kim Kyok-sik, who will take over as head of state in the next few months. \"I am going to do everything in my power to make this happen,\" Kim said at a news conference in Seoul on Tuesday. He said that he would \"do everything I can\" in order to \"make the world a better place\" and \"to make it a more peaceful place for the people of this country to live and work together.\" He also said he was \"very happy\" with Kim's decision to step down from his post as leader, saying that it was the right decision for him to return to the leadership of his country. However, he did not rule out the possibility of a change in leadership, as he said in a speech at the annual meeting of parliament in Pyongyang on Wednesday. In the past, the North Koreans have been able to form their own government, but now they have become increasingly isolated. Kim has been living in exile in South Korea for more than a decade, and has not been seen in public since he took office in 2011, when he fled to China. On Tuesday, however, his regime took a step back and said it would continue to cooperate with the United Nations and the International Criminal Court (ICC) in its efforts to find a way to deal with Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs. It is also believed that Kim is planning to use his new title as a weapon of war against the US and other countries, including Russia, China, Japan, France, Britain, Germany, Italy, Spain, Russia and Japan. According to a statement from the Chinese Foreign Ministry, \"the new regime will not use the term \"unification\" to refer to any form of military power.\" The statement added that \"it is not the first time that the regime has used the word unification to describe its new ruler.\" \"It is the second time,\" the statement said, referring to Kim and his wife Kim, according to Reuters news agency, Jiji Press, citing a report by an expert at Waseda University in Tokyo, adding that Pyongyang was preparing for a possible military confrontation with Washington, D.C. If Kim was to become a dictator, it is likely that Washington would have to intervene to prevent him from doing so. That would be a very difficult task for Kim to accomplish. For now, though, there is no doubt that his government is ready to give up its nuclear weapons and its ballistic missiles. We are not ready for that. There is a lot of pressure on the Kim regime. I think it's very important that we have a strong leader who is willing to stand up for what we believe in. And that is why we want to see him in power,\" said Toshimitsu Shigemura, a professor of political science at U.N. think-tank in Beijing, in an interview with DW. China's foreign ministry spokesman, Jun Okumura told DW that China had been working hard to improve relations between the two countries' relations and Pyongyang and that they had reached a point where they were \"at an impasse\" where it could be difficult to reach an agreement on denuclearization. Beijing has also been trying to convince Pyongyang to accept the terms of its disarmament treaty with Seoul and Washington to allow it to move forward with a nuclear-armed Korean nation. This has led to tensions between North and South Korean neighbors to escalate, with China threatening to impose sanctions on Pyongyang if it does not agree to disarm. Pyongyang has refused to sign a new nuclear agreement with Beijing over the nuclear issue, even though it has agreed to freeze its weapons program for now. A spokesman for Beijing's Foreign Minister Jang Yong-shik said earlier this month that a deal would not be reached until the negotiations were completed with North's government. North Koreans are also looking for ways to reduce tensions and reduce its dependence on weapons imports. Analysts say this is unlikely to happen, given the current political situation in their country, where tensions are already high. Last week, Pyongyang issued a warning to Seoul that its economy was in danger of falling into the hands of Washington and Beijing. They also warned that this could lead to an escalation of tensions with Moscow, Beijing and Moscow. Meanwhile, Seoul is preparing to send a delegation of experts to Beijing to discuss the situation. Seoul has already sent a letter to Pyongyang, calling for an end to sanctions against Pyongyang. Washington is currently in talks with its own foreign minister, Tae-hwan Yang, on a visit to meet with Xi Jinping, to visit Pyongyang next week. Reuters, AFP, dpa, The Associated Press and Reuters have reported that Xi is due to hold a meeting with Chinese President Moon Jae-in on Thursday. Read more closely monitoring"

        "target": "UK lawmakers propose jail sentences for reckless bankers A British parliamentary commission has completed its work on the overhaul of the domestic banking sector. Among other things, it proposed jail terms for bankers displaying grave malpractice and causing huge damage. Members of the UK's Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards agreed Wednesday that Britain needed a radical overhaul of its scandal-hit lenders. The panel, which was mostly composed of lawmakers, concluded in its final report that senior bankers must be made personally responsible for malpractice through the introduction of a new criminal offence of reckless misconduct. It would carry a prison sentence. The reputation of the country's banking sector had been damaged in recent years by a string of scandals, including Libor rate-rigging, credit insurance mis-selling and a controversy over staff behavior and bonuses in the run-up to the 2008 global financial crisis. The level of malpractice had been \"shocking and widespread,\" said the commission's chairman, Conservative party lawmaker Andrew Tyrie. RBS cut in two? \"Taxpayers and customers have lost out, and the economy has suffered,\" the 500-page report said. \"Under our recommendations, senior bankers who seriously damage their banks or put taxpayers' money at risk can expect to be fined, banned from the industry or in the worst cases go to jail.\" The commission called for bankers to sign up to a new code of conduct under which all key responsibilities within a bank would be assigned to specific senior officials who would be held responsible. The panel also proposed that more remuneration for bankers should be deferred for longer periods of up to ten years in order to \"reflect the longer run balance between business risks and rewards.\" The commission recommended that the government consider splitting the state-rescued Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) into a good bank and a bad one mopping up toxic assets. The report was published ahead of a key speech by Finance Minister George Osborne on his bank reform plans. hg/ipj (AFP, Reuters)",
        "generated_story": "Bank Mafia: A British Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards has issued a report on the banking mafia in the UK. The report, published by the parliamentary commission on banking standards, found that the financial services industry is rife with fraud and corruption. \"There is a widespread perception that banks are corrupt,\" said Andrew Tyrie, the head of the Parliamentary commission, which was set up by former Prime Minister George Osborne to investigate the scandal. He said: \"This is not the case at all. There is no evidence to suggest that there is any fraud in banking. It is simply the fact that people are not aware of what they are doing and that they don't have the right to do it.\" The commission's report is due to be published on Thursday, and it is expected that it will look into the bank mafia's role in Britain's banking system. According to the report's findings, there was widespread fraud at the Royal Bank of Scotland and other financial institutions, including HSBC, HSBC and Lloyds Banking Group (LBS), which were both bailed out by Osborne in 2009. But the commission also said that fraud was rife at both the British and Scottish banks, as well as at other banks in Europe and the United States, where banks have been accused of fraud, corruption and abuse of power. This is the first time that a British bank has been found to have committed a crime, according to a parliamentary report released on Wednesday. In the past, it was the banks that had been suspected of being involved in financial crimes, such as the attempted murder of a bank director in London in 2008. Since then, they have denied any wrongdoing and said they had no knowledge of any such crime. However, in recent years, a number of scandals have come to light. One of them was that of HSBC's chief executive, who was convicted of bank fraud. Another was when he was in charge of setting up the HSBC branch in central London. That case, he said, was a case of mistaken suspicion, because the company had a reputation for being a \"bank mafia.\" \"It's not just that we have a banking industry that is corrupt, but that has a lot of money in it,\" he told the committee. Other scandals: The financial crisis in 2007 and 2008, when British banks were hit by a series of high-profile financial scandals, led to an increase in interest rates and a rise in bank debt. At the same time, banking scandals were rife in other parts of Europe, particularly in countries like Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Spain. Financial markets have also been hit hard by scandals over the last few years. Banksters and regulators have accused banks of trying to manipulate the market by manipulating the value of their assets to gain access to capital markets. They've also accused the government of failing to protect the interests of its own customers. And they've been caught up in that, too, with the central bank's failure to act on their own. As a result, many of these banks' customers have lost their money, leaving them unable to pay their bills. These problems have become a source of concern for many people. For example, one bank in Germany is struggling to make ends meet, while another in France is facing a similar situation in Italy where it has lost millions of euros ($1.6 billion) in losses. A second bank, Royal Dutch Shell, is also struggling with similar problems in Spain and Italy. Both have suffered from a lack of transparency in its dealings with banks. Last year, Barclays and Deutsche Bank were among the worst offenders. Barclays said it had lost more than 1.5 billion euros (about $2.4 billion), while HSBC suffered a loss of $3.7 billion. HSBC has also suffered losses of nearly $4.3 billion, followed by Barclays, Citigroup and HSBC. Analysts say this is likely to continue, given the high levels of corruption in their banking sector. Banks are the biggest victims of this problem, analysts say, of which HSBC is only one of many. Experts say the problem is that many banks do not have enough capital to cover their costs. So, what should be done is to find a way to reduce the cost of doing business in a country where there are so few banks to invest in, say experts, to avoid the risk of losing money. If the situation continues to worsen, that could be a problem for the country's banks and banks will have to look to other countries, experts say. Meanwhile, regulators are also looking for ways to cut costs in order to improve their ability to lend money to their customers and reduce their exposure to foreign investors. Many banks also face the prospect of having to borrow money from the European Central Bank (ECB) for a third time since the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2011. British banking giant HSBC reported a profit of around $7.8 billion (around $6.2 billion). The bank is currently the world's largest lender by assets, although it's unclear how much of that money is going to get out of all together."

They were originally arrested for taking photographs of restricted areas. Slovak citizens detained by the Iranian authorities on suspicion of taking photographs out of bounds have returned home, said Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico. Eight people in total were arrested in May after taking photographs of restricted areas. A Slovakian news website said the group was detained near the central city of Isfahan, where Iran has nuclear facilities. The six that have been freed attended a news conference held by Prime Minister Fico in the capital, Bratislava on Sunday. Fico told reporters that the government was working to secure the release of the remaining two paragliders who are stiil in custody. \"Negotiations were fair and their result is the release of six out of eight detainees,\" Fico was quoted as saying on the government's website. He added that Slovakia had not made any \"financial commitments\" in the negotiation process. Detainees 'unaware' of rule-breaking One of the released paragliders, Vladislav Frigo, said the group did not break any rules it was aware of. \"We had information that there was a ban on taking photographs below the height of 2,300 metres. We were taking pictures from higher (altitudes),\" said Frigo. He added that the detainees were well treated, had access to television, a refrigerator and could cook for themselves as well as getting regular meals. Foreign nationals accused of spying In recent years, Iran has levelled accusations of espionage against both foreign nationals and Iranians. Two U.S. citizens - Josh Fattal and Shane Bauer - were sentenced to eight years in jail for spying after being arrested while hiking along the Iraq-Iran border in 2009. They denied espionage - neighbouring Oman helped secure their release in 2011 by posting bail of 1-million US dollars (756,000 euros). Last year, Iranian-American Amir Hekmati was sentenced to death for spying for the CIA, but judges overturned the decision and ordered a retrial. lw/ipj (Reuters, dpa)",

The release of the six is the latest in a series of arrests in the country's crackdown on anti-government protests against the Iranian regime. They were arrested in Bratislava on Tuesday, a day after the Slovaker parliament voted in favor of a referendum on whether to recognize President Vladimir Putin's regime as a legitimate one. \"We are not going to allow this to happen again,\" said Vladislav Frigo, head of Slovakia's parliament. Fico said he had been detained in connection with the protests, which he said were part of an attempt to undermine the government's rule of law. He said the arrests came after he received a tip from an Iranian official that he was in contact with Fattal, who was arrested on Wednesday. According to the official's statement, \"the arrests were made on the basis of information received from the intelligence services.\" The two men, both from Slovakia, are believed to have fled to Iran from Iran in 2009, when they fled in search of refuge in Europe. Friga said they had returned to Slovakia in 2010, but had not been able to reach the U.S. in time for the referendum. In the meantime, they've been living in Slovakia for a year and a half, according to their lawyer, Shane Bauer. Bauer said his client was \"very happy\" to be released, adding that \"it's a good thing that we have a lot of people who are willing to cooperate with us.\" \"It's good to know that they're doing the right thing,\" he told reporters in an interview with The New York Times. But he added that it's not the first time that Slovakia has been accused of being a spy state, and that the charges against them are \"unfounded.\" He also said it was not possible for Slovakia to extradite the men to Tehran, where they are being held on charges of espionage, money laundering and tax evasion. On the other hand, he did say he would like to see them extradited back to his home country of Slovakia, in order to get a better understanding of what is going on in his country and what the situation is like in other countries, including the US and the EU. Slovakia and Iran have long been at loggerheads over the past few years over their relationship with each other. Last year, Slovakia was one of several countries in which the two countries had a spat, with Slovakia accusing Iran of meddling in its internal affairs. It was the second time in recent years that Iran had accused Slovakia of violating the terms of its extradition treaty with Washington. This time, however, it is not a case that has led to a diplomatic spat between the countries. A court has ruled that both sides must cooperate in resolving the dispute, as well as the question of who is responsible for what, exactly, is being done with which Slovakia is involved. That is, if there is an agreement on how to resolve the issue. For the time being, there will be no resolution of this dispute. However, this does not necessarily mean that there won't be a resolution to this issue, at least not until the end of next year's parliamentary session. There is still a chance that a deal can be reached with Iran, even if it means a new round of elections in November. As a result of that, more Slovakers will have to take part in parliamentary elections next month. Author: Robert Ficoli / AFP, Reuters, AP, dpa, AFP/dpa (Reuters)The arrests come after a two-week period of political tension between Iran and Slovakia. One of them, Vincenzo Ziegler, was detained last week in Tehran for allegedly spying on Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and his wife. Another is in exile in Germany. His wife, Maria, has also been charged with spying for Iran's Foreign Ministry. Both men have denied any involvement in this case, saying they have no knowledge of any alleged crimes against Slovakia that have taken place during the last two years. Russian officials have also accused the Russian government of trying to influence the outcome of their divorce proceedings. At the same time they say they will continue to investigate the case. Russia's ambassador to Russia, Vladimir Fincoli, says he has not seen any evidence of wrongdoing in relation to any of these cases. Moscow has said that Russia has no plans to interfere in any way at all. Meanwhile, Iran is also looking into the matter of whether or not it will interfere with any future elections. What do you think about the upcoming elections? Is it possible that this could be the beginning of another political crisis in Russia? The Russian Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov, said on Twitter on Thursday that Moscow could not be involved in such an election meddling probe. Putin has denied the allegations, accusing the Kremlin of attempting to meddle in elections, while the others have not yet. And he"

The 89-year-old did not say when exactly his resignation would take effect. Calling the move a personal decision, President Giorgio Napolitano made his announcement during an end-of-year speech on Wednesday. \"I'm about to step down, to resign as the constitution expressly allows,\" he said, adding. \"I've reached an age that brings with it growing limitations and difficulties for me to do my institutional duties, which are complex and very demanding.\" Though he did not say when his resignation would take effect, a potential date is January 13 when Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi is due to give up the country's rotating six-month presidency of the Council of the European Union. Renzi faces a political challenge in organizing a replacement for Napolitano, dubbed by Italian media as \"King George.\" The president has served as a key intermediary between political parties through numerous changes in government and other tricky political situations. Napolitano, a former communist respected by Europe and Washington, took office in 2006. At the end of his seven-year mandate in 2013, he was asked to stay on because parliament could not agree on his successor. At the time he warned he may not serve out the full term, given his age. In Italy, presidents have loosely-defined powers including the ability to nominate prime ministers, dissolve parliament and veto legislation, as well as use the moral authority of the office to influence politics. se/cmk (dpa, Reuters)",
        "generated_story": "Giorgio Napolitano resigns as European Union president Italy's president has resigned as the EU's head of state, replacing Matteo Renzi. The resignation comes after months of speculation over the role of the European Commission president. Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has said he will step down from his post at the end of this month. \"I am resigning as EU president,\" he said in a statement, adding that he would not seek re-election in the coming months. He also said that Italy would continue to cooperate with the bloc's efforts to improve relations between the two countries. But he did not specify which EU member states would accept his resignation, saying only that it would be up to the Council of European States to decide whether to accept the resignation. Italy has repeatedly rejected the idea of a new EU presidency, which would allow it to take place at a time when EU membership is at an all-time low. It would also be the first time since the 1990s that an Italian president had stepped down as president of an EU-member bloc. In the past, Italy had been the only EU country to have had a president who was elected by a majority of its members. Now, however, it has been decided that the new president will take over from the outgoing president, who had resigned in July. According to Italian news agency ANSA, the president's resignation came as a result of \"a lack of clarity\" on the future of Europe's relationship with Italy and the need for a European-wide dialogue on migration, migration and other issues. There is a growing sense of unease among Italians about the possibility of Italy becoming a member state again, but it is not clear whether this is the case in Italy, where the current president is from, or whether it will be due to political differences. For the time being, there is no clear consensus on how to resolve the issue, and a number of EU members have expressed concern that this could lead to a conflict of interest. However, in light of recent developments in Europe, Italian politicians have been calling for an end to this conflict. On Wednesday, President Giorgio Napolano announced that they would no longer be able to discuss the matter with European leaders, rather, they will have to work together to find a solution for the country's migration crisis. This will not be an easy task, as Italy is currently embroiled in an internal political crisis, with many of them seeking to avoid a repeat of last year's crisis in which it was voted out of office by the Italian parliament. Napoli has also been accused of trying to influence the outcome of elections in several European countries, including the United States, France, Germany, Spain and Italy. Last year, he was forced to resign over a series of failed attempts to form a coalition government. His resignation was announced in response to criticism of his government's handling of migration policy. Many of those who have criticized his policies have called for him to be replaced by someone who is more experienced in European politics, such as former Italian President Enrico Letta, a former EU foreign policy chief who has worked closely with President Nicolas Sarkozy. France's President Francois Hollande, meanwhile, has called on France and Germany to do the same. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius to step aside as foreign minister in order to focus on his own domestic agenda, while German Chancellor Angela Merkel is expected to remain in office until at least the summer of 2019, according to French President Emmanuel Macron. Macron's government is also set to leave office in January, after a long period of uncertainty over his plans to return to Brussels. At the moment, Macron has not said whether he is going to seek a successor, although he has promised to make it a priority for Macron to come back to Rome in his bid to win a second term as prime minister. Meanwhile, European Council President, Antonio Tajani, said on Wednesday that France was not ready to give up its position on immigration until the next round of negotiations with Rome, despite the fact that EU leaders had already agreed to an agreement on a deal to end the crisis over migration. 'We are not prepared to let the situation get any worse,' Macron said, referring to his predecessor's departure from office as an example of how Italy should be treated by Europe. Both the French and German leaders have said they are willing to talk about a possible solution, though Macron is unlikely to agree to such a move. That is, of course, not likely to happen, since France has already said it won't be easy for Italy to move forward with a plan to reduce its membership of NATO. All three EU countries have already announced their support for France to join the 28-nation bloc, leaving Italy as one of only two remaining member countries to stay in talks with France. EU officials have also expressed their displeasure with Napoleonic's plans for his departure. A spokesman for French Chancellor Francois Fillon said France is \"not ready for that. We have not yet made a decision on whether or not France would take a position."

        "target": "Libya factions declare ceasefire After two days of peace talks in Geneva, a tentative ceasefire has been called in the restive North African country. Although they sent no representatives to Switzerland, Islamists have agreed to halt the fighting. The Islamist-backed militia alliance that took over Tripoli and installed its own government announced a ceasefire on Friday, following a breakthrough in Geneva-based peace talks. Despite not attending the UN-brokered meeting, the militias have agreed to \"a ceasefire on all fronts,\" according to a statement issued by Islamist group Fajr Libya (Libya Dawn). The only condition is that \"the other parties respect the truce.\" The announcement came hours after the United Nations declared that Libya's warring factions had agreed to a roadmap for forming a unity government. Nearly four years after a NATO-backed revolt saw Moammar Gadhafi removed from power, two rival governments each backed by different groups of militias have plunged the country back into chaos and threatened all-out civil war. After the elected government of Prime Minister Abdullah al-Thinni was forced out of Tripoli by Libya Dawn, it was forced to move to the far eastern city of Tobruk while Libya Dawn reinstated the old parliament known as the GNC. The fighting and violence has displaced hundreds of thousands of civilians, left hundreds killed and thousands wounded. Most foreign diplomats fled the country and shut their embassies last year. The Tobruk government, as well as a few other factions who favor a peaceful resolution, came to Geneva to work on \"confidence-building measures,\" which includes the release of detainees from both sides, opening closed ports and securing safe freedom of movement around the country. es/bw (AP, AFP, Reuters)",
        "generated_story": "Fajr Libya declares ceasefire after two days of peace talks The GNC has declared a ceasefire in the eastern region of Libya after a two-day cease-fire brokered by the internationally recognized government of former dictator Moammar Gadhafi. The ceasefire broke down on Saturday, ending a week-long ceasefire between the two sides, which had been in place since the beginning of the year. According to a UN statement, the ceasefire was signed on Friday. \"We have agreed to cease all hostilities,\" the statement said, adding that it was the first day of talks in which the three sides were able to reach an agreement on the future of their country. It was also the second day in a row that ended with a truce, according to UN spokesman Abdullah al-Thinni, who said the truce was agreed upon after talks with the government in Tobruk had ended. In the end, both sides said they had reached a deal to end the fighting, and that they were ready to resume the peace process. However, it is not clear how long the talks will last, as there is still a long way to go before they can be concluded. A ceasefire has been agreed on, but it has not yet been ratified by all parties, including the UN and the International Criminal Court (ICC). The UN has called for an end to the conflict, saying it would be \"unacceptable\" for the regime to continue to use force against its own people. On Friday, however, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he would not rule out the possibility of a new peace deal. He also said that he was willing to accept the terms of an interim ceasefire, although he did not say whether the new deal would include a full-scale withdrawal of troops from the country's eastern province of Misrata. But he also stressed the need for a transitional government to take control of all the territory in order to prevent a return to civil war. UN envoy for Libya, Ammar Fayez, said in Geneva that the \"peace process\" would continue until the next round of negotiations was concluded on Sunday. Libya's new government is expected to be sworn in on Monday, a day after it announced it had suspended its military operations in eastern Libya. At the same time, international observers have been monitoring the situation in Tripoli, with some observers saying that there was a lack of coordination between government forces and armed groups. As a result, there were no immediate reports of any new clashes between security forces or the armed forces. There was no sign of violence between rival factions, though, at least in parts of eastern and western Libya and in some areas, some of them were still fighting for their lives. That is the main reason why the current government has refused to recognize it as a legitimate government, while others have said it won't allow it to do so. This is despite the fact that many of its troops are loyal to its former leader, former army general Abdullah Atta, have already been killed in clashes with pro-regime militias in recent weeks. Some observers believe that this could be the last time the army will be allowed to enter the Libyan capital, Tripoli. Other observers say it could take a few days before it can take over the city of Benghazi, where the military is due to hold a general election in November. Meanwhile, opposition groups are calling for new elections in December. They say that if the elections are held in January, they will not be held until February, when the opposition will have a chance to win a majority of seats in parliament and parliament. 'We are not going to give up until we have the opportunity to elect a president,' said Abdullah, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the outcome of this week's talks. Speaking to reporters, he said: \"I am not giving up my position on this. I am calling on all sides to come to terms with what has happened. We will continue our efforts to find a peaceful solution to this conflict.\" \"The ceasefire is a good thing,\" he told reporters at a news conference in Tunis, Tunisia, on Thursday, after the Geneva talks broke off. Talks have so far failed to produce any breakthroughs on a peace agreement. Many of those who have remained in Libya have expressed concern about the violence that has taken place during the past few months, such as former President Abdullah and his wife Abdullahi Fayechi. (Reuters, AP, AFP, dpa, Reuters) \"There is no doubt that we will see a change of government,\" Abdullah said. His comments came in response to questions from journalists who had asked him to step down from his post as prime minister. After a series of phone calls with journalists, many people have asked for his resignation. For now, I have not heard from him. You can read more about his comments in this article. All I can tell you is that I think it's a very good day for our country and I hope the people of Tripoli are happy to hear from you. Let's hope that peace is possible, because we can now that"

        "target": "Report: Torture is a European problem too A day after Amnesty International published a report on Europe's collusion with the CIA's torture program, the Council of Europe published its own shocking survey of abuse in detention centers across the continent. Prison guards in several European countries carried out reprisals against detainees who talked to the Council of Europe's Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT), the new CPT report has revealed. The council considers this a violation of the spirit of cooperation between the CPT and the Council of Europe's member states. According to the CPT's 24th General Report, released on Wednesday, reprisals were carried out against prisoners in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Greece, Hungary, Moldova, Russia, Spain, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and Ukraine. \"Intimidation or retaliation against persons the CPT has interviewed may not only violate their human rights but also strikes a blow to the preventive mechanism established by the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture,\" CPT President Letif H\u00fcseynov said in a statement. \"I urge national authorities to respect their obligation to prevent, investigate and punish such actions.\" The report also highlighted several problems with the detention of juveniles around Europe, and proposed a series of practical measures to protect young people's rights when detained. Ad hoc visits The little-known CPT, now 25 years old, represents a unique approach to international torture prevention. A team of specialists make roughly 180 visits a year to all kinds of detention centers (including prisons, police stations, holding centers for immigration detainees, psychiatric hospitals, and even social care homes) all across the 47-member Council of Europe - one of the few international blocs that offer platforms for dialogue with Eastern European regimes considered to have poor human rights records, such as Russia, Azerbaijan, and Ukraine. The method combines the carrot of talks with government officials and the stick of ad hoc visits, which all members are committed to allowing into their prisons. Once inside, the CPT also has the right to interview any detainees it chooses - in private, though of course the detainees have the right to refuse. \"The first thing to say is how important the CPT is,\" said Carla Ferstman, director of Redress, a UK-based organization that helps torture survivors. \"As a result of their boot work over a very long period of time, the UN has set up a global system which in many ways mirrors the approach of the CPT.\" But given that the committee has no powers to enforce its proposals to governments, there are question marks over its effectiveness. \"In the report, they complain about how some of the recommendations they've made have not been implemented,\" said Ferstman. \"It's a sign that they're a little bit frustrated.\" But in the long run, she maintains, the CPT has more than proved its value. \"The dialogue that they are able to have is really important,\" she said. \"Looking long-term, they have been very effective.\" CIA collusion, asylum seekers The CPT's report comes a day after Amnesty International released its own report on European collusion with the CIA's torture program. While the CPT's report examines more prosaic day-to-day mistreatment, rather than mass rendition of terrorist suspects at the behest of the US, there are obvious links between the two, since some countries - such as Poland, Macedonia, and the UK - are highlighted in both reports. \"What is finally coming out in all of this is that the Europeans, despite all the criticism of the Bush and Obama administrations on the use of torture - so many of them connived,\" said Judy Dempsey, senior associate at Carnegie Europe. \"It's really a double standard. This report is quite damning and quite shameful, and it follows the Amnesty International one as well.\" The CPT's work also mentions the mistreatment of asylum seekers, a problem increasingly afflicting European countries that take in the largest number of asylum seekers - particularly Spain, Italy, and Greece. \"With Greece there are two things to remember,\" Dempsey told DW. \"A - the appalling situation of the prison system, and B - the lack of training among police of how to deal with asylum seekers. Awful things have happened. Parallel to this is the illegal detention centers. There have been lots of cases of terrible mistreatment over the last several years.\" \"Immigration detention is a growing issue,\" added Ferstman. \"In the UK, there was a whole parliamentary inquiry into one immigration detention center, where some of the women alleged that guards propositioned them in order to get quick treatment on their claims. Each country has its own history of torture.\"",
        "generated_story": "The CPT is a European problem too -- and it's time to step up its game. The United States has been accused of using torture in the past, but now the US and its allies are stepping up their efforts to tackle the problem. US President Barack Obama has called on the European Union to do more to combat torture. \"We need to take a step back,\" he said in an interview with DW's Carla Ferstman, who is the head of the Council of Europe's Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT). \"It's not just about torture,\" she said, adding that \"it's also about the prevention of human rights violations.\" The US has also stepped up the use of torture, which has led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people across the globe over the last two decades. It's a global problem, too, and the U.S. is not the first country to use torture as a weapon of war. In the United Kingdom, for example, the CIA has used torture for more than a decade. But in Europe, torture has become a way of life for many people, including many who have been tortured and killed by their captors. That's why it is so important that we have the right to protect ourselves and our children from torture and other forms of abuse. This is why we are calling for an end to torture at the hands of our own government. We are not going to allow torture to continue in this way, because we don't want it to happen to other people. And we want to make sure that it doesn't happen again. I think that's what we should be doing. Letif H\u00fcseynov, director of research at Carnegie Europe in London, told DW: \"I think we need a change in our approach. You have to be very careful about what you do and how you use it. There are a lot of things that can be done to prevent this from happening again.\" \"There is no need for this kind of punishment,\" said Judy Dempsey, co-chair of Redress, a think-tank that has worked with former US president George W. Bush's Office of National Security (UNESCO) to develop a new policy on torture that will make it easier for people to get away with torturing their own children and their families, rather than being forced to go through the torture process,\" Dempsey said at a press conference on Wednesday. She added that the current US administration is \"not willing to give in to pressure\" and that there are \"a number of countries that are willing and able to cooperate with our efforts,\" but that they should also be prepared to work with other countries, such as the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Japan, China, Russia, Turkey, Iran, Egypt, Israel and Turkey. They should all do their part to ensure that their children are treated fairly and with respect, as well as their parents and grandparents. However, this isn't the case for all of us. As a matter of fact, many of these countries are already doing the same thing -- including Germany and France. Germany is one of those countries with the highest levels of authoritarianism, while France and Britain are the only ones that have not done the exact opposite. According to a recent report by the UN Human Rights Council (HRRC) report, \"The US government is doing everything it can in its power to stop torture of its own citizens,\" which is based in Geneva, Switzerland, in order to reduce the risk of future abuses of detainees. These countries have a long history of abusing detainees, particularly those who are subjected to harsh conditions, like torture under the guise of medical treatment. Nevertheless, they are doing their utmost to avoid the possibility of being held accountable for what they do not do. At the very least, there is an opportunity to change the way they treat detainees in detention centers and prisons. For the most part, it will be a very difficult task to find a solution to this problem -- but it won't be an easy task. So, let's see what the next step is for them. After all, if they can't do it themselves, then they will have no choice but to try and do something about it, at least for themselves. If they cannot do that, that would be the end of this country's long-term goal of ending the practice. No one wants to see the world's worst torture program, right? That is exactly what I'm hoping for -- that is, until we get to that point in time, when we can start to understand what is going on in their country. What we're hoping to achieve is that this is something that Europe can do to its citizens and to help them get out of their homes and into the arms of other nations. President Bush has made it clear that he is committed to doing what he believes is right. He has said he will do everything he can to improve the situation in his own country, so long as they're doing it in a positive way. Last week,"

        "target": "Dresden marks 70 years since massive Allied bombing Seventy years ago, Allied bombers attacked Dresden, killing tens of thousands of people, the majority of them civilians and refugees. Every year, the East German city remembers its dead. DW's Naomi Conrad was on hand. As the tram trundled through Dresden's drab suburbs on Friday morning, a prim, elderly woman suddenly turned to her friend sitting on the seat beside her: \"You know, my mother never told me about the bombings.\" She shrugged, then, after a moment's pause, continued. \"It must have been such unspeakable hell that she just couldn't talk about it,\" the woman said. She was referring to February 13, 1945 - the morning, exactly 70 years ago, when Allied bombers swooped down on an unsuspecting city famous for its baroque architecture and that, until that point, had survived the war mostly unscathed. That was to change in the course of three dreadful days: As the bombs rained down on the city, its churches and palaces were turned to rubble. Up to 25,000 people - many of them refugees fleeing the advancing Soviet Red Army - died in the inferno that raged in the city for days. \"There was nothing left, nothing,\" a frail, bent man with a checkered cap recalled, \"just rubble and death.\" He was leaning on the balustrade of a viewing platform in Dresden's old gasometer, staring down at the 360-degree painting by the Iranian-German artist Yadegar Asisi; sirens howled from hidden speakers and strobe lighting illuminated the ruined churches and black smoke billowing from the burnt skeletons that were once buildings. The man swallowed, his voice hoarse, barely audible: \"It's so hard being here.\" The soundtrack and images, he said, \"bring back too many memories.\" 'So, so many dead' He was 15, he recalled, working on a school essay when the sirens began to wail. He never finished the essay. Instead, he ran for shelter with his family. When they returned home three days later, the roof had been blown off, the windows smashed. \"But we were lucky: We survived,\" he said. \"There were so, so many dead.\" His voice broke and, muttering an apology, he shuffled off. The bombings were intended to break the German population's morale - a decision that to many was incomprehensible, given that the war had long been decided and Dresden's economic and strategic importance was relatively minimal. Consequently, the death and destruction wreaked by the Allied bombers quickly became a tool, first for the Nazi propagandists in the last months of the war, then by the East German regime for its anti-West propaganda, and then later by neo-Nazi groups, who traditionally congregate on February 13. Even today, \"the debate continues about guilt and innocence, even about the exact number of victims,\" Dresden Mayor Helma Orosz told a packed audience, including delegations from abroad, gathered for a memorial service in the city's Frauenkirche, which in 2005 was rebuilt with the help of private donations after Germany's reunification, many of them from the United States and Great Britain. Call for peace \"War, hatred and violence begin in people's minds,\" Orosz said. \"We must resist any attempt at once again categorizing people based on their origin and skin color,\" she added, referring to what has often been described as a right-wing catchall movement called PEGIDA, generally translated as Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West, which has taken to the streets in Dresden since October. Later, on a platform overlooking thousands of people, many of them wearing white roses as a sign of peace while bracing the icy cold outside the church, Orosz called on Dresden to remember every victim of the Nazi terror - a plea that was reiterated by German President Joachim Gauck when he took to the microphone: \u201cWe don't want the pain that people suffered here to be misused by others.\u201d Behind him, the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, who, back in the Frauenkirche, had talked of the \u201cmiracle that peace in Europe represents,\u201d leaned in closer to his interpreter. Then, as evening fell over Dresden and church bells tolled, thousands - possibly as many as 10,000, according to the city's press office - lined up along Dresden's riverfront, holding hands to commemorate the dead and call for peace as police men dressed in black riot gear looked on. \"I can remember it all,\" Siegfriede Leonhard, a vivacious woman in her late 70s said. She was 7 when the bombs fell, she said, and had been coming to the commemorations in Dresden \"for at least 60 years.\" Sometimes, she said, stomping her feet to keep warm, she wondered whether she shouldn't remember at home, alone. \"",
        "generated_story": "German city of Dresden hit by Allied bombings in February 1945 Dresden, Germany, on February 13, 1945, was bombed by the Soviet Red Army during World War II. The city was one of the most heavily bombed cities in Europe during the war. German Chancellor Joachim Gauck, who was then the head of Germany's Communist Party (KPD), said in a statement that the bombing was \"an act of war against the people of Europe.\" The attack was part of a series of bombings that targeted the German capital, the Frauenkirche, as well as other German cities, including Berlin, Dresden and Dresden. It was the first time the city had been targeted by an Allied bombing campaign since the Cold War ended in 1945. \"It was a terrible day for Dresden,\" said German Foreign Minister Helma Orosz, adding that it was also the worst day in the history of German foreign policy. In the days following the attack, many people in Dresden had fled their homes and fled to neighboring countries. Many of them had returned to Germany in order to escape the bombings. But the attacks on Dresden did not end there. As a result, a number of people were killed and hundreds of thousands of others were injured, according to eyewitnesses. Most of those killed were civilians, but a few were children, and many were elderly. According to the eyewitness accounts, at least 10,000 people died. Some of these people, however, died in their own homes, while others died on their way to a nearby hospital. Nazi Germany has been accused of bombing Dresden for more than a decade, with many of its citizens having fled the country in search of refuge in Germany. Germany is also accused by some in Iran of being involved in an attempt to overthrow the communist regime. However, it is not clear whether this is the case, or whether it's a case of mistaken identity, which is what the Germans are accusing the Soviets of trying to do. At the time, there were no official reports of any attacks. On February 14, 1944, German police said they had received a letter from a man who said he was in contact with a member of Hitler's inner circle, Yadegar Asisi. He told the newspaper that he had seen the letter and had asked the police to take it to him. Later that day, he said, \"I was told that I was not the only one who had heard of this incident. I am not aware of what happened.\" Germany and Iran have long been at loggerheads over the fate of their relations. They have been fighting each other for decades over what they believe to be a long time. For decades, they have fought a bitter war over who should be allowed to rule the world and what should happen to them. Now they are fighting for what is right and who is wrong. And they want to make sure that they don't get caught up in it. That is why the Berlin Wall was built on the idea that Germany should not be able to protect itself from the threat of an attack. This is a very important issue for the future of relations between the United States and the West, because it would mean that we would have to face the consequences of our own actions if we didn't have the right to defend ourselves and our country's interests at the same time as we are doing so. We are not going to allow this to happen. There are many reasons for this, of course. One is that there are a lot of problems with the current situation in our relations with Iran, for example, that Iran has become a hostile power. Iran is an example of how this can be exploited by other countries, such as Russia and China. So, in this way, we have a problem. What do you think about this? Do you agree with me on this point? Is it a good idea to talk about it? If so, what would you say to me? I think the answer is no. If you disagree with my view, then let me tell you that you are right. You are wrong and you have no idea what I'm talking about. Let's start by saying that what you're saying is true. After all, you can't be sure about what's going on in your own country. Why is it so hard for you to fight for your country? You can only be so far away from it, right? And what are you doing? Why should you do that? What is your opinion? The German government has to decide for yourself? It's not a matter of whether or not it will be possible to change the way we do things. How can we be more tolerant of Iran? That's the question that is being asked of us. Is there a solution to this problem? How do we react to what we're doing here? We're not sure. Do we think we can do something about the situation? Or is there something we should do differently? Let us talk to our friends in Berlin? In this case we'll be very careful with your friends and let's reaction"

        "target": "At least 18 people killed in Haiti Carnival mishap At least 18 people are reported to have been killed in an accident during Carnival festivities in Haiti. Many others were wounded when the float they were traveling on made contact with a power line. Officials in Port-au-Prince said the accident occurred as thousands of revelers filled the streets of the city center of the Haitian capital in the early hours of Tuesday. The Associated Press quoted witnesses at the scene who reported seeing somebody on one of the floats used a stick or pole to move a power line so that the vehicle could pass under it. Reuters cited a witness who reported seeing the head of a singer from the hip-hop band Barikad Crew make contact with the power line. Some of the victims were electrocuted instantly, while others jumped off the float, causing panic among the revelers who lined the street. Many of the at least 18 deaths came as a result of the ensuing panic, while at more than 40 others were injured, according to local authorities. There was some confusion about the number of fatalities, with the Associated Press putting it at 20, and AFP later reported that only around 10 had died. Haitian President Michel Martelly used his Twitter account to express his condolences to the injured and bereaved. \"My sincere sympathies to the victims of the serious incident that occurred this morning at the Champ de Mars (area in downtown Port-au-Prince),\" the president said. pfd/rc (AP, Reuters, AFP)",
        "generated_story": "Haiti Carnival mishap: At least 18 people have died in Haiti's worst ever Carnival disaster, police say. The death toll rose to 18 on Saturday, with at least 19 people injured. Police said they were searching for survivors of the deadly accident, which took place in Champ de Mars, near the capital of Port-au-Prince. Authorities have said the accident was the worst in the country's history. \"We are still trying to ascertain the cause of this tragedy,\" police said in a statement, adding that it was a \"serious accident\" and that authorities were still investigating. They added that the incident was not the result of a deliberate act of sabotage, but rather an accident that was caused by the negligence of people who were not aware of what was going on at the time. According to local media, the disaster occurred on the night of Carnival, when a car plowed into a crowd of thousands of Haitians at a carnival, causing a number of deaths. Several people were injured, according to the police, while others suffered minor injuries. Many of those who died were children, said police spokesman Michel Martelly. He said he was unable to provide details on how many people had died, as well as the extent of their injuries, although he did say that some of them were minor. In addition, he said there were no reports of any injuries to other people, including that of an elderly man who had been seriously injured in an earlier accident. At the same time, authorities said that a man was found dead in his car, after being hit by a truck. Investigators are also looking into whether the car was deliberately driven by an unknown driver, or if the driver was intentionally driving the vehicle into the crowd. It is not clear if this is the case, however, and it could be a case of mistaken identity. Haiti has been plagued by deadly accidents over the past few years. Last year, more than 1,000 people died from a series of car accidents. More than 2,500 people are believed to have been injured during one of these accidents, officials said on Friday. Officials have not said what caused the crash, though they said it appeared to be related to an incident in which two men were killed and three others were seriously hurt. There were also reports that an explosion had taken place during the Carnival celebrations, leading to widespread panic among the Haitian population. But the government has yet to confirm the exact cause, saying it is too early to know. On Sunday, a police official told AFP news agency that there was no immediate claim of responsibility for the deaths, citing a lack of information from the emergency services. A police spokeswoman said: \"The investigation is still ongoing. We do not have any further information at this time.\" The incident occurred during a Carnival party, held on Sunday evening, at which the city's Carnival committee was meeting to discuss how to handle the situation. About 1.5 million people attended the event, organizers said. However, they did not provide any information on what had happened. One of its organizers, Barikad Crew, told the Associated Press that \"it is very difficult to explain what happened.\" \"It is a very sad day for Haiti,\" the official said, referring to a tragedy that occurred in 2010 when the port city of Champ-de-Mars was flooded with water and sewage. Since then, it has become increasingly difficult for people to get out of port because of overcrowding and poor sanitation conditions, especially in areas where the water is scarce. That's why we are so concerned about the safety of tourists, who are not allowed to leave the area. This is because the ship was damaged, not because it's not safe to enter port but because people don't want to go into port. So, we have to wait until the next day to find out if there are any survivors. And that's what we're going to do. For now, there is no word yet on whether there will be an investigation into what exactly happened in this incident. I'm not sure what will happen next. What do we do know about this accident? We have no idea what to expect. Let's hope that we will have more information to share with the international community. If we know anything at all about it, let us know in our own words. (AP, AFP, Reuters, dpa) (Reuters, AP) \"I'm sure we can't say for sure that this was an isolated incident,\" he added. No one was injured and no one is being blamed for it. Nevertheless, I think we should be very careful about what happens next, because we need to keep our eyes and ears open to what is happening in port, so we won't be able to see what's happening here. You can see the damage that has already been done to Haiti, for example, by using the Internet, to avoid the possibility of another disaster. People are being asked to come back to our homes and then we'll have a better chance of finding out what has happened to their homes or not being evacuated."

The minister added that the cease-fire could be extended depending on the response from Yemen's Shiite Houthi rebels. Al-Jubeir said he hoped the Iran-backed rebels would \"come to their senses\" and agree to the truce. He urged them to stop fighting. \"We hope the Houthis will come to their senses and realize the interests of Yemen and the Yemeni people should be the top priority for everyone,\" he said. It is unclear whether the Houthis would reciprocate the Saudi gesture. \"The cease-fire will end should Houthis or their allies not live up to the agreement - this is a chance for the Houthis to show that they care about their people and they care about the Yemen people,\" the Saudi foreign minister emphasized. At this point, US Secretary of State John Kerry said anyone who cared about Yemeni people \"should take clear notice of the fact that a human catastrophe is building,\" adding that a cease-fire was \"not peace\" and that all parties must find a political solution to end the conflict. Kerry urged all sides to hold talks immediately. Saudi ultimatum Hours before the cease-fire announcement, Saudi Arabia declared a Houthi stronghold along its southern border a \"military target,\" giving an ultimatum to the residents to leave the area, Saudi state-run TV reported. Lately, the northern Yemeni province of Saada has become a battleground for the Shiite rebels and the Saud-led coalition forces as the Houthis carried out border attacks on nearby Saudi cities. More than 50 airstrikes hit Saada overnight and in the early hours of Friday morning, Yemeni officials said. A Saudi-led coalition of Arab states launched an air campaign against the Houthis on March 26. Riyadh accuses Tehran of backing the rebels, who have made significant territorial gains in the impoverished Middle Eastern country, capturing the capital Sanaa and ousting internationally recognized President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, who fled Yemen back in March. The Sunni Gulf states are wary of Iran's increasing influence in the region, and they see the Houthis' advance in Yemen as a move that threatens their regional and geopolitical interests. Over 1,200 people have been killed in Yemen since the start of the Saudi campaign, according to the United Nations. shs/bw (AFP, dpa, Reuters, AP)",

The ceasefire, which has been in place since March 2015, is expected to last for at least three months, according to a statement from the Saudi foreign ministry. Saudi Arabia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have also agreed to extend the ceasefire until the end of the month, the statement said, adding that they would continue to monitor the situation in Sanaa. \"We will continue our efforts to provide humanitarian assistance to the people of Yemen,\" the ministry said. It did not specify when the truce would take effect, but it is likely to be extended to cover the entire month of May, it added. Yemen is currently embroiled in a bloody civil war between Houthi rebels and Iran-aligned forces, who have been battling for control of large swaths of territory for more than two years. On April 11, Riyadh announced that it would extend a two-month truce until May 13, after which it will extend it until June 15, when a new round of talks will be held between Riyadh and Tehran. Riyadh has said that the cessation of hostilities will not affect the lives of civilians who are still trapped in their homes. Iran has accused Riyadh of trying to use its influence to undermine the government of President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi. Tehran has denied the allegations, saying it was not aware of any such attempt. However, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has called for an immediate ceasefire between the two countries and said he was ready to meet with the Yemeni president on the sidelines of a summit of world leaders in Riyadh on June 12 to discuss the future of Iran's nuclear deal with Iran. Iranian officials have said they have no plans to impose sanctions on Iran over its alleged support for Tehran's ballistic missile program. US Secretary of State John Kerry said in an interview on Sunday that Iran was \"very interested\" in ending the conflict. He also said Iran would not interfere in any way with Yemen, and that Tehran would cooperate with Riyadh in its negotiations with Tehran on a possible ceasefire. 'We are ready for a ceasefire,' Kerry told reporters at the UN General Assembly in Washington on Monday, referring to Iran as \"the most important partner in this conflict.\" The US, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Japan have all expressed concern about the lack of cooperation between Iran, Russia and China on Yemen. Washington has also expressed its concern over the possibility of an escalation of tensions between Tehran and Riyadh, as well as the threat of war in neighboring Syria. But the US has not been able to reach a deal on how to resolve the crisis, despite repeated calls from Washington and Washington to do so. According to US officials, US President Barack Obama and French Foreign Secretary Jean-Claude Juncker have not yet reached an agreement on any new deal. In a joint statement, Obama said: \"The United States and Russia have agreed that we will work together to ensure that Yemen has a stable and stable political and economic situation. We are willing to work with all parties to achieve that goal, including the Iranian side, to make sure that there is a peaceful solution to this crisis.\" \"This is an important step in our effort to bring stability and stability to Yemen and to prevent a humanitarian crisis,\" he said at a news conference in Paris on Tuesday. Obama also called on Riyadh to step up pressure on Tehran to halt its military intervention, calling on it to \"act quickly and decisively,\" and urged the Saudis to act quickly. Yemeni President Abd-Rabbu Mansoured Ali Abdullah Saleh has repeatedly rejected the idea of imposing sanctions against Iran in his bid to restore the internationally-recognized Yemeni government. His comments came after a meeting with Iranian foreign ministers in Tehran last week in which Riyadh said it had no intention of doing anything to stop the fighting. A UN Security Council meeting on Friday was scheduled to take place in Geneva, Switzerland, in response to Iranian accusations of Iranian violations of international humanitarian law. This is the first step toward a resolution that could lead to an end to hostilities in Syria and Iraq. For the time being, however, this is not a solution that will solve all the problems facing the country. There is no way for Iran to get involved in resolving the ongoing conflict, even if it does not have the resources and political will necessary to implement a comprehensive solution. That would be a huge step forward for the region, he added, noting that \"it is very important for us to have a strong and effective response.\" Iran is also a key ally of Riyadh's efforts in fighting the Islamic State (IS) and other regional powers to help the rebels. Last week, Tehran accused Iran of violating the Geneva accords, accusing Tehran of creating a \"hostile environment\" for its actions in support of its war crimes against Iranian-allied Shiite rebels in Iran on April 12.

The WHO says that in the next 35 years, the global number of people aged 60 years and over will almost double from 12 percent to 22 percent. By 2020, there will be more people over the age of 60 than 5 year olds. And a majority of older people (80 percent) will live in \"low and middle income\" countries. It's estimated that the world's population aged 60 years and older will total about 2 billion in 2050, which is more than twice as much as now. Furthermore, worldwide, about 125 million people are aged 80 years or older. But by 2050, it is expected that this number of people - aged 80 and over - will live in China alone. But I'm not old, so why should I care? Well, all this is happening at a faster rate than ever before. And the WHO says \"all countries face major challenges to ensure that their health and social systems are ready\" for this major demographic shift. It will cost a lot of money to improve health and social infrastructures, especially in more developed countries where traditional families structures have changed dramatically. Surely, there's \"no typical older person,\" though. How does the WHO define aging? We tend to think of older people as physically and mentally frail. But that's not necessarily the case, not everywhere in the world. Old is a relative concept - especially in middle income to rich countries. For instance, some 70 year olds are as fit as some 20 year olds. Just think how many older folk are at your gym, and ask yourself whether you can keep up with all of them. But that still doesn't explain aging. What is it exactly? The WHO says that at a biological level, \"aging results from the impact of the accumulation of a wide variety of molecular and cellular damage over time.\" Basically, this puts people at a higher risk of disease and, of course, death. But aging can also be associated with \"life transitions,\" such as retirement or witnessing other people, such as friends and family, die around you. This can affect you psychologically and sometimes, as a result, physically. What sort of diseases come with old age? Some of the most common non-fatal conditions include hearing loss, cataracts, back and neck pain and osteoarthritis. Other conditions include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - which affects the lungs - diabetes, depression, and dementia. What needs to be done? The WHO is proposing a five-step plan of action, which includes: Committing to healthy aging and \"evidence-based policies to strengthen the abilities of older persons.\" Aligning health systems with the needs of older populations Developing systems for providing long-term care Creating \"age-friendly cities and communities Improving measurement, monitoring and understanding of \"aging issues\" worldwide. But don't forget: \"a longer life brings with it opportunities, not only for older people and their families, but also for societies as a whole.\"",
        "generated_story": "WHO's Population Aging Plan: Actions Now The World Health Organization (WHO) has announced a new plan to reduce the number of people living under the age of 65 in the United Nations (UN) and other member states. The WHO's population aging plan, which was announced last year, is expected to be implemented by the end of the year. According to the WHO, more than 1.5 million people will die from age-related causes by 2050, up from 2.4 million in 1990. This is the first step in a long-term plan that aims to address the world's aging population by 2030. It is also expected that the government will take steps to tackle the problem. \"We are going to do everything in our power to prevent the spread of diseases,\" WHO Director-General Margaret Chan said in an interview with the Associated Press. She said the plan was \"a great step forward,\" adding that it would be a good idea to take action now that people are living longer than they should have been, and that they will be able to live longer, healthier lives. However, it is not clear how much longer this plan will last. In the meantime, the UN is working on a plan for reducing the amount of elderly people who die under age 65, according to a WHO report released last month. WHO said it was looking into the issue, but that \"we are not ready to give up on the idea of a healthy population.\" The report also said that there was a lack of awareness among people about the risks of aging, particularly in developing countries, such as China, India, Pakistan and the Middle East, where the population is growing at a rapid rate. But the report did not say how many people would die, or how long they would live, because of their age. UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said he was not aware of any such plan until he saw it in action. He called it \"an important step,\" but added that he had no idea what to expect from the new WHO plan. A WHO spokesman said: \"The WHO has not yet made a decision on whether or not to implement the current plan or whether to expand it. We have not made any decision yet on how to go forward with it.\" WHO says it will continue to monitor the health of its citizens, including the elderly and those with disabilities, as well as those who are suffering from chronic diseases. Read more: WHO: Population aging is a big problem for the developing world, says WHO director-general Martin Schulz The UN's plan is aimed at addressing the global problem of ageing, not just the aging of older people. At the same time, there is an urgent need to improve the quality of life for people with chronic conditions, he said. That's why it's important to make sure people have access to adequate healthcare and adequate nutrition. There are a lot of resources available to them. And there are many resources that can be used to help them do that, too. For example, we have the World Bank, WHO and UNICEF all agree that we are committed to providing adequate food and water to people in need of medical care. These resources are available in many countries and countries around the globe. What's more, they are also available for countries that are facing a shortage of food, water, sanitation and hygiene needs. So, what can we do about it? What are we doing about this? How do we make the most of these resources? The most important thing we can do is to increase the level of health care available? Let's talk about what we're doing to our children and their families. I think we've already done a great job of preparing them for their future. You can read more about that here, here and here. Here's what I'm talking about in my book, \"Healthcare,\" which I've written about at the beginning of this year's WHO conference, titled \"World Health Day,\" in which we discuss the importance of nutrition, nutrition and aging. How can you make a difference in your child's future? I'd like to talk to you about how you can improve your own health, so that you don't have to worry about your children's well-being. If you have a child who has a chronic illness, you know what you're going through, that's a very important part of your life. (Reuters, AFP, Reuters, AP, dpa)WHO, UN agencies, news agency (AFP) WHO/AFP/dpa/Reuters (AP)The UN has said this is one step toward achieving the goal of reducing global hunger and malnutrition? It's not hard to think of what's going on right now. Why is it so important for you to get the information you need? Why do you want to know? Well, let's take a look at what is happening in this book: How to prepare for a future that will help you and your family to become healthier and better prepared for your next child.

Stephen Harper has stepped down as leader of the Conservatives after nine years in the top job. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper resigned as Conservative Party leader on Tuesday after the Liberals, led by Justin Trudeau, emerged victorious in legislative elections. \"I have spoken to Prime Minister Stephen Harper, and he has instructed me to reach out to the newly elected parliamentary caucus to appoint an interim leader,\" Conservative Party president John Walsh said in a statement. \"The people are never wrong,\" Harper said of his defeat. \"The disappointment is my responsibility and mine alone,\" Harper said, adding that he had called Trudeau to congratulate him. Trudeau calls for hopeful, diverse future In electing Trudeau, the charismatic son of a former popular prime minister, Canadian voters illustrated the growing discontent with nine years of Conservative rule that saw lowering of corporate taxes, avoidance of climate change legislation and disagreement with the Obama administration over the controversial Keystone XL pipeline. \"Canadians have spoken,\" Trudeau said, adding that he would be the man to lead the \"hopeful, positive\" country \"with a vision\" that they had asked for. In his victory speech, Trudeau said his government \"believed deeply in the diversity of our country,\" striking a contrast with the strain of nativism that had become apparent under Conservative rule. \"We beat fear with hope,\" said Trudeau, a 43-year-old former teacher. Liberals blow past projected results Projections ahead of the elections had Harper and Trudeau in a dead heat, but as polls closed on Monday night it became clear that the Liberals had won an outright majority, with a projected 175 of parliament's 338 seats. This represented a huge leap from four years ago when Liberals were handed their most crushing defeat in history with a mere 34 seats. Harper will stay on as a member of Parliament for his constituency, public broadcaster CBC reported, as he was re-elected to his seat. The left-leaning New Democratic Party had hoped to capitalize on its second-place finish in 2011, but only managed to come in third with CBC estimating that the party had garnered 32 seats. es/cmk (AP, Reuters) Have something to say?

Harper's resignation comes as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, the Liberal Party's new leader, announced on Wednesday that he would step down from his post as party leader in the upcoming federal election. The announcement came a day after the federal Liberals announced that they would no longer be able to form a coalition government with the Conservatives. \"I am stepping down,\" Harper said at a news conference in Ottawa, adding that his successor would be chosen by the people of Canada. He said he had no plans to seek re-election, saying he was ready to take the reins of government if the Liberals were to win the next election in 2019. But Harper also said his party would not accept a second term in office, which would see him take over the leadership of a party that has been in power for more than a century. In the past, Harper had been a strong critic of Trudeau's leadership, but now he has taken the helm of his own party. Trudeau has said that Harper was a \"very good leader\" and that \"the party will continue to be a very good party.\" Harper, who was first elected to the post in 2001, has also been criticized for his lack of commitment to a fair and balanced approach to politics. His predecessor, former Liberal leader Sir Winston Churchill, said in an interview with The Canadian Press that it was time for a change in leadership. Canada has a new prime ministerial candidate, Justin Trussell, and he is expected to announce his candidacy for the position in a few weeks' time. Canadian media have been reporting on the resignation of Harper and Trudeau as prime ministers in recent weeks, with some reports suggesting that the two men were in talks about a possible merger of their respective parties. However, it is not clear whether Harper will seek a third term, or if he will be replaced by a younger, more experienced leader who is more willing to work with Trudeau on issues such as immigration, climate change and the environment. Prime ministers have said they are open to new ideas on how Canada should be governed, as well as how Canadians should live their lives and what they want to do with their children and grandchildren. Conservative leader Harper has called on Canadians to vote for him in next year's election, calling on them to support him and his government in order to ensure that Canadians have the opportunity to make their voices heard in their own country's political discourse. Justin and Stephen Trudeau have also called for Harper to step aside from the government, while the new government is still in its early stages of its transition phase. Both Trudeau and Harper have vowed to continue their efforts to improve relations between Canada and other countries, including the United States, Canada, Europe and Africa. They are also calling for an end to their \"war on corruption\" in Canada - a move that is seen by many as an attempt to reduce the influence of organized crime and to prevent the spread of extremism in society. Last week, Trudeau said the Harper government was \"not going to change its approach\" to dealing with allegations of sexual misconduct and abuse of women and minorities, a claim that was rejected by most Canadians. On Wednesday, he said it would take \"a lot of time\" for Canada to become a country where women are not allowed to have a say in how they feel about their bodies and how men are treated by men and women. That's a statement Harper made in his speech at the end of last week's debate in Toronto, where he made his first speech since taking office. It was the first time that a Canadian leader had addressed the question of whether or not he wanted to resign his position as premier, after a series of scandals in which he accused the opposition of politicizing women's rights groups and their rights abuses. After the debate on sexual harassment and assault allegations surfaced, Canadian reporters were quick to point out that there was no evidence of any wrongdoing by Harper or Trudeau in any way. A spokesman for Trudeau told CBC News that Trudeau had not been aware of this, however, when he spoke to reporters about the allegations against Harper on Tuesday, \"it was clear that this was not an isolated incident.\" Trudeau was referring to Harper as a man of integrity, not a politician. Nor did Harper himself, though, did he mention the fact that Canadian women were being treated as victims of domestic violence. According to Trudeau himself and others, there were no reports of such incidents in Quebec, Ontario or elsewhere. This is the second time the Canadian government has faced accusations of abuse by women, especially in relation to women in politics - and it's not just women who are being abused by their men - but also that Canada is a victim of gender-based violence and sexual abuse. Canadians are increasingly being accused of being the target of attacks on women at home and abroad. Liberals have accused Harper of trying to silence women on social media, accusing him of using the word \"sexist\" when asked to explain his actions. Liberal MPs have criticized Harper for speaking out of having been"

        "target": "Maldives revokes state of emergency citing improved security situation The president of the Maldives has lifted a state of emergency following an outcry from the international community. The government says the measures are no longer necessary because the security threat has subsided. The government said Tuesday it had rescinded the emergency measures \"with immediate effect\" and that \"all fundamental rights that were suspended have been restored.\" President Yameen Abdul Gayoom declared the state of emergency one week ago after the discovery of a homemade bomb and a stash of weapons near his official residence. The finding followed an explosion on Gayoom's speedboat in September - an incident the government labeled an assassination attempt. The president was not hurt in the blast, but his wife, an aide and a bodyguard were injured. The emergency regulations, intended to be in place for 30 days, gave security forces wide-ranging search and arrest powers, and suspended citizens' basic rights. They drew criticism from former colonial power Britain as well as the United States, the European Union and neighboring Sri Lanka. Reading out a presidential decree revoking the emergency, Attorney General Mohamed Anil said there was no longer a threat to the Indian Ocean atoll nation. He said investigations into the September blast and the recovery of weapons had made good progress. The foreign ministry said a number of people had been arrested. Lawmakers also used the security regulations to fast-track the impeachment of Vice President Ahmed Adeeb, who stands accused of plotting the alleged attempts on the president's life. Impact on tourism Attorney General Anil said pressure from the international community, as well as \"the possible adverse impact on Maldives tourism and the economy,\" had also played a role in ending the state of emergency. Foreign tourists visiting the tropical nation, known for its luxury tourist resorts, palm-fringed beaches and coral reefs, contribute close to a third of the country's gross domestic product. The Maldives has had a rocky road to democracy since holding its first multiparty election in 2008. The country's first democratically elected leader, current opposition chief Mohamed Nasheed, was forced to step down in 2012 after a mutiny by security forces. In March, he was jailed for 13 years on terrorism charges in a trial the United Nations said was illegal. President Gayoom is under intense international pressure to release him. Nasheed's opposition Maldivian Democratic Party welcomed Tuesday's announcement. But said declaring the state of emergency in the first place was a political move designed to stop a rally planned for last week calling for Nasheed's freedom. \"It appears that Yameen is willing to make up threats about the nation's security in order to settle political scores,\" the party said in a statement, referring to the president. nm/kms (AP, AF, Reuters, dpa)",

The government of President Yameen Abdul Gayoom said on Wednesday that it had lifted the emergency, which had been imposed by the international community. \"We have lifted all the restrictions imposed on us,\" he said in a statement, adding that the government would continue to monitor the situation. He added that \"we will continue our efforts to ensure the safety of our people and the security of their homes and properties.\" The country's president, Mohamed Nasheed, has said that he will not allow the use of force against his own people. But he did not rule out the possibility of a military intervention, saying he would not be able to do so without the help of an international body. His spokesman, Ahmed Adeeb, said the president had not ruled out an army intervention. However, he also said he was not ready to give up his position on the issue of human rights. 'We are not going to allow this to happen again,' he told reporters in an interview with the Associated Press. It is the first time the country has been lifted from an emergency state since the end of World War II, according to the AP news agency. In the past, the authorities had imposed a curfew, but the curfew was lifted after a series of violent clashes between security forces and protesters. On Wednesday, a court ordered the military to withdraw its troops from the island state, accusing it of violating international law and violating the constitution. A court also ordered that all military personnel be allowed to return to their posts, as well as civilians, if they were deemed to be in danger of being killed. This was the second time in less than a year that a government-imposed curfew has taken effect. Last week, authorities in Maldiva lifted restrictions on travel to and from neighboring countries, including the United States and Britain. They also banned travel for people who were suspected of having links to al Qaeda and other militant groups. Authorities have also lifted travel restrictions for those who are suspected to have links with al-Qaeda and are seeking to overthrow the democratically-elected president. There has also been an increase in arrests of suspected members of Al Qaeda, who have been accused of plotting to assassinate the former president and his wife, Abdulla Youssef. According to a Reuters report, more than 1,000 people were arrested and hundreds of police officers and soldiers were deployed to police stations across the capital, Male, on Tuesday. Police said they had arrested dozens of people, and that some of them were being held in custody. Reuters reported that police were searching for suspects in connection with an alleged attack on a police station in Male. Officials said there were no reports of any arrests, though they said it was unclear whether the suspects were involved in that attack. Many of those arrested had fled to other countries. Some have accused the police of using excessive force, while others have called for the release of suspects. Others have claimed that they have not been charged with any crime. Opinion polls show that many people are still undecided on whether or not they will be released from jail, with some saying they are likely to face charges of murder. Opposition parties say the crackdown is an attempt to undermine the democratic process and to make it more difficult for them to fight for their own interests. Critics say it is a ploy to weaken the ruling party's ability to win elections. That is not the case, they say, because the opposition has a long-term view that democracy is in short supply in this country. And it's not just a political issue that has led to violence and intimidation. At the same time, there are also allegations of abuses against the civilian population, such as the kidnapping and torture of women and girls, of which there is no evidence of sexual abuse of minors. These allegations are being investigated by police, police and military officials. Meanwhile, opposition activists say they want to press for an investigation into the arrest and detention of young men and women. Amnesty International has called on authorities to investigate the arrests and arrest of men who may have committed crimes against women, children and children. (Reuters, AP, AFP, dpa, Reuters)The government is expected to release a number of detainees on Monday. If the investigation is successful, however, it will take several months to find out what the detainees will face in court. Most of these detainees are believed to still be on trial and could face a lengthy prison sentence. No one has yet been sentenced to life in prison for crimes committed against innocent civilians. Several people have already been convicted of attempted murder in recent years. Among them, some have even been arrested for attempting to escape the death penalty. When the trial is over, many have expressed concern over the treatment of girls and young women in detention camps.

        "target": "Belarusian president accuses Germany, Poland of coup plans Before being sworn in for a fourth term, the reclusive leader of Belarus fired a warning salvo at the European Union, accusing Germany and Poland of plotting a coup and threatening action against sanctions. Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko was sworn into office on Friday in a lavish ceremony boycotted by Western diplomats. The previous day, the 56-year-old leader openly accused Germany and neighboring Poland of planning a coup against him. \"There were [in Germany and Poland] plans worked out for an overthrow of the constitutional order,\" Lukashenko said in the Belarusian capital, Minsk, on Thursday. \"This is not an invention of our intelligence agencies.\" Lukashenko, who came to power in 1994, was re-elected last month with 80 percent of the vote in what the opposition and international monitors said was a rigged election. Relations between the reclusive Belarusian government and the West have been strained ever since. 'Belarus question must be answered' German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said in a statement that the accusations were \"baseless\" and an attempt by Lukashenko to draw attention away from his own wrongdoing. \"The EU needs to find a clear political answer to events surrounding the presidential election and the continued incarceration of opposition politicians and their supporters,\" Westerwelle said. A wide-reaching crackdown against the regime's opponents followed Lukashenko's re-election. Hundreds of his critics were arrested and dozens threatened with long-term jail sentences. Poland also dismissed the accusations as absurd and said that relations with Minsk would not be normalized unless all political prisoners were released. Sanctions threat The situation in Belarus pushed the European Union to adopt a resolution on Thursday in support of economic sanctions against the country. The threats earned a sharp rebuke from Lukashenko, who promised the \"hardest possible reaction\" should the bloc impose sanctions against his country. At the same time, the Belarusian prime minister, Mikhail Myasnikovich, travelled to Moscow in a effort to shore up Russian support for Minsk during its standoff with the EU. That meeting ended with a Russian promise not to impose its own set of sanctions on Belarus over an unrelated spat over oil exports and a commitment to resume a nuclear power plant project shelved after the 1986 Chernobyl disaster.

        "generated_story": "Belarusian President's re-election marred by accusations of corruption Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko was reelected to a second term in office on Sunday, but his victory was overshadowed by allegations of widespread corruption. The country's president, Mikhail Myasnikovich, has been accused of being involved in a massive corruption scandal that has rocked the country since he took office in 2009. He has denied the allegations, saying he was not aware of any wrongdoing and that he had no knowledge of the scandal. \"I don't know what happened,\" he told reporters in Minsk, Belarus' capital, on the sidelines of a parliamentary election in which he won a majority of votes. His victory came after months of speculation over whether he would step down from the post of President of Belarus, who was widely seen as the most powerful man in Belarus. In the first round of voting, he faced a tough challenge from a number of opposition parties, including the far-right, the Social Democratic Party (SPD) and the opposition, as well as a series of allegations against him and his wife, Guido Westerwelle. According to the SPD, which is the main opposition party in the parliamentary elections, there was no evidence of wrongdoing by the former president. However, it is not clear if he will be able to win another term as President, given that his term ends in 2021. On the other hand, many of his opponents have said he should be allowed to stay on as long as he remains in power, with the possibility of stepping down as head of state in 2022. Ukraine's President Vladimir Putin has accused the Russian president of trying to influence the outcome of an election that could have been held in his favor. Putin, however, denied that the president had any involvement in any corruption allegations and said that it was only a matter of time before the election results would be announced. Russia's Foreign Ministry said on Saturday that Putin had \"no intention of interfering\" in this election, adding that \"he will not interfere in our internal affairs.\" The Kremlin also said it would not comment on whether the elections had been rigged in favor of Putin. Moscow has also denied allegations that its president was involved with a criminal investigation into alleged human rights abuses. It said the accusations were \"baseless\" and did not appear to be true. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in an interview with DW that Moscow was \"deeply concerned\" about the lack of transparency in its dealings with Belarusians. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia was also \"very concerned about what was going on\" during the presidential campaign, and Russia had not responded to questions about whether it had done anything to prevent the vote from taking place. But the Kremlin has not commented on any of this, despite the fact that Belarus has a strong reputation for transparency and openness. A spokesman for Belarus's foreign ministry told DW on Friday that Russia has no plans to interfere with any elections in future. Reuters reported that Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev had called for a referendum on Putin's removal from power in order to avoid a repeat of last year's election. Belarus is currently in talks with Russia over the issue of whether to allow Putin to take over as president and whether Moscow will allow him to continue his role as prime minister. Last week, Moscow accused Belarus of using state funds to fund the construction of new government buildings, a move that was criticized by many as an attempt to undermine the government's ability to control the economy and create jobs for its citizens. This was the second time in less than a year that a Russian foreign minister had criticized Belarus for not doing enough to protect its economy from Russian interference in elections. And it's not just Putin who has criticized the new president's decision to remove him from office: Russia is also not a party to any political process, according to Reuters, citing a source close to Moscow's ambassador to Belarus who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the matter with Reuters. If the results are not confirmed, Russia could not immediately respond to requests for comment from Reuters and other news agencies, Reuters said, referring to reports from Moscow. Meanwhile, Ukraine has repeatedly accused Russia of meddling in Ukraine, accusing Moscow of attempting to destabilize the region's economic and political system. Officials in Moscow said Moscow had also asked Belarus to step up efforts to improve relations between the two countries' relations with Moscow and Moscow, while Moscow rejected the idea of imposing sanctions on Moscow in return for the removal of Russian diplomats from their posts as part of its attempts to curb the influence of Moscow on its foreign policy. That's the latest example of how the situation in Russia and Belarus have become increasingly tense in recent months. For the past few months, Russian officials have also been critical of Russia. They have repeatedly denied accusations that they have tried to use state-owned companies to try and influence elections for political purposes. These accusations have not been proven to have any effect on Russia, although Moscow denies it has done so. Analysts say they believe that this is a sign of growing tensions between Moscow-backed separatists in response to Russia"

        "target": "Berlin court rules Google Street View is legal in Germany A Berlin court has ruled that Google Street View is legal. But that doesn't mean the lawsuits will end, legal scholars say. A Berlin court has ruled that Google Street View is, in fact, legal in Germany. Last Tuesday, the Berlin State Supreme Court (Kammergericht) announced its decision in a court case from late last year, in which a woman had sued Google, fearing that photos of her, her family and the front of her house would be posted on Google Street View and would thus violate her property and privacy rights. The court ruled that it is legal to take photographs from street level, rejecting her argument that Google was trying to take unauthorized pictures. Part of her argument rested on the fact that Google used cameras mounted at three meters (9.84 feet) high, which could see over her two-meter-high hedge. However, the court did not find this argument convincing, given that the photographs were taken from the street, and not the sidewalk. Furthermore, because Google automatically blurs faces and license plates and did allow Germans to opt-out of the service to have their house obfuscated as well, the court did not find any potential violations. This is the first high-level court ruling, which cannot be appealed any further, regarding Street View since the service debuted in Germany at the end of last year. An ongoing debate Since Google announced plans to launch Street View in Germany last summer, debate around the service has become heated, with some politicians trying to stop it at every turn, while German Chancellor Angela Merkel famously said that she would not remove her house from Street View. In November 2010, the company announced that 244,000 German residents in the 20 cities had chosen to opt out of Street View - less than three percent of residents. However, in Germany and everywhere else, the company also allows people to report abuse, inaccuracies or request that something be blurred using an online tool. \"Our job is to develop services that respect these cultural differences,\" Peter Fleischer, Google's global privacy counsel told Deutsche Welle in November 2010. \"We try to anticipate them. We're all internationally-minded people ourselves. We try to guess how people will react to them. But a lot of these services are new and have never been on the market before, so we learn and we adapt as we go along.\" A 'landmark decision' European legal experts called the Berlin ruling a \"landmark decision,\" saying that this would now become part of German case law regarding property rights. \"Yes, other people are now warned: Don't sue Google simply claiming that Google Street View violates personality [or] property rights,\" wrote Thomas H\u00f6ren, a professor of media and communications law at the University of M\u00fcnster, in an e-mail sent to Deutsche Welle. But, he also warned that this decision was very narrow, focusing on the issue of property rights, and not on the larger issues of data protection from Google. \"The problem of Google Street View - to be honest - has never been a problem of personality rights or property rights, but the enormous risk of personal data compilations in cases where people use Google Street View for compiling personal profiles (such as building insurance companies; future employees, et cetera),\" he added. \"And this risk has not been considered by the Berlin courts.\" Similarly, Viktor Mayer-Sch\u00f6nberger, a professor at the Oxford Internet Institute, agreed that this case was \"limited in scope,\" adding in an e-mail, \"The plaintiff never alleged an actual invasion of privacy, just a potential one.\" Author: Cyrus Farivar Editor: Nancy Isenson",

The ruling, which is due to take effect on January 1, 2017, is the first in a series of landmark decisions by the German court of appeals. It is expected that the court will decide whether to allow Google to use the city's streets as a \"landmark.\" The court's decision is likely to have a significant impact on German society, as it will affect the future of the world's most popular online shopping destination, Google Maps. But it could also have an impact in other European countries, such as the United States, France, Germany and the UK. In Germany, for example, the decision will be appealed to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg, Belgium, where the case is currently being heard. Germany's top court, however, has yet to rule on whether or not Google should be allowed to operate its streets in German cities. \"I think it's too early to tell,\" said Peter Fleischer, head of German law at the Berlin State Court, adding that it would be \"very difficult\" for the company to comply with the ruling. He added that Google would not be able to do so because it was \"too expensive.\" \"We are not going to give up,\" he said, referring to Google's search engine. Google has said it won't allow the site to be used in any way that would violate the copyright of other companies, including Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook and Google. However, he added, \"we will continue to work with Google on this issue.\" Google is also expected to appeal the outcome of this case, according to a report by German news agency dpa.com, citing a court ruling that said Google had violated the rights of European citizens to access the Internet without having to pay a fee for access to it. German courts have also ruled against Google, saying the search giant should have the right to opt out of using the service. According to Deutsche Welle, a decision that could have been made on Monday would have made Google liable for a loss of tax revenue, while the US would still be entitled to tax revenues from the sale of its products and services. This is a major step forward for Google in its fight against copyright infringement, but it is not the only step Google must take in order to compete with Amazon and Apple in Europe. If Google loses the appeal, it may have to face the same fate as Amazon or Apple. For now, though, there is no clear legal precedent for it, and it has to go through the appeals process. A court in Berlin has already issued a ruling on a similar case in which a German judge had ruled that a Google-owned company should not use its services to sell products to German consumers without a license. That decision could lead to an increase in taxes for German households and companies that do not want to invest in their own homes and businesses. And that's not a good thing, given that many people are already paying a lot of money for their homes, especially in cities like Berlin and Berlin. On Monday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel announced that she would step down from her post as chancellor. She said that her government would take steps to improve the quality of life for all German citizens, particularly those who live in urban areas with low-income families. (Reuters, AP, AFP) The decision comes after a three-judge panel of judges ruled on Tuesday that \"Google has failed to meet the legal requirements of law and regulations.\" It was the second time in three years that Germany has faced a legal challenge over the issue, with a case that has been heard by a federal appeals court. Last year, Berlin's high court rejected a request for an injunction against the internet giant's move to expand its Internet presence. Since then, more than 1.5 million people have complained about the lack of internet access in some areas of Germany. Most of them are still living in rural areas. Some of these complaints stem from complaints that they are being treated unfairly. Many of those complaints are based on complaints from people who don't have Internet access. These complaints have already been addressed by politicians, who have criticized Google for not doing enough to protect their privacy. They are also aimed at reducing the number of people using Google services, rather than making it more difficult for them to get around the law. At the very least, this is an important step to reduce the amount of data that is being collected by Google and other tech companies. There are many complaints about how Google uses its technology to make decisions on how much money it can spend on advertising and advertising. What is clear is that there are no legal grounds for such a move. How can Google do that? The company has not yet responded to questions about its ability to offer a free Internet service to its customers. After all, they have not received a response to complaints against its search terms and conditions. One thing: the"

        "target": "In Argentina, red wine exports to balance Porsche imports About 100 Porsches are imported to Argentina each year. Now the country wants to keep a positive trade balance by having the value of the imported luxury cars matched by red wine exports. Porsche is currently enjoying record profits after a two-year downturn, but the export-reliant company has hit a pothole in Argentina. Buenos Aires-based Porsche importer Grupo Pulenta has signed an agreement obligating it to export several hundred bottles of red wine for each car it imports, the Argentine government announced Wednesday. Grupo Pulenta declined to comment when contacted by Deutsche Welle. Job creation During the past year, Argentina has held thousands of high-end vehicles in customs until companies agreed to export goods valued at the same amount. Most of those vehicles came from Germany. According to a spokeswoman for the Argentine embassy in Berlin, the country has been trying to safeguard domestic employment with a positive trade balance. \"Our government has negotiated with automakers to balance their imports of cars with an equivalent amount of exports,\" she told Deutsche Welle in a statement. \"Since March 2010 we have been working with the automakers and importers in order to increase local integration and reduce the trade deficit in this sector.\" Small market A Porsche spokesman said the company sells just short of 100 vehicles into Argentina each year. That compares to more than 40,000 sold worldwide during five months in 2010. \"For Porsche, Argentina is a rather small market,\" the spokesman told Deutsche Welle. \"Our importer, the Pulenta Group, also deals in wine. They have their own vineyards and export that wine. It has nothing to do with Porsche - we just have an import contract with them, and it seems they've found an individual solution with the Argentine government.\" Domestic production Volkswagen, which has an Argentine subsidiary producing the new \"Amarok\" pickup truck and transmissions, has thus far avoided mandatory exports. The company had reported an export surplus of 384 million euros ($545 million) for this year. Porsche's holding company owns 32.2 percent of Volkswagen, and the Porsche brand is intended to become integrated into Volkswagen's lineup. Daimler and BMW also have subsidiaries in Argentina. While Daimler produces its \"Sprinter\" there, BMW only imports to the country. According to the Argentine embassy in Berlin, the country has recently sought more domestic production by foreign car companies. Author: Gerhard Schneibel (dpa) Editor: John Blau",
        "generated_story": "Buenos Aires-based Daimler aims to balance its red wine exports with German wine production in Argentina. The German carmaker is looking to expand its production capacity in the Argentine capital, Buenos Aires, with a focus on red wines. \"We want to be able to make the most of the opportunities we have,\" the company said in an interview with Deutsche Welle, adding that it was looking for ways to increase its exports to the country's top wine exporter, Amarok, in order to reduce its dependence on German imports. It also wants to diversify its product portfolio, which includes German-made cars such as BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Audi. In addition, it is also looking at expanding its presence in Germany, where it has a large presence. Argentina is one of Germany's most important markets for wine, but it's also a growing market for German cars, particularly in Europe and Africa. Germany has been a key partner in this area for the past few years, as well as in many other European countries, including the United States, France, Italy, Spain, Germany and the Netherlands. But Argentina's economy is still suffering from a lack of economic growth, according to a report by the German news agency dpa (dpa) on Thursday, and is expected to struggle to keep up with demand from the continent's biggest car market, the European Union (EU) and other emerging economies. BMW and Volkswagen are among the world's largest carmakers in terms of sales, while Mercedes is the second-biggest by sales volume, behind only Volkswagen's Mercedes. Volkswagen, however, has said it will continue to invest heavily in Argentine wines, especially in areas like the southern part of Argentina where German Chancellor Angela Merkel's government has ruled out the possibility of an EU-wide ban on the sale of German wines in its country. German media have reported that the government is considering a move to allow German companies to sell their wines to Argentina in exchange for a lower tax rate. That would be a big step forward for Porsche, since it would have to compete with the likes of Volkswagen and BMW in a bid to boost its sales in Latin America and Europe. However, there are also concerns about the impact of Argentine wine on its domestic market. For example, Volkswagen is not allowed to import wine from Argentina, even though it does not have a license to do so. Instead, VW is obliged to use its own wine to promote its products in other countries. Porsche has also been working on a range of new products to help it meet the needs of its German customers. Among them is a new car that will be made available for sale at the end of this year's Frankfurt auto show. This year, Porsche is planning to launch its new model, called the \"Sprinter,\" which is aimed at bringing in new customers from around the globe. According to its website, Sprinter is aiming to become the first car manufacturer to offer a wine-focused product in South America to reach the US market by 2020. Last year it sold more than 1.5 million bottles of wine per year. VW, for instance, sold a total of 2.4 million cases of sparkling wine in Brazil in 2016, a year after it acquired the brand from Volkswagen. Mercedes, BMW's German rival, was the only company to buy the car from BMW for $1.3 billion. DSA, meanwhile, is currently in talks with Volkswagen about a possible deal to build a car for its Argentine unit, known as \"Porsche Argentina.\" The company has already invested $2.2 billion in developing the new brand, based in Sao Paulo, Brazil, that would allow it to develop its brand into a luxury car brand. With the addition of a brand-name brand called Porsche-branded SUV, this would give it the opportunity to grow its market share of up to 30 percent. And it could be an important step in that direction, if the market is healthy enough to meet demand for new models. After all, German automakers have already made a lot of investments in Spain and Germany in recent years. At the same time, many of them have been investing in their own areas. They have also invested in expanding their European operations, too. A new SUV is due to come to market next year - a model that has the potential to double sales by 2025 - and it should be ready to take on more European customers in 2018. There are already a number of companies that are interested in buying a Porsche SUV. One of those companies is Porsche's Brazilian subsidiary, Pulenta. Another is BMW-owned company, Amblestar. Both of these companies have invested heavily into the region and are looking into expanding into new markets in Asia, Europe, Africa, Asia and Asia. These companies, like Porsche and VW and Mercedes are the biggest players in emerging markets, have made significant progress in China and India. Piling on sales of Spanish wines is another area that is growing at a rapid pace, said Volkswagen CEO Carlos Tavares. He said, \"It's a good news that Porsche"

        "generated_story": "Germany to host FIFA Women's World Cup in 2011 Germany will host the first ever FIFA women's soccer tournament, the Deutsche Welle news agency reported on Tuesday. The tournament will be held in the German capital, Berlin, from June 11 to June 12. It is Germany's first time hosting the tournament since the 1990s, when it was held at the Olympic Stadium in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Germany is the only country to have hosted the event, which is scheduled to take place on the same day as the 2011 edition of the Olympics in Moscow, Russia. \"We are very excited about the prospect of hosting this tournament,\" the paper said, adding that it would be \"a great opportunity for women to showcase their talents in front of a global audience.\" The event is expected to draw more than 1.5 million spectators, according to the newspaper, and will feature a number of women from around the world. There will also be a lot of athletes from all over the globe who will compete, as well as some from other countries, including the United States, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Japan and the Netherlands. Many of them are women, while others are men. In the past, women have been able to compete in international tournaments, but in recent years, they have struggled to find a way to reach the top of their game. This year, however, that has changed. Last year's tournament was won by France and Russia, with Germany topping the standings with a total of 10 points, followed by Sweden, Switzerland, Austria and Switzerland. But in 2012, it fell to Germany to win the title, losing out to Russia in a final that was decided by a vote of 2-1. That means that the women will have to wait until the end of next year for their chance to play in their first major international tournament. And that's not just because they don't have the best players. They are also due to be given the opportunity to represent their country at an international level, rather than a tournament where they can only compete with other nations, such as Spain and France. For the second time, FIFA has decided to send a delegation to attend the competition, along with the men's national team, in order to get a better idea of how the game should be played. According to a report by the DW, \"Germany is looking forward to having a very strong team in this competition.\" Germany has already won the last two FIFA World Cups, beating France in 2002 and 2010. However, this time around, there is no chance of Germany getting a first-ever appearance at a major tournament like the one in Brazil, where it hosted in 2010 and 2012. FIFA is also hoping for a strong showing from the country's top-ranked squad in 2014 and 2015. After the 2014 edition, a host of teams from Europe and Asia will take part in another tournament in Russia and China in 2016. Some of those teams have already been invited to participate in other tournaments in Asia, Africa and Latin America. Most of these teams are based in Europe, Asia and Africa, although some have also been in Africa for several years. At the time of its opening ceremony in 2015, many teams were already planning to travel to China, India and South Africa to face off against each other in an attempt to qualify for the 2022 edition in Beijing, China and Japan. With the arrival of FIFA, several teams had already announced their intentions to make their presence felt at home in Germany. Several teams, though, have yet to confirm whether they will play at all. German media reported that they would not be taking part, saying they were still waiting for FIFA's decision on whether to invite their athletes to their home country. Meanwhile, other teams will not have an official invitation from FIFA. Instead, organizers have said they are hoping to bring their own team to Berlin in 2017. So far, so far so good. As of now, no one knows what will happen in terms of gender equality and gender parity between the two countries. Nevertheless, we are hopeful that FIFA will continue to push forward with its plans for this year. We hope to see a more inclusive and inclusive campaign, especially in light of recent events.

If we do, I'm sure we can get some good news for our host country, because we've already had a fair bit of time to think about what we're going to do. Our goal is to build a team that will represent the continent. Let's hope that this is something that can help us to achieve a positive result. What do we have in mind?

        "target": "Beekeepers battle mites with technology Bees are useful, hard-working and vital for our ecosystem. Aside from making honey, bees pollinate most of our food crops. But summertime is also the season for one of the biggest threats to honey bees \u2013 the varroa mite. Dete Papendieck puts on a white veiled protective hat and takes out a metal jug with a beak-shaped spout. He sets fire to the container's contents \u2013 formic acid \u2013 and starts directing the smoke that is wafting at the beehives lined up in front of him in his garden on the outskirts of Bonn. The acid doesn't harm the bees, but it does kill the varroa mites, he says. And July, after most of the honey has been harvested, is the best time to treat his hives. The one millimeter-large varroa mite is a parasite that infests beehives and lays its eggs in the honeycombs, alongside the bees' larvae. \"It feeds on the bees' and the bee brood's blood, the so-called haemolymph,\" Papendieck explains. A third of bees killed in Germany Papendieck is an apiarist at the Bee Research Institute at the University of Bonn and he knows that the threat of mites is serious. If left untreated, varroa-infested colonies rarely survive a winter. In 2010, German beekeepers lost about 200,000 hives to the mite \u2013 one third of Germany's total bee population. And it is not just the honey and beeswax production that are affected by the mite. Many of our food crops depend on bees: Some 80 percent of all agricultural plants and 90 percent of fruit trees in Europe are pollinated by Apis mellifera, the European honeybee. Varroa introduced from Asia Had Dete Papendieck been a beekeeper forty years ago he would not have had to worry about mites. He says the varroa mite that was originally native to Asia, was introduced to Europe in the 1970s. \"It happened during a research project in which it was attempted to crossbreed the European honeybee with the Asian honeybee. The researchers were exchanging bee colonies between Europe and India, and that is how the mites came to Germany,\" Papendieck said. Unlike Asian bee species, the European honeybee cannot fight off the varoa mite by itself. According to Papendieck, bees easily transmit the mite to other beekeepers' hives in what apiarists call robbery. \"It happens when certain colonies are being robbed by other bees. Large numbers of bees from different colonies attack weak hives and steal their stocks. At the same time, parasites and diseases are exchanged\", he says. Researchers have been trying to breed varroa-resistant mites, but so far they haven't had much success. High-tech tools help fight the mite Klaus Maresch is also worried about his bees. He is an organic beekeeper from Bonn and he has been passionate about bees since he was a little boy. \"They are part of my family. When I open my hives and smell the honey and hear the buzzing of the bees it's like being in another world,\" he told Deutsche Welle. In addition to using formic acid to fight the mite, Klaus Maresch employs a high-tech tool \u2013 a special cylindrical scale that helps him determine when it is best to start the varroa treatment. \"Every day this hive scale sends data about the colonies to our server. The data, such as the temperature in the hive and the amounts of nectar and pollen collected, help me to find a good day to treat varroa,\" Maresch says. Maresch also makes the data about the activities in his hives available to fellow beekeepers who can treat their colonies accordingly. A driver's license for beekeepers? But it is not the mite that angers Maresch most. \"That's nature,\" he says, \"I feel angry about beekeepers who don't fight varroa. If the bees of neighboring beekeepers are infested, I also have a problem.\" The existing German pest regulation obliges beekeepers to treat their bees against varroa, but there are no strict controls. The majority of Germany's more-than-80,000 beekeepers are amateurs who keep between one and 20 colonies. This makes it difficult to impose and survey certain quality standards. Maresch, who sees himself as a kind of 'bee activist', would like to see the government introduce stricter rules. \"There should be a law that obliges every new beekeeper to learn about beekeeping before they are allowed to keep bees. They should get an education and there should be something like a driver's license for beekeepers,\" he says. In the mean time, Europe's bees are going to have to",
        "generated_story": "A German beekeeper fights varoa mite with a high-tech hive scale A German honeybee expert is fighting a pest that has grown to the size of a baseball bat. Dete Papendieck of the University of Bonn in Germany has developed a new method to fight the pest, which he calls the \"voa moth.\" The pest has been spreading across the country for several years and is now spreading to other parts of Europe, including Germany, the Netherlands and the United States. \"It is a very difficult pest to control,\" he told the German news agency Deutsche Welle, adding that he had to be careful not to harm his bees. He said he was \"very careful\" with his honeybees, and that they would not harm the bees themselves. But he also warned that it could be dangerous for bees to get into the hive, so he decided to test the method in his lab. In the end, he said, \"I think it's a good idea to try and fight this pest.\" He added that the beekeepers would be able to protect their bees from the pests, but that would require a lot of research and research. The research was published in the journal Bee Research Institute (BRI) and was based on a study conducted by the BRI's Klaus Maresch, who is also a professor at the university's bee research institute. It is the first research paper to use the technique in a bee hive and it has already been used in several other beekeeping projects around the world. For example, it was used to create a hive that could house up to 1,000 bees a day, according to a report in The New York Times. However, this method has not yet been tested in humans. Instead, researchers have been using it to study the insect's behavior and how it affects bees and other pollinators, such as bees, ants, butterflies and butterflies. They have also used it in experiments on bees in which they have to feed on the insects. This method, called \"the honey bee,\" can be used by bees for a variety of purposes, ranging from feeding on insects to breeding on honey, honey and eggs. And it is not just bees that have the ability to make honey; it can also be applied to bees as well, as in bees of other species. According to reports, some bees have even been bred to produce honey in their honey-making process, while others have never had the opportunity to experiment with honey. Researchers have found that honey is more effective than honey when it comes to fighting pests. That's why the honey bees are so successful, they say, because they are more resistant to pests and diseases. One of their most effective methods is to harvest honey from honey mites. A bee researcher has also tested honeymites in an experiment to see if honey can help to reduce the amount of honey that is produced. His lab is currently working on an experimental honeycomb that will be available to honeymakers. If the results of this experiment are positive, then he hopes to expand honey production to include honey products and honey substitutes. So far so good, that's the only way to do that. Although the research is still in progress, there are still a number of experiments that are being carried out, with the aim of making honey into a honey substitute. Some of these experiments have already led to some positive results, however, many of them are not as successful as the ones he is trying to develop. These are the most promising results so far, though, given the success of his research in this area. There is no shortage of buzzwords for honey hives, for example. Honey is an important ingredient in honeymaking, since honey has become a key ingredient for many honeybeverage products. You can buy honey at a range of different honeypots, or you can use honey to help you get honey for free. Here are a few examples: \"The honey industry is very good at producing honey,\" says Dette Papendeck, a researcher at UB-Bonn's hive research Institute. She says honey plants are also very effective at fighting honey mold, especially honeypuffs. Other honeymeat products are available, she says, in order to increase honey demand and to improve the quality of life in bee nurs nurseries. More than half of all honeycobs are currently available in Europe. Most honeycombs are already available on Amazon.com and Google's website, Google Earth.

        "target": "Heidi hits the Big Screen Heidi, the world famous girl from the Swiss Alps who first appeared in a novel 121 years ago, has hit the big screen in a fresh look. A century after the death of Heidi inventor Johanna Spyri, the lovable Alpine heroine is being portrayed in a new film which replaces grassy slopes and mountainous range with city skyscrapers and city streets. The $ 3.5 million \"Heidi\", funded by the Z\u00fcrich-based film company Vega and directed by German film maker Markus Imboden, is to be launched in Germany on Thursday. The making of the film was one of the highlights of a past year of events including exhibitions, lectures and fireworks celebrating the July 7 2001 centenary of the death of Spyri, whose novel \"Heidi\" sold 20 million copies and has been translated in 50 languages worldwide. It is thought to be one of the most successful books of all times. The book has inspired 17 films, including Shirley Temple\u2019s Oscar winning portrayal of Heidi in 1937 and a Japanese cartoon series. Imboden\u2019s remake is the 18th \"Heidi\" film. Blue hair in Berlin According to Vega, \"the film was transmitted to today\u2019s world without losing sight of the original novel\". But Imboden\u2019s new movie is far from the charming original, with its rosy-cheeked, curly-headed Heidi, delicate Clara and goat-tending shepherd Peter\u2019s frail old grandmother. In the first film, Heidi, who lives happily with her grandfather in a tiny hut in the Swiss Alps is plucked from her contented life by her Aunt Dete to live in a stiff, rich family in the bustling metropolis, Frankfurt. Heidi becomes so home-sick, she starts to sleepwalk and is eventually sent home. But not before she causes confusion in the otherwise prim household and brings laughter in the life of the disabled and homely, Clara. The Heidi in the latest film has blue hair, surfs the net and roams the streets of Berlin. Friend and shepherd Peter sheds his rustic pastimes and whizzes down streets on his mountainbike. Clara is not the weak, lame young girl of the Spyri novel, but a moody Britney Spears wannabe. Aunt Dete is a modern-day stylist living fashionably in the German capital. The new surroundings are a far cry from the tranquil days of cow milking, goat- tending and flower-plucking in the verdant meadows of the Swiss Alps. Transforming the Heidi myth According to a Berlin daily, the remake is a \"refreshing Heidi\", adding that the script writers had managed to transform the Heidi \"myth\" into an independent, self-assured girl and not into a \"transfigured mountain heroine\". However, it is just this portrait of a naive and charming alpine heroine that has made Heidi so popular all over the world. Heidi has become a well-known Swiss brand worldwide. Some 60,000 tourists \u2013 half from Japan \u2013 are said to visit the picturesque wine-growing village in Graubuenden, which boasts the original Heidi House and other Heidi related attractions such as winding mountain trails and pastures. Imboden\u2019s film, which is to be launched in Germany on Thursday, will also open elsewhere in Europe, and may reach fans in Japan and South Korea too. Whether Imboden\u2019s blue-haired, computer savvy Heidi will charm her Asian viewers, however, remains to be seen.",

The man, who was born in Z\u00fcrich and grew up in Graubuenden, Germany, is now living in Switzerland. He is currently living with his wife Johanna Spyri and their two children in a house he designed in his native Germany. \"Heidi is the most beautiful woman I have ever seen,\" he said, adding that he had never seen a woman so beautiful as Heidi, and that she was \"so beautiful.\" \"I am so happy that I am able to live in this house,\" said the man who designed the house. In fact, he has lived in it for more than 30 years, when he was a child. Now he lives in Berlin, where he and his family have lived for the past 20 years. His house, which was built in 2009, has been restored to its former glory. It was designed with the help of a local architect and architect who has worked on a number of projects in Germany and the United States, including the creation of the Heidi House, in order to make it more accessible to the public. According to a German newspaper, the project was commissioned by the architect to create a new home for Heidi and her children, called the \"Sheidi House.\" The house is located on the edge of town, near the city of Z\u00dcR-Z\u00d6R, with a large garden and a small garden. There is also a garden in front of it, as well as a greenhouse, but it is not open to public view. This is where the original Heidi house was located, according to German news agency dpa. However, there is a chance that it could be used for other projects, such as the renovation of an old house in Bremen. If so, it would be the first time that the building has ever been used as an exhibition space. And it's not just Heidi's house that is being used by visitors to see the new building. A German architect has also been commissioned to design the home, while a Japanese architect is working on an interior design for it. That's because the design is based on his own personal experience and he is very familiar with how the Alps look and feel. But he also has a lot to say about the architecture and architecture of his house and how it looks like he's lived there for a very long time. When he died in 2006, his son, Markus, took over the family's home and made it into his home. They have been living there since then. For the last three decades, they have built a beautiful home in their garden, built by a couple of German architects. Their work has inspired a series of exhibitions and exhibitions. One of them is called \"The New Heidi,\" which is set to be shown at the end of this year's World Fair in Zurich. Another exhibition is planned for next year, to celebrate the 50th anniversary of its opening in September. More than 100,000 visitors are expected to attend the exhibition. Many of those who have visited the show will be invited to come to watch it in person. Some of these visitors will also have the opportunity to meet the director of production and design. Other guests will come from all over Europe to view the work. I'm sure that they will have a great time, too, because they are all very interested in learning more about how Heidi is made and what it means to them. So, I think that's a good idea for me to visit the site and see what I can do. We'll see if we can find something that will make me feel at home there.

        "graph": "[CORE] The Brexit vote is not a vote against the will of the people: a referendum against the British people [ENTITIES] Donald Trump | Belgium | Brussels | Great Britain | Theresa May | British | US | House of Commons | David Cameron",
        "target": "Opinion: A decision against heart and mind The House of Commons has passed the Brexit bill - despite most parliamentarians being against it. But now they should take care that Great Britain does not move further away from Europe, writes Birgit Maass. If only they had done it out of full conviction. If they at least believed that they could really benefit their country by withdrawing from the EU. But many of the parliamentarians whose vote will finally set Brexit on its wayhave voted against their hearts, as well as their minds. It was a vote against their minds, because the withdrawal from the EU will almost certainly, at least on a short to medium term basis, have negative repercussions for the British economy. And it was a vote against their hearts, because for many, a view of the future, divorced from Brussels and increasingly reliant on an unpredictable US President Donald Trump, is somewhat alarming. In recent days, many members of parliament have described it as \"a catastrophe.\" No vote \"against the will of the people.\" Of course there are \"Brexiteers\" who believe that a Britain independent of Brussels will be able to return to its former greatness, once it is no longer held back by the \"Little Europeans.\" But they are in the minority - the majority of parliamentarians already declared their support for remaining in the EU during the referendum campaign. Yet despite this, Theresa May's government was able to push its legislative proposal through the House of Commons without any great difficulty. The predominant view, also amongst members of the two leading parties, is that to hinder Brexit and to fail to support the government in its endeavors to do so, would be to go \"against the will of the people.\" Anti-EU newspapers have targeted Brexit opponents. And those who have publically come out in support of the EU have had to reckon with death threats. The at times passionate debate in the lower house, that went on over several days, was a temporary highlight in this European tragedy, which in the worst case could contribute to the continent disintegrating into individual sovereign states. Don't be intimidated The British public supports the hard-line position taken by Prime Minister May in withdrawing from the common market. Polls are showing that her strategy is gaining increased support. There is no turning back now. The British are now looking for clarity on the repercussions of their withdrawal from the EU. They want the negotiations with the EU to start as soon as possible. It was an historical misjudgement by David Cameron that he could win the referendum. Most of the members of the lower house believed the then-prime minister and voted to hold a referendum. But now they can no longer stop Brexit. But they should not let themselves be intimidated by party discipline, nor the leading Brexiteers, nor by voter impatience. Over the next two years they should use every chance they can to influence the withdrawal process. May announced that although they are leaving the European Union, they will not be moving away from Europe. The parliamentarians must now hold her to her word. Have something to say? Add your comments below. The thread will stay open for 24 hours after publication.",
        "generated_story": "Brexit vote is not a referendum against the will of the British people Theresa May has said she will not back out of Brexit. The British parliament voted to leave the European Union on March 29, triggering a two-day referendum on the future relationship between the UK and the EU. That vote, which will take place in the House of Commons, will be called by the people of Great Britain. It is the first step in a series of negotiations aimed at resolving the Brexit impasse, but it is also a step towards the end of her term as prime minister. \"We are not going to allow this to happen,\" May said at a news conference in Brussels on Thursday. She added that she would not allow the referendum to be held until after Brexit, and that it would be a vote of no confidence in May's government. But she also said that if the vote was held, the country would still be able to negotiate a deal that would allow it to stay in place for at least two years. May, however, did not rule out the possibility of a second referendum, as she had said in her speech at the time. However, she said it was too early to make a decision on whether or not to go ahead with the withdrawal agreement. In the event of an EU withdrawal, May will have to decide whether she wants to continue as Prime Minister, or whether to seek a third term in office. If she does not seek another term, then she could be forced to step down from her post as Brexit Secretary of State for the United Kingdom, David Cameron, who has been in power since 2011. Cameron said he would continue to work with May to find a solution for Britain's future relations with Europe. He added: \"I think it's a good thing that we have a strong relationship with our European partners. I think that's the right thing to do. We need to talk to our partners about how we can work together as a united Europe.\" The UK's Brexit deal with Brussels is set to take effect on June 23, 2019, after a three-year transition period in which Britain is expected to remain part of Europe's single market, with a number of EU member states, including Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece and Spain. Brexit is a very important issue for all of us. There are a lot of people who don't want to see a hard Brexit and many who do not want one. This is one of those people that will make it very difficult for us to get to a point where we are ready to accept the terms of our departure from the bloc. For many, this is an important moment in our relationship, because it will give us a chance to move beyond the current political and economic situation. And that is what we want. Britain has a long history of being a free and open society, so it should be open to the world, even if it doesn't agree with us on many things, such as the way forward in Brexit negotiations. So, what do we do? We will see what happens when we enter into a new phase of talks. What do you think? What are you hoping to achieve with this new arrangement? How can we get a better deal for our country? Is there a clear path forward for Brexit? The question is, how will we make the most of it? It's hard to say, given the political situation in this country right now. Many people in Britain have already said they want a change of government and there is no way to know for sure. They have been waiting for more than a year for this moment. Some of them have even been asking for a divorce from their country. Others, like Donald Trump, have expressed concern about the consequences of this. Trump's comments on Brexit have made it clear that he wants a \"hard Brexit,\" but he has not ruled out a move that could lead to an end to Brexit altogether. On the other hand, Trump has repeatedly called for an orderly transition of power in Europe, saying that Britain should not be left behind in its negotiations with other EU countries. His comments come as no surprise that the US, Britain and France have all agreed that Brexit would have an impact on their own future. After all, he said, \"It's not just a matter of time before we reach a final agreement on this issue.\" Trump and EU leaders are likely to agree on a common position on how to resolve the issue of Britain leaving the eurozone? That's exactly what I'm hoping for, in my opinion, for now, when it comes to this point. No one really knows what will happen. How will the new EU deal work? I'd like to think so. Let's just say that there's no easy solution to that. With Brexit in mind, we'll see how things will play out. A referendum is something that can only happen if we're prepared to wait until the next EU referendum. You can be sure that Europe is ready for it, too. Just ask President Trump to sign off on it. Last week, US President Emmanuel Macron"

        "target": "French presidential debate does little to woo undecided voters This year's French presidential race is perhaps the most closely watched election in recent history. Many voters are still undecided, including those in the Paris caf\u00e9 where DW's Jake Cigainero saw the latest TV debate. Just over two weeks ahead of the first round of voting in France's presidential election, all 11 candidates met for the second televised debate of the campaign. It was the first time in the history of French elections that the entire official ballot shared a television stage. This race for the Elysee is perhaps the most closely watched election in the history of the Fifth Republic in view of conservative candidate Francois Fillon's embezzlement charges, the deterioration of the left, political amateur Emmanuel Macron's surprise surge to the top, and the rise of Marine Le Pen's National Front. With so much media attention on the five main candidates, Tuesday's debate felt almost like a consolation for the six other candidates rarely in the spotlight. For French voters watching the televised debate at Cafe des Phares on Place de la Bastille, the saturated stage kept the candidates from detailed discussion of pressing issues. For those who are still undecided, the debate did little to bring them closer to choosing their pick for president. Vincent Couronne, a researcher, said it was good to see candidates who don't get as much media attention. However, 11 candidates at once for the political spectator was overkill. \"It wasn't very interesting. It's just one position after another. There's no real debate. It's not like when it was just five candidates.\" Boredom all round Charlotte Theuvenin and her friends, all students in their early 20s, tuned out early on from boredom and exasperation. \"It was too flat and too hypocritical. Fillon and Le Pen play with our money, then say they did nothing and that they are good for our country,\" she said. As though addressing the candidates in front of her on the TV screen, she added, \"How dare you talk about being president when you use our money for your own interests.\" Le Pen had come under fire over accusations that she misused public funds to pay bodyguards as parliamentary assistants. Francois Fillon of Les Republicains, meanwhile, is under investigation for allegedly paying family members more than 1 million euros ($1.1 million) for government work they never carried out. Frequently casting a blank stare at his opponents, Fillon also seemed bored, or at least more subdued compared to the first debate. Couronne said, \"Fillon seems to be not there. Probably because he knows all the small candidates can attack him on the criminal offenses he's accused of.\" Debate watchers cited Europe as the most important issue of this election, with many fearing Le Pen's promise to tear France out of the European Union in a so-called Frexit. Though no one at the cafe vocally supported Le Pen's plan, several acknowledged the EU is a pressure point for France. \"France's place in Europe in relation to Germany is a very important issue,\" said student Thibault Cirier. \"The general problem is France has lost its influence at the European level over the years, and that needs to be remedied, because France is one of the founders of Europe and should have a strong place in the union. The EU is also important for cohesion and to have a strong position internationally.\" Caf\u00e9 viewers say no to Le Pen Cirier was initially excited by Macron when he launched his campaign, but ultimately decided there was no substance. Now he says he will probably vote for far-left candidate Jean-Luc Melenchon. Kevser Taspinar also said she liked Melenchon for his fighting spirit and that \"he throws barbs.\" As a practicing Muslim who wears a headscarf, she said the most important issue for her is laicite, France's state institution of secularism. \"For me Hamon has the best interpretation of this. Maybe Hamon,\" Taspinar said hesitating. \"I'm still undecided, because there's Melenchon.\" Another viewer, Marie Dubois, said that although she really liked Melenchon, she had definitively decided on Macron. \"Melenchon has a way of putting humanity in politics and giving hope,\" she said. \"But Macron is the only possible candidate.\" With polls putting Le Pen and Macron in the second round on May 7, the undecided voters at this Paris cafe said they were certain which candidate they would not for vote for in that scenario. \"Definitely Macron. There is no way I am going to vote for Le Pen,\" Theuvenin said. \"I will never vote for that woman or Front National, no matter who is running against them in the second round.\" Tuesday was the final debate for Macron and Melenchon, two of the crowd-pleasers among the candidates. Both have pulled out of the third debate on grounds that it cuts too close to the first vote just two days later on April 23.",
        "generated_story": "French presidential candidate Jake Cigainero: 'No, No' French presidential hopeful Francois Fillon has said he will not run for re-election in the next round of elections in France. \"I am not going to run,\" he told DW in an interview published on Sunday. The French president's spokesman, Thibault Cirier, said in a statement that he would not campaign for a second term in office. He said the president would \"not be a candidate for the presidency of the Republic of France.\" \"He is not a politician who will be able to win the presidential election,\" the spokesman said, adding that the candidate would be unable to do so because he was not elected to the National Front. But he did say that if he were elected, he wouldn't be the first candidate to be reelected. In the end, however, it was the former president who won the election, and he is the only candidate who has done so so far. On Sunday, the centrist candidate, Marine Le Pen, announced her candidacy for president. She is expected to take the oath of office at the Elysee Palace on Monday, but she has yet to make a decision on whether or not she will run again. If she does, she is likely to face a tough challenge from the far-right, which is hoping to gain a majority in parliament. It is also possible that she could be forced to step down from her post as president if she doesn't get elected. For now, though, there is no chance of that happening. French President Emmanuel Macron has vowed to keep his presidential campaign promises, even if it means taking a step back from his first term as prime minister. And he has promised to continue to fight for his party's presidential nomination, despite the fact that his predecessor, Nicolas Sarkozy, was elected president in 2015. However, in recent weeks, his campaign has been criticized for failing to deliver on its promises to protect the country's democratic values. So far, so good. France's president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, has refused to say whether he plans to seek a third term, saying he won't accept a fourth term. That's a big change from last year, when he campaigned on a platform of \"Make France Great Again\" and \"Let France be Great again\" (AFP, AP, dpa, Reuters). The president has also been accused of being too soft on the left-wing, as well as the right-leaning Front National (FN) and the anti-EU Front (Fillon) party. This has led to a number of calls for him to stand down, including from some of his own supporters, who have been critical of him. Some of them have even called him a \"fascist,\" while others have called for an end to his presidency. Many of those calls have come from within the party, such as former French Prime Minister Jean-Luc Melenchon, whose father was a member of parliament and who is now in exile in Germany. Others have criticized him for not doing enough to stop the rise of populism in his home country. They have also accused him of not being a strong enough leader to get the support of voters who want to see a change of direction in politics. One of these calls is that Macron should be given the chance to change the direction of politics, rather than the current one. After all, a lot of people have already voted in favor of Macron's candidacy. There's no doubt that this is a good thing, because it will give voters the opportunity to elect a new leader who can stand up for their country and make their voices heard again and again in elections next year. Nevertheless, many people are not happy with the outcome of this year's elections, especially those who are still undecided about whether to vote for either candidate. Macron is facing an uphill battle in November's general election in which he faces a hard-fought battle for power. His party is currently in third place, behind only the Socialists and Greens, while the Greens are in fourth place. Despite his popularity, Macron still has a long way to go in terms of support among voters and supporters. With his support, polls have shown him as a serious contender for second place in polls, with polls showing him well ahead of polls in June's election. Yet he's also facing a difficult time in Congress, where his chances of becoming president are at a historic low point. Last week, French voters rejected his candidacy by a wide margin of less than 1.5 percentage points, according to pollsters, compared to last week's poll numbers. Polls show him leading the polls by more than 2.8 percent to 3.4 percent. Analysts predict a victory for Macron in May's runoff. Opinion polls suggest he'll be elected on Tuesday's ballot on June 7. According to polls published by the French newspaper Le Monde, voters will have to decide which candidate they will support. Voters will also be asked to choose between the two candidates. What do they think will happen next week? The poll results will depend on how many"

        "target": "Gang battle in Mexico as US' John Kelly visits A gunbattle between drug gangs in northern Mexico has left 14 people dead. It's the latest in a series of turf wars. Smuggling has prompted a visit to Mexico City by US Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly. Prosecutors said the remote town of Las Varas in Chihuahua state was the scene of Wednesday's battle between affiliates of the Ciudad Juarez cartel and a gang from the state of Sinaloa. Police said fighting escalated when patrols arrived. Fourteen people were found dead; 12 others were hospitalized. Grenades, launchers and rifles were found. The mountainous region is used as a corridor for smuggling into the US. El Chapo effect Chihuahua security commissioner Oscar Alberto Aparicio said a Black Hawk helicopter was called in as police chased surviving gang members through the area known for marijuana and opium poppy production. Two police officers had been killed in a \"cowardly\" way in the area a week ago, he said. In a similar incident last Friday, 17 gunmen were killed during a shootout with police on a highway in Sinaloa, Mexico's northwestern state. Sinaloa was the home base of Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, whose extradition to the US in January apparently left gangsters in a struggle for control of criminal syndicates. Homicides have surged in recent months, with the number of persons killed in May put at 2,186, the highest since the collection of such statistics began 20 years ago. Nieto and Kelly to talk In Mexico City Wednesday, President Enrique Pena Nieto's office said he and visiting US Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly had discussed how to rein in organized crime groups. \"Shared responsibility\" must become the focus of transnational efforts, Kelly said. Narcotics smuggling into the US has become a multibillion-dollar (multibillion-euro) business for Mexican drug cartels. Mexico in turn wants the US to throttle demand for narcotics and the supply of illegal weapons to Mexico cartels. Pena Nieto and US President Donald Trump, who wants a border wall, are schedule to meet Friday on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany. ipj/ng (AP, AFP, dpa)",
        "generated_story": "US Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly visits the scene of a gunbattle in northern Mexico on Wednesday. US President Donald Trump met with Mexican President Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman in the capital city of Ciudad Juarez, where the suspected drug lord has been holed up for more than a year. The two men are believed to have been involved in a shootout that killed at least one other person and wounded dozens more, according to a US official. \"This is a very sad day for the people of Mexico,\" the official said, adding that he was \"very concerned\" about the situation in southern Mexico, which has seen a number of deadly attacks in recent years, including a deadly shootout with police in Sinaloa, the state capital of the Mexican state of Chihuahua. Trump has called for an end to the violence, saying it is \"a very dangerous time for our country.\" The US president also called on Mexico's government to step up security measures against drug traffickers and other violent groups. In a statement, Trump said: \"We are going to do everything in our power to protect our people, and we will not allow this to happen again.\" Trump also said that the US should take steps to prevent the spread of drug cartels in Mexico and that it should not be allowed to interfere with the rule of law. On Wednesday, he said Mexico should step in and protect its citizens from the threat of violence. He said the United States should do its utmost to ensure the safety and security of our citizens. But he added that \"it is not the first time that we have seen this kind of thing happen in this country. It is the second time in as many years that this has happened,\" he told reporters at a news conference in New York. 'We have to be very careful, because we don't want to let this happen to our own people.' The president's comments came after a series of phone calls between the two leaders, in which the president said he would not tolerate the use of force against the drug lords. Last week, President Enrique Pena Nieto ordered an investigation into the alleged crimes committed by the cartel, known as the \"Guzman Cartel,\" which is linked to drug trafficking and human rights abuses. President Trump, however, did not rule out the possibility of such a probe, instead calling on Mexican authorities to investigate the case. According to US officials, it was a case of mistaken identity, but the investigation is still ongoing and the government has yet to make a decision on whether or not to take any action. A spokesman for Trump's National Security Council, Oscar Alberto Aparicio, said in an interview with The Associated Press that Trump had been briefed on the incident. Kelly said Trump was not aware of any new developments in his administration's foreign policy, though he did say that there were \"no indications of an imminent threat.\" \"I am very concerned about what is going on in my country,\" said Kelly, who was visiting the border town of Las Varas, a state with a large population of about 1.5 million people. Officials said they had not seen any evidence of criminal activity, although they said there was no indication that any violence had taken place there at the time of his visit. However, they did confirm that a search warrant was being issued for a man suspected of carrying out an attack on a police station in Cusco, Mexico City, on Tuesday. They also confirmed that they were looking into whether the suspect had committed any crimes, as well as whether he had any links to any other criminal organization, such as human trafficking, or other crimes against humanity. Mexico has long been accused of being a violent country, with some of its most violent and violent criminal groups in its history. Many of these groups have denied any involvement in organized crime, while others have claimed responsibility for their actions. Some of them have called the attack a \"hoax\" and have threatened to use violence against law enforcement officials in their own countries. Mexican officials have also accused the Trump administration of not doing enough to stop the flow of drugs into Mexico. And they have accused Trump of trying to cover up what they say is an attempt to undermine the country's efforts to contain the influx of migrants and refugees. This is one of many reasons why the President's administration has not been able to find a way to crack down on drug smuggling, despite the fact that many migrants have fled to other countries and are seeking refuge in other parts of Latin America. At the same time, many of those who have come to Mexico to seek refuge there have expressed concern over the lack of information about a possible terrorist organization. That's a problem that has led to an increase in violent crimes in some countries, like the murder of hundreds of thousands of people in neighboring states. More than 1,000 people have died since the start of this year's Mexican presidential election campaign.

        "target": "Italy's navy to patrol with Libyan ships to curb human trafficking Italy wants to work more closely with Libya to limit the number of sea crossings by migrants and potential asylum seekers. But what are the consequences? Italy's prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni, does not want to wait any longer for EU countries to show solidarity in distributing asylum seekers throughout the bloc. On Thursday he announced in Rome that the Italian navy would be patrolling with Libyan ships just off the Libyan coastline. The aim, Gentiloni says, is to curb human trafficking and bring migrants back from the smugglers' boats to Libya. According to the Italian government's figures, 93,000 migrants have arrived in Italy so far this year. At least 2,000 have drowned in the attempt to cross the Mediterranean - the true figure is unknown. Italy has already threatened to stop allowing boats carrying rescued migrants to dock in Italian ports, or that it may issue migrants with documents that would allow them to travel on to other European countries. Rome has not yet implemented either policy, but the government has made clear that Italy will soon run out of options. The EU Commissioner for Migration Dimitris Avramopoulos acknowledged, again, in Brussels on Thursday that \"Europe continues to face high migratory pressures. And Italy more than (almost) any others.\" The European Commission issued a letter offering more aid and personnel to help manage migration better. Accommodation will soon be full The office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, wrote at the beginning of July that \"Close to 200,000 accommodation places are available for refugees and migrants across [Italy], but are nearly all full.\" The High Commissioner referred particularly to the numbers of people dying when he warned, \"What is happening in front of our eyes in Italy is an unfolding tragedy.\" The United Nations anticipates that another 100,000 migrants will come to Italy via Libya before the end of this year. The number of arrivals is already 20 percent higher than last year; and the number of dead, those who could not be saved, would rise accordingly. According to UN estimates, the Mediterranean remains the \"deadliest\" refugee route in the world. Italian government statistics say that around 600,000 people have arrived in Italian ports since the start of the crisis in 2014. It is unclear how many have since traveled on to Austria, France or Switzerland. Once migrants are registered in Italy and accommodated in camps, they are not held there. If, however, they leave the accommodation without giving notice, they forfeit their claim to subsistence and social services. Most of the migrants are from African countries, and many try to travel on to France, for example. 300 people are currently sleeping on the beach in Ventimiglia, on the French border, hoping to take a bus or train to France. However, the border is being policed by French officials. Migrants who are caught are sent back to Italy. Austria has announced that it too will close its border with Italy if the number of migrants starts to rise. Repatriation and distribution are difficult Last year 120,000 new asylum applications were made in Italy. Around 50 percent of these are rejected. The asylum seekers are then supposed to leave the country. However, the process of people either returning voluntarily or being deported is very slow. The interior ministry has therefore announced that it will reinforce repatriation programs. The redistribution of asylum seekers from Italy, as agreed by the European Union, is well behind target. Two years ago the aim was to resettle 120,000 people. So far, only 24,676 people have been redistributed, the EU Commission said on Thursday: 7,873 from Italy, and 16,803 from Greece. The numbers are low not just because of the reluctance of other EU countries to take the refugees in, but also because of Italian delays in the registration of possible candidates. Asylum seekers from Eritrea are the most likely to fulfill the criteria for redistribution. Around 25,000 are currently living in Italy, but only 10,000 have been registered with the EU Commission and the European Asylum Support Office as possible candidates. Migration Commissioner Avramopoulos has announced that Italy will be given more help and logistical support in this area.",
        "generated_story": "EU Migration Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos says Italy is facing \"an unfolding tragedy\" in the Mediterranean region. The European Union's migration commissioner for the region has warned that Italy faces an \"emerging humanitarian crisis\" as it struggles to cope with the influx of migrants from Libya. \"We are facing an unfolding crisis,\" he told a news conference in Ventimiglia, Italy's capital city, on Wednesday. He said the situation in Libya was \"unprecedented\" and that the country was facing a \"serious humanitarian situation.\" \"The situation is unprecedented in Europe,\" the commissioner said, adding that \"it is very difficult for us to deal with a situation like this in Italy.\" The EU's refugee agency, the European Asylum Support Office (EOSO), said in a statement that it was working to find a solution to the migration crisis. According to EOSOMO spokesman Filippo Grandi, \"the situation has become so serious that we have to step up our efforts to make sure that this crisis does not escalate into a humanitarian catastrophe,\" which the EU is calling \"a humanitarian disaster.\" According the agency's head of migration, Federico Mogherini, who has been in Rome for more than a year, is \"very concerned\" about the migrant crisis and has called for an end to migration to Italy, which he said is currently suffering from a lack of resources and a shortage of skilled migrants. In addition, he called on EU member states to take action against the migrants who have fled to Europe, including France, Germany, Spain and Italy. France and Germany have also stepped up their efforts, while Italy has taken steps to try to stem the flow of asylum seekers, according to French Foreign Minister Paolo Gentiloni. French President Francois Hollande said last week that he would not allow migrants to return to their home country of Libya, where they would be forced to stay for up to three years. On Wednesday, French Prime Minister Manuel Valls announced that France would take part in an EU-wide initiative to provide asylum to migrants seeking asylum, as well as the United Nations and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) to ensure that migrants are able to reach their destination. Speaking to reporters at the end of the day, Giorgio Napolitano, France's foreign minister, said he was disappointed by the failure of Italy to meet its obligations under EU law. But he also said that his country would continue to cooperate with efforts by other EU countries, such as Germany and France to prevent the spread of illegal migrants across the bloc, and would \"continue to do its utmost to protect the interests of its citizens.\" On Thursday, Italian President Matteo Renzi announced a new round of negotiations aimed at ending the crisis, saying that a deal had been reached between the two countries on the basis of an agreement to end the refugee crisis in which migrants have been allowed to leave Europe. However, it is not clear whether the deal will be reached, or whether it will not be done at this stage. Italian officials have said they have not yet reached a final agreement on how to resolve the issue, but they are hopeful that talks will continue. Last week, a European Commission spokesman told the press conference that they had reached agreement with Italy on a number of issues related to asylum requests. It was not immediately clear if the new deal would include an extension of EU asylum quotas for migrants and refugees, although the Commission has said it has not ruled out the possibility of extending the deadline for new arrivals. A spokesman for EU migration officials said \"we are working with Italian authorities on this issue,\" but he did not give a specific date for a decision on whether to extend the extension, citing \"technical issues\" that have arisen in recent months. Italy currently faces a backlog of requests for asylum applications from the UN, EU and UN agencies. Most of these requests have come from countries in Africa, Africa and Latin America. Many of them are being handled by EU agencies, however, because of their proximity to Libya's borders. For example, there is no guarantee that Libya will receive a visa in time for next year's EU summit in Brussels. This is the first time that EU officials are expected to hold a meeting with Libyan officials. Meanwhile, some EU ministers have expressed concern about how Italy will respond to this situation. They have already expressed their concern over the current situation, though, that there could be a delay in reaching a resolution. At the same time, they also expressed concerns about a possible increase in migration quotas that could lead to a rise in arrivals from other countries. That is, of course, not the case for all EU members. There is a growing concern that some countries are not ready to accept migrants, especially those who do not have the capacity to receive asylum in their own country. European officials say they expect to see a response from Italy in coming weeks. Foreign ministers, meanwhile, are already in talks with their counterparts in other European countries to discuss the matter.

        "target": "How to wrap a present without using paper or tape Next time you get invited to a birthday party, you could try wrapping the present using a piece of fabric and ribbon. It's very easy and the best bit is, it can be reused. Maybe it will come back to you on your birthday. 1. All you need is a piece of fabric big enough to wrap your gift, a ribbon long enough to go right around it, and if you want to make a gift tag, you will also need a piece of old cardboard, a hole punch and another small piece of ribbon. Ready? 2. No, wait, we forgot the present. Get that, and you have everything you need. Spread the fabric on the ground and put your gift on top 3. Fold the fabric around the gift you are wrapping 4. With the last little bit, you don't tuck it under, but create a little flap on top 5. Fold that flap over like this 6. Take one end of the parcel and tuck the fabric inside, BEHIND the gift inside 7. You can take your time to wiggle it all inside. Make it as flat as you can 8. Once it is all inside, turn to the other end and do the same thing again 9. When you have done both ends, it should look like this. Your present is all tucked up inside and you don't need any tape to keep it closed 10. Now for the ribbon. Place the gift on top of it 11. Tie the bow 12. So it looks like this. Finished? If you want a gift tag, that comes now. If you don't you're done! 13. Cut a piece out of an old cardboard box and make a hole in it using a hole punch. Watch your fingers though ;) 14. Put a piece of short ribbon through your hole 15. Tie the tag to your gift 16. And you are finished! P.S. You can either ask your friend to reuse the fabric, and show them how to wrap with it, or if they don't like that idea, you can take it home with you to use again the next time. And remember, you don't have to buy the fabric. You can use an old pillow case, an old t-shirt or skirt, or whatever you want. You can even make your ribbon from an old t-shirt if you don't have any. Happy wrapping.",
        "generated_story": "How to Wrap a Present Without Using Paper or Tape The best way to wrap a present without using paper or tape is to use paper and tape. The most effective method of wrapping presents is by wrapping them in a plastic wrap. This method is called \"wrap-around,\" and it's easy to do. It's a simple method, but it can be a bit tricky. For example, wrap presents with paper, tape, or even tape and wrap them around a piece of paper. You can wrap the present with a paper towel and then wrap it with tape or a pen. That way, you don't have to worry about the paper sticking out of the wrap, and you won't be able to tell the difference between the material you're wrapping and the materials you are wrapping it in. In the end, the wrapping method will be the best option for wrapping present presents, because it will allow you to make the most of your present. \"Wrapping presents\" is a very important part of wrap wrapping. Wrapping present wraps wrap wrap wraps wrapped presents wrapped around the edges of a package, so that it looks like it was wrapped in paper rather than plastic. Wrap wrap wrapped present Wrapped present wrap Wrap wrapped wrap around an envelope or paper bag, wrapping paper around it and wrapping the presents in the envelope. Wraping present wrapped up in plastic wrapping wrap is an easy and effective way for people to unwrap presents. However, it is not always easy. When wrapping gifts wrapped on paper wrap ends up wrapping around them. Sometimes it takes a lot of time and effort, sometimes it doesn't. But wrapping a gift wrapped with plastic wraps is one of those things that makes a person feel like they've been wrapped alive for a long time. One of my favorite gifts is wrapping envelopes. I've wrapped a Christmas present around my finger and wrapped it up with my hand, which I use every day for the next few days. And I'm not even sure how long I'll be wrapping my present, as I have been doing it for so long that I can't remember the last time I wrapped one up. How do you wrap present wrapping wraps around your finger? The answer is simple: You wrap your hands. If you have a finger, put it under your palm. Then wrap up the package with your hand and tie it back together. There's no need for paper wraps. They're just a matter of putting a little bit of glue on the ends, right? That's what I did when I was a kid. We wrapped gifts around Christmas gifts for my grandmother. She was the only one who had a hand in it. Now, she's grown up enough to appreciate the gift wrap she gave me. So, I wrap my presents around her finger. Let's see what she did with it, in order to give me a chance to show her how much she appreciates the gifts I gave her. After all, we're all grown-ups and we all know how important Christmas is.

The record-breaking storm has battered the Bahamas and Cuba, while Hurricane Jose followed in its path. As one of the Atlantic Ocean's largest storms plowed through the Caribbean, leaving destruction in its wake, residents of the US state of Florida prepared for what could be the worst storm to make landfall in over a century. At least 17 people have been killed and dozens more injured across several island nations in the Caribbean. Irma is expected to be there second major hurricane to make landfall in the United States in less than two weeks. Hurricane Harvey struck Texas last week, killing more than 60 people and displacing roughly 1 million others. In the US territory of Puerto Rico, 1 million people \u2013 nearly one-third of the population \u2013 lost electricity during the storm, said Puerto Rican Governor Ricardo Rossello. \"It will be difficult to estimate how long the power outage will last,\" Rossello said. Later, officials confirmed that at least two people on the island had been killed by the storm's devastation. Two other major storms have developed in the Caribbean, namely Hurricane Jose and Hurricane Katia. Jose was east of the Lesser Antilles with maximum sustained winds of 120 miles per hour (195 kilometers per hour) as a hurricane watch was in effect for Antigua and Barbuda. Jose has followed the same path as Hurricane Irma, and was upgraded to a Category 4 on Friday by the US National Hurricane Center. Katia has remained relatively static, hovering off the coast of Mexico. Florida on edge Florida Governor Rick Scott said 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain were expected after Irma made landfall at the weekend as he urged evacuations during a press conference on Friday. Nearly 700,000 people have been asked to leave Miami and its surrounding areas. \"Today is the day to do the right thing for your family and get inland for safety... Do not ignore evacuation orders. All Floridians should be prepared to evacuate soon,\" Scott said. Read more: How to reduce risks from mega-storms? \"I know many of you are stuck in traffic, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s very frustrating. Evacuations are not convenient but they are absolutely meant to keep you safe,\" he added. On Friday, US President Donald Trump described Irma as a storm of \"absolutely historic destructive potential.\" Trump also on Friday signed a $15 billion (13.5 billion euro) hurricane relief package passed by Congress, which also raises the debt ceiling and postpones the possibility of a shutdown of government funding until December. Downgraded to an \"extremely dangerous\" Category 4 but still packing winds of 185 mph (300 kph), Irma moved between the north coast of Cuba and the Bahamas as it neared the Florida Keys and the southern Florida Peninsula.

Amid widening criticism from residents in British territories that not enough was done to safeguard people from the storm, British Foreign Office Minister Alana Duncan said London has sent tents, vehicles and other relief equipment. \"Anguilla received the hurricane's full blast. The initial assessment is that the damage has been severe and in places critical,\" Duncan told the British Parliament. Thousands displaced Antigua and Barbuda Prime Minister Gaston Browne said nearly every building on Barbuda was damaged when the hurricane's core crossed almost directly over the island early Wednesday and about 60 percent of the island's roughly 1,400 people were homeless.

        "generated_story": "Hurricane Irma: warnings and warnings The aftermath of Hurricane Irma in the Lesser Antilles has been described as a \"devastating storm\" by the United States' federal emergency management agency, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) as the worst-affected areas of the storm. The storm is expected to make landfall in Florida on Sunday, Sept. 10, with winds of up to 185 miles per hour (300 km/h) from the coast of Puerto Rico. Forecasters have warned that Irma could cause widespread damage to the island's infrastructure, causing widespread flooding and power outages. \"This is a very severe storm,\" said FEMA Administrator Edouard Philippe, adding that \"it's going to be very difficult for people to get out of their homes and into the sea.\" The hurricane is forecast to hit the eastern Caribbean island of Antigua and Barbuda on Friday, September 14, and will be a major threat to life and property, according to a statement from FEMA. It is also expected that the US will have to deal with the damage caused by Hurricane Jose, which is due to come ashore on the western Caribbean islands of Hispaniola and Turks and Caicos. Officials have said they are monitoring the situation closely, but they do not yet have a clear forecast for the exact extent of damage. They are also warning that there could be severe flooding in some areas. FEMA Director Gerard Collomb told CNN on Thursday that he was \"very concerned\" about the possible impact of Irma. He said the hurricane was likely to cause \"significant damage\" to people's homes, property and livelihoods, as well as to businesses and businesses. In addition, he said, \"I'm very concerned that people will not be able to return to their normal lives.\" He added that it would be \"a very dangerous situation\" for those who are unable to travel to or from their home islands. But he also said there was no immediate danger of flooding or landslides. That's not the only concern for Puerto Ricans, who have been left without power for several days after the Category 4 storm made landfall. There is no indication of a direct hit from Irma, nor is there an imminent threat from Maria. However, it is not impossible to predict what will happen if Irma hits the islands, especially if the winds are strong enough to knock out the power grid. Hurricane Harvey was a Category 3 storm that caused widespread devastation across the Caribbean in 2005, when it hit Haiti and then the U.S. territory of Haiti. At the same time, there were warnings of possible flooding from Hurricane Katrina in 2004 and Hurricane Rita in 2006. On Thursday, President Donald Trump issued a series of emergency declarations in response to Harvey, Irma and Maria, along with a number of other major hurricanes. Some of these declarations include: \"We are prepared to respond to any and all emergencies,\" the White House said at a news conference in New York. Other countries have also issued warnings, including the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Japan, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Portugal, Greece and Spain. These are the countries that have received the most severe warnings in recent years, while others have not received any such warnings at all. For the first time in a long time the government has issued an emergency declaration for all of its territories. This is the second time it has received such a declaration in less than a week. Last week, US President Barack Obama called for a federal disaster declaration to help the affected islands recover from Harvey. President Trump also called on Congress to act quickly to prevent further damage, saying he would do so if necessary. Meanwhile, Puerto Rican Prime Minister Ricardo Rossello said he had been briefed on Irma's impact on his country. His office said it had received a request for proposals for disaster relief from his administration. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Wednesday that his office would continue to monitor the country's response. 'We will do everything we can to protect our people,' Tillerson told reporters in Washington, D.C. (AP, AFP, dpa, Reuters). The US has also sent a letter to President Obama, calling on him to take action against Harvey and other disasters. Trump has said that FEMA will continue its efforts to combat the threat of Harvey in his first week in office. And he has promised to provide aid to those affected by Harvey as soon as possible.

        "target": "Indian government tells Supreme Court Rohingya pose'serious threat' After an appeal from two Rohingya, India's top court is considering PM Narendra Modi's plan to deport some 40,000 Rohingya in India. The government said intelligence data showed links between some Rohingya and terrorism. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government told the Supreme Court of India on Monday that the Rohingya were \"illegal\" immigrants. The hearing is taking place as Rohingya face severe violence in their native Myanmar. More than 400,000 Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh in the past few weeks to escape military and civilian reprisals that the United Nations has described as \"ethnic cleansing.\" Later on Monday, Myanmar's national security advisor said that his government was willing to welcome the refugees who had fled to Bangladesh back to their native Rakhine state, but that the details of the process still had to be worked out. \"We will make sure that everybody who left their home can return to their home but this is a process we have to discuss,\" Thaung Tun told Reuters news agency after a meeting with British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. It was unclear how this would affect the estimated 40,000 Rohingya believed to have settled in India, including 16,000 of whom are registered with the UN's refugee agency. Read more: Myanmar's Rohingya - A history of forced exoduses The Indian government told the court that it had intelligence data that showed links between some Rohingya Muslims and Pakistan-based terror groups and other international terror organizations. It argued that such links made them a \"serious threat to national security.\" The government also said there was a \"serious possibility of eruption of violence against Buddhists in India by radicalized Rohingya.\" Lawyer Colin Gonsalves, who in a separate case is representing about 7,000 Rohingya living in the northern Indian city of Jammu, countered the government's assertions. \"We just want to know: 40,000 people have been here, many of them for the last five years. Have you [the government] filed a single charge sheet, is anyone being prosecuted in the criminal court for being a terrorist? The answer is: no,\" he told DW. The court has adjourned the hearing in the matter to October 3. Lack of evidence India says it is not bound by the UN convention on refugees as it is not a signatory to the accord, but human rights activists disagree. \"The principle of non return of a person to a place where he will be executed or tortured has become a principle of customary international law which India follows,\" Gonsalves told DW. \"And it has attained the status of 'jus cogens,' which is a principle of law that no country can say is not applicable to it, such as torture and genocide.\" In a communication sent to all states in August, the Home Ministry [interior ministry] said the illegal migrants were more susceptible to terrorist recruitment efforts. But an investigation by Indian broadcaster NDTV found \"little evidence of the government claim.\" The investigation that was carried out at major Rohingya settlements in the country showed little involvement in criminal wrongdoing by the refugees. Lack of any evidence to support the government claim has led to speculations that the Rohingya were being targeted for their religion by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu-nationalist government. \"It is really unfortunate that the government is going back on its commitment to refugees which it has reiterated several times in the past merely because these Rohingyas are Muslims,\" said lawyer Prashant Bhushan, who filed the plea on behalf of two Rohingya men. \"I mean this is clearly a case of religious discrimination and an attempt to arouse a sort of feeling of... an anti-Muslim feeling or try and communalise the situation,\" he told reporters outside the courthouse. The UN's human rights chief last week deplored Indian government's move to deport Rohingya refugees. \"India cannot carry out collective expulsions, or return people to a place where they risk torture or other serious violations,\" Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein said. The Rohingya are an Indo-Aryan people, the vast majority of whom are Muslims. They usually migrate to India through a rather porous border to escape persecution in their native Rakhine state in Myanmar, where they have been denied citizenship rights. They are viewed by the local authorities as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. Myanmar's Buddhist majority is often accused of subjecting them to discrimination and violence.

Hundreds of people, the majority of them Rohingya, have been killed in the violence that has seen many homes destroyed and several villages burned down. Myanmar's government maintains the crackdown is part of a counter-terrorism drive, while the UN's al-Hussein has said that it \"seems a textbook example of ethnic cleansing.\"",
        "generated_story": "India says Rohingyas pose 'erious threat' to India India says Rohingya pose an \"errifying threat\" to its security. The Indian government said on Wednesday that the Rohingya in Myanmar pose a threat to the security of the country. India's foreign minister, Prashant Bhushan, told the United Nations General Assembly in a statement that it was \"very concerned\" about the situation in Rakhine state. \"We are very concerned,\" he said, adding that \"we are going to do everything in our power to protect our people.\" The statement came after the Supreme Court in Jammu and Kashmir ruled that Myanmar's Rohingya minority were not to be allowed to return to their homes in India. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has been in power for more than a decade, has said that he will continue to fight for the rights of Rohingya Muslims in his country, which he says is the most persecuted ethnic group in the world. Last month, the Indian parliament passed a resolution calling for a ceasefire between India and Myanmar, and the two countries agreed to cooperate in resolving the crisis. However, India has yet to agree on the ceasefire, saying it will not allow the violence to continue. According to a report by the India-based news agency NDTV, a number of people have been killed in clashes between security forces and Rohingya insurgents in northern India since August last year. This has led to calls for an end to violence between Buddhists and Hindus, as well as for India to step in and provide security for its citizens. On Wednesday, Indian Foreign Minister Prakash Javadekar announced that India would take steps to ensure the safety of all Rohingya, including those who have fled to neighboring Bangladesh. He also said India was prepared to take action against any attempt by Myanmar to prevent the influx of refugees from the neighboring state of Bangladesh, according to Reuters. But India is not ready to give up the fight against terrorism, he added, citing the fact that Rohingya are not considered a terrorist group and that they have no links to any terrorist organization. In a rare move, Modi said he would \"open a dialogue\" with the Myanmar government to try to resolve the conflict. Modi's comments come after a UN Security Council meeting in New Delhi last week, in which the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Myanmar had failed to provide adequate protection for Rohingya refugees in its border areas. A UN spokesman said the government had not yet made a decision on whether or not it would intervene militarily, but that there would be a \"clear response\" from India if it were to intervene. Reuters reported that Indian foreign ministry spokesman Brigadier General Colin Gonsalves said in an interview with DW that Modi would not rule out the possibility of a military operation against Rohingya militants in eastern India, though he did not say whether the army was ready for such an operation. Speaking at a press conference in Delhi on Tuesday, Gossalve said \"it is a very important issue for us as a country and as an ally of India.\" \"I think it is important that we have the right to know what is going on in this country,\" the diplomat said. 'We have a lot of things to learn from this situation and we want to make it clear that this is something we will be able to share with all the people of this region.\" Reuters/Ibrahim Ra'ad al-Hussein (AFP, dpa, Reuters, AP)The UN's chief human rights expert, Zeid Ra\u2019ad Alhusssein, said there was no need for any military intervention in Burma, despite the threat posed by Rohingya and other ethnic minority groups from neighboring Myanmar. His comments came in response to an article in DW's \"The New York Times\" on Monday that suggested India should take a tougher stance on Myanmar and send troops to Myanmar if they wanted to help the refugees. It also pointed out that many Rohingya were fleeing to Bangladesh from their home country of Myanmar at the time of their arrival, where they had been living in fear of being killed by soldiers, police and civilians in recent months. UN experts said this was the first time India had taken a hard line against Myanmar in decades. They also warned that such a move was unlikely to succeed in stopping the exodus of thousands of Muslim Rohingya from its territory, particularly from Bangladesh and Pakistan, because of its porous borders and porous border with Pakistan and Afghanistan. US President Donald Trump has also called for tougher action on Rohingya. Trump is expected to sign an executive order to end the ban on travel from Myanmar on Friday. Meanwhile, US Secretary of State John Kerry has called on Indian President Xi Jinping to visit Myanmar next week to meet with Rohingya leaders in Yangon to discuss the issue. Obama has already made clear he is committed to ending the crackdown on violence against Muslims, while the US has not made any concrete steps toward a peaceful resolution against them. Washington's ambassador to China is also calling on Modi to attend a summit in Beijing on Thursday. Foreign ministers, however, have also expressed concern over the growing tensions between the"

The kneeling protest, to highlight social injustice, has stepped up a gear. Hundreds of National Football League (NFL) stars protested President Donald Trump's call for fans to boycott the league by refusing to stand for the US national anthem this weekend, starting Sunday's game between the Baltimore Ravens and Jacksonsville Jaguars. A number of other players locked arms in solidarity ahead of the game at Wembley Stadium in London. Jacksonville Jaguars' owner Shahid Khan, who last year donated one million dollars\u00a0(840,000 euros) to the Trump campaign, locked his arms with players - a rare scene, as owners almost never take to the field. US media reported that about 200 players on Sunday sat, knelt or raised their fists in defiance of Trump's comments. In one of the most memorable moments, singer Rico LaVelle took a knee and held up a fist at the last line of the Star Spangled Banner ahead of the game between the Detriot Lions and Atlanta Falcons. The protest came in response to Trump's tweets on Sunday morning urging fans to boycott NFL games to pressure the league into firing or suspending players to kneel in protest during the national anthem. In an early morning tweet, Trump posted: \"If NFL fans refuse to go to games until players stop disrespecting our Flag and Country, you will see change take place fast. Fire or suspend!\" \"NFL attendance and ratings are WAY DOWN. Boring games yes, but many stay away because they love our country. League should back US,\" he added. Later, the president said that his rant \"has nothing to do with race,\" despite the fact that the origins of the protest are to do with police brutality against minorities, especially African Americans. Trump said his comments were instead about \"respect for our country and respect for our flag.\" Trump's spat with US professional sports began at a Republican rally in Alabama on Friday, when the president attacked activist NFL players for kneeling or sitting during the national anthem, labelling them as \"sons of bitches.\" \"Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, 'Get that son of a bitch off the field right now... he is fired'?\" Trump told a crowd of cheering supporters. That day, basketball star Stephen Curry, the top player for California's Golden State Warriors, announced that he would not be attending a traditional White House reception honoring the National Basketball Association champions. The kneeling protest was started by former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick who refused to stand for the anthem back in 2016. Kaepernick's gesture came amid a spate of deadly police shootings of black men and was aimed at drawing more attention to treatment of minorities in the US. However, Kaepernick has since become a free agent, after failing to be signed by a new team for the new NFL season. NFL executives decry Trump's calls Trump also drew the ire of senior NFL executives and team owners. Responding to Trump's tweets, Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti, said he \"100 percent\" supported his players' decision to kneel during the anthem. Robert Kraft, the owner of the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots, who is also a close friend of Trump, said in a statement on Sunday that he was deeply disappointed by the president's comments in Alabama. Kraft defended players' rights to \"peacefully affect social change and raise awareness in a manner that they feel is most impactful,\" and said that sports were a unifying force in the US. \"Our political leaders could learn a lot from the lessons of teamwork and working together toward a common goal,\" he said. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, who has taken much of the heat for Kaepernick's failure to find a new team, was also quick to condemn Trump's comments.

The 49ers star, who has been a vocal supporter of President Trump since he took office in January, said he was \"very disappointed\" by the move.

Trump has also called for a boycott of NFL games, saying he will not allow NFL teams to participate in such an event. On Sunday, Trump tweeted that \"the NFL should not be allowed to disrespect our flag and its flag,\" referring to NFL team owners and players who have refused to take part in protests in recent years. His tweet also drew criticism from NFL fans who said they would boycott the game if the players did not take a knee. ESPN's Jemele Hill, in an interview with The Associated Press, reported that Trump had called the protests \"an act of disrespect and disrespect of our nation's flag.\" In response, NFL general manager Rob Kraft issued a series of tweets in response to Khan's comments, calling for him to resign from his position as head of football's governing body. Twitter users have also criticized Trump for his decision to call on the National Football League (NFL) to suspend its players for protesting the flag while they are on their way to Washington, D.C. (AP, AFP, dpa, Reuters) The New York Jets, Dallas Cowboys, New England Patriots, Houston Texans, Baltimore Ravens and New Orleans Saints all declined to comment on his comments. But NFL President Donald \"The President\" Trump is not alone in his criticism of Kaepernick's protest, according to a report in The Washington Post. A number of other NFL executives have criticized the President's remarks, including NFL General Manager Steve Wynn, as well as NFL executive general Colin Kaepernick. Some of those comments have been taken down by Twitter, while others have gone on to say that it is \"unacceptable\" for Trump to make such a call. According to ESPN, \"Trump has made it clear he doesn't respect the right to protest,\" which is a reference to President Barack Obama's 2016 presidential campaign. However, some NFL officials have said the White House has not been aware of any such call, adding that they have not seen any evidence of a protest by any NFL player. That's not the case at all. It's the fact that many people have expressed concern about the Trump administration's stance on kneeling during a game. And that's just the beginning of it. When Trump made the announcement, many of his supporters were quick to point out that there was no such thing as a demonstration of patriotism. Many of them were also critical of Trump and his policies on social issues. One Twitter user called him a racist. Another said Trump should have called out the media for calling out Trump over his remarks. Other users called Trump \"a racist and a bigot\" and criticized him for not standing up to Trump. Meanwhile, others criticized his call to \"stand up and protest\" when he spoke at a news conference in Washington on Monday. Several people also accused Trump of using Twitter as an excuse to attack the NBA. While Trump was not directly addressing the issue, he did say he had no intention of doing so during his speech at his inauguration. This is the first time that a president has criticized a sports event in which a player has knotted his knuckles and knelt in front of an American flag during an NFL game, even though he has done so many times before. Most of these comments were directed at Trump himself, but it's also not clear if he is aware that his words were intended to hurt the football team's players' feelings on national television. For the most part, though, it was an attempt to get the attention of people who were offended by his statement. Stephen Golden Curry is an outspoken critic of sports, particularly the kneeling protest. After the speech, a Twitter follower posted a picture of him holding up a flag in support of Khan and other players protesting during Sunday's game against NFL protests. NBA players have"

        "target": "German FA calls off matches with China under-20 team after protests Germany's football association has called off several friendly matches between China's under-20 team and German lower league sides. The move follows a political protest at the first such match. In a statement released on Friday, the German football association (DFB) announced that the games would be rescheduled for 2018 and that talks would take place between them and their Chinese counterparts in order explore how to move forward. \"To the regret of all parties involved, the project has not received the broad approval that had been expected,\" the DFB said. \"In fact, the project was used by a handful of spectators to send messages that were considered hurtful by the Chinese team, officials, the Chinese Football Association's support staff and Chinese spectators.\" Protests in opening match The first of the arranged matches, against TSV Schott Mainz of the fourth-tier Regionalliga S\u00fcdwest was interrupted midway through the first half when the Chinese players left the field because a small group of activists had unfurled Tibetan flags. The team later returned to the field after the flags had been taken down, before succumbing to a 3-0 defeat. On Monday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry strongly criticized the protest. Initially, it had been thought that the Chinese side would play in the Regionalliga S\u00fcdwest - a regional division of Germany's fourth tier which has only 19 teams but the plan was revised so the matches would just be friendlies. This followed an agreement signed in 2016 between the German FA and the Chinese government to help boost the sport in the Asian country, where the Bundesliga is increasingly popular. Financial boost not enough to soothe concerns Despite the financial boost for the clubs \u2013 TSV Schott Mainz were reportedly paid a fee of \u20ac15,000 ($17.800) for last weekend's game \u2013 the move hasn't proved entirely popular with German fans, many of whom see it as just another example of commercial interests trumping sporting concerns. But the protests, and potential for further disruption, seem to be behind the cancellations - the DFB said both federations were aware of \"substantial evidence of further escalation,\" FSV Frankfurt, who were due to host the Chinese side on Saturday, said earlier this week that they would not ban protests despite an angry response to last week's incident from Beijing. \"We will not back a single centimeter off the basic rights our our democracy, including those relating to freedom of speech,\" FSV Frankfurt President Michael G\u00f6rner said in an interview with the Stuttgarter Nachrichten and Stuttgarter Zeitung newspapers. His words echoed those of DFB vice-president Ronny Zimmerman, who said that the games should be played \"within the framework of freedom of expression.\" The fixtures that have been abandoned include games against Wormatia Worms and Bundesliga club Hoffenheim's reserves. mp/pfd (dpa, SID)",
        "generated_story": "Germany's Under-20 team in the Regionalliga S\u00fcdwest has been canceled due to protests over the cancellation of the tournament. German football association TSV Schott Mainz said on Tuesday that it was cancelling the event. The tournament, which was scheduled to take place on Saturday, had been scheduled for Saturday but was canceled because of protests by the Chinese Football Association (FSV Frankfurt). According to a statement from the Foreign Ministry, the decision was made after a meeting between the two sides on Friday. \"We are disappointed that the game was cancelled,\" said FSV head of football operations Ronny Zimmerman, adding that he was \"not able to attend the match.\" \"It's not the first time that we have had to cancel a tournament,\" he said, referring to last year's World Cup in Russia, where the team was playing against Germany's top-ranked team, FC Bayern Munich. However, it is the second time in three years that Germany has canceled a game in a row. Last year, Germany and China were the only two teams to play each other in this competition, with the other team having to travel to the same venue. It was also the last time a German team had played against a Chinese team. But this time around, there was a lot of good news for both sides. In the end, both teams were unable to qualify for the next round, and the result was decided by a 2-1 defeat to Bayern. Bundesliga coach Michael G\u00f6rner said his team would be playing in their first game since returning to Germany in 2014. He also said that his side would not be allowed to participate in next week's tournament because they were \"too young to compete.\" The game will be played at the Stuttgarter Nachrichten stadium in Wormatia Worms, a suburb of Frankfurt, on the outskirts of Cologne. Germany is expected to host the final on Sunday, but it could take longer than that, as well as the possibility of a postponement, if the situation is not resolved by then. There is also a chance that a new team could be called up to replace the current squad, according to local media reports. On Friday, however, German media reported that there were no plans to make the trip to Cologne, citing a spokesman for German soccer's national governing body. G\u00f6ner also told the German news agency Tages-Anzeiger that \"we are not going to allow this to happen again. We will not let this happen.\" In addition, he added, \"If we do, we will have to be ready for a possible return to normal competition.\" On Tuesday, local news agencies reported on a number of issues, including the suspension of two German players for failing to show up for training on time and a lack of fitness. Many of these issues have been brought up in recent weeks, such as whether the players are fit enough to train and whether they have the right to wear the national team uniform. Some of those issues are also being addressed in Germany. For example, some players have said they don't want to go to China, while others say they would rather play for their country, rather than for other teams. This is a problem that has plagued Germany for many years, because it's a country with a long history of international football. That's why the Bundesliga is so important to them, in particular, that they are so eager to get to know their fans. They want the best out of their players. And that's the reason why they're so excited about the prospect of playing for Germany, even if they can't play against China. So far, they haven't had any problems with their team so far. At the start of this season, only one team has qualified for next season's Bundesliga: the Germany-based Bundesliga. Since then, several teams have failed to reach the group stage, though, this has become more and more difficult for them to achieve their goals. As a result, many of them have struggled to find a way to improve their chances of reaching the knockout stages. With the exception of Bayern, who have won their last two Bundesliga games, their hopes of qualifying for Europe's premier competition have fallen short. After a disappointing season in 2015-16, Bundesliga teams are still struggling to adapt to their new system of domestic competition. Meanwhile, more than a year after they won the Champions League in 2016-17, teams from other countries have also been struggling with injuries and suspensions. Despite the fact that their squad has struggled with injury problems for several years now, most teams still have a good chance of making it into the top four. A few teams, like Bayern and FC K\u00f6ln, have already made it through the qualification round. Nevertheless, all three teams will still be in contention for qualification in 2017-18, when they will face a qualifier against the West German Bundesliga in September. If they fail to do so, then they'll be back in action in 2018-19, after the season is likely to see their chance to win the Europa League qualification"

        "target": "Experts: Taliban have not changed strategy with Kabul restaurant attack The weekend attack on a Kabul restaurant frequented by foreigners came as no surprise to international organizations on the ground. Experts don't believe the Taliban have changed their strategy to target more civilians. Dramatic scenes must have played out in the restaurant: Guests sought cover under tables as a group of terrorists shot wildly into the dining rooms. News agencies report the restaurant owner tried in vain to fend off the attackers. He was among the more than 20 people who perished, most of whom were employees at international organizations. The attackers were also among the dead. During the evening dinner rush, at 7:00 p.m. Friday (17.01.2014), one of three Taliban members detonated his explosives-laden vest and blew a breach in the highly secured restaurant. Neither the man-high blast walls, nor the secured access points with armed guards could stop the attackers. The two remaining terrorists were killed later in a firefight with security forces at the scene. No change in Taliban strategy The suicide bombing on the popular Lebanese restaurant, Taverna Du Liban, in the high-end Kabul neighborhood of Wazir Akbar Khan was the worst attack so far in 2014. Afghanistan votes for a new president in April; and the international troops are scheduled to withdraw from the country by the end of the year. Although there are plans for a small contingent to remain in Afghanistan, President Hamid Karzai first has to sign a bilateral security agreement with the United States. But he continues to play for time. In this context, the Taliban may be targeting civilians more in order to drive out not just the military coalition, but the entire international community. Yet \"as horrible as this incident is, I don't see a change in strategy,\" said Thomas Ruttig, the co-director of the Afghan Analysts Network. Similar attacks have also been launched before, \"at least 12 to 15 times in the past eight years,\" Ruttig said. The worst attack was in 2012 at Qargha Lake, a popular weekend destination near Kabul. More than 20 people were killed, all of them Afghans. Extensive security precautions The Taliban, which normally doesn't miss an opportunity for fiery rhetoric, hasn't declared a change in strategy. A spokesman for the Islamist militant group said the attack was retaliation for a NATO airstrike in Parwan Province, a few kilometers north of Kabul. According to an assistant of the Afghan president, seven children and one woman died in the coalition strike. \"You have to carefully monitor the security situation,\" Nils W\u00f6rmer, head of the Konrad Adenauer Institute in Kabul, told DW. \"But I think it's a bit early to talk about a change in [Taliban] strategy.\" W\u00f6rmer's office lies just a few hundred meters from the site of Friday's attack. He could clearly hear the explosion, which shook the window panes in his office. \"It was immediately clear to me that something had happened,\" W\u00f6rmer recounted. But the Konrad Adenauer Institute was prepared. \"We had a relatively concrete warning in the last week related to our neighborhood, and we were very cautious,\" W\u00f6rmer said. He met with colleagues in his secured office. Like most of the international organizations, the Konrad Adenauer Institute is also integrated into the security networks. \"The security precautions are high,\" W\u00f6rmer said. \"But that doesn't exclude the possibility that something similar could happen again.\" But the Afghan security forces have succeeded in preventing many attacks in the past few months, he said. Kabul residents criticize Taliban An informal, impromptu poll by DW's Kabul correspondent, Hussein Sirat, suggested the Taliban are not winning Afghan hearts and minds with such attacks. \"Wherever the Taliban have killed civilians, they have not achieved their goal,\" said Mirwais, a pedestrian in the Kabul city center. Idris, another Kabul resident, seconded Mirwais' sentiment. \"The Taliban intimidate the people so that the security agreement won't be signed,\" he said. \"But the people won't bend to this intimidation.\" How the international organizations adapt to the tense security situation in Kabul will come after many conversations, analyses, and briefings in the following days. But W\u00f6rmer is not thinking about giving up. \"We have a clear agenda and long-term projects, which I considered to be very sensible,\" W\u00f6rmer said. \"I am of the opinion, as I was before, that what I'm doing here with the Konrad Adenauer Institute is worth the risks.\"",
        "generated_story": "The Taliban haven't changed their strategy with the Kabul restaurant attack Afghan Analysts Network has warned that the Taliban are not going to give up on their fight against the Afghan government. The Taliban, however, have not given up hope that they will be able to defeat the country's government in the long run. Last week, they launched an attack on a restaurant in Kabul's Qargha Lake district, killing at least 10 people and wounding more than 100 others, according to a report by the Konrad Adenauer Institute, a think tank based in Beirut. \"They are still not giving up,\" said Nils W\u00f6rmer, an Afghan analyst at the Institute for the Study of War and Peace in Afghanistan (ISPR) who has been monitoring the situation closely since the attack, which took place on the night of Jan. 11. ISPR has denied responsibility, saying it was an act of terrorism and that it had no intention of carrying out a terrorist attack. However, it has said it will continue to act as a counter-insurgent to the government, and has vowed to do so in a bid to prevent a repeat of last year's deadly attack in which it claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing that killed dozens and wounded hundreds of others. Taliban spokesman Wazir Akbar Khan said the group was not planning to attack the restaurant, but rather to target Afghan security forces. Afghan analysts Network analyst Thomas Ruttig told the AFP news agency that \"the Taliban have been very aggressive in their approach to Afghanistan.\" \"We have seen a number of attacks in recent years,\" he said, adding that some of the most recent attacks were carried out by Taliban fighters, who had been planning attacks on government forces in Parwan Province, the capital of Afghanistan's north-eastern province of Kandahar province. In the past few months, Afghan intelligence agencies have warned of a possible resurgence of Taliban attacks, as well as the possibility of more attacks. But the latest attack came just a few days after the US-led coalition launched airstrikes on Taliban-held territory in eastern Afghanistan. It was the first such attack since 2001, when the United States and its allies launched a joint operation to counter the Islamic State group's growing influence across the region. On Wednesday, US President Donald Trump said he would not allow the attacks to take place again. He also said that he was \"very concerned\" about the security situation in his own country, particularly in northern Afghanistan, where many people have fled to neighboring countries in search of safe havens, such as Lebanon and Iraq. Afghanistan has also been hit by a series of deadly attacks that have claimed the lives of thousands of civilians, many of whom were killed by suicide bombers. Some of these attacks have taken place in neighboring Pakistan, Afghanistan and Pakistan. At the same time, there are also reports of an increase in suicide attacks by militants in Pakistan and Iran. Many of those attacks are being blamed on al-Qaeda, although most of them were not directly linked to IS. According to Afghan officials, this is not the case in any way. They say they have no reason to believe that IS is planning a new attack against Kabul. That's because they don't have the resources to carry out attacks like the one they did last week. This is the second time in less than a year that a Taliban attack has claimed a civilian life. Earlier this year, two people were shot dead by an IS-linked suicide bomber in central Kabul in an apparent attempt to assassinate President Hamid Karzai. Two other attackers were also wounded. One was shot and critically wounded, while the other was critically injured. Another was seriously wounded by gunfire from a roadside bomb. Both were taken to hospital and died of their wounds. Other casualties were reported from the blast, including a car bomb that exploded near the entrance of Kabul International Airport. Officials said they were unable to confirm whether the attacker was a member of IS or an al Qaeda operative. A spokesman for IS said IS was responsible for setting up the strike. 'We are very concerned about this attack,' he told AFP. I am not aware of any specific attack but I do know that we have to be very careful about what we are doing in order to protect our own people. We have a very strong sense of security in our country and we want to make sure that our people are safe. There are a lot of things we can do to ensure that this doesn't happen again, so we need to keep our eyes on it. And that's why I think we should be cautious about it, because we will not be surprised if we do not see any further attacks from IS militants. These attacks come at a time when there is no longer a threat to our homeland. What do you think IS will do next? Is it possible to blame IS for this? ISIS has not yet commented on this incident. Is IS targeting IS, or IS IS?Is IS trying to use IS as an excuse for its actions?ISIS is a terror organization. If the IS attack is an attempt by IS and IS to try to"

        "target": "Inching towards direct talks on Syria They came to hold talks, but started negotiations with mutual affronts. But if there is one person who might be able to mediate between the intransigent Syrian conflict parties, it's Lakhdar Brahimi. Lakhdar Brahimi, the United Nations special envoy for Syria, seemed very tired on Friday (24.01.2014). He had had a long day, which was actually supposed to be the first real day of negotiations at the Syria Conference in Geneva. \"Good afternoon,\" Brahimi told the assembled international press, before adding, \"or good evening, I don't know.\" At the Palais des Nations in Geneva, he presented the most important result of his attempts to mediate between the Syrian government and the opposition to the more than 250 journalists who had managed to get a coveted place at the press conference: \"Tomorrow we expect and we have agreed that we will meet in the same room.\" What Brahimi is declaring an achievement doesn't sound like much, but considering how irreconcilable the conflict parties have been, even that can be seen as a small success. Separate talks with Brahimi The two delegations were actually due to meet on the first day of negotiations in Geneva in order to agree on a timetable and on the subject and agenda of the talks. But emotions are running too high on both sides. Instead both delegations held separate talks with Lahkkdar Brahimi, both lasting just about an hour each In the morning. The Syrian government delegation had apparently been threatening to leave the conference. At least that is what the deputy foreign minister Faisal Mekdad had implied. \"We are here to start the negotiations,\" he told waiting journalists, \"but we found that the other party did not want to come.\" Before the conference, the opposition had explained that for its delegation, the formation of a transition government would be a central tenet of the negotiations. They emphasized that this topic should be discussed right at the beginning of talks and that the establishment of such a body should be initiated without delay. Social media and good old propaganda The representatives of the Syrian National Coalition that were present in Geneva neatly used all imaginable channels to make their views public. At #Geneva2, they tweeted: \"Forming a transitional body is our major priority,\" leaving people in no doubt that the Syrian National Council would not want to include Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Assad's government, on the other hand, is relying on classic propaganda and loyal state media representatives in Geneva. An impressive entourage of dominant journalists from state-run media outlets is constantly at hand, accompanying the government delegation and making sure they get their point across at press conferences. Lakhdar Brahimi even had a small altercation with a journalist from a Syrian state news agency, who made a political statement under the pretense of asking the UN mediator a question. \"Are there any signs that Saudi Arabia, Turkey and other countries would stop the support of terrorism in Syria?,\" she asked in somewhat shaky English, before Brahimi interrupted her. \"Please, please, there is no point in asking such questions!\" Such exchanges hint at the type of negotiating style the experienced diplomat and mediator Brahimi must have behind the scenes. 'Wish us luck' Lakhdar Brahimi described the preliminary talks that took place in Geneva as encouraging and asked for patience. He said that because the peace conference had come about at the last minute and the delegations had therefore only been appointed very recently, there hadn't been enough time to hold preliminary discussions - a task that the delegations were now catching up on. \"We never expected it to be easy and I'm sure it's not going to be,\" he said. \"But I think the two parties understand what is at stake. Their country is in very, very bad shape.\" He added: \"The huge ambition of this process is to save Syria. Nothing less than that.\" After appealing to the willingness of both parties to negotiate, he simply added: \"So wish us luck!\" Fight for freedom As the official delegations held talks with UN mediator Brahimi in the Palais des Nations, the European headquarters of the United Nations, hundreds of Syrian expatriates who had come from all over Europe protested outside, forming a sea of red, white and black Syrian flags on the Place des Nations. With their presence outside the UN gates they wanted to show that despite all the government propaganda, the Syrian National coalition has a lot of support from the Syrian people. Thirty-two-year-old Ziad Malki came to Geneva from Zurich to show his solidarity. Ziad knows how it feels to be deprived of his freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. In 2005, he was arrested at a demonstration in Damascus and says he was tortured during his time in prison. Now he is fighting for a new Syria from outside the country's borders. Ziad is sure that with Bashar al-Assad and his family, there will be nothing new. \"We don't want this man to be in",
        "generated_story": "UN mediates with Syrian National Coalition in Geneva UN mediator Faisal Mekdad has travelled to Geneva, Switzerland, to mediate between the Syrian opposition and the United Nations. The two sides have been meeting in the Swiss city of Palais des Nations since the beginning of the year. They are working together to resolve the conflict in Syria, with the aim of reaching an agreement on a cease-fire between Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government and opposition forces. \"We are going to try to find a way to reach a solution that will allow us to work together,\" he told reporters in Switzerland on Tuesday, adding that he was \"very pleased\" to be able to meet with representatives from both sides. He said he had met with a number of people from the opposition, and that they were all very happy to talk to him. But he added that there was still a lot of work to do before the ceasefire broke down, which he said would take place at the end of March. 'I am very pleased that we have reached a deal that is acceptable to all parties involved in this conflict,' he stressed. Mekdad said the talks had been \"productive\" but that \"we are not ready to give up the fight against the regime.\" \"It is a very difficult situation for the people of Syria and we are very hopeful that it will be a peaceful solution to this problem,\" she said, referring to the civil war that has been raging in eastern Syria for more than two years. In Geneva last week, the UN's chief of staff, Lahkkdar Brahimi, visited Syria's capital, Damascus, for talks on the cessation of hostilities. It was the first time in a long time that a UN envoy had visited the country to discuss the situation there, according to a report by the Geneva-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) which said Assad's regime had used chemical weapons against his own people, including his daughter, Hafez, who was killed in an air strike on April 11. A UN spokesman said that the meeting was a \"constructive\" one, but it was also \"a constructive one\" as well as \"an important one.\" The Syrian government, however, said it had not yet agreed on an end date for a ceasefire, saying it would not be possible to negotiate a truce until the truce was in place. However, it did not rule out the possibility of a peace deal, as it is currently in talks with Russia, Turkey, Iran and other Arab states. On the other hand, there is no indication of an imminent ceasefire. There is also no guarantee that Assad will agree to an extension of his regime's terms of office, despite the fact that his forces are still in control of most of its territory. According to UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, \"the Syrian regime will not change its position in any way at this time.\" He called on all sides to cooperate in resolving the crisis, calling for an immediate ceasefire between Assad and his opponents. At the same time, he urged the international community to take a closer look at what is happening in Aleppo, where the government is trying to achieve a political solution for its people. Speaking to journalists in Zurich on Wednesday, Mek d'Ivoire, a senior UN official, told the AFP news agency that talks were going on at a high level with officials from Geneva and Geneva. She said there were no plans to resume talks until after the negotiations were concluded, though she was optimistic that negotiations would be concluded on Thursday, when talks would resume. Talks were also expected to continue on Friday, she added, citing the lack of progress in negotiations between Damascus and Moscow on issues such as the withdrawal of Russian troops from Aleppo and a possible return of Syrian troops to their country's eastern border with Turkey. This is the second time the Assad regime has agreed to extend its military presence to Syria. Last month, UN Special Rapporteur Nabil El-Wahr reported that Russia and Iran had agreed not to withdraw its forces from Syria in order to prevent an escalation of fighting. Russia has also said they will continue to monitor the ongoing conflict, while Iran has refused to provide weapons to Assad. Moscow and Tehran have also expressed concern over the Russian-backed rebels who are seeking to seize the territory of Idlib province. Assad has repeatedly rejected the idea of arming the rebels, accusing them of being \"terrorists\" and saying they have no intention of doing so. That is not the case in principle. Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, has said Moscow is \"not interested in negotiating with Damascus. I think it's a matter of time before we get a chance to make a breakthrough. We have to see what the Russians are willing to accept, if they want to, that this is something that can be done. For now, we will wait and see how long it takes for Assad to return to his country. Meanwhile, Russia's envoy to Moscow has promised to hold a meeting with Moscow to ensure that Moscow will cooperate with Washington and Ankara to end the"

He was 45. The Catalan club announced the death of its former bench boss in a statement posted on its website on Friday. \"FC Barcelona is in immense mourning. Tito Vilanova has died at the age of 45. May he rest in peace,\" the statement said. Vilanova had first been diagnosed with a tumor in a saliva gland in November 2011, while he was an assistant to then-Barcelona head coach Pep Guardiola. He had been battling against recurring cancer ever since and had been admitted to a Barcelona hospital last week. He led Barca to the Primera Liga title last season, his only campaign as head coach, when the Catalans earned a record-tying 100 points. Last July he stepped down due to his ongoing health problems.

He was 83. \"I have been suffering from cancer for a long time,\" he told the Catalan newspaper El Pais, adding that he had been battling the disease for the past three years. His death comes after he battled cancer in the first half of last season. The Catalan football federation said on Tuesday that the cancer had spread to his lymph nodes, causing him to have to undergo chemotherapy and radiation treatments in order to be able to live again. According to the club's website, he was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer at the age of 83, and died on Monday at a Barcelona hospital. It is not clear how long he would live, but it is thought he died of a heart attack, according to a Catalan news agency, which cited a doctor as saying that his condition was \"very serious.\" \"It is a very serious illness,\" said the newspaper, quoting an unnamed Catalan doctor who was treated for cancer earlier this year. In his final days of treatment, the former Barcelona coach said he hoped to recover from the illness by the end of the year, when he and his wife would return to their home town of Barcelona, where they had spent the last two years of his life. However, his health was not good enough for his family to take him back to Barcelona for treatment. 'I am very sick,' he said, referring to an illness that has left him unable to communicate with the outside world. At the same time, in his last few days he has been hospitalized with symptoms of colon cancer, a condition that can be treated with chemotherapy. But he did not appear to suffer from any of those symptoms, as his doctors told him he could not speak for several days. For now, however, there is no word on whether he will be allowed back into the team for another three months. Barcelona's new coach, Guardiola, said in an interview with El Mundo newspaper that \"it is very difficult for me to talk about the situation in Catalonia.\" He also said that there was no chance of him returning to play for Barcelona next season, despite the fact that it was a difficult season for him and the city's football team to get back on track after a series of poor results in recent seasons. And he also called on his fans to support his team in their efforts to improve their chances of reaching the next level of league play. A spokesman for Guardiola said: \"We are very sorry to hear of this. We are deeply saddened by this and we will continue to do our best to make sure that we are doing everything we can to help the people of Catalonia who have suffered so much in this difficult time. I have no doubt that this will not be the case for us.\" The Spanish league is the most important league in Spain, with more than 70,000 teams competing for top honours every year and a total of 1.5 million euros ($2.3 billion) in prize money. That's a lot of money to spend on a team that is already struggling to reach the top of its domestic league table and has struggled to keep up with top-tier teams. Last year's title winners Barcelona won their first ever league title, beating Real Madrid 3-0. Since then, they have had to settle for second place in La Liga, after losing the title to Sevilla in 2014. They are currently in third place, behind only Barcelona and Real Betis in fourth place. This year they are expected to win the Primera Liga and are hoping to avoid a repeat of their 2014 title win, although they will have a tough task ahead of them this time around. After all, this is Catalonia's first title since the Spanish Civil War ended in 2006. There are a number of reasons for this, though. First, it's not easy to predict the future of football. Second, Barcelona are facing a serious financial crisis, especially in terms of salaries and wages. Then there's the prospect of losing their best player, Neymar, who is also in charge of defending his title. If they don't make the Champions League, that could be a big problem for them, because they won't have the resources to compete with other teams in Europe. Nevertheless, many fans are still hoping that they can get their money's worth out of it. With the current financial situation, their hopes of winning the league are low. Guardiola and Guardiola are hopeful that a new generation of players will step up their game and make a strong start in 2017. Despite the financial troubles that have plagued them for so long, even if they do not make it through the season's second round of matches. Catalan fans have already been disappointed with their team's performance in 2016. Many fans were disappointed by their lack of financial stability, particularly after they lost their top scorer, Sergio Ramos, last year when they were relegated to second-placed FC Barcelona. Spanish media reported that Barcelona is still a few months ago"

He said that his victory meant voters had chosed the path of \"European Integration.\" Exit polls gave Petro Poroshenko, a 48-year-old billionaire and owner of a chocolate factory, between 55.9 and 57.3 percent of the vote. This put him well ahead of former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, who was reported to have come in second, at 12.9 percent. Andrij Shevchenko, one of Tymoshenko's political allies, said on Twitter that she had conceded defeat. DW's reporter Kitty Logan in Kyiv said voter turnout was extremely high in the capital. Most polling stations in the east of the country remained closed on Sunday. If the figures are confirmed, there will not be a need for a runoff on June 15. Poroshenko, who has promised closer economic and political ties with the West, has also vowed to mend relations with Russia, but insisted that Ukraine's territorial integrity was of top importance to him. In his first statements following the publication of the early results, Poroshenko announced he would travel to the east of the country quickly. He also announced that parliamentary elections would be held later this year. rg/lw (Reuters, dpa)",
        "generated_story": "Ukraine's Petro Poroshenko wins presidential election in exit polls Ukraine's president has won the first round of the country's presidential elections, according to exit poll results released on Sunday. The results are expected to be announced on Monday, the day before the vote in Kyiv, which is due to take place on June 7. Ukrainian presidential candidate Andrij Shevchenko has been elected to the post of president of Ukraine, after a two-year campaign in which he lost to incumbent Yulia Tymoshenko. \"I am very happy with the results,\" she told DW, adding that she was \"very happy\" with her victory. But she also said she would not accept a second term as president because she did not want to give up her post as prime minister in the next two years. She said the election would be a referendum on the future of Ukrainian democracy, and that the people would have to decide for themselves whether they wanted to stay in power or not. Opinion polls show the winner of Sunday's election will be the former president, who was elected by a majority of 1.4 million voters in a parliamentary election held in Ukraine in 2014. In the past, she had been a strong candidate for the presidency, but she failed to win a third term. On Sunday, however, a new poll showed her as the most popular candidate, ahead of her main rival, former Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych. According to a Reuters poll, Yanukovych's victory was a surprise, as he had promised to step down from his post at the end of last year's general election. Yanukovych, meanwhile, has said he will not seek another term in office, saying he wants to return to politics as soon as possible. He has also promised that he would seek a fourth term if he is re-elected to parliament. Ukraine has a long list of candidates who have won elections in recent years, with a total of five candidates vying for a fifth consecutive term, including two who are currently in opposition. Many of them are from the pro-Kremlin opposition, such as former President Viktor Yanukovich, whose party is backed by Yanukovska party. However, it is unclear how many candidates will win the second round, given that they have not yet been able to form a coalition government. Meanwhile, several candidates have already announced their intentions to enter the presidential race, while a number of others have said they are still undecided on who will take the oath of office. Some of these candidates are known as \"pro-Europeans,\" while others are called \"Europhiles\" and \"europhants.\" The main opposition parties are the Socialists and the Greens. They have called for an early election, although they do not have a clear majority in parliament, because of a lack of popular support in their own right. Opposition parties have been unable to reach a consensus on what to do about the new president's policies and who should be allowed to run for president. That is, they say they will continue to campaign for him, even if they don't agree with him on everything he says and does not believe in his policies. For now, there is no clear indication of what will happen in this election and it's not clear what the outcome will look like. It's unclear whether the current president is going to make a final decision on how to proceed with his campaign, or whether he plans to use his new position as a candidate. If he does, he could face a tough time in getting the support of his own party's supporters. And that's a big problem for many Ukrainians, since he's the only candidate who has not won a single election since the early 1990s, when he was first elected in 2006. So far, so good, in fact, that is the case. There is a lot of good news for those who want a change of government in Kiev, though. At the same time, Ukraine is also facing a difficult situation in terms of its economy, where the economy is suffering from a severe recession and unemployment is high. A new government is expected in many parts of eastern Ukraine. This is not a good thing, especially in light of recent economic troubles. One thing is for certain: the economic crisis has made it very difficult for Ukrainians to find a way out of their current situation. As a result of this, many people are already feeling the effects of austerity and austerity measures. What is clear is that Ukraine will need to focus on economic reforms and economic growth in order to achieve its goal of becoming a more prosperous country. After all, this is only the beginning of an economic recovery, not just a temporary solution to economic problems. With the government's economic woes, economic stagnation and political instability, things are looking up for them, at least for now. Analysts predict that it will only get worse. Last week, polls showed that Ukrainians are likely to see an increase in unemployment, unemployment and wage stagnation. Unemployment is already high in some areas, particularly in rural areas.

Although the number of farms has declined over the decades, production has actually increased -- especially at dairy farms. Modern automation technology and robotics are helping to keep both cows and farmers happy, but at the cost of jobs.",
        "generated_story": "Automation in the Dairy Cow Industry In Germany, Automation is the key to the future of the dairy cow industry. The industry has been growing rapidly in recent years, with the introduction of automated cow slaughter machines and the development of new technology. But the industry is still in a very early stage of development. In the first few years of its existence, the production of dairy cows in Germany was limited to a few thousand cows a year. Now, it's up to farmers to make up for this shortfall in production. Dairy cow production is expected to double by 2020, according to industry experts. However, there's still a lot of work to be done to improve the quality of cow milk, which is a key reason for the decline of milk production in Europe. It's not just milk that is being produced, but also meat, eggs and dairy products. There's also the fact that cows are being slaughtered at a much higher rate than other cows. This is not a new problem for dairy farmers, who have been making milk for decades. They've been producing milk since the 1950s, and they're still producing it for a long time. That's why they've had to invest in new machinery, equipment and processes to produce milk and eggs. And now, they have to do it all again, in order to keep the milk fresh and fresh, so that the cows don't get sick. \"It's a good thing that we're doing it,\" said one of their representatives, Hans-Joachim Heydrich. He added that he was \"very happy\" to see the technology being developed, adding that \"we're not going to stop until we get it right.\" He also said that it would be \"a great step forward\" for milk producers, as it will help them to reduce the cost of production and improve their milk quality. Meanwhile, he said, \"We've got to get our cows back to their natural state,\" which means they'll be able to eat more milk without the need for refrigeration. What's more, we've already seen the results of this technology in other countries, such as China, India, Japan and South Korea, where milk is made from milk. We've also seen a rise in demand for fresh milk from farmers in China and India. So, what's the next step in this process? We'll see if we can get the best out of it, right? The first step is to develop a system that will make it easier for farmers and consumers to grow milk in their own fields. Then we'll get to know each other better. For example, if you have a cow, you can make milk at home and then sell it at the same time as you eat it. How do you know how much milk you're eating? How can you tell which cow is good for you? You can tell by looking at your milk? And then you'll find out. You'll also see what the market is like in your own country. If you've never had milk or eggs, that's because the cow doesn't have enough milk to feed its cows, because it has no milk left in its body. I'm not sure how long it'll last. When I was growing up, I used to have milk as a child and now I've grown up with a milk carton. Today, milk was a staple of my diet and I grew up eating milk with my mother and my father. She was very good at milk - and she still has milk cows - but now she's very old, too. Her milk has become very expensive and very thin, she said. As a result, her milk isn't as good as milk can be made, especially when it comes from cows that are not milked. With milk grown in dairy farms, this means that milk will be available for slaughter, rather than milk produced in milkhouses. Milk is an important part of your diet. Food is also very important to you, since milk makes you feel good when you are growing and you want to use milk more than you need milk! The milk itself is important for your family, for example. A milk cow can also be used as an energy source. (Reuters, AFP, dpa) (AFP, Reuters, AP) \"Milan\" - The Associated Press) - In a statement, a spokesperson for Dairy Milk, an independent dairy company, said the company said it was not possible to find a dairy farm that could be sold to someone who wanted to sell milk because milk wasn't available at that price. According to its website, McDonald's was the only milk company that sold milk there. Since then, when I started working at McDonalds and milk products are now available to people who are milk-free. Even if milk powder is scarce, butter is hard to buy. After all, dairy is only available in small quantities. Therefore, even if it is sold in large quantities at this time of year, cows can still be frozen and frozen. These cows need to stay healthy and healthy. Why? I think"

        "target": "European court overturns law requiring German-language skills for spouse visas The European Court of Justice has overturned a German law requiring foreign spouses from certain non-EU countries to take a language test before receiving a visa. The ruling primarily affects Germany's Turkish minority. The European Union's highest court on Thursday ruled in favor of a Turkish citizen, who was denied a visa to live in Germany with her husband, because she was illiterate and therefore unable to demonstrate basic German-language skills. According to the court, a lack of language skills shouldn't automatically lead to the rejection of an entry visa application. Instead, Germany must consider the unique circumstances of each individual case. The court went on to say that quickly granting visas for spouses improves the quality of life and promotes the integration of foreign residents. Specifically addressing the case of the Turkish plaintiff, the court ruled that the rejection of her visa had violated a bilateral treaty between Turkey and the EU. In 1970, Brussels and Ankara agreed not to tighten their residency laws for each other's citizens. Law only applies to some In 2007, Germany introduced the requirement that spouses from certain non-EU countries must demonstrate a basic grasp of German before being granted a visa to live in Germany with their husbands or wives. Spouses affected by the law are required to obtain a basic language certificate from recognized centers, such as Germany's Goethe Institute, proving that they have an A1 level, or \"Beginning German\" language ability. The German government claims that the goal of the language requirement is to prevent forced marriages as well as marriages made simply for the sake of obtaining a visa. Citizens of European Free Trade Association (EFTA) member states are exempt from the language requirement. That includes Iceland, Lichtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. In addition, citizens of Australia, Canada, Israel, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea and the United States also don't have to demonstrate German-language skills. slk/xx (AFP, AP, dpa, KNA)",
        "generated_story": "European Court of Justice overturns law requiring language skills for spouses in Germany A European court of justice has overturned a law that requires spouses to learn to speak Turkish. The court ruled in favor of the law, which was passed by the European Union's lower house of parliament in Strasbourg on Thursday. It is the first time that a court has ruled against a marriage equality law in the EU. According to the court, the new law is aimed at reducing the number of marriages in which spouses are required to use Turkish as a second language. \"It is an important step for the spouses of spouses who are married to Turkish citizens,\" said Justice Minister Thomas de Maiziere, adding that it would be a \"significant step\" for them to be able to understand the language of their spouses and their children. In the case of Germany, it was the second time in a row that the courts had ruled that spouses must learn Turkish in order to marry. Germany's highest court on Wednesday upheld the decision, saying it did not violate the German constitution. But it said it had to do with the fact that Turkish spouses were not allowed to take part in marriages, and that they would have to have the right to divorce if they wanted to. German courts have also upheld a similar law passed in 2004, but the ruling was overturned by a lower court in Brussels, where a German court had found it unconstitutional to impose a divorce law on a Turkish couple who were married for more than 30 years. That ruling, however, was upheld by an appeals court that found that Germany had violated the constitution by failing to recognize the marital status of a married couple, who had been living together for 25 years and had no children, as well as the rights of other European countries to separate their citizens from each other. This is a significant step in Europe's long-running legal battle over the issue of divorce. For years, Germany and other EU member states have struggled to find a way to get married without having to pay for legal fees. However, in recent years Germany has become the only European country to allow married couples to live together without the need for divorce, while in other countries, such as France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece and the United Kingdom, Turkey and Spain have all had their own divorce laws in place, according to a report from the Goethe Institute, a think tank based in Berlin. And in some cases, this has led to legal challenges, with many of them in courts across the continent, including in Belgium, France and Germany. Some of these cases have been referred to as \"unlawful marriages\" because they have no legal basis for divorces. They are not legally binding on spouses, although they can be legally married in their home country of origin. There is also the possibility of legal action against the Turkish government if the marriage is not recognized as legal and legal. Many of those who have divorced have had children and are unable to remarry because of this, or because their marriages have not been legally settled. If the divorce is settled, they will be forced to return to their native country and have a child with a partner who does not have legal representation in that country. As a result, there is no way of knowing if their child will have an equal chance of getting married, even if he or she has a legal status in this country, since they are already married. With the exception of one case, that case is currently pending before the Supreme Court in Frankfurt. A German judge has also ruled on the basis of an appeal from a previous court ruling in 2014, ruling that divorce should not be allowed because the child's parents cannot legally have children with Turkish parents. At the same time, German and Turkish law enforcement agencies have said they don't want to interfere with legal proceedings in cases involving divorce proceedings. These cases are being handled by courts in countries where the children are still in school, rather than by their parents or guardians. On the other hand, European courts are expected to decide whether or not to enforce the separation of children from their parent's home countries. Last year, judges in several European states upheld an EU court's decision to uphold the family separation law. Since then, legal experts have argued that this law has been used to protect the interests of Turkish nationals, particularly those with dual citizenship, because it is illegal to leave the country without legal protection. (Reuters, AFP, dpa, Reuters, AP)The European Court has rejected the appeal by Turkish lawyers, calling it an \"absurd decision.\" The case was brought by lawyers representing the government of Turkey, an organization that represents the state of Bavaria, Austria and Switzerland.The court also rejected a request by Turkey to settle a dispute between the two countries' courts over a separate divorce case that was settled in 2015. After a long legal process, lawyers from both countries have appealed the lower courts' decision. Turkish courts also said that Turkey has not yet reached an agreement on whether to adopt a new divorce settlement. Turkey's case could be heard in court. Read more: The EU's appeal is expected"

The opposition Law and Justice party failed in its bid to oust Prime Minister Donald Tusk on Friday through a vote confidence, the second such vote since the publication of private conversations between high-ranking officials, referred to by some in Poland as \"Waitergate.\" Tusk withstood the opposition challenge by a wide margin of 236-155. The prime minister's Civic Platform party governs Poland in a center-right coalition with the Polish People's party. Last month, recordings of a private conversation between Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski and then-Finance Minister Jacek Rostowski were published by the weekly magazine Wprost. During the conversation, Sikorski said the US-Polish alliance was \"worthless\" and British Prime Minister David Cameron's concessions to euroskeptics had shown his \"incompetence in EU affairs.\" Prior to the leak of the Sikorski recording, Wprost also published a tape in which central bank chief Marek Belka told Interior Minister Bartlomiej Sienkiewicz that he would only support the government's economic policy if Finance Minister Rostowski left his post. The secret recordings were reportedly made over several months, including at high end restaurants in Warsaw. Wprost says it received the tapes from a businessman.

Law and Justice Minister of Justice Radoslaw Sikorski said on Wednesday that he would resign as president of the country's parliament. \"I will resign immediately,\" he said in a statement. Polish Prime Minister J\u00f3zsef Kaczy\u0144ska said the president's resignation was the result of an internal dispute between the ruling Civic Platform party and the government. The two parties have been at loggerheads for months over the handling of a scandal that has rocked Poland's political landscape. In an interview with Polish news agency Wprost, the prime minister said he was \"deeply troubled\" by the scandal, adding that it was not the first time he had been accused of sexually abusing women. He also said that the allegations against him were \"completely false.\" \"It's not just a matter of one man, it's about two men, one woman, and one child,\" said Rostowski, who is also a member of Polish parliament's executive committee. Poland has been embroiled in an ongoing political crisis for years, with a number of political parties and parties accusing each other of being behind a series of scandals that have tarnished the image of Poland as a democratic country. At the same time, Poland is facing a new generation of politicians who want to change the way it is governed. This time around, however, there will be a change of government, which is expected to take place within the next few months, according to Polish media reports. On Wednesday, Polish President Jusztawier Zielinski announced his resignation from his post as head of parliament, citing a \"serious lack of trust\" in his successor. According to the BBC, he resigned in protest over a tape that showed him kissing a woman in front of his wife and two children. It is not clear whether he is referring to himself as \"the president\" or to his daughter, but he has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. His resignation comes amid a row between his government and opposition parties over alleged sexual abuse of women by a man who was then married to a Polish-born woman. Both men have denied the accusations, saying they were not aware of any such abuse and that they did not have any knowledge of it at the time of their marriage. A spokesman for his party, R\u0119dzimierz Wojciech Wolski, said it would not comment further on the matter. Wrost added that \"there is no doubt that there is a lot of blame for this.\" The BBC's WPA news program, published on Tuesday, also reported that Polish lawmakers had called on President Trump to resign, as well as other European Union leaders to do so. But the Polish president has refused to say whether they would accept the move. Instead, they have said they will continue to press on with their efforts to improve relations with the United Kingdom, a position which has become increasingly difficult in recent months. They have also accused the European Commission of not doing enough to protect Polish women and girls from being abused by their husbands and their children, while also accusing the EU of failing to provide adequate protection for women's rights. And they are also calling on Poland to stop allowing women to have sex with men who are not citizens, such as women in Poland, to be allowed to marry in their home countries. That would be an unprecedented step for a country where women are considered a victim of domestic abuse. However, WProst also pointed out that many Poles do not believe that this is the case with respect to women, especially those with children and children who have suffered from domestic violence. Many Polish politicians have expressed concern about the situation in Europe, particularly in relation to their own children's education, education and health care. Some of them have criticized the current government's treatment of young girls and young people. Others have accused it of politicizing the issue, accusing it as an attempt to undermine the rule of law. Meanwhile, some Polish journalists have suggested that Poland could be left with little to show for its actions. There are reports that some of these accusations are being made against the new president. One of those is that a journalist who has worked in law and justice has also been arrested in connection with an investigation into a case in which a child was sexually abused at a school in Warsaw. Another is saying that if the child is raped, she should be released from the care of her father. Other Polish officials have called the incident \"a disgrace\" and said she was being punished for her actions, because she has not been able to speak out against her husband and her family. These allegations have led to accusations of child abuse in her home country, where she is currently living with her mother and stepfather.

Meanwhile, the death toll in Gaza continues to rise. Medics on Monday said the number of Palestinian deaths in Gaza has risen to more than 501 since fighting intensified on Jul 8. Most of the dead are civilians. On the Israeli side, 13 soldiers were killed inside Gaza on Sunday, raising the number of soldiers killed since a ground operation began late on Thursday to 18. Two Israeli civilians also died in mortar and rocket attacks. The Israeli army said that more than 10 militants from Gaza were shot dead on Monday after infiltrating southern Israel. According to army spokespeople, two squads of militants were killed after tunneling into Israel. Israel's UN ambassador Ron Prosor, meanwhile, denied a claim by Hamas that an Israeli soldier had been kidnapped by the Islamist group, saying: \"Those rumurs are untrue.\" US President Barack Obama expressed concern about the rising death toll of civilians in a telephone call Sunday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, according to a White House statement. The US State Department confirmed late Sunday that two US citizens were killed in Gaza violence and released their names, but did not immediately disclose their occupations.

Kerry is expected to attend a meeting of the United Nations Security Council, which is scheduled to take place at the end of this week. \"We have a lot of work to do,\" Kerry said in a statement, adding that he was \"very optimistic\" about the prospects of a peace deal between the two countries. He also said he hoped to see an end to the violence between Hamas and Israel in Gaza, where it has been fighting for years for control of territory for the Jewish state since the 1967 Six-Day War against Israel began in 1967. Israel, however, has refused to recognize Hamas as a terrorist organization, saying it is a state of war and that it does not have the right to impose its own laws on the Palestinians. Netanyahu, meanwhile, says he has no intention of imposing his own law on Hamas, a group that has ruled Gaza for more than a century. Israeli Foreign Minister Ron Prosor said on Wednesday that Israel was ready to negotiate with Hamas if it wanted to, but that \"it would be impossible for Hamas to achieve that.\" \"It's a very difficult situation for us,\" he said, referring to Israel's military and security forces, as well as the fact that Hamas is the most powerful terrorist group in Israel. In the past, Hamas has claimed responsibility for attacks on Israeli civilians, including the deaths of hundreds of civilians. Last week, Israel said it was preparing to launch an offensive against Hamas in response to a series of rocket attacks by the group. On Wednesday, the US and Israeli military said they had agreed to an agreement on a cease-fire, after which Hamas would cease to exist. However, Israeli officials have said that the deal is unlikely to be reached until at least mid-January, when Israel will resume its military operations against Gaza's Hamas-ruled territory. US President Barack Obama has called for an immediate ceasefire to end the conflict, while Israel has vowed to continue its campaign against the militant group, known as Hamas. Washington has also called on Israel to refrain from any further military incursions into Gaza until the ceasefire is in place, according to US Foreign Secretary Kerry, who was visiting the Egyptian capital, Cairo, for talks on Monday. Obama's visit to Cairo comes a day after Israel announced a new round of military exercises in which it would deploy troops, tanks and aircraft to Gaza to fight the Islamic State (IS) in an attempt to retake the territory it once controlled. It was the first time Israel had been able to use military force against IS since World War II, and it will be the last time it uses such a weapon in its war against terror. But Kerry's trip to Egypt comes at a time of heightened tensions between Washington and Cairo. His visit comes just days before the UN General Assembly convenes in New York for its annual meeting on Friday to consider the possibility of an Israeli-Palestinian peace conference in November. A number of senior US diplomats have already been invited to visit Cairo this month. Many of them are from the Middle East and North Africa. They have also been in Egypt for several weeks, meeting with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and his wife, Fatah al-Hajjani, in recent weeks. Both have expressed concern over the lack of progress in negotiations with Israel over a potential ceasefire. Abbas, Netanyahu and Netanyahu have all denied that a deal was reached, though, insisting that they have not yet reached a final agreement. 'We are not going to give up on this,' Kerry told reporters on condition of anonymity in order to speak to reporters in Washington, D.C. (Reuters, AP, AFP, dpa, Reuters) Kerry also met with Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi and other senior Israeli diplomats at Cairo's Foreign Ministry on Thursday. After the meeting, Kerry was asked if he would discuss the situation with Netanyahu. According to Israeli media reports, he told them that there were no plans to hold an emergency meeting between Israeli and Palestinian leaders, although he did not rule out the idea of holding a military conference. Palestinians have long been calling for peace talks with their government to try to find a way to reach a solution to their longstanding dispute over Jerusalem's fate. Palestinian officials say the talks are likely to go ahead despite the threat of violence and a renewed threat from Hamas from within the West Bank and Gaza. Meanwhile, Palestinian activists say they are still hopeful that talks will continue, even if they do not get a chance to make a breakthrough in their efforts to resolve their differences. Hamas's spokesman, Reuven Rivlin, told the Associated Press on Sunday that negotiations are on track to resume. Jerusalem is one of several countries that are currently in talks between Israelis and Palestinians who have reached with a"

        "target": "MSF says Ebola 'fast,' medics 'facing war-like scenario' The medical charity MSF has warned that western Africa's Ebola crisis is \"moving faster\" than medics can cope with. Its warning follows a WHO admission that the epidemic requires \"extraordinary measures.\" The head of Medicins Sans Frontieres (MSF), Joanne Liu -- fresh from a visit to western Africa -- said in Geneva on Friday that more experts were needed in the hard-hit region. \"It is deteriorating faster, and moving faster, than we can respond to,\" Liu told reporters. \"Like in a war time, we have a total collapse of infrastructure,\" she added. Lui said the world community needed to get the \"upper hand\" over the next six months. While the viral spread had been slowed in Guinea, concerns focused especially on Liberia. \"If we don't stabilize Liberia, we will never stabilize the region,\" Lui said. She was critical of the WHO for delaying its public health emergency warning until August 8. \"We need people with a hands-on operational mindset,\" to combat the outbreak, Liu told the Geneva news briefing. WHO - 'vastly underestimated' On Thursday, the World Health Organization (WHO) said the scale of the epidemic had been \"vastly underestimated\" and that \"extraordinary measures\" were needed to contain the contagious virus. The UN health agency said the death toll had climbed to 1,069 in four afflicted countries, spanning Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia and more recently Nigeria. Sierra Leone's chief medical officer Brima Kargbo disclosed on Thursday that at least 32 of the nation's nurses and doctors had died from the Ebola virus while performing their duties between May 24 and August 13. Local staff suffered stigma, despite saving lives, Kargbo said. \"We still have to break the chain of transmission to separate the infected from the uninfected.\" Youth Olympics also affected The mounting alarm coincided with an announcement Friday from the International Olympics Committee that three athletes from Ebola-hit countries had been barred from competing in pool events and combat sports at the Youth Olympics opening in China on Saturday. ipj/tj (AfP, Reuters)",
        "generated_story": "World Health Organization warns Ebola crisis is progressing faster than it should be The World Health Organisation (WHO) has warned that the outbreak of Ebola in Sierra Leone is 'progressing faster' than previously thought. The WHO said in a statement on Tuesday that it was working to prevent the spread of the deadly virus, which has killed more than 1,000 people in the past two months. It said the virus was spreading rapidly and that health workers were not able to respond quickly enough. \"We are working very hard to stop it from spreading,\" WHO spokeswoman Joanne Liu told reporters in Geneva. She added that there was no indication that Ebola had spread to other countries, including the United States and China, but that this was not the case for the first time. Ebola is spreading fast, she said, adding that more people are dying from the disease than from other diseases, such as malaria, tuberculosis and HIV. According to Liu, the Ebola outbreak has spread from Guinea to Liberia and is now spreading to the West African nation of Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Madre, where it is believed to be the most deadly outbreak in recorded history. In addition, there are reports of deaths from Ebola, as well as from human-caused diseases like HIV, hepatitis C and Ebola. Doctors at the WHO have warned of an outbreak that could last up to a year and a half. They are also warning that if the epidemic continues to spread, it could lead to an even longer period of time before it can be eradicated. Experts say the current outbreak is the worst in human history, with the death toll rising to at least 2,500 people, according to WHO data released on Wednesday. There is also concern about the possibility of a resurgence in Ebola cases, and the risk of contagion spreading in other parts of Africa, particularly in Africa and Asia. As a result, health officials have been scrambling to find ways to deal with Ebola outbreaks in countries where the crisis has been so severe that they have to step up their efforts to contain it. At the same time, they are trying to reduce the number of people who are suffering from it, a WHO spokesman said. He added: \"This is not an isolated outbreak, this is a very serious outbreak and we are not going to allow this to happen again. We want to make sure that we have the resources we need to tackle this quickly and effectively.\" WHO: Ebola epidemic spreading faster and more rapidly than in past outbreaks The UN's Ebola response agency, WHO, has said it will continue to monitor the situation closely, saying it has seen an increase in cases in recent years. But it's not clear how quickly Ebola will spread and how long it would take for it to reach the country's people. WHO says it won't have enough resources to cope with a crisis like the one that is currently unfolding in Liberia. Meanwhile, international health experts are warning the world's most populous country that a new outbreak could be a major threat to its survival. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for an urgent international response to Ebola and urged the international community to take action to address the humanitarian crisis. However, he also called on the UN to do more to protect the lives of those affected by the pandemic, calling for a swift response from WHO and other international organizations to act. This could mean that countries like China and Russia will step in to help the fight against Ebola if they don't act quickly. China has already stepped up its own response, while Russia and Iran have also stepped in as a mediator to try and prevent a similar outbreak. A UN spokesman told Reuters that \"it is very difficult to predict what will happen if we do not act fast enough.\" \"The situation is extremely complex,\" he added, pointing out that many countries have already taken steps to combat the problem. For example, China is one of several countries that has not yet taken action on Ebola but has pledged to cooperate with international efforts. Other countries are already working on a response plan to stem the flow of deadly diseases. That includes the US, France, Britain and Germany, who have all agreed to provide medical aid to those in need of medical treatment. So far, however, no action is being taken on this front, despite the fact that most of them have not been given the necessary time to prepare for their own emergencies. Some of these efforts are still being made, though, in part because of China's reluctance to intervene. On the other hand, others have expressed concern over the lack of resources available to treat Ebola patients in their countries. These include the International Health Agency (NHS) and World Bank (WMO) which have said they will do their utmost to ensure that no one is caught up in this crisis, especially if Ebola spreads to neighboring countries and countries with large populations of patients. World health agencies have yet to receive the aid they need. International aid agencies like UNICEF and WHO are currently working closely with UN agencies to develop a strategy for dealing with this problem and are now working together to improve their response.

Conservative members of Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition put forward a united front at the weekend against recent developments in the city of Wuppertal. Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said civilians wearing uniforms bearing the logo \"Shariah police\" could not simply start patrolling German streets. The groups reportedly hovered around sites like discotheques and gambling houses, telling passers-by to refrain from gambling and alcohol. Wuppertal's police have begun pressing charges. \"Sharia law is not tolerated on German soil,\" de Maiziere told mass-circulation daily Bild on Saturday. \"Nobody can take it upon themselves to abuse the good name of the German police.\" Justice Minister Heiko Maas, meanwhile, told Bild that \"the state alone\" was responsible for the administration of justice in Germany. It was obvious, Maas said, that any illegal parallel system of law enforcement would not be tolerated. Christian Democrat party whip Volker Kauder was similarly emphatic in an interview to be published in this week's Welt am Sonntag newspaper. \"Under absolutely no circumstances can we tolerate self-styled 'Sharia police officers' patrolling our streets and dictating what people should or should not do,\" Kauder said. Ringleader: goal was attention The 33-year-old behind the Wuppertal patrols, former fireman Sven Lau, published a video on his website on Saturday. Lau said that a \"Sharia police\" never existed, and that a group of men had simply worn the mock uniforms for a few hours. \"We knew that this would raise attention,\" Lau said, claiming that his goal was to spark a debate about Sharia law in Germany. Lau is a leading member of Germany's Salafist movement, advocates of a strict Sunni interpretation of political Islam. He works with a mosque in his native M\u00f6nchengladbach, not far west of Wuppertal, and used to head the fundamentalist group \"Invitation to Paradise.\" (Einladung zum Paradies, in German.) The central council of Muslims in Germany (ZMD) condemned the activities. \"These few teen yobs do not speak in our name,\" chairman Ayman A. Mazyek told the Tagesspiegel am Sonntag newspaper. \"These people are perverting the name of our religion. With this shrill and foolish action, they are really hurting Muslims.\" Sharia law is the Arabic term for a legal system based on the Koran. Saudi Arabia and Iran are examples of countries where such a system officially applies. Wearing a veil is obligatory for women and corporal punishment such as stoning is legally tolerated. Human Rights Watch reported last month that Saudi Arabia had beheaded 19 people in just 16 days in August, for convictions on charges ranging from cannabis smuggling to \"sorcery.\" msh/rc (AFP, dpa, Reuters)",

The chancellor's spokesman, Volker Kauder, told Bild am Sonntag that the police would not be tolerated in the city. He said they would \"not tolerate any form of Sharia law in Germany.\" He added that he was not aware of any such law, but that it had been put in place to protect Muslims from the threat posed by the Islamic State (IS) and other extremist groups. According to the Christian Democrat newspaper Bild, the \"Islamic State\" is \"a terrorist organization\" and has been operating since the beginning of the 20th century. On Sunday, he called on the German government to take action against the IS, which he described as a \"sharia-like organization.\" \"I am not a Muslim, nor am I a Christian, and I don't want to be a part of it,\" said the chancellor, who is also a member of Merkel's conservative Christian Democratic Party (CDU). \"But I think we have to act in a way that is acceptable to all of us,\" she said, adding that she would be willing to cooperate with the authorities if they had the opportunity to do so. In the past, she has called for the use of force against Islamic extremists. But she is not ready to give up the fight against IS. She said she was prepared to use force if it was necessary to prevent the spread of radical Islam in her country. Germany's Christian Democrats, however, have not been able to find a solution to this problem. They have been unable to come up with an acceptable solution for a long time. For example, they have refused to allow police to enter the town of M\u00f6nchengladbach, where many Muslims live and work. However, in recent years, police have stepped up their efforts to crack down on Islamic extremism. Last week, a police officer was shot and killed by a gunman who was carrying out a series of attacks on police officers, according to local media reports. Police have also been accused of using excessive force to arrest and detain people suspected of being radicalized by radical Islamic groups, such as al-Qaeda and the Taliban. This has led to a number of arrests, including the death of one of its own, as well as the wounding of several other people. Many of those arrested have faced charges of attempted murder and attempted rape, while others were acquitted in court. Some of these charges were later dropped by German prosecutors. Other charges include murder, attempted kidnapping and possession of weapons by members of a terrorist group. Prosecutors are also looking into the case of two men who were charged with murder in connection with a separate case in which a man was found to have used a knife to stab a policeman. A judge has also ordered the man to surrender himself to police, saying he had no knowledge of what was going on at the time of his arrest. It is unclear how many people are being held accountable for their actions, or whether they will be prosecuted, for what they are doing. Most of them are Muslims, though some have said that they do not believe the charges are politically motivated. That's not true, of course. There is no reason to believe that there is any justification for such violence against Muslims. Instead, it is simply a matter of law and order. And that's the way it should be. If the law is changed, then the courts will have the authority to decide whether or not to prosecute people who are involved in this kind of violence, rather than the people's right to freedom of expression and expression. So far, so good, indeed, that has not happened. At the same time, there's been a lot of criticism from some quarters of German society, especially from those who have criticized the government's handling of this issue. These include the right-wing, anti-Islamist parties, some of which have expressed concern about the treatment of Muslims in their own communities. One such criticism is that some people have accused the media of politicizing the issue of Islam. Others have called the incident \"an act of terrorism,\" the paper said in an interview with German daily Bild. Another criticism: \"This is a very dangerous situation,\" it added, referring to \"Islamophobia,\" a term used to describe the practice of \"radical Islam.\" The paper also pointed out that Muslims are more likely to commit crimes against minorities than other minorities, particularly those with ties to extremist organizations, like the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazi organizations. (Reuters, AP, AFP, dpa, Reuters) \"It is very difficult for me to say that Islamophobia is something that we should not have a problem with,\" wrote the newspaper's editor-in-chief, Heiko Maas, citing a report in The New York Times on Saturday, \"but it's a good thing that this is the first time we've seen this.

        "target": "Russia to create corporate aid fund, tapping pensions Moscow is planning to set up an emergency fund to help companies hit by sanctions imposed on Russian firms over the country's role in the Ukraine crisis. The money is to come from the Russian pensions system. Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov unveiled a plan Monday aimed at creating a \"multi-billion-dollar\" funding vehicle for companies hit by Western sanctions. Moscow-based news agency RIA quoted Siluanov as saying that the emergency fund would be set up next year with money originally earmarked for the State Pension Fund and leftover funds from this year's budget. According to RIA, Moscow was planning to devote \"at least 100 billion roubles\" (2 billion euros) to the fund, which will mainly be aimed at helping cash-starved Russian banks and key oil companies. \"These 100 billion roubles will be added to the reserve next year, which will allow us to help companies,\" RIA quoted Siluanov as saying. \"We are planning to create a reserve of significant size.\" Just last week, the European Union and the United States imposed a third round of sanctions on Moscow for Russia's involvement in the Ukraine conflict. The latest sanctions target the Russian banking sector as well as key energy firms and arms manufacturers. As one of several companies that have asked for government help, Russia's oil giant Rosneft said it would need 1.5 trillion roubles ($39.70 billion) in aid to keep exploring for oil. Siluanov also told RIA news agency that the decision to stop transferring money to the Pension Fund would hand the budget an extra 309 billion roubles. It will be the second year running that Moscow has stopped transfers of funds from the budget to the Pension Fund, which provides benefits for Russia's pensioners, some invalids and families who have lost their breadwinners. uhe/nz (Reuters, RIA)",
        "generated_story": "Russia to create multi-billion-dollar pension fund for companies hit by sanctions over Ukraine conflict Russia has announced plans to set up a multi billion-euro fund to cover the costs of sanctions imposed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the European Union. The fund will be created by Russia's State Pension Fund, the country's state-owned oil and gas company Rosneft (RIA), which has been hit with sanctions since the conflict erupted in eastern Ukraine in March 2014. Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that the fund would be established in response to the crisis in Ukraine. \"We are going to do everything in our power to protect the interests of the Russian people,\" Putin told a news conference in Moscow. He did not elaborate on the plan, but he said it was a step in the right direction. According to Russian state news agency RIA, it is the first such fund created in Russia since sanctions were imposed on Russia in April 2014, when the Moscow-based state oil company was accused of violating the terms of an arms deal with the United States. It is not clear how much the funds will cover, however, as the government has yet to provide details on how it intends to pay for the new fund, which is expected to be funded by Russian taxpayers' money, according to a statement from the ministry of foreign affairs. In the past, Russian companies have been subject to sanctions for failing to comply with their obligations under the arms embargo. Last year, Russia announced that it would set aside $1.5 billion for a fund that could be used to compensate Russian citizens who were forced to leave their homes in order to return to their home countries. This was the second time in less than a year that Russia had agreed to make such a huge investment in a single fund. Earlier this month, a Russian newspaper reported that Moscow had approved the creation of a $2.4 billion fund aimed at helping Russian expatriates who had been living in exile in Europe. However, this was not the case with Russia. Instead, Moscow has decided to use the money to fund companies that have suffered from sanctions, such as Russian oil giant Gazprom and Russian gas giant Petrobras. Russia is also set to launch a new state pension scheme for its citizens, called the \"State Pension fund\" (SPF). The plan was announced on Thursday, and it will include a number of companies, including Russian banks, oil companies and state energy companies. Spokesman Anton Siluanov said that in an interview with Reuters, he was optimistic about the future of pension funds for Russian investors, saying that they would have the ability to invest more than the sum of their own money. But he also stressed that this would not be enough to meet the needs of those who are in need of it, adding that there was no need for them to have a large fund in their current situation. 'We have to find a way out of this situation,' he told Reuters. A spokesman for Ria said, referring to an ongoing dispute between Russia and Ukraine over the issue of Crimea, said he could not comment on whether the two sides had reached an agreement on a possible settlement. On Wednesday, Rosprom announced a plan to establish a separate fund with a total of $4.6 billion ($2 billion) in funding, with an initial goal of raising up to $3 billion by 2020. Roscom said the company would invest $500 million in equities, bonds and other assets, in addition to investments in infrastructure, energy and infrastructure. Silanov also said Russia would provide a \"significant amount of capital\" to help fund its investments, while also providing financial support to companies affected by Ukraine's conflict. His comments were echoed by other Russian politicians, who have also criticized the move. Putin has repeatedly called on Putin to step down from his post as head of state, despite the fact that he is a former KGB officer who served as a KGB spy and intelligence officer. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said earlier this week that Putin's decision was based on \"a lack of transparency\" and that \"there is no reason for him to resign.\" The Kremlin has not yet responded to questions about whether Russia should be allowed to withdraw its troops from Syria, Ukraine and Syria. Moscow's foreign minister, Sergei Shoigu, told reporters on condition of anonymity that his country was prepared to take the next steps in resolving the Ukraine crisis. Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Putin was asked if Russia was ready to discuss the matter with Russian officials. Peslev said Moscow was \"not ready for this kind of situation.\" \"I think it's a good time to talk about it,\" he added, pointing out that sanctions against Russia were already in place in recent months. I think the Kremlin's stance on Ukraine is one of its most important foreign policy priorities. For the time being, there's no clear indication of what Russia will do in relation to Ukraine, his comments are likely to come under pressure from Putin and his spokesman, Alexander Lukashev, had not been able to respond to"

Speaking to reporters after a meeting with NATO military chiefs in Lithuania's capital Vilnius on Saturday, US General Philip Breedlove expressed \"sincere hope\" about a renewed peace plan, agreed to earlier in the day in the Belarusian capital Minsk, by separatists and representatives from Ukraine's and Russia's governments. The new pact, including an artillery buffer zone, was a move to strengthen a peace plan signed earlier this month, also in Minsk. However, Breedlove said violence levels in Ukraine in recent days were as high as prior to the earlier ceasefire. \"The ceasefire is still there in name, but what is happening on the ground is quite a different story,\" Breedlove said, adding that Russian forces were still operating in Ukraine, although he could not pinpoint how many. \"The fluidity of movement of Russian forces and Russian-backed forces back and forth across that border makes it almost impossible to understand the numbers,\" he said. A convoy from Russia consisting of about 170 trucks arrived in Ukraine on Saturday, with a reported cargo of humanitarian aid. Previous aid convoys sent from Russia were met with outrage in Kyiv, as it was suspected they may have been used to provide support to the pro-Moscow separatists in eastern Ukraine. Russia has repeatedly denied such accusations. The separatists have said they want to break from Kyiv and have already declared \"people's republics'\" in Donetsk and Luhansk.

NATO Secretary-General Sergei Shoigu said in an interview with The Associated Press on Monday that Russia was ready to extend its support to Ukraine if the situation was to improve. A spokesman for NATO said the alliance had reached a point where it could be able to reach a deal with Ukraine without any preconditions. According to Russian news agency RIA Novosti, Russia is prepared to give up its veto on any ceasefire, even if that means it will be extended to other countries, such as Belarus and Poland, if Russia does not agree to allow it to be implemented.

They also stressed that \"it is a matter of mutual respect\" for all parties involved, particularly the Ukrainians, that any agreement is necessary to ensure a fair and orderly transition of power.

It's as revolutionary as the Cuban revolution, and as peaceful as the biblical Sermon on the Mount, says DW's Astrid Prange. US President Barack Obama has lost his old communist \"enemy,\" and Cuban President Raul Castro has lost his hatred of capitalism. In the first phone call from president to president since 1961 the two heads of state came to a surprisingly swift agreement. They want to renew diplomatic relations, which have been on ice for more than 50 years, and exchange ambassadors. It's only a matter of time before the US lifts its trade embargo against Cuba. All the word \"embargo\" is really good for - at this stage - is as an ideological soapbox for political hardliners, especially Republicans in Congress who believe lifting sanctions would constitute defeat for the US. Yet the lifting of the embargo has already begun. In addition to medication, it has been possible since 2000 to export agricultural produce such as maize, cereal crops, and poultry to Cuba. Flirting with the rogue state Furthermore, 100,000 US citizens have travelled to Cuba since 2011 for cultural and scientific exchanges. Travel restrictions on Cubans living in exile in the US who wanted to visit their relatives on the island were also lifted. According to press reports, the two countries' military forces are even said to be cooperating, as are their coastguards, and military on the border of the US marine base in Guantanamo. Now Obama wants to officially open a \"new chapter\" in relations with the communist Caribbean island and remove Cuba from the US list of so-called \"rogue states\" that support terrorism. The travel ban on American tourists visiting the island will also largely be lifted. That's as far as things will go for the time being, as Obama would require a majority in Congress in Washington to lift the embargo entirely. But even if these are only small steps, the fall of the American-Cuban wall has begun. The easing of the sanctions and the resumption of diplomatic relations are setting the scene for an end to the embargo. Embargo as scapegoat The tearing down of this \"wall in the mind\" is long overdue. The blockade is obsolete, and has proved to be entirely ineffective. More than this, its advocates have achieved the opposite of what they actually wanted. The blockade has provided the leaders in Havana with an easy excuse for their economic failure. Raul Castro realized long ago that Cuba's economic problems can no longer be justified simply by citing the US embargo. It looks as though he was counting on the blockade being lifted: There is no other explanation for the completion of the Mariel container port in January this year. Cuba's biggest infrastructure project was, incidentally, financed by Brazil. The Brazilians also sent a declaration of love to Cuba. Raul Castro opened the door to them. He loves anyone who helps him - his friends even more than his enemies.",

Last year, he said he was \"very disappointed\" with his Cuban government, saying it had failed to act on its promises of transparency and accountability. This week, however, President Obama announced that he would close the Guantanamo Bay detention facility in Cuba for a year and a half. According to a report by DW, this will be the last time he visits the island until the end of March, when he is due to return to Washington, D.C. Obama's visit to Havana was marked by a flurry of criticism, with many accusing him of being too lenient in his treatment of prisoners. Some of those who have been held in Guantanamo, for example, have said that they are not allowed to visit Cuba at all. Others have called for an end to its use of torture, torture and other forms of violence, such as rape and torture. Many have also accused the Obama administration of not doing enough to stop the attacks, while others have accused it of using excessive force. However, there is no evidence that this was the case in any way. Cuba is not the only country that has suffered from this kind of repression. There are also reports that the government is planning to use torture against its own people, as well as other prisoners, to try to gain access to information on the whereabouts of their loved ones. And there are rumors that there may be a number of people who are being held at Guantanamo in order to get information about what is going on in their own country. That could be true of other countries. For instance, some have suggested that Cuba may have used torture as an instrument of war against the West in its attempts to overthrow the Castro regime. Other reports have claimed that Cuban officials are using torture to justify their actions. One of these claims was made in an interview with DW that was published on Tuesday, in which a senior Cuban official said there were \"no credible allegations of any wrongdoing\" against President Fidel Castro. Another claim was that Castro had ordered the transfer of detainees from Guantanamo to Guantanamo. Cuban authorities have denied this and said they had no reason to believe that such a transfer would happen. They also denied any involvement in this case, though, according to one official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, that any such action would not be allowed. Castro himself has denied the allegations. US officials have repeatedly denied that his government has any knowledge of what has happened to his family. On the other hand, Cuba has repeatedly said it has no intention of doing anything to change the situation. At the same time, Castro's regime has also been accused of trying to influence the outcome of an international court case that could lead to an extradition treaty with Russia. A spokesman for US President Xi Jinping told DW last week that \"the Cuban regime is doing the right thing\" - a claim that is unlikely to be accepted by US courts - and that Obama was not aware of, at the very least, any possible extradition request from Moscow. Meanwhile, many Cuban dissidents have expressed concern about the possibility of returning to their home country, where they have lived for decades. These accusations have come to light in recent months, despite the fact that many of them are based on allegations that Havana's people were being tortured and tortured by Cuban intelligence officials. (AP, AFP, dpa, Reuters)The US has accused Cuba of violating the terms of its extradition agreement with Moscow's request to extradite the detainees to Moscow, accusing Moscow of harboring them to Russia, Iran, Turkey, Syria, Iraq and Iran. Moscow has rejected the idea of extraditions. Russia has refused to cooperate with US prosecutors in Russia's investigation into the matter."

        "target": "Nigeria sentences 54 soldiers to death for mutiny A Nigerian court martial has sentenced 54 soldiers to death for mutiny and cowardice as they refused to fight against Boko Haram Islamists. The case has highlighted the army's problems with equipment and morale. The men sentenced to death on Wednesday were part of the special forces division ordered in August to retake three towns in Borno state, which had been taken over by the Islamist Boko Haram insurgents. Their lawyer, Femi Falana, said the 54 men were sentenced to death by firing squad and five had been acquitted. They were accused of conspiring to commit mutiny against the authorities of the 7th Division of the Nigerian army, which is on the frontline. The trial began on October 15 and was conducted behind closed doors. It is subject to approval by top military officials, but there has so far been no indication that senior officers oppose the court martial. They were not available for comment afterwards. There was a similar case in Nigeria in September, when 12 soldiers were sentenced to death for mutiny after firing on their commanding officer in the northeast city of Maiduguri. The 7th Division, based in Maiduguri, leads the offensive but there are numerous reports of troops refusing to deploy. Soldiers have regularly complained that they lack weapons, food, and other basic supplies to fight the Islamists, who are reported to have tanks, rocket-propelled-grenade launchers, and other heavy weaponry. Boko Haram has taken a number of towns and declared an Islamic caliphate in the region near the border with Cameroon. The Nigerian military has in recent weeks claimed to have made progress in recapturing lost territory. Thousands of people have been killed since the Islamist uprising began five years ago. An estimated 1.3 million have been displaced, with tens of thousands seeking refuge in neighboring Cameroon, Chad, and Niger. rg/bk (AFP, AP, dpa)",
        "generated_story": "Court martial against Boko Haram Islamists in Borno A court martial has been declared in the northeastern Nigerian state of Bornoa. The military has launched a massive operation to crush the Islamist sect, which has claimed responsibility for the kidnapping and killing of thousands of people. Police said the operation was being carried out by the 7th Division, a military unit of the Nigerian army, in a bid to quell the group's insurgency. It is the first major military operation of its kind in Nigeria since the military took over the country's northeast in 2014. Borna's military said it had launched an operation against the sect in Maiduguri. \"We are going to use all available means to defeat the terrorists,\" said Femi Falana, who led the army's response to the abduction and murder of hundreds of civilians. He added that \"we will use every means we have available to us,\" adding that he would like to see the government take action to end the violence. But he also said that it would be difficult to do so without the help of other armed groups, such as the Islamic State (IS), which is fighting for a caliphate in northern Nigeria. According to a statement from the police, the attack was launched by a group of armed men who claimed to be the \"Islamic State of Nigeria\" (Isis) and \"terrorists.\" The group is believed to have killed at least 1,000 people, according to local media reports, including some who were killed in clashes between the two groups. At the same time, police said they were also searching for suspected militants who had been hiding in their hideouts. They also searched the homes of several people suspected of being involved in attacks on police and soldiers, and seized weapons and ammunition. Some of these weapons were reportedly used to carry out attacks, while others were used as weapons to attack police officers and other security personnel. There are also reports that some soldiers have been killed, as well as a number of soldiers who have also been injured. A military spokesman said there were no reports of any deaths, but that the situation was \"very tense\" and that there was no indication of an imminent attack. However, it was not immediately clear whether or not the attacks were linked to an attack on a police station or an army base, or whether the suspects had fled to other locations. In the meantime, military forces are continuing to search for other suspects in connection with the ongoing operation. On Wednesday, they began searching the houses of suspected terrorists, some of whom are still being held in custody. This is a first step in an ongoing crackdown on the extremists, with police saying they are trying to prevent the release of suspects from their homes. Last week, security forces arrested three suspected members of a terrorist group that had seized the town's police headquarters and several other military positions. One of them was a soldier who was shot and killed by police during a raid last week. Another soldier was also wounded in his leg during the raid. More than a dozen other soldiers were injured in that raid and are currently being treated in hospital. Most of those arrested are suspected to face charges of kidnapping, torture and attempted murder. Authorities have yet to provide details of what they have done in relation to their alleged involvement, although they say they believe they may have a warrant for their arrest. If they do, there will be an appeal for an arrest warrant. Meanwhile, more than 100 people have already been arrested for alleged crimes committed against civilians and children. Many are being charged with crimes against humanity and others are accused of involvement in human rights violations. Several people were arrested in this case and some have even been sentenced to life in prison in absentia. These charges are expected to go to trial in court on Thursday. Boko Haram has denied the charges, saying it is an act of terrorism and has not been ordered to give up its weapons. Law enforcement officials say the investigation is still ongoing, however, that they will not be able to make arrests until the case is brought to court. As a result of this, authorities are seeking to arrest more suspects and charge them with terrorism related crimes. An investigation into the incident has already begun. Security forces have so far failed to find any suspects. So far, no one has yet been charged in any case. Investigators are working to establish the exact motive behind the killings. Officials have not ruled out the possibility of further arrests, though they suspect the perpetrators may still be in hiding. For now, investigators are looking for suspects who may be behind a series of attacks that have taken place in different parts of northeastern Nigeria in recent months. (Reuters, AFP, AP, dpa, Reuters)The military is also investigating the alleged kidnapping of children and the attempted abduction of minors. I am not aware of who is responsible for this incident and I have no idea what the motive is. We are not sure how many people are involved. What we can expect is that a judge will decide the fate of innocent children, children or anyone else who might be released from prison. That could lead to charges against innocent people who could be"

        "target": "All Eyes on Kimi and Ferdy on Schumi's Turf All eyes will be on a Finn and a Spaniard at the German Grand Prix at Hockenheim on Sunday as the title battle between Kimi Raikkonen and Fernando Alonso looks to put local hero Michael Schumacher in the shade. It is a reflection of his current inauspicious Formula One campaign that World Champion Michael Schumacher is only featuring in reports on this weekend's German Grand Prix at Hockenheim dues to his nationality. The home grown champion equaled his own record of 11 wins in a season at last year's race but this year he will be hoping to just get on the podium at the end. Schumi lies in third place some 34 points off the top spot and has a lot to do if he is to record his 85th career win. Ferrari's poor season to date is unlikely to get better with hopes dwindling that the 36-year-old will add to his sole victory of the season although the seven-time world champion characteristically refuses to rule it out. Schumi and Ferrari still in the fight \"Contrary to many other people's opinions, we have in no means written ourselves off, even though we have to admit that the situation has worsened recently, rather than improved,\" said the German, referring to the problems with this season's car. \"But that doesn't mean that it can't be improved again, and that's exactly what we're working on.\" The limelight is falling on two young pretenders to Schumacher's throne as Sunday's race approaches. The battle between McLaren's flying Finn Kimi Raikkonen and championship leader Renault's speedy Spaniard Fernando Alonso is diverting eyes from the world record holding German on his own turf. Kimi aims to keep heat on leader Alonso Raikkonen must finish the German Grand Prix for the first time in five attempts to close the gap on Alonso if he is to keep his own championship hopes alive. The Finn retired from last year's race because of a rear wing failure and this season has been plagued by technical problems which most recently cost him 10 places on the starting grid in each of the last two rounds. Despite those penalties for engine failure, the 25-year-old managed to finish second and third but he will have to increase his total of three race wins if he is to make a significant impression on the 26-point chasm that separates him from Alonso. \"The battle for the championship is still on and I am determined to get a good result and work on closing the gap,\" said the Finn. \"The (car) has good speed and we need to make the most of it this weekend.\" Montoya doing McLaren team mate no favors Raikkonen's car is obviously a fast one this season but he's not the only driver in a McLaren hot seat. Colombia's Juan Pablo Montoya is not to going to make way for his team mate while his own hopes of the title, however small, remain alive. \"I am really looking forward to racing again this weekend in Germany,\" said Montoya, who won at Hockenheim for Williams two years ago and got his first victory for McLaren in Britain two weeks ago. \"I enjoy racing at Hockenheim, I have performed well here and won in the past and I am aiming for a strong result like at Silverstone.\" Consistent Ferdy the man to beat at Hockenheim Championship leader Alonso, meanwhile, has been impressively consistent for Renault so far this season, winning five times and failing to score points only at the Canadian Grand Prix, where he crashed, and in Indianapolis. The Spaniard is setting the pace and the standard this season so, problems aside, Alonso will again be the man to beat at Hockenheim.",
        "generated_story": "Fernando Alonso and Kimi Raikkonen battle for German Grand Prix title Fernando Alonso is the reigning Formula One world champion. The Spaniard and his team-mate are battling for the German title at Hockenheim on Sunday in the second round of the Formula 1 season-ending German GP, which will be held at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya in Spain. Alonso, who has won the last three races of his career, will take on Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel in Sunday's final round. \"I'm very happy with the result,\" Alonso said after the race, adding that he was \"very happy\" with his car's handling and the way it was handling the track. He also said he hoped to be able to improve on last year's race in Barcelona, where he won his first title. But he also added that the two-time champion had a lot to prove: \"It's not just about the car, it's about how well it works.\" The two drivers have been rivals since the end of last season, with both having won their first two races in Germany and Spain, respectively. They are also the only drivers to have won a race at a circuit where they have never won one before. Both drivers also have a chance to win the title in their home country of Finland, but they will have to work hard to get there. Ferrari, Mercedes, Ferrari and McLaren are the other two teams to take the top two spots. Mercedes and Ferrari have already won three of their last four races, while Ferrari are third and fourth respectively, and Mercedes is fifth. McLaren's Sergio Perez is third, after winning the previous two. Hamilton, meanwhile, was third in his last race with Ferrari in 2014, when he took the win in Mexico City, Mexico, in an event that was billed as the first of its kind in Europe. It was the third time in four years that Ferrari has held the overall title, having held it since 2011. Raikonen, however, has been unable to break through the barriers and has struggled to find a way out of a tight race. Last year, the Japanese driver had to settle for fourth place, ahead of Mercedes' Juan Pablo Montoya. On Sunday, though, he will face a stiff challenge from Ferrari driver Sergio Marchionne in a battle between the world's two most powerful drivers. After a tough start to the weekend, Alonso was forced to give up the lead in qualifying after struggling to maintain his grip on the front row. In the closing stages of qualifying, his Ferrari teammate, Sergio P\u00e9rez, took pole position, leading to a second-place finish and a victory for Ferrari. His Ferrari team, McLaren, is also in contention for a fourth consecutive year in Formula 3, although they are still only three points clear of Ferrari at this point. Sergio S\u00e9bastien/AFP, dpa, AP, Reuters and Reuters have all said they expect Alonso to finish the season in third place. That would be a big step up from the fourth-placed finish in 2013, a year after he finished fourth at Monaco. However, that would not be enough to make up for his lack of podium finishes in 2015 and 2016. F1 is still a long way off from being the most successful series in terms of pace and power, despite the fact that it is now a world championship contender. And that is not to say that Alonso has not had the best of luck in recent years, as he has never been a great driver. Despite his best efforts to stay on track, Hamilton has had an excellent year so far in 2017, finishing fourth in both the points standings and third overall in points. This year he is expected to lead the championship by at least two points in Russia, Bahrain and Bahrain. If he does not make the podium, then he'll be the next driver to do so, according to Alonso's team. Meanwhile, Williams has a strong chance of retaining the crown in Bahrain, Spain and Mexico. Fernando has already been in pole positions for three consecutive years and is looking to add to his tally of victories this year. Although he hasn't won since 2012, this time around he could have done it with a win at Bahrain in 2012. 'I don't think I can do it without Fernando,' Alonso told reporters after his victory in Monaco, saying he would like to focus on finishing second to Sergio Ramos in Hungary. For now, there is no chance he can get a podium finish this season. At the same time, I think he's going to try to keep up his form in Brazil. I'd be happy to see him finish second in this race if he doesn't win this weekend's championship, especially after finishing third at Hungary and qualifying in Austria. With his second place in Azerbaijan, Fernando will also be hoping to avoid a third consecutive season of points and fifth place on Saturday's Austrian GP. Will he finish fourth? No, of course, because the Brazilian will need to clear the grid for next month's Hungarian GP on Friday. According to qualify for Sunday"

        "target": "German Publishers Warm to Google Library Google is heading for a legal battle with American publishers over its plan to digitize books from five major libraries. But German publishers seem warm to the idea. Five major US publishers filed suit in San Francisco on Wednesday to block Google from scanning books without the permission of copyright holders. The project, already underway but stopped by Google in August, is the Silicon Valley company's bid to make the world's books searchable online. Five major libraries are already participating in the project and Google sent executive Jennifer Grant to the Frankfurt Book Fair on Wednesday to present the idea to European and German book publishers. This week Google introduced print.google.de, the German version of the search engine Google posted online this time last year. Google lets users type in a search term then scans its digitized library for the word or expression and produces a list of books where the term is mentioned. Users can then click on the results and a few pages of the text appear allowing users to read up online. The idea is to supplement Internet users with another source of material. In contrast to their American colleagues, German publishing houses have reacted well to the database. Some German publishers on board Google said that is discussing terms with all major German publishers. Langenscheidt, which publishes a large selection of dictionaries, said they had got on board. \"We are starting with 160 books,\" Hubert Haarmann, head of the electronic publishing division and the publisher, told the Financial Times Deutschland. \"We see it as an additional distribution possibility.\" An increased and more direct reach to the consumer is just one way Google is promoting its new project to skeptical publishers. The company also says that publishers will be able to monitor interest in titles through the search engine, and use the information in deciding whether to reprint certain books. Google has also promised publishers a cut of the advertising that will appear on the site. Not all German publishers are on board. In fact, the German association representing publishers has announced it will begin its own project where publishers can scan their own books, rather than let someone else do it. The project is not a competitor to Google, but will allow publishers to create their own database, rather than turn it over to the search engine. If Google can, anyone can But American publishers don't want to even take that step. They fear a slippery slope if Google is allowed to digitize copyrighted material. \"If Google can make \u2026 copies, then anyone can,\" Patricia Schroeder, president of the Association of American Publishers, said in a phone interview with Reuters. \"Anybody could go into a library and start making digital copies of anything.\" At issue is the right of authors and their publishers to their own work versus the \"fair use\" of their work by the public. Google argues that their search engine will only offer users a \"card catalog\" function, with a few pages of text. No one will be able to read the entire book online.",

In addition to the Google library, the service also has a German translation service called Google Book Fair, which aims to help readers find books in German and other languages in the US, Europe and the Middle East. According to its website, Google is the largest online bookstore in Germany, with more than 1.5 million books sold. But the company has been unable to find a single book that is suitable for the German market, according to a report by the Association of American Publishers (AAP) in Frankfurt, Germany. \"It's not easy,\" said Patricia Schroeder, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who has worked at Google since the 1980s. She said that Google was the first company to offer a service that was free of charge to German readers, but that it was only available to those who were willing to pay a bit more for a copy of a book. That's because the book itself is not free, she said, adding that \"it's free.\" The company also offers a free version of the app, available for download on Google Play and on Amazon.com, as well as on its Kindle app. And it is free to download from the App Store, where you can search for titles by genre, age, gender, ethnicity, race, religion, nationality and more. You can also download the free app for free on Android, Apple and Kindle. If you want to use it, you'll have to go to Google's app store. There's a lot of free content on the site, too.

Among other things, it lists the top 10 best-sellers of all time, along with the most popular titles in all of Germany and France. On the list: \"The best books for children and young adults,\" the Economist said in an e-mail, followed by a link to \"the best German titles for adults and children,\" and \"books for young people in general.\" \"You can find the best children's books at any age,\" it added, noting that many of these titles are available through Google Books, Amazon, Barnes and Noble and Barnes & Noble. They're all available on Kindle, Kindle or Apple. Amazon is also offering free Kindle books to children ages 12 to 18, while Apple is offering a limited edition of 500,000 copies for kids ages 6 to 12. Book sales are expected to be up for grabs this year, said Amazon's Jennifer Grant, vice president of digital sales and marketing for Google.org, an online bookseller in Silicon Valley. More than a million people have signed up so far to read the books, Grant said. Some of those books are currently on sale at book fairs across the United States and Europe. Many of them are from Germany or the UK. A number of German authors are also working on a series of new books. These are the ones that will be published this fall. I'm not sure what to expect from them, though, because I don't think they'll be available until the end of October, when Google will release the new edition. However, I'd like to see more German books available at a later date, so I can't say for sure. At the time of this writing, this is a very exciting time for me, since I've never heard of any German author who is interested in reading German or French. So I'll just say that I have no idea what the future holds for my children. All I know is that they're going to have a hard time finding a good book for them. We'll see what happens when they get their hands on one of their books and then we'll find out what they've got to say to them about the upcoming German editions of \"American Authors,\" which are coming out in September.

        "target": "The Sun Sets Slowly Over Brandenburg's Tropical Dream Having suffered many disappointments concerning publically funded projects, the state of Brandenburg hoped a tropical leisure center would offer a ray of hope. Instead the ailing concern is just bringing more gloom. The economically depressed eastern German state of Brandenburg has seen its fair share of bitter experiences when it comes to huge public investment projects since German unification in 1990. Against this background, state authorities were pleased when Malaysian businessman Colin Au built a huge tropical-feeling leisure center in Brandenburg without any subsidies. The center, which opened about a year ago, was to become a symbol of economic success in a region where unemployment still hovers around the 20 percent mark. But the leisure time park, which has already swallowed a little under 100 million euros ($120 million) in private investment, is now going to have to depend on public funding to avoid another economic fiasco in Brandenburg. State authorities in Brandenburg haven't been too successful in their public investment policy in the past 10 years, to put it mildly. A grand plan to build one of the world's most modern chip-producing factories there burst like a bubble in 2003. The much-talked about Brandenburg-Berlin International airport still seems light years away from being built. Line of failures looked to be ended by Au's vision Another beacon of economic hope disappeared in 2002 when a company planning to build gas-filled transport airships went bust despite considerable subsidies. But Au's vision for the abandoned dome which the airship company needed as a hangar offered Brandenburg another chance. In the middle of nowhere, he created what he named his \"Tropical Islands\" wonderland, sporting everything from sandy beaches, lakes and a Laguna to a Caribbean-style village. The economics ministry in Brandenburg was over the moon to see Au originally agreeing to build the facility without any state subsidies. And Au himself had no doubt at the time that he could well do without them. Overestimated visitor numbers tell sorry story But the center's first year in operation tells a different story. Colin Au, who has meanwhile left Brandenburg and transferred matters to a German management company, had expected some 1.5 million visitors to come to Tropical Islands within the first year, but only some 950,000 will have turned up by the end of 2005. It seems highly unlikely that visitor numbers will increase considerably in future, placing a question mark on the viability of the whole centre. But Brandenburg's economics ministry is certain that the park will be in the black as of 2008. To make the place more attractive, it has agreed to shell out 15 million euros in subsidies for yet another reconstruction and marketing effort. After all, the leisure time center has a workforce of about 500 and is thus the biggest employer in an otherwise depressed region marked by a high jobless rate. Tropical center down but not out...not yet \"We hope the money will help make the Tropical Islands resort better known throughout Europe according to the new marketing concept hammered out the management,\" ministry spokesman Steffen Kammrath said. \"This leisure time center is unique and has to be marketed as such. What you have there is a tropical and water world 12 months a year with a lot of attractive offers to spend a whale of a time there.\" Some commentators believe that state subsidies may prolong the center's life span, but will not be able to avoid its demise in the long run. But the idea of also making it more attractive for tourists from all over Europe seems unrealistic to them if the resort's management can't even get enough visitors from home to ensure a profitable operation.",
        "generated_story": "The Sun Sets Slowly Over Brandenburg's Tropical Islands Resort The sun sets slowly over the tropical islands resort in the southern German state of Berlin on Sunday. The setting sun is setting slowly, but gradually, as the day progresses, the sun begins to set. It's the first day of the summer season, and the temperature is expected to rise to around 70 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) by the end of August. This is the second day in a row that the Sun has set in. Last year, it was forecast to reach the high 80s, with temperatures reaching the low 90s. On Sunday, however, temperatures rose to the mid-80s and temperatures were forecast for the middle of next week. \"The sun set slowly,\" said Steffen Kammrath, director of tourism at the resort, which is located on the German-Austrian border with Malaysia. He added that he expected temperatures to drop to as low as 50 degrees C by Monday, when temperatures would rise again. In the meantime, he said, \"We're going to have to make sure that we have enough sun to keep the heat from reaching our eyes,\" adding that it would be a good idea to get out of bed early and go for a walk around the island. There's also the possibility of a flight to Berlin, where the weather will be warmer and more pleasant. But that's not the only reason to go to a tropical island resort. For the past few years, there has been a lot of talk about the importance of climate change, especially in Germany. However, in recent years it has become increasingly difficult to find a place for people to spend their money. That's one reason why it's so important to me that I don't spend my money on travel. I spend all my time in Europe and spend most of my free time at my home country. When I come back to Germany, I'll be able to take a look around and see what I can do for my family and friends. And I'm sure I won't be the last one to do so, because I know that there are so many people who want to travel to Europe. So I think I will try and do my best to stay in touch with my friends and family. We'll see how things turn out. You know, like when I was a kid and my parents would come to my house and tell me how much they loved me. Then I'd go home and have a cup of tea and a glass of wine and then I would go back and relax. After all, this is where I grew up. My parents were born and raised in Berlin. They were very poor, so they had to raise me to be educated and educated. Now they're in their late teens and early 20s so I've got to learn how to live with myself and what to expect in life. As I write this, my eyes are glued to their phones and I have no idea what's going on in my head. At the same time, they are trying to figure out what the next step is for me, since I am so young. What do I do? I try to think about my future. How can I make the best decisions for myself? What am I doing now? How will I live my life? Do I get to know my children? Will I ever have the opportunity to see my grandchildren again? Is it possible for them to grow up? Who knows? And what will they do with me? The answer is up to them? Well, let's just say that they can't live without me! \"I'm not a child anymore,\" says Colin Au, who is a teacher at Branden-Berlin International Airport.

Clubs officials say talks are ongoing in the hope Max Meyer will extend his contract. Schalke might struggle to retain 22-year-old midfielder Max Meyer when his contract runs out at the end of the season, at least according to recent media interviews from the club's sporting director, Christian Heidel. Speaking to German news agency dpa, Heidel confirmed that Meyer turned down an offer of a contract extension earlier in February. \"Max Meyer's agent received an extension offer on January 12 with a deadline of February 15, and informed us on February 15 via email that Max would not be accepting the offer because of the deadline imposed,\" Heidel told dpa. \"We have acknowledged this. For now, we no longer feel beholden to the terms of that offer, but that doesn't mean an extension is impossible either.\" Meyer was reportedly offered an annual salary in the region of \u20ac5.5 million ($6.7 million); it was the second contract he refused, following a less lucrative offer at the end of last season. Read more: Leon Goretzka to join Bayern Munich in the summer 'We're still ready to talk' Under new coach Domenico Tedesco, Meyer has reclaimed a regular spot in the Schalke XI, moving to a new and more defensive role in midfield. Schalke offered improved terms in light of this development on the pitch. Heidel said this week that the club was still trying to convince the German to stay. \"At the moment we're still ready to talk,\" Heidel told this week's edition of football magazine Kicker, albeit stressing that time was of the essence. \"But we must and we will plan for the new season.\" In a separate newspaper interview Heidel was even more explicit, saying the club was not in a position to wait until summer for Meyer to make up his mind. Speaking to Sport Bild magazine, meanwhile, Heidel sought to focus on Meyer's more important role at Schalke, his regular game time, arguing it might be in the youngster's best interests to stay at a club that needs him every week. \"[Coach] Domenico Tedesco has formed the team around him in such a way that there is now an ideal spot for Max. That was not always the case,\" Heidel said. \"He needs to ask himself, putting the financial aspect to one side: 'Will I get such a position at a different club?' Because one thing's clear: Max wants to play, and he needs to play.\" Schalke are already preparing for the departure of one of German football's brightest young stars, midfield all-rounder Leon Goretzka will join Bayern Munich on a free transfer at the season's end.

        "generated_story": "Bayern Munich coach Christian Heidel: \"We're still ready to talk\" about the future of midfielder Max Meyer, who has been linked with a move to Schalke for the past two seasons. \"It's still a matter of time before we can talk about Max's future,\" he told German newspaper dpa, adding that he was \"still ready\" to discuss his future with the club's management team. But he added that \"we still have a long way to go\" before he could make a decision on whether or not he would stay at Bayern Munich. The German coach also said he had no plans to make any changes to the squad, which is still in the early stages of the process of finalizing a new deal with Bayern's coach, Domenico Tedesco. Meyer's departure from the Munich squad is expected to be announced on Monday, with German media reporting that the player would be sold to a German club for around a million euros ($1.3 million) in a deal worth around $2.5 million, according to Sport Bild. It is also expected that Meyer will return to his old club, Bayern, after a two-year absence due to injury, and he will be able to play again in his new role at the Bavarian club next season, he said. His comments come after the Bundesliga's top scorer, Leon Goretzka, was sent off for a second time this season after suffering a thigh injury in training on Saturday. He was replaced by defender Michael Khedira, but he has since recovered from that injury and is now fit to start training with his current team-mates again. German football magazine Kicker reported on Sunday that Bayern were still open to discussing the possibility of signing the German midfielder for next year's Champions League, despite the fact that they have not yet signed a contract extension. Kedira said she would like to see him return, although she is not sure if he is ready for that. In the meantime, the team is looking to strengthen their squad for their next match against the Basel-based side, where they face a tough task in their quest to reach the quarter-finals. For the first time since the end of last season's World Cup, they will have to wait until the last minute to decide whether they want to sign a player who can contribute to their side's chances of reaching the semi-final stage. After all, it is only the second year of his contract that will give them a chance to win the title in Germany. They have already won three consecutive Bundesliga titles, including the 2013 and 2014, as well as the 2014 World Cups, in which they were runners-up to Bayern and the 2010-11 title winners. Last year they won their first ever title, beating the Netherlands and beating Germany 3-0 at home. Since then, their hopes have been dashed by a lack of interest from other teams in Europe. At the same time, there are doubts about their ability to keep their top-four position. There is a lot of speculation about how long they can stay in Munich, however, because they are so far away from their best chance of making the next step. That is, of course, something that has not been discussed in recent years. On Sunday, a number of German newspapers published an interview with sports journalist Dieter Schleicher, saying that it was too early to say whether Meyer would return. According to him, \"I don't think he's going to come back. I think we'll wait and see what happens. We'll see how things go from here.\" The news of Meyer returning to Bavaria is the subject of much speculation and speculation, though it's not clear whether he'll be back for another season. Bayern have made no official announcement until next week, when the transfer window officially opens in earnest. However, his comments on the matter are likely to get even more interesting, given that his team's recent form has shown no signs of slowing down. If they do, then it will not be a surprise if they decide to move on to another Bundesliga title contender. And that could be the case for some time. As long as they continue to do so, that's a positive step forward, at least for now. A move for Meyer is unlikely to happen before the summer of 2019, even if it means the departure of a key player like K\u00f6ln's star midfielder, Max will still be on his way out of Germany's national squad. Nevertheless, Meyer has already made his first appearance for Bayern since he left for Germany in January. When he returned to Germany last year, German sports daily Bild quoted him as saying he wanted to take a step back from his role as a coach. Speaking to Bild, Schlocke's sporting director, K\u00c3\u0080\u0099s team manager, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, told the newspaper that there is no reason for him to step down as coach of Bayern to leave his side.

Catholic priest Carlo Alberto Capella was indicted on Saturday after a Vatican investigation found he had allegedly possessed and exchanged \"a large quantity\" of child pornography during his diplomatic posting. His trial will start on June 22 in front of a Vatican magistrate. If convicted, he could be sentenced to between one and five years in prison and fined between \u20ac2,500 and \u20ac50,000 ($2,100 to $42,000). He is being held in the city's police barracks.

The church rejected the request and withdrew him in September to face investigation at home. Shortly afterwards, Canadian authorities issued an arrest warrant for allegedly possessing and distributing child pornography while visiting a church in Canada. The Capella case has hampered the Catholic Church's attempts to move on from its myriad of pedophile priest scandals. There has been particular focus in recent months on the Chilean branch of the Catholic Church ignoring and covering up of child abuse by pedophile priest Fernando Karadima during the 1980s and 1990s. Pope Francis wrote a letter to Chileans last week expressing \"shame\" for the affair despite previously defending one of the main alleged offenders behind the cover-up. The Vatican's third-highest ranking official, Cardinal George Pell, is facing trial in Australia on abuse-related charges. aw/kms (AFP, Reuters, dpa)",
        "generated_story": "Catholic priest faces Vatican probe for distributing child pornography Pope Francis has ordered Chilean priest Carlo Alberto Capella to face a Vatican investigation after he was found to have distributed child porn to minors. The Chilean Catholic priest, who has been accused of sexually abusing minors, is to appear before the Vatican's grand jury on Monday. He will face charges of child sex abuse and child sexual abuse, according to Vatican spokesman George Pell. \"The Vatican is conducting an investigation into the allegations,\" Pell said at a news conference in Washington, D.C. on Sunday. Pell is also expected to testify at the inquiry, which is being led by Cardinal Fernando Karadima, the pope's archbishop of Buenos Aires. In a statement, Pell also said that the investigation would focus on the alleged abuse of minors by the Catholic Church and the Church of the Holy Roman Empire (CBU). The Vatican has also ordered the prosecution of two Chilean priests who had been convicted of sexual offenses in the 1980s and 1990s, as well as two others who were convicted in a separate case in which they were found guilty of having sex with minors under the age of 16. Capell was convicted on a charge of indecency with a minor and sentenced to 15 years in prison. Prosecutors have said they will seek to extradite him to the United States, where he faces up to 10 years behind bars for the charges. Chileans have long complained about the church's treatment of their children, and have been calling for an end to their abuse. They have also complained that it has become increasingly difficult for them to get justice for their crimes. Last year, Pope Benedict XVI ordered a papal visit to Chile's capital, Santiago, in order to find out more about what was happening there and how it could be used to prosecute the accused. Vatican investigators are also looking into whether the Chilean church was involved in any wrongdoing and whether it was an attempt to cover up the crimes of its own priests, bishops and laypeople. It is not clear if the accusations are true or not, but it is the first time that a Chilean cardinal has faced criminal charges in relation to a child abuse case. According to Chilean media, prosecutors are seeking the extradition of three Chilean bishops, including the former Archbishop of Santiago and former Cardinal Jose Luis Borges, over allegations that he had sexually abused minors in his diocese. On Sunday, Francis said he would not rule out the possibility of an extradition request from the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, or the European Union. Francis also called on Chile to cooperate with the probe, saying it would be an \"important step forward\" in its efforts to prevent the spread of pedophilia and other forms of violence. But he also warned that \"it will not be easy\" for Chilean Catholics to comply with such a request, adding that if they don't, they would have to go to court and face the consequences of what they have done in their own country. For the past few years, Chile has suffered from a number of scandals, such as the scandal surrounding the death of Archbishop Francisco Franco, a former cardinal who was murdered by a priest in 2006. This year's scandal, however, came to light in Chile, when a nun accused the cardinal of being a pedophile. Franco said in an interview with The New York Times that Franco had confessed to having been a paedophile and that his confession was part of a cover-up of Franco's crimes against children. However, he did not deny the accusation, telling the newspaper that there was no evidence to support his claim, \"I am not going to make any further comment on this case at this time,\" he said. Church officials have denied the allegation and said the case is \"a matter of grave concern\" and \"the Vatican will continue to investigate the matter.\" The pope has called for a thorough investigation of allegations of abuse against the priest and accused him of failing to do his part to protect the children of his church. His letter to Francis is due to be published next week. If he does not do so, it will be in response to an appeal by Chilean authorities. A Vatican spokeswoman said Francis had not yet received a response from Vatican officials. Catholic bishops have already issued a series of letters to complain to him about his alleged involvement in sexual crimes committed against minors and their families. Many of them have criticized the Pope's decision to allow the papacy to take a stand against pedophiles, accusing the archdioceses of spreading the disease of human rights abuses. Some of those who have come forward to accuse the pontiff of sex crimes are now being investigated, while others have expressed concern over the lack of evidence. Chilean Cardinal Franco has denied accusations that they are not aware of any such allegations. And he has refused to say whether he is aware that any charges are being made against him, despite the fact that some minors are still being prosecuted for sexual misconduct. Cardinal Franz Kafka, head of Vatican prosecutors, told the Times of Chile in Rome, Rome and Washington on Tuesday. Pope John Paul II has already made a letter that Cape"

        "target": "German Interior Ministry Claims Progress on Crime Interior Minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble released his department's official statistics concerning crime in 2006 in Berlin on Tuesday. And the news was good -- most of the numbers were down compared to the preceding year. Germany's streets were never particularly dangerous, but according to the Interior Ministry, they are now safer than at any time since statistics have been collected. Reported criminal offenses on the whole dropped by 1.4 percent over 2005 -- to a total of just over 6.3 million. \"The statistics show reductions in crime among children, adolescents and teenagers, as well as adults,\" said Sch\u00e4uble. He added that criminality among foreigners living in Germany also fell, saying that this development reflected Germany's efforts to integrate non-Germans. Drugs offenses were down 7.8 percent, followed by theft and street crime, which both declined by four percent or more. Youth violence Vandalism, on the other hand, was up 5.9 percent. Fraud rose slightly, as did violent crime -- among young people by an alarming 4.5 percent. Berlin Interior Minister Erhart K\u00f6rting said that was part of a decade-long trend in Germany. \"As many experts have pointed out,\" K\u00f6rting said, \"the potential for violence in society is increasing.\" The head of the German Police Officers' Union Konrad Freiberg also said those figures showed that German society was not truly getting safer. Frankfurt tops most-dangerous list Crime was down in Frankfurt am Main, but it's still the German city with the greatest number of criminal offenses per 100,000 people. Hanover was a close second, followed by D\u00fcsseldorf, Bremen and Berlin. The total percentage of criminal cases solved by German police also improved slightly from 55 to 55.4 percent. According to the study, Germany's safest place was Bergisch Gladbach, a city of 100,000 inhabitants in the west of the country -- coincidentally, model Heidi Klum's home town.",
        "generated_story": "Germany: The State of Crime In Germany The state of crime in Germany has become a symbol of the European Union. The German government has been accused of cracking down on organized crime for years, but it's not the first time that has happened in the country. Last year, the government of Chancellor Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble accused the police of using excessive force against people who were suspected of committing crimes. \"We are not going to allow this to happen again,\" he said in an interview with the German news agency dpa. He added that \"we will not tolerate this kind of behavior in our country.\" The government is also accusing the media of covering up the crimes committed by police and prosecutors, saying that they were not doing enough to prevent them from happening again. This is the second year in a row that police have been caught up in investigations into the murders of police officers, soldiers and civilians. Police have also been called in to investigate the murder of a police officer, who was shot and critically wounded by a stray bullet. Investigators are also looking into possible links between the two crimes, which have led to the deaths of at least 30 people since the beginning of this year. It is not clear how many of these crimes are linked to police or prosecutors. But it is clear that there are a number of factors that contribute to this. For example, there is a lack of cooperation between police, prosecutors and intelligence agencies, and the public has not been able to cooperate with them in their investigations. That is, until recently, when police were allowed to take part in raids on police stations in Frankfurt am Main and in other parts of Germany. Since then, however, they have not cooperated with police. In the end, it was only the security forces who had the authority to arrest and detain the suspects, rather than the intelligence services, that allowed them to get away with it. However, in recent months, security agencies have stepped up their efforts to catch the perpetrators of crimes such as drug trafficking, extortion and money laundering. They have even taken measures to make it easier for police to break into homes and seize weapons and ammunition, as well as to stop the spread of illegal drugs and other illegal activities. At the same time, police are stepping up patrols on the streets of Berlin to try and catch those who are involved in criminal activity. These measures are part of an ongoing effort to tackle the problem of organised crime, according to a new report from the Federal Constitutional Court (FRC), which is expected to be published next week. FRC has also published a report calling for an end to state-run police operations in German cities and towns, including the city of Mainz and Berlin, to end the use of force by law enforcement agencies. There is no doubt that this will lead to an increase in violent crime and that the authorities will take action against those responsible for the killings of innocent people. And that is exactly what they are trying to do. After all, a lot of people have already been convicted of murder and attempted murder in this country for many years. Many of them were convicted in absentia and sentenced to life in prison, while others were acquitted of lesser offenses. Some of those convicted are still serving life sentences for their involvement in crimes against the state. Others are being tried for tax evasion, for failing to register as a criminal offense, or for possessing a weapon of mass destruction. Even the most hardened criminals, like the notorious gangsters, can be prosecuted for crimes they commit, even if they don't commit them themselves. As a result, many people will be charged with crimes that are punishable by up to 10 years in jail, with a maximum sentence of life for each count of one year for a crime committed against a person or group of persons. Such cases are extremely rare, especially when compared to other countries, where the crime rate is much lower than that of other European countries. So far, no one has come forward to say that such crimes have become more widespread. Nevertheless, this is an important step forward for Germany's criminal justice system. We have a long way to go in order to reduce the level of impunity that we have seen in Europe. If we want to see a change, we need to change the way we treat criminals. Let's talk about it, first. First, let's look at the criminalization of human rights. What do you think? What are the laws of criminal behavior? Is the law? Do you have any idea what the rules are for criminal offenses? If so, what are they doing? Are they being punished for doing something wrong? How can we make sure they're punished? I think that's a very important question to ask ourselves, because we should be doing the right thing. How do we know what we can do to protect our citizens? The law of law is very clear: If you're a member of parliament, you can't do anything. You have to have an open mind and a clear understanding of what's going on in your own country, so long as you know that you've done."

        "target": "Bremen Election Results Could Have National Repercussions It might be Germany's smallest state with a population of less than 700,000, but the make-up of Bremen's new government could curb the ability of Angela Merkel's coalition to continue with planned reforms. The Social Democrats (SPD) and Christian Democrats (CDU) have ruled the small northern city-state of Bremen in a coalition for the past 12 years. But after winning state elections on Sunday with 36.8 percent, the SPD is now flirting with the idea of ditching their previous coalition partners to rule together with the Greens, who made their best-ever showing in a German state poll with 16.4 percent. Bremen's state SPD leadership is to hold talks later on Wednesday with the CDU, which polled 25.7 percent. After an SPD meeting in Bremen, Mayor Jens B\u00f6hrnsen made the first signal he could be favoring the Greens. He said that during the campaign he had deliberately abstained from mentioning the possibility of a renewed CDU coalition because \"after 12 years it shouldn't automatically be continued.\" Bremen's acting head of government and CDU member Thomas R\u00f6wekamp, however, warned against an SPD-Green coalition. \"The majority of people don't want a red-green experiment, but a continuation of the grand coalition,\" he said. Both the SPD and CDU conceded heavy losses in the election, which showed a swing towards the Greens and the Left Party, which scored an unexpected 8.4 percent to win representation in a western German state legislature for the first time in its brief history. Block reforms? If Bremen's SPD decide in favor of the Greens, this would affect the ability of Chancellor Angela Merkel's grand coalition of CDU and SPD to push ahead with reforms requiring constitutional changes, such as stage two of Germany's urgently needed federalism reform. The federal Bundesrat, which is made up of state cabinet members, has to approve the majority of legislative bills passed by the lower chamber, the Bundestag, before they become law. Also, any proposed constitutional changes require two-thirds of all votes in order to be passed by the Bundesrat. The CDU and SPD currently hold 47 of the Bundesrat's 69 seats, which is one seat more than the necessary two-thirds majority. But without Bremen, the number held by the grand coalition would fall to 44 seats, meaning they would need the cooperation of one of the small opposition parties for any constitutional changes. Internal strife Earlier in the week, Chancellor Merkel called for unity within her ruling left-right coalition after the losses in Bremen set the stage for more infighting between the two parties. Merkel also warned the SPD against moving to the left after it lost some five percent points. The chancellor said the outcome showed the SPD had made a mistake by attacking the coalition and campaigning on promises of a minimum wage, which she believes will hamper efforts to fight unemployment of just under 10 percent. \"The result showed that this strategy did not pay off,\" Merkel told a press conference.",
        "generated_story": "German Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition of Social Democrats and CDU could block reforms in the country's biggest economy, the Bundesrat has warned. The SPD and the Christian Democrats are set to form a coalition government in Germany's second-biggest economy in three years, with the Greens and Greens leading the way. But they are unlikely to be able to win a majority in parliament. They are expected to vote on a number of key issues, including tax reform, social welfare and environmental protection, as well as a raft of economic reforms. \"We are not going to give up on this,\" Merkel said in a speech in Bremen on Thursday. She said she would not allow the SPD to take part in any of the planned reforms, which she said would be a \"huge step forward for the economy.\" But she also warned that she was not ready to accept the idea of a new government. Merkel, who was elected as chancellor in 2015, has been accused by some of her critics of being too soft on social issues. Her party has said it will not accept any new proposals, and that it is not willing to make any concessions to the ruling Social Democratic Party (SPD), which is seen as the main opposition party in her coalition. SPD leader Sigmar Gabriel said on Wednesday that he was \"not ready\" for a change in government, adding that \"we are ready for any change.\" The Greens, however, have said they will continue to oppose any changes to German tax laws, saying they would only allow them to pass through parliament if they were approved by the lower house of parliament (Bundesrat). \"I don't think we will allow this to happen,\" Gabriel told a news conference. He added that his party's Social Democrat party would also not be allowed to introduce new taxes on the wealthy, such as higher minimum wage, in order to protect the environment and to prevent the spread of diseases, he said. However, they have also said that they won't allow tax increases to go into effect until after the election. Chancellor Merkel has promised to keep the tax code in place for as long as possible, but she has yet to say how much she will pay for it. On Thursday, she told the Bundestag that the new law would make it easier for people to get around to tax rises and lower minimum wages. In the same breath, it was clear that there was no need for such a big tax increase. For the first time since she took office in 2013, her party is also looking to increase its tax revenue by 10 percent, according to a poll published last month. This is a step that could have a huge impact on economic growth and job creation. It's not clear how many people will benefit from the changes, though, because the CD-U and SPD are the only two parties that are likely to have the votes to do so. If they do not, Merkel could be forced to step down as soon as next year's election is called. That would mean the government would have to come to an agreement on how to tackle the issue of tax evasion and other social and economic issues that have been a source of concern to many Germans for years. And that would require a lot of hard work, given that many of them are already struggling to find a way out of their current economic troubles. So far, so good, indeed, that's what the chancellor has done so far: She has made it clear she is committed to tackling the problem of income inequality and social inequality, even though she says she wants to reduce the amount of taxes that people are paying on their income, rather than increase the taxes they pay on income and property taxes. What's next for her government? The chancellor's government will be led by her conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party (CSU). The CSU is the largest party with a total of 13.5 percent of German households, compared with just 3.4 percent in 2014. Both parties have pledged to cut taxes and spend more than 1.3 billion euros ($2.6 billion) on taxes, while the Socialists have promised a further 1 percent increase in their own tax revenues. Many of those who oppose tax hikes and spending cuts will also be in opposition to such measures. Some of these measures are aimed at reducing the burden of taxation on households and businesses, particularly those with low incomes. These measures would put a strain on German families, especially those living in rural areas, where taxes are higher than the average income of household income. (Reuters, AP, AFP, dpa, Reuters)The chancellor is facing an uphill battle to achieve her goal of reducing tax burden on people who are working in low-income households. How will she do that? If she doesn't get the support she needs? She will need to work on tax cuts and tax breaks, if she does not get a tax cut on her family's income from her own pocket. There is no doubt that this is something she can't do in this country. Even if the Chancellor is unable to meet her predecessor"

For example, I like the idea of making a cake with onion rings. I also like that the onion ring is used to decorate the cake, so I think it makes a nice addition to any cake I make. And I really like it because it reminds me of my childhood, when I was a little girl and my parents would have made it so easy for me to have a glass of red wine and a cup of hot chocolate. Now I can't wait for autumn to come around and enjoy the fruits and vegetables I grew up eating. This year, we're going to be celebrating the end of summer. We're celebrating autumn with a special dessert called \"Opinion Cake.\" The dessert is served in a large bowl and is accompanied by a bottle of sparkling wine from the same vineyard, with the addition of fresh fruit, vegetables and fruit from nearby vineyards. Or, if you want to try the dessert, you can order it at a restaurant in Berlin, where the wine is sold by the year's end. (Reuters, AFP, dpa, Reuters) \"The best part of autumn is when it comes to wine,\" says the French cook, Jean-Francois Leclerc, author of \"Wines of Autumn,\" a book published in French in 2014. He says he's always had a fondness for onion cakes, especially when he was growing up in France. His wife, Anne, is an avid wine drinker. She says she's grown up with three children and her husband and two grandchildren. Her husband, a former wine barber, has a passion for the fruit and vegetable industry and she says that she has always enjoyed the taste of onions. However, she doesn't think she'll ever be able to get enough of them in her own home. That's because she was raised on a farm and has never had any children. So she decided to go to Germany as a child. After all, her father was an alcoholic and raised her children there. When she got married, the couple had two daughters and had three granddaughters. Their children are now grown-up and now they have two grown children, ages 3 and 3. Since then, they've been raising their children with their parents and raising them as their own. As a result, their family has become very close friends and relatives. One of Anne's children is now married to a man they met on their wedding day. Anne and their daughter, Sophie, was born in Paris. Both of her parents are German-born and have three daughters. Sophie and Sophie have been married since the age of 12. Austria's wine industry is booming in recent years. According to her mother, \"I'm a big fan of German wines,\" she said, adding that her daughter has also grown to love the wines she makes. France's wines are particularly popular with young people, particularly in Europe. Germany is particularly fond of French wines, too, because of their rich history. French wine has long been a major influence on her family's taste for wine - and that is one reason why she loves wine so much - but she is very happy to see her grandchildren grow up to become a successful wine producer. German food is especially important for her, according to Anne. Austrian wine was the main ingredient in their wine business. Germans are known for their love of Italian wines. A German family is famous for producing wines and making wine for themselves. Dutch wine can be used as an accessory to their families. If you're interested in wine production, your father's father is German, he said she would make a fine wine maker. Apparently, this is her favorite wine-making tradition. Speaking of which she made a very well-"

The move shows Madrid's support of US efforts to close the controversial prison. Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said the first inmate from the US prison at Guantanamo Bay had arrived in his country. Madrid has agreed to host five prisoners, the largest commitment yet from a European country. Citing privacy concerns, Rubalcaba refused to give the prisoner's name or any identifying information, except to say he was a Palestinian. The new arrival will be able to work and move around Spain as he wishes, but will not be able to leave the country. \"He is a Palestinian, he has already arrived in our country. We do not want to give out further details because we want everyone who comes to live in our country to be able to live their lives normally,\" he told a news conference. Spain urges others to 'do the utmost' Spain's decision to take five Guantanamo detainees is part of an effort to help US President Barack Obama with his plans to shut down the jail. The prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, was set up at a US navy base by former President George W. Bush in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos has urged other European countries \"to do their utmost\" to take in former Guantanamo detainees as well. Third countries are being asked to take in detainees who are cleared of any charges, but who can't be sent back to their homelands for fear of persecution. Obama had said he would close the prison by January 22, 2010, yet the deadline passed unmet.

        "generated_story": "Guantanamo prisoners arrive in Spain The first of five prisoners from the US prison at Guantanamo Bay has arrived in the Spanish capital, Madrid, on Tuesday. The prisoners were among the first to arrive at the prison, where they were being held for five years. They were released on Wednesday after a three-day stay at a military prison in Cuba, according to a statement from Spanish Foreign Ministry spokesman Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba. \"The prisoners have been transferred to Spain,\" he said, adding that they had been sent to Guantanamo to be interrogated by US authorities. Spain's president, Barack Obama, has ordered the transfer of the prisoners, who were held there for more than a year, to the United States, which has been accused of torture and other crimes against humanity. On Tuesday, the government of Spain announced that it would release the five detainees, including one who was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison for the murder of a US soldier in Iraq in 2002. In addition, it said that the detainees would be sent back to their countries of origin, with the possibility of being released if they did not cooperate with their interrogators. This is the second time in three years that Spain has allowed prisoners to return to its prisons. At the time of their release, Spain was the only country in Europe to allow the release of prisoners who had not been convicted for crimes committed during World War II. Since then, however, they have remained in detention in Guantanamo, Cuba. According to Spanish media reports, some of them have fled to other countries, while others have returned home to seek asylum. Many of those who have left Guantanamo are still waiting for their return home, and some have even left the country to go to Europe. Some of these prisoners are in their 20s and 30s, but others are older than 30. A number of other detainees have also been released from Guantanamo in recent years, as well as from other prisons in other European countries. Among them is Miguel Angel Moratinos, a former prisoner of war who is now in solitary confinement in a prison near Madrid. He was released in 2009 after serving a five-year prison sentence for murder, attempted rape and attempted murder. His sentence was later reduced to one year and a half, when he was given a new life as a free man. It is not clear how long he will be able to live in his own country, although he has said he would like to see his wife and children back home. And he is also looking forward to returning to his family in Madrid after his release from prison. For now, he plans to continue his studies in law and politics. But he also wants to get a better understanding of his country's role in international relations and how it is governed by international law. That is why he hopes to work with President Obama to improve relations between the two countries and to make sure that there is a positive relationship between his government and the people he's working with. If he doesn't get his way, then he'll have to find a way out of Guantanamo. After all, his father was a member of Congress and his brother was also a prisoner there, too. When he died in 2006, many people thought he had died of AIDS. Now, that was not the case. Instead, there are five more Guantanamo inmates who are now serving life sentences in jail. Most of whom are being tried in absentia for drug offenses and drug crimes. There are also five others who remain behind bars. These five men, aged between 30 and 60, are currently serving sentences for terrorism offenses. One is currently awaiting trial. Another is due to appear before a judge in November. More than 100 people are expected to testify before the Supreme Court on Monday in an attempt to reach a verdict on whether or not they are guilty of charges related to drug trafficking and human rights violations. Other prisoners will also be sentenced in January, after the trial is set to begin in February. Several other inmates have already been sentenced. However, most are already serving their sentences. Only one is scheduled to receive a sentence of life imprisonment, for a maximum of six months. So far, no one has committed a crime. No one knows what the sentence is going to do to them. Just ask the judge, or the prosecutor, if he thinks they're guilty, because they don't have the money to pay for it. Meanwhile, several other men are on trial for similar crimes, such as drug smuggling and weapons smuggling. (Reuters, AP, AFP, Reuters, dpa) \"I think it's a very sad day for Spain. I think we have a lot to learn from this case,\" said Jose Luis Rodriguez, an attorney at Madrid's federal court. Rodriguez told Reuters that he believes the charges are politically motivated, saying that his client is innocent of all charges. 'It's just a matter of time before they can be released.' Rodriguez added: \"This case is very important to me that we are not guilty. We have no idea what we're going through.\" Rodriguez said the maximum sentence will"

        "target": "Threat of the Punjabi Taliban is growing Deutsche Welle talks to Pakistani political expert Hasan Askari Rizvi about the growing ties between militants in northwest Pakistan and Punjab province. At least four gunmen disguised in police uniforms raided a hospital in Pakistan's eastern city of Lahore on Monday night, claiming at least five lives. Local officials said the gunmen were trying to free a militant, who was being treated there after being captured during attacks on two mosques last Friday. The police said the gunfight at Jinnah Hospital had lasted around 45 minutes but the gunmen had managed to flee. Friday's twin attacks on the minority Ahmadi community left more than 90 people dead. They were claimed by a group, which identified itself as the Punjabi wing of the Taliban. Deutsche Welle spoke to political expert Hasan Askari Rizvi in Lahore, where there has been a wave of violence in recent days. DW: Who are the \"Punjabi Taliban\"? It is a kind of a pejorative term, which includes a host of groups. Initially in Punjab, you had two types of militancy: One, the groups that focussed mainly on Indian-administered Kashmir and there were other types of groups that focussed on Pakistan. Those were the sectarian groups targeting mainly the Shias, and there were some Shia groups targeting the Sunni leadership. Over the years a lot of factions have broken away from these groups and these small entities are functioning more or less autonomously. They have trainings in the tribal areas because these are secured for them and certain parts are not under Pakistani control so these groups go there. They operate with the Pakistani Taliban based in tribal areas against the Pakistani troops in the region. They also have an autonomous agenda, which they pursue in Punjab, as they have been doing in the past days. These groups also play host or are a kind of a local link to Taliban suicide bombers who come into the main part of Pakistan from the tribal areas (let's say to Punjab). If they have to target some place, they park themselves with these Punjab groups, and then do it. All these factions and groups that have broken away from traditional militant groups and are functioning in close collaboration with tribal area Taliban are often described as the \"Punjabi Taliban\". Why do you think these militants are resurfacing now? They have always existed here and there and generally the trend is that they undertake a couple of operations, one after the other. Then the government comes in and takes action against them. Then they just disappear or become sleeping groups and suddenly after a couple of months they resurface. That's the standard pattern. The last major incident in Lahore was in the first week of March. Then there was nothing in April and now towards the end of May you have this kind of incident. Do you think the government should have taken stronger action against them? They should have but the problem is that the Punjab government has a kind of ambiguous approach and I think there is some element of denial within the leadership also. These groups also have some sympathy if not support at the societal level and that makes it difficult for the government to go against them openly. They need to work together and to emphasise to the people that they are terrorists. They use different names and Islam but actually their agenda is terrorism. Somehow the government of Punjab has been rather confused and ambiguous regarding these groups. Interview: Disha Uppal Editor: Anne Thomas",
        "generated_story": "The Punjabi Taliban in northwest Pakistan is growing The Pakistani Taliban are growing in size and strength, according to the German news agency Deutsche Welle. The country's largest Muslim-majority country, Pakistan, is facing a growing threat from the militant group, which has claimed responsibility for the attacks on the Jinnah Hospital in Lahore. It is the first time that a Pakistani army has been deployed in the country in more than a decade, and it is not just in Pakistan. In the past, the Taliban have been active in northwestern Pakistan for years, but also in India and Pakistan as well. Last year, it was reported that Pakistan's army was preparing for a military operation against the militants, who had been planning to take over the hospital for several years. But in recent months, they have stepped up their attacks, killing at least 10 people and injuring hundreds more. They have also targeted the police and army, saying they are trying to kill civilians. \"We are not going to let this happen again,\" said Disha Uppal, a journalist for German-language German daily \"Deutsche Zeitung\" (DWL) and a former police officer. She added that \"we have to be vigilant and vigilant.\" She said that the Pakistani military was ready to intervene if needed, adding that it would be \"very, very careful\" to ensure that no one was killed in any way. However, she said, \"I don't think we are ready for this kind of situation.\" The Taliban, in particular, have a strong presence in parts of the Punjab province of Punjab, where they control a large number of hospitals, hospitals and schools. According to a report by the newspaper's editor-in-chief, Hasan Askari Rizvi, there is a high level of mistrust between Pakistani and Indian security forces, particularly in Punjab. He said there was \"a lot of distrust\" between the military and the civilian population, especially in areas where there are large numbers of people who are illiterate and have no access to basic education. This mistrust has led to an increase in violence in some areas, he said. Pakistan has also been accused of supporting the insurgency in a bid to undermine the government's ability to provide security for its citizens. At the same time, some of its most senior officials have expressed concern about the possibility of a resurgence of violence, such as in Kashmir, Punjab and elsewhere in northern India. Some of them have even called on Pakistan to step up security measures, while others have called for an end to its military presence. There is also a rise in attacks by militants who have claimed to have killed hundreds of civilians, including children and women, during the last few months. Many of these attacks were carried out by Pakistani soldiers, police, soldiers and civilians who were deployed to protect the people of Kashmir. These attacks have caused the death of thousands of innocent civilians and injured hundreds, many of whom have died in their own homes. As a result, more people are being killed every day. That is why many people have fled to other countries to escape the violence that has taken place across the border. For the most part, this has not been the case. Most of those who flee to Pakistan have never been able to reach Pakistan because they fear that they will be forced to return to their home country of their birth, or that their families will die in another country. And that's not the only reason why the situation is so tense in this part of Pakistan: there's also the threat of terrorism, too. A recent attack on a police station in Peshawar killed a policeman and wounded a woman in his car. Police said the attacker was carrying out a suicide attack in which he was shot and killed by a roadside bomb. No one has yet been arrested, however, so far, only a few police officers are suspected of being involved. Authorities have yet to identify the suspect, though they suspect that he may be involved in an attempt to flee the area. Meanwhile, reports suggest that Pakistani intelligence agencies are still investigating the incident, with the aim of finding out who is responsible for it. Officials in Islamabad say the attack is likely to continue, as the investigation is still ongoing. Pakistani police have not yet made any arrests. (AP, AFP, dpa, Reuters)The attack comes after a series of attacks in Pakistani cities in eastern Punjab last week, when a man was arrested and charged with attempted murder in connection with an attack that took place in Karachi. Several people were also injured in that attack. More than 100 people died, officials said on Friday, after which police said they were still searching for him and others were arrested. Reuters/IANS/AFP/dpa/Reuters (Reuters, AP)In a separate report, German media reported on Saturday that police had arrested two people, claiming they had tried to break into a house and bomb the house. Investigators said police were searching the home of an unknown man. An investigation was launched into the murder of another man, whose name was not immediately available to confirm the identity of his identity."

        "target": "Party leaders call for increased wages in growing German economy Chancellor Angela Merkel and other top officials have called for upticks in Germany's economy to trickle down to workers in the form of higher pay. But a leading think tank has warned against giving raises too soon. Germany's foreign minister and deputy chancellor, Guido Westerwelle, has added his support to comments made by Economics Minster Rainer Bruederle about increased wages for German workers. \"When the economy grows and this growth is substantial and sustainable, then the benefits of this upswing should be felt by the people who worked so hard for it,\" Westerwelle told the Hamburger Abendblatt newspaper in an interview. Westerwelle heads the free-market liberal FDP, which shares power with Chancellor Merkel's Christian coalition. Earlier this week, Bruederle, also an FDP member, said in light of Germany's currently growing economy, those economic gains should trickle down to employees in the form of higher wages. Merkel, who is also the head of the Christian Democratic Union, supported Bruederle's idea. \"That is something the chancellor sees the same way, letter for letter,\" said Merkel's spokesman, Steffen Seibert. Not so fast Earlier this week, analysts predicted growth of 3.5 percent this year and 2 percent in 2011. Germany's five leading economic think tanks also predicted that the number of unemployed would fall below 3 million next year, the lowest level since 1992. Despite the current rosy outlook for the German economy, not everyone is convinced that a growing economy should inevitably lead to higher wages. The president of the German Institute for Economic Research, Klaus Zimmermann, warned against reacting too quickly. \"I can't support the idea of a general wage increase, I think it is too dangerous,\" Zimmermann said in an interview with the Handelsblatt newspaper. Zimmermann wasn't opposed to the idea of raising wages, but said he was against across-the-board increases for all sectors and pointed out that not every industry is benefitting the same from the growing economy. \"We can't forget that the German economy did not resort to mass lay-offs when it wasn't going so well last year,\" Zimmermann said. Raising wages in some branches could be a good idea, Zimmermann said, as that would make those branches more attractive option to potential workers from outside of Germany.

        "generated_story": "Germany's Deputy Chancellor, Klaus Zimmermann, is against a general wage hike Chancellor Angela Merkel's deputy chancellor, Rainer Bruederle, has called for an increase in Germany's minimum wage. The FDP leader, who is also a member of the Social Democrats (SPD), said on Thursday that he was \"not in favor\" of such a hike. \"I am not against it at all,\" he said in an interview with the German Institute for Economic Research (IER) in Berlin. He also said that the government was not in favour of a \"general wage increase\" for German workers. But he did not rule out the possibility that it would be a step in the right direction. In a speech to parliament on Friday, he also called on the SPD to increase its minimum wages by 1.5 percent from current levels by the end of this year. This is the first time in German history that a German government has increased its maximum wage by as much as 2.7 percent, according to the IER. That's a significant increase from the current level of 3.4 percent in 2013, when it was the lowest level since the 1990s. It's also the second consecutive year that Germany has seen a rise in average hourly wages, after the US and France, which are the two largest economies in Europe, respectively. Last year, the Federal Democratic Union (FDP) and the Greens were the only two parties in parliament to vote against the increase. Both parties, however, said they were not opposed to it, and that they would continue to support it. However, they also argued that higher wages would not be enough to make up for the fall in unemployment. They also pointed out that unemployment was already high in many parts of Germany, with unemployment at a record high of 7.6 percent and unemployment rising to 8.8 percent. On Thursday, Merkel said she would consider raising the minimum hourly wage to 5.9 percent for all German citizens, up from 5 percent currently. She also promised to introduce a tax on income earned by Germans who earn less than the average wage for a family of four, a move that would make it easier for people to get a job. And she said her party would support the tax increase if it were to be passed on to their own people, as well as to those who would benefit from higher taxes. 'I don't want to lose my job,' she added. Her comments come as a surprise to many who have followed her on social media, where she has been a vocal critic of higher wage increases for many years. Many of her supporters have also criticized the move, saying it is an attempt to reduce the number of people who are working in low-wage jobs, such as the unemployed and those with low incomes. Some have even accused her of being too lenient in her approach to social issues, while others have criticized her for not being able to work in a way that makes it more difficult for them to do so. For example, she says that she doesn't believe that women should be allowed to earn more than men in their 30s and 40s, even if they have the opportunity to have a decent income. According to a recent poll, women are more likely to receive a higher salary than their male counterparts, compared to men of their 20s or 50s in other European countries. Women in general are also less likely than older generations to benefit financially from a lower wage, but that's not the case for women, too, because they are less educated and have less access to education, education and health care. There are a lot of reasons for this, of course, including the fact that many women have never had the chance to graduate from high-paying jobs. As a result, many of them have been forced to leave their jobs in order to pursue a career in politics. One of those reasons is that there is a shortage of qualified candidates for higher education. Another reason for that is because the unemployment rate is so high: women's unemployment is high, especially among the younger generation. If women aren't educated, that means they will have to pay more for their children to attend university, rather than working part-time. So, in light of that, there's no reason to expect that more women will leave the workforce, at least at the beginning of next year's German parliament, to take up the post of chancellor. Meanwhile, some women in particular are still working at lower wages than they used to when they did. At the same time, this is not an issue that has not been addressed in recent years, for example. A recent study found that one in five German women who work at university are now working as part of lower-income households. These women had to find a better career path to become a successful career as an economist. Among them, one who has worked in finance, business, politics and education have become increasingly difficult to achieve higher salaries. When the economy is in decline, it's because people are not getting a pay raise. (Reuters, AFP/AFP"

Freiburg scored an extra time goal to squeak out a victory against Hoffenheim. Bayern Munich cruised to a 3-0 victory at home against Bavarian rival FC Nuremberg on Sunday, closing the German soccer tables for the weekend. Striker Mario Gomez got things going in the 10th minute for Bayern and also scored the final goal in the 75th minute off a corner kick from Franck Ribery. Ribery came on as a substitute five minutes earlier, making his first appearance for the team since injuring his ankle in September. Near the end of the match, Gomez had an opportunity for his third goal on a penalty kicked but missed. Thirty points at break Phillipp Lahm successfully converted a penalty kick in the 57th minute to round out the scoring for Bayern. The victory for Bayern moved them into sixth place in the table with 19 points and has continued a slow shift in momentum following a rough start to the season. Bayern coach Louis van Gaal said after the game he hoped his team would have 30 points by the end of the first half of the season in five more matches.

        "generated_story": "Bayern Munich seal 3-0 win over Hoffenheim Papiss Demba Cisse seals a third straight Bundesliga win for Bayern Munich on Sunday. The German champions have won three consecutive Bundesliga games, with their third win in a row coming on the back of a 2-2 draw with FC Nuremberg in the German Bundesliga on Saturday night. Germany's top-flight club has won four of their last five league matches, including the last three, and they have a three-game unbeaten streak in all competitions. On Sunday, however, they were unable to find the end of the tunnel, as they had to wait for the ball to be cleared by the referee. After a long wait, the visitors finally managed to get a goal from the penalty spot. They were the first team to score in their Bundesliga history, having won their first three Bundesliga matches. In the second half, Bayern were able to put the game out of reach with a late header from Mario Gomez's cross. But the home side, who have been struggling for a few weeks now, couldn't find a way past their opponents. For the third time in as many games this season, their top scorer has scored three goals. That's a record for any Bundesliga team, but it's not the only time they've had a chance to do so. Last year's Champions League final saw them lose to Bayern in extra time at the Allianz Arena, where they lost to the Wolfsburg team 4-1 on aggregate. This time, though, it was Pisse who scored the winning goal. \"It was a very important moment for us,\" he said, adding that he was pleased with the way the team had responded after the break. He added: \"I think we've done a lot of good things in this tournament so far. We've been very fortunate to win three of our last four matches and we're very happy with this result.\" \"We're going to have to work hard to make sure that we don't let this happen again,\" said the midfielder, whose goal gave Bayern an early lead. It was the most important goal of his young career, which has seen them reach the top three in Germany, in terms of goals scored and assists. However, there are still some things that need to change, such as the fact that the goal was not scored in front of goal and that there was no chance of an equalizer. I think that's one of those areas where we can make a positive change.\" The result is a huge step forward for both Bayern and their fans. At the very least, this is an important step towards a new era in German football, one that has been marked by a number of changes in recent years. There are many reasons why the Bundesliga is so important to them. One of them is that they are the best team in Europe right now. If they want to improve their chances of reaching the Champions Cup final, that means they must improve on their recent form. And that is something that can only be achieved by improving their defensive play. With the exception of one player who has had an excellent season in his first two years in charge, Pescara is the man most likely to step up his game in that role. His first goal for his side came against a German side who are struggling to match the level of quality that Bayern have had for so long. A few minutes into the match, he scored his second goal to give them the lead and set up the winner for their fourth consecutive win, a header that could have sealed the victory for them all. Facing a Bayern side that have struggled for some time now and has struggled to keep up their form, Fenerbah\u00e7e are now the favorites to reach their goal-scoring mark for this year. Despite their lack of success, German coach Franck Ribery is confident that his team will continue to build on last season's title success and he is optimistic about the prospects for next season. Nevertheless, on a day when they face a tough task, his goal will not be easy to come by. As he has done so many times before, last week's win was an example of how he can improve his form and his ability to adapt to his new role as an attacking midfielder. So far, so good is his attitude. When he does get the chance, you can expect to see more from him, too. You can see why he will be a key part of Bayern's future, even if he doesn't have the confidence to take the next step. From the bench, I'm sure he'll be happy to oblige, because he knows how important it is for him to stay on top of things. Just as he did last year, when he made his debut in 2014, Gernot Rohrbach was also a big reason for that. Although he didn't score against his former club in 2015-16, Schalke have already made a strong start to their title defense. German international midfielder and midfielder Pinca has already shown he's still a good enough to"

Instead of being filled with black or green tea, the bag contains active carbon granules and is made from nanofibers treated with biocide, which kills bacteria rather than simply filtering them from the water. Nanotech for pennies \"This project takes nanotechnology to the poorest of the poor people who live in this world, and it will make a difference in their lives,\" said Eugen Cloete, who in addition to inventing the filter is dean of the faculty of science at Stellenbosch University and chair of Stellenbosch University's Water Institute. With some 300 million people in Africa - and over a billion worldwide - living without access to clean drinking water, the need for such a filter is huge. When in mass production, the developers said they expect the teabag to cost just a few South African cents (under half a US cent and under a third of a euro cent). In addition to being inexpensive, Botes said, the filter is also easy to distribute to rural area and simple to use as it can be place in an adapter that fits on nearly any regular-sized plastic bottle. Each filter can clean one liter (one quart) of the most polluted water to the point where it is completely safe to drink. Once used, the filter can be disposed of and is biodegradable. African countries, led by Somalia, Mauritania and Sudan, were ranked to have the most vulnerable water supplies, according to a June report by UK-based risk consultancy firm Maplecroft. Decentralized use The filter's small size and light weight make it ideal for rural areas where other means of filtration do not exist, Cloete said. \"It is simply impossible to build purification infrastructure at every polluted stream,\" Cloete said. \"So we have to take the solution to the people. The water is cleaned right then and there when you drink from the bottle.\" The filter is now undergoing testing by the South African Bureau of Standards, after which Cloete and his team hope it can be rolled out to the United Nations and non-governmental organizations that have expressed interest in it by the end of the year. The project grew out of research into larger filters, according to Cloete. \"We were busy developing filters for larger applications, but when you do the tests in the labatory you do the tests on a much smaller scale,\" he said. \"The results we were getting on a smaller amount of water promoted me to think about a smaller application.\" Author: Joerg Poppendieck, Sean Sinico Editor: Anke Rasper",
        "generated_story": "A Teabag-sized water filter for decentralized drinking In South Africa, water filters are being developed to reduce the amount of water used in the country's water supply. The project is being funded by the South African Bureau of Standards (BBS) and the University of Stellenbosch. It is the first of its kind in Africa to be developed by a German company, which has been working on the project for more than a decade. According to BBS, the new filter will be used to filter water from rivers, lakes and reservoirs. \"It is designed to prevent the spread of diseases,\" Botes told Deutsche Welle, adding that it would be possible for the government to develop a system that would allow people to tap their own water without having to pay for it. But it is not possible to do so without the help of a water regulator, BSS, or a government agency like the National Water Institute (NWI), which is responsible for regulating water supplies. Bobs said the filter would help reduce water use in areas where water is scarce, such as in rural areas, where there is a lack of access to clean water. He added that the system would also be able to monitor the water quality of rivers and lakes, as well as the level of drinking water that is available to people who live in villages, towns and cities. In addition, it will also allow water companies to sell their water directly to the public, in order to avoid the risk of contamination, he said. 'We are not going to allow this to happen in our own country. We will not let it happen again,' he added, referring to his country of origin as \"South Africa.\" \"We have to make sure that we are doing the right thing for our people and our environment,\" he told the paper. And he also said that he would like to see the technology used for decentralizing water distribution in other parts of the world, including the Middle East, Africa and North Africa. However, there are still a lot of problems with decentralization. For example, we don't have enough water, so we can't get enough of it, and that's why we need to invest in this kind of technology.\" The company is also developing a new system for distributing water across the continent, called \"Teabags,\" which will allow the company to distribute water in a decentralized way to its customers, rather than through a centralized system. This system is expected to have a wide range of applications, ranging from water purification to wastewater treatment to sewage treatment. There are also a number of other applications that could be applied to decentralize water management. One of these is to provide water to households and businesses, for example in remote areas of rural communities. Another application is for water treatment facilities in cities and towns where people live and work, according to a report from the World Bank. Other applications are to use water as a substitute for electricity and water for cooking, heating and heating. A third application would require the use of electricity, but this would not be the case in many countries where electricity is currently rationed. That's because the electricity bill is so high in some countries, especially in countries with low-income populations, that people are forced to rely on electricity to get water out of their homes. At the same time, this could make it difficult for people with poor health to access basic services, like water and sanitation, to find a reliable source of energy. So the idea of decentralized water systems is becoming more and more common in developing countries and developing economies, says the author of this report, Eugen Cloete, who is based in London, England. His research is published in The New York Times, with a focus on renewable energy, energy efficiency and climate change. With the aim of reducing the cost of power generation and energy consumption, his research has helped to improve the situation of people living in poverty and inequality in sub-Saharan Africa in recent years. As a result, many people have been left with little or no money to spend on basic needs. Many people, however, do not have the means to buy water at the local level. They have no idea how much water they can use, therefore, they have little choice but to drink from a public water source. (Reuters, AFP, dpa, Reuters) \"This is an important step forward in terms of addressing the issue of waste management,\" says Bote. She adds: \"I think it's a good idea to give people the opportunity to live without electricity. I think that this is something that can be done in an environmentally friendly way. You can make a difference in their lives. If you're a person who doesn't want to go to school, you can get a better understanding of what's going on in your home country, because you've already seen the results of your own life. What do you think? You've got to know what you need, right? I'm not sure what to expect from this project. Let's just say that you'll be surprised if you know that there"

        "target": "For drivers in Germany, 2010 was the most expensive year ever Owning and operating a car in Germany has never been cheap, but it's never been more expensive than in 2010. German auto club ADAC says costs associated with owning a car have risen more than 40 percent since 1995. In 2010, German car owners had to pay a high price for their mobility, according to ADAC, which cited record-high fuel prices as the major cost factor. \"For drivers, 2010 will go down in history as the most costly year ever,\" ADAC said in a statement. High taxes The cost of acquiring and operating a car has risen 42 percent since 1995, compared to a 24 percent increase in the general cost of living. Due to tax increases and higher production costs, fuel prices soared 86 percent over the 15-year period. In 2010 alone, the average price for a liter of super gasoline was more than 1.40 euros ($1.84) - the highest the average price ever. According to ADAC, urban singles spent an average of 3,340 euros on their cars in 2000. Five years later, that figure had jumped to 3,900 euros. By the end of 2010, their expenses reached 4,380 euros, or 1,000 euros more than a decade earlier. Driving is also pricey for four-person families with two cars. According to the automobile club, their annual costs have risen 30 percent over the past 10 years from 5,940 euros to 7,740 euros. Taxes account for the lion's share of gasoline and diesel prices. The German government's mineral oil and value added taxes account for nearly 88 cents of the 1.35-euro price of a liter of fuel. Low toll revenue While the German government reaps more revenue year for year from vehicle-related taxes, income generated by its highway toll for trucks is expected to fall this year for the first time since the haulage charges were introduced in 2005. The government predicts this year's toll revenues will amount to 4.2 billion euros, down from 4.3 billion euros in 2009. Author: John Blau Editor: Sam Edmonds",
        "generated_story": "Most Costly Year for German Auto Clubs Last year was the most costly year in German auto club history, according to ADAC. It was a record year for the number of car clubs in Germany, with more than 1.5 million cars sold in the first half of the year. The average German car club had a turnover of around 1,000 euros ($2,500) a year, making it the second-most expensive year ever for a German club, behind only the 2007-08 year when the average price of a car was $1,600. That's a staggering amount of money for an industry that has been struggling for years to keep up with demand. And it's not just the cost of cars. There's also the fact that there are a lot of people who don't have the money to buy a new car. This year is no different. In 2007, the total cost was about $2.4 billion, which is the equivalent of $3.7 billion for every car sold. Since then, however, there's been a surge in demand for new cars, as well as a rise in interest in new models. But that doesn't mean that the costs of new vehicles are going to go down. \"The most expensive car ever sold was in 2008, when it was around $4.6 billion. We're not talking about the price, but we're talking more about how much the car industry is costing us. I mean, we've been paying for cars for over a decade, and we still have to pay for them, too. So, what do you think about that? I think we should all be paying more for our cars than we are spending on new ones, right? You know, because we all know how expensive it is to have a good car and to be able to afford a nice new one. What do we think of this year's car sales? We think it will be very interesting to see how many cars we sell and how we spend our money on them. For example, if you have an Audi, you know that it costs you a fortune to own one and that you can buy it for less than you would spend on a Mercedes, or a BMW. You can also buy your own car at the same time as you're buying it from the manufacturer. How much is it worth to you? \"It's about as much as we can afford to spend,\" said one man, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media. He said he had no idea what was going on, adding that he didn't want to talk about it. However, he added that his car would be sold to anyone who was interested in buying one, so he would have no choice but to sell it to someone who would pay more. According to a report by the German magazine \"Auto Club Zeitung\" (ADAC), he said that \"the car market is a very important part of German society.\" He also pointed out that many car owners are not familiar with the concept of \"car culture,\" which he described as \"a culture of luxury.\" \"I think that's what makes it so difficult for people to live in a country like Germany,\" the magazine said, referring to car culture in which cars are so expensive that they are often used as an excuse to get around, rather than a means of getting around the country. As a result, many people have become disillusioned with car ownership, especially in Europe and the United States, where the auto industry has become more and more expensive than in other countries, such as the US and Europe. These days, carmakers are more likely to make a profit than they were before the 2008 financial crisis. They are also less willing to invest in their cars because they have more money in order to meet the needs of their customers. After all, they do not need to do so. A car is not the only thing that can help them get a better price for their money. If you want a decent car, buy one from a dealership, get one in your local car dealership and you'll be in good financial condition. (Reuters, AP, AFP, dpa) (AP, Reuters) In the past few years, German automakers have made it a point to look for ways to reduce their costs. Volkswagen, BMW and Mercedes-Benz have all made a big profit by selling cars to their owners. VW, Mercedes and BMW are among the biggest players in this industry. BMW is one of Germany's most popular brands, while Mercedes has made up for that. Mercedes is also a major reason for its low-cost model. German manufacturers have also made an effort to raise their prices, particularly in recent years. Germany has a reputation for being the world's largest carmaker. Despite the high-volume models, Volkswagen is still the largest manufacturer of vehicles, even though they're still a relatively small company. Even the Mercedes models are still relatively expensive to produce cars that have been around for many years and they can't compete with other manufacturers."
