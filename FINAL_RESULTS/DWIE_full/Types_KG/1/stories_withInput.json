        "target": "Myanmar Junta Announces Amnesty The junta in Myanmar, also known as Burma, announced an amnesty for more than 7,000 prisoners on Friday, including a few political detainees. The amnesty came on the 21st anniversary of the brutal crackdown of a student-led pro-democracy movement in 1988 and the subsequent seizure of power by the current junta. Journalists were invited to Yangon\u2019s notorious Insein prison on Friday as the authorities released the first batch of prisoners. At least 600 inmates were freed as part of an amnesty for over 7,000 inmates nationwide. Among those released in Yangon were two journalists and 25 political prisoners -- rights groups say this is only 1 percent of the total number of political prisoners held by the military regime. Maung Zarni, a research fellow at the London School of Economics, was \u201chappy for the prisoners who were part of the release\u201d. \u201cThis is a very positive personal development and I am happy they have been released but we need to understand that the junta is using the prisoners\u2019 release as a public relations exercise. It is the 21st anniversary of the military coup so they are using this as a way to pacify political discontent in the country.\u201d Amnesty comes ahead of next year\u2019s polls Myanmar's director general of prisons, Zaw Win, said that the prisoners had been freed so they could take part in next year's polls. In recent months, rights activists, pro-democracy activists and Western countries have cast doubt on the credibility of the planned elections as many key political activists are still in detention. This includes pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who recently began a new 18-month period of house arrest after being found guilty of violating her house arrest order in a widely condemned trial. \u201cThe whole Suu kyi trial is rather unlawful,\u201d said Zarni. \u201cBecause the country does not have an independent judiciary, the judges are just puppets who dance to the tune of the top leadership.\u201d Junta is holding on tightly In 1990, Suu Kyi\u2019s National League for Democracy won Myanmar\u2019s last general election by a landslide. But the junta never recognised the results and has since tightened its control over the country. The 2008 constitution, which was drafted and approved by the military generals, which guarantees the army 25 percent of parliamentary seats, is yet another sign of its desire to consolidate power. \u201cThe military is going to be in power for a long time,\u201d warns Zarni, \u201cbecause they have got control of all the political and economic institutions in the country as well as the entire state of Burma. So with or without elections, this is likely to remain the same.\u201d New Democratic Party formed Meanwhile, a new political party has been formed in Myanmar. The Democratic Party is headed by Mya Than Than Nu, who is the daughter of the country\u2019s first democratically-elected prime minister, U Nu. The party has proposed a power-sharing deal with the military, which would give 40 percent of power to politicians and 60 percent to the military rulers. Harn Yawnghwe, the director of the Brussels-based Euro-Burma Office, doubts the new party stands a chance: \u201cIt is possible that they they would be able to get some votes. But it is not likely, even if they were able to contest the elections freely, that they will be able to form a new government because the military is not prepared to let any party rule.\u201d Democrats should exploit elections He thinks the only way out for the democratic forces in Myanmar is to use the upcoming elections wisely and \u201cto take part in them even if they are against them. I think we have to look at the elections as a process which will lead to democracy -- maybe in few more years.\u201d The National League for Democracy has indicated that it will not take part in the polls unless all Myanmar\u2019s political prisoners, including Suu Kyi, are released. Suu Kyi\u2019s lawyers have filed an appeal against the extension of her house arrest and the court is expected to give a ruling on October 2. But few are hopeful that the junta will amnesty her anytime soon. Author: Disha Uppal Editor: Anne Thomas",
        "generated_story": "Myanmar's new junta targets political prisoners Mya Than Than Nu, the head of the National League for Democracy (NLD) in Myanmar, has accused the new military government of violating international human rights law. U Nu has denied the allegations, saying he was not aware of any such allegations. \"I have no idea what happened,\" he told reporters in Brussels on Friday, adding that he did not know what was going on in his country. He said he had not heard from the military, but that it was \"very clear that there was a change in the government.\" The new government, which has been in power since 1989, is expected to take over the country by the end of this year. It is also expected that Myanmar will be able to implement a new constitution, and that the constitution would be amended to make it easier for the people of Myanmar to live in peace and order. The government has said it will not allow the use of force against the opposition. But it has also promised to do everything it can to protect the rights of those who have been imprisoned, including the right to self-determination. Aung San Suu Kyi, who heads the NLD, was elected as the party's leader in a landslide election last year, said she would not rule out the possibility of a return to democracy. She added that she was hopeful that a transitional government could be set up to ensure the rule of law was upheld. However, she added, \"We are not going to allow it to happen. We will have to see how it is done and how we can do that.\" I am not a politician, nor am I a lawyer. I have never been to a country where the political system is run by a civilian government. In the 1990s, I was the first democratically elected prime minister of my country to be elected. Since then, however, my political opponents have tried to force me to step down. They are trying to prevent me from becoming the next Yangon mayor. This is a very difficult situation for me, because I don't have a lot of time to think about what I want to say to my people. That is, until I get to the point where I can say that I do not have the time or the resources to deal with the situation. So I will continue to work on this issue, as long as it's not something that will affect me personally. If I'm elected, then I won't be allowed to run for office. There is no chance of that happening in my lifetime. What is happening is that my government will do something about it. And that is the only way that can be done. For now, there is not much to talk about. At the moment, though, it seems like the Myanmar government is doing a good job of making sure that its people are being treated fairly and fairly. As I speak, this is an important issue for all of us. On the other hand, what is Myanmar's future? The country's political situation is very different from that of other countries in this region. Myanmar has a long history of authoritarian rule in which the ruling military regime has ruled since the late 1950s and early 1980s. Many of its political leaders are based in exile, so I think that's why the current government should be given more time and space to build a strong political and economic base. These are the kind of people who are willing to stand up and fight for their rights and freedoms that are at stake in their own country, such as democracy and freedom of expression. You can read more about my experience here."

        "target": "US duo shares Nobel Prize for Economics US researcher Elinor Ostrom is the first woman to win the Nobel prize for economics since it was created in 1968. She will share the prestigious award with US compatriot Oliver Williamson. The jury from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said the Americans' research had shown how \"economic analysis can shed light on most forms of social organization.\" Ostrom, a professor at Indiana University, was honored for her \"analysis of economic governance,\" especially in relation to the management of common property or property under common control. The political scientist's work challenges the widely accepted belief that common property is poorly managed and should be either regulated by central authorities or privatized, it added. She carried out numerous studies showing how self-organization and local-level management work to keep common resources viable. Her studies included both natural resources, such as forests, and artificial structures, for example police forces. Ostrom told Swedish television that she felt \"great surprise and appreciation\" and was \"in shock\" about being the first woman to win the prize. The pros and cons of big firms In his work, co-prizewinner Oliver Williamson, of University of California, Berkeley, examines why large corporations tend to arise - and why they do not - based on the cost and complexity of transactions, according to the Nobel committee. \"He has taught us to regard markets, firms, associations, agencies, and even households from the perspective of their contribution to the resolution of conflict,\" the jury said. Williamson authored 'The Economic Institutions of Capitalism' in 1975, a landmark text of the 'new institutional economics' movement that questioned the idea of firms as simple profit-making machines. Last but not least The Nobel prize for economics is the only Nobel award that was not created by the will of Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel in 1896. It was actually founded by the Swedish central bank, the Sverige Riksbank, to celebrate its tri-centenary a year earlier. It was awarded for the first time in 1969 under its official name: the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel. But although it was the last \"Nobel prize\" to be created and the last to be announced each year, the prize is not a poor relation in monetary terms. Winners of the awards for peace, literature, medicine, physiology, chemistry and physics all receive 10 million Swedish crowns (969,000 euros). A good year for women This year was a record year for women laureates. German-Romanian writer Herta Mueller won the Nobel Prize for Literature. Australian-American Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider of the United States were awarded the prize for medicine. And Ada Yonath of Israel was one of three scientists recognized for her work in chemistry. Americans more or less swept the board this year. Nine of the 11 laureates were US citizens. The most prominent of those was US President Barack Obama, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for his \"extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples.\" jg/AFP/dpa/Reuters Editor: Sam Edmonds",
        "generated_story": "The Nobel prize for economics has been handed out to the first woman to win the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences. Elinor Ostrom won the prize in economics in 1968. The prize was awarded to a Swedish economist who had worked for the Swedish central bank since the mid-19th century. She won it for her work in the field of economic economics, which she had written about in her book, The Economic Institutions of the United States (EISS), which was published in 1969. It was presented to her by Sveriges Riksbank, the country's largest bank, in memory of Alfred Nobel, who died at the age of 88 in a car accident in 1967. \"I am so honored to have won this prize,\" she said, adding that she was inspired by the work of Nobel laureate Oliver Williamson, a professor of economics at Indiana University in California, where she taught for more than a decade before she became a Nobel Peace Prize laureate in 1970. In the same year, she received the award for \"The Economic Institution of America,\" which is the most prestigious award in economic history. WASHINGTON, D.C. (AFP/dpa/Reuters Editor: Sam Edmonds) \"It's a great honor to receive this award, and it's an honor for me to be able to give it to someone who has worked so hard for so many years. I am very proud of what I have done for my country and the people who have helped me achieve my goals.\" The Nobel peace prize is awarded annually to one of Sweden's most influential economists, Elina Yonath. Nobel laureates have been honored for their contributions to economic and social development for over a century and a half, but in recent years, they have also been recognized for a number of other achievements, such as their work on the economy, social justice and human rights. This year's prize will be given to an economist from the University of California in Berkeley, Stanford, Indiana and Indiana universities, along with the American Academy of Social Sciences (AUST) in recognition of their efforts to improve the lives of people living in poverty and inequality in their own countries. A Nobel-prize-winning economist, Carol Greider, has won twice as many awards, including the best economist of all-time, Carl Friedrichs, as well as the second-most influential economist in American history, Nobel Laureate and Nobel winner, Olaf Nobel. He was born in Sweden in 1892 and died in Germany in 1945. His wife, Ada, was also a teacher at IU. They have two children, both of whom are American citizens. Both of them have a son who lives in Israel. Their son, Oliver, is also an American citizen and has a daughter who is a German-born American who works at a university in Berlin, Germany. If they don't get married, their children will have to go to school in America to get a degree. And they won't have the opportunity to study the economics of a country where they were born. That's not a problem for them, though, because they are not the only ones who want to live in an economic utopia. There's also the fact that they can't afford to pay a living wage. But they do have an education system that is free and free, so they're free to do so. So they've got a lot of free stuff to learn, too. What's more, there's the chance they'll have free money to spend on education, education and other things they need to know about the world, like how to make a decent living."

In a document on combating AIDS, the Commission said that as of 2007, around 2.2 million people carried the virus in the EU and nearby countries, an increase of 700,000 from 2001. According to Commission figures, around 730,000 of these live within the EU's 27 member states. France, Italy, Spain and Portugal have relatively high infection rates - ranging from 0.4 percent to 0.5 percent. In the Baltic country of Estonia, the infection rate stands at around 1.3 percent. In neighboring Ukraine, around 1.6 percent of the population has been diagnosed with HIV, while in Russia around 1.1 percent are HIV positive. The Commission warned that now was not the time for Europe to drop its guard on preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS, adding that in some neighboring countries the number of people carrying the virus had doubled. EU Health Commissioner Androulla Vassiliou said political momentum in the fight against HIV/AIDS needed to be maintained, adding that people must \"take responsibility for themselves and their partners by talking about and practicing safe sex and going for HIV testing.\" A cure for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has yet to be found more than a quarter century after it was brought to public attention. However, efficient treatments exist to slow the evolution of the virus. dfm/AFP Editor: Chuck Penfold",
        "generated_story": "One in three people living with HIV/AIDS in the EU and neighboring countries are unaware they are HIV-positive, the European Union's Health Commissioner has warned. The health commissioner, Androulla Vassiliou, told a news conference in Brussels on Monday that three out of four people who live with the virus have been unaware of their HIV status. \"We are not aware of the fact that we have HIV,\" she said, adding that \"we are aware that HIV is a very serious disease that affects the entire population of Europe.\" The European Commission, which oversees the health and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) program, said it was the first time it had been tested for HIV in Europe since the 1990s. It is the second time in five years that the disease has been found to be resistant to HIV and AIDS, according to a report by the Commission on Health and Human Development (HCRH). \"It is not a new disease,\" the commission said in a statement, referring to the HIV virus that causes AIDS and is spread through the blood and saliva of infected people. In addition, it said that more than half of all HIV cases are reported to have occurred in France, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Spain. France is one of only a handful of countries that have tested positive for HIV, and one in four of those countries has tested negative for it. Spain and Portugal are the other two countries with a high rate of HIV infection. Portugal has the highest number of cases, but it is also the only country with an HIV positive population. Italy has a low rate, while Spain has an average of 1.5 cases a year. And in Portugal, 1 in 3 people have had HIV. But the number is rising rapidly in other EU member states, as well as in Russia and Ukraine. On Monday, Germany's health Commissioner, Dr. Chuck Penfold, warned that it could take up to three years for people to recognize their status as HIV or AIDS-negative. He added that there was a \"very high risk\" of being infected by HIV, a disease which can spread to other people, such as children, elderly people and people with pre-existing medical conditions. Germany, for example, has reported an increase in HIV infections in its citizens since 2001, when it came to children and young people in their 20s and 30s who had never been infected before. Europe's highest-ranking health official, In an interview with DW, he said he was \"deeply concerned\" about the lack of awareness among the public about HIV patients, saying that many of them were unaware that they were infected. His comments came as a result of a series of phone calls to his office in Tallinn, Estonia, where he had just received a phone call from a woman who said she was unaware her status was being monitored by health officials. A spokesman for the government of Estonia said the country had also been asked to provide information on the status of its HIV test."

        "target": "Switzerland Calls on Private Security Firms for Euro 2008 In addition to enlisting foreign police during Euro 2008, Switzerland will also be bringing in private security personnel from Germany, reported a Swiss newspaper. \"We have to turn to about 500 private security personnel from Germany,\" Urs Stadler, spokesman for a security firm consortium told the Monday, May 26, edition of Swiss newspaper Tages Anzeiger. \"Most of them were already in operation during the World Cup two years ago, and have relevant experience,\" added Stadler from Prisec, a consortium made up of the companies Protectas and Securitas. The spokesman said more help was needed, but could not give exact numbers \"due to pending assignments.\" Recent soccer violence raises concern Swiss media has been questioning the security preparations for Euro 2008 after a spate of violence at recent games. In the latest incident, seats were ripped out and a goal post wrenched from the ground after St. Gallen faced the prospect of relegation following a 2-0 defeat to Bellinzona on May 20. St. Gallen was the third incident in a month that saw violent clashes with police who twice resorted to rubber bullets and tear gas. While Switzerland is seen as a low risk country in terms of hooliganism, violence has been on the increase in recent years and estimates claim there are around 400 hooligans and 600 sympathizers. Swiss Sports Minister Samuel Schmid said that hooliganism cannot be ruled out, reported German news agency DPA. But he expressed his belief that extra measures such as more policing, restrictions on alcohol -- which he has called \"a catalyst for violence\" -- and video surveillance will help keep trouble at bay. Private firms to boost European police The private security companies will be responsible for patrolling the stadiums and their surroundings, as well as the public viewing areas, team hotels and trainings areas. An international police force will manage the rest. Switzerland has committed some 31,200 police officers and soldiers. Another 1,700 police will be sent from Germany, which will have the authority to make arrests. France will offer the third largest contingent with 750 officers and Croatia, Poland, Sweden, Greece, Russia and Spain will also send reinforcements.",
        "generated_story": "Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Poland, Germany, and Spain have all agreed to help with security preparations for Euro 2008 in the Swiss Alps. Germany and France have agreed on a host of security measures for the tournament, including the use of drones and drones. The Swiss government has also announced plans to use drones to protect the country's sports teams. \"We are working closely with our German counterparts to ensure that we have the best possible security situation,\" German Foreign Minister Samuel Schmid said in a statement on Monday, adding that \"we are going to do everything we can to make sure that the security of our athletes is not compromised,\" he said. According to the German news agency DPA, the team will be based in St. Gallen, Switzerland, with the aim of protecting the sport from potential attacks. In addition, it will also be using drones, which are used to monitor the sports team's movements and to track the movements of the players. For example, a drone can be used as a means of monitoring the movement of players, but it is also a way of ensuring that they don't get caught up in their movements. This is the first time that a Swiss team has been allowed to play in an international competition without having to wear a helmet. That is, if they are able to keep their eyes on the ball and not be distracted by the fact that their equipment is being used, they will not have to worry about what is going on in other countries. It's not just Germany or Spain that are worried about the safety of their athletes, though. They are also aware that there is a risk of a terrorist attack in some countries, such as the Czech Republic and the United States, as well as in Spain and Italy. There are a number of countries that could be affected by a potential attack, according to German officials, who have said they have not yet decided whether to take part in this year's World Cup in Russia. If they do decide to participate, that is because they want to be part of an event that will take place at the end of June, when the host nation of Germany will host the final in Moscow, Russia, on May 20. At the same time, German media have reported that Germany is preparing for a possible attack on its own team, while France and Poland have also expressed concern about possible attacks on their sport team. However, there have been no reports of any such attacks so far. German sports journalists, however, have expressed their concern, saying that it would be \"a very difficult task\" for Germany to get involved in such a situation. Meanwhile, in Switzerland's case, security experts have warned that any attack could happen, even if it doesn't happen at all, because it could lead to an attack that would endanger the lives of thousands of Swiss sportsmen and their families. As a result, many of them have already fled to Germany in search of safety and security, where they fear for their own safety. But that's just the beginning of what will happen in Europe. On May 26, Swiss media published a report that said that German police had opened an investigation into the possible involvement of German security services. A spokesman for German prosecutors said the investigation was ongoing, citing a source familiar with German law enforcement agencies. Police are currently investigating the case."

        "target": "German Minister Urges Peace in Georgia's Separatist Regions German Foreign Minister Steinmeier has called for an end to the \"spiral of violence\" between the Georgian government in Tbilisi and its Russian-backed rebel regions and presented a three-stage plan to break the deadlock. Steinmeier issued the plea as he began a tour of the region to sponsor a new peace plan aimed at calming the simmering tensions over Georgia's separatist regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. \"This is my appeal to break out of the spiral of violence. A lack of dialogue is not an option for the future,\" he said after meeting with his Georgian counterpart Eka Tkeshelashvili. Steinmeier, who chairs the so-called Group of Friends of the United Nations' Secretary on Georgia, is proposing a three-phase peace plan based on a mutual declaration of non-violence and repatriation of about 25,000 ethnic Georgians expelled from Abkhazia in the 1990s. Negotiations over the status of the two rebel regions, which have enjoyed de facto autonomy since the end of a civil war in 1994, was reserved for the final phase of negotiations. Tkeshelashvili said, \"The plan has great potential for success,\" but added that the most difficult thing would be to convince Russia. Peace talks remain distant The threat of armed conflict in the region last month has given urgency to international pressure for renewed peace talks, but Tbilisi, Moscow and the Russian-backed regions remain far apart on the basic premises for restarting peace talks. Officials in Tbilisi oppose a treaty on the non-use of force without guarantees on the return of refugees and the withdrawal of Russian peacekeeping forces base in the region. Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was skeptical of peace efforts Thursday. \"Signing of a treaty on the return of Georgian refugees to Abkhazia is unreal now, because such a return requires a calm situation,\" Lavrov was quoted as saying by news agency RIA-Novosti. \"We think that signing a treaty on the non-use of force without any preconditions is an absolutely unavoidable first step,\" he added. Experts see little hope for Steinmeier's plan Analysts do not expect anything conclusive from Steinmeier's trip, pointing to intransigence on the part of the Abkhaz President Sergei Bagapsh, who said he would \"not consider the plan.\" \"We are not going to discuss Abkhazia's status with anyone. We are building an independent, democratic state,\" Bagapsh was quoted by Georgian news agencies as saying. Speaking to journalists ahead of the meetings Thursday, Steinmeier admitted: \"We don't have any illusions about simple answers, but we cannot stand by without acting on this conflict. That would be irresponsible.\" From Tbilisi, the German minister is to travel to the Black Sea city of Batumi for talks with Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili and then to Abkhazia on Friday before ending his three-day tour in Moscow. Most citizens of the breakaway republics have been issued Russian passports and over 2,500 Russian peacekeeping troops patrol the region under a UN ceasefire agreement. In opposition to Georgia's bid to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Russia moved to strengthen diplomatic ties with the breakaway regions sharply aggravating tensions with the Georgian leadership in recent months.",
        "generated_story": "A New Peace Plan for the Separatist Regions of Georgia, Abkhazia and South Ossetia A new peace plan for Georgia is being drafted by German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier. The new plan is expected to be unveiled in Tbilisi on Friday. It will be signed by the heads of state of the two regions, Eka Tkeshelashvili and Sergei Bagapsh, as well as the UN Secretary-General on the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the European Union (EU) Secretary General, Federica Mogherini. According to the report, the plan would be based on an agreement between Russia and Georgia in 1994 and 1994, when the former Soviet republic was annexed by Russia. \"It is the first step in the process of establishing a new state,\" the document said, adding that it would also include the creation of a \"state of trust\" for Abkazian people. In addition, it also included the establishment of an observer mission in Georgia to monitor the situation there. On Thursday, Russia's foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said that he was \"very pleased\" with the new deal, which was signed with Georgia's president, Vladimir Putin, on Thursday. However, he added that \"we are not ready to give up on Georgia.\" \"We are prepared to do everything we can to make it a better country,\" he said in an interview with state news agency RIA-Novosti. He also said he hoped that the deal would include \"a lot of cooperation and cooperation between Georgia and Russia,\" which he described as \"the most important part of our relationship with Russia.\" In the past, Georgian President Ilham Aliyev has been accused of being a traitor to his country, and of trying to use the country as a cover for his own crimes. But he has denied this, saying he is not aware of any evidence of such a crime. His comments came in response to a question from the Russian Foreign Ministry's spokesman Sergei Ryabikov, who said the Georgian president had been in contact with a number of Russian officials in recent weeks. Ria-News reported that Russia had also sent a delegation to Moscow to discuss the issue, but did not provide any details of what the meeting would entail. Russia, however, has said it was not interested in discussing the matter. Moscow has not yet responded to questions about whether the talks would take place in a way that would allow it to happen in any way. Instead, Moscow is likely to press ahead with its plans, according to Russian state-run news agencies, in order to prevent any further escalation of tensions between Moscow and Moscow. Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Moscow would not comment on any of these proposals. She said Russia would continue to cooperate with efforts to resolve the conflict, including through the use of diplomatic channels and other means."

        "target": "Bayern's Klinsmann Praises, Hoeness Attacks Hoffenheim The Bundesliga's two top teams don't play until Friday, but the mind games are already underway. Bayern's coach Juergen Klinsmann says Hoffenheim are legitimate contenders, but commercial manager Uli Hoeness disagrees. When the Bundesliga scheduled Bayern's home match against Hoffenheim in the league's unloved Friday night slot, they probably didn't imagine that it would turn out to be the match of the first half of the season. Indeed, few experts or fans thought that Hoffenheim, a first-division debutante located in a southern German village with 3,000 inhabitants, would give mighty Munich a run for its money. But it's the first week of December, and Hoffenheim top the table by three points. They also have a much better goal difference than their second-placed rivals -- and that has drawn praise from Bayern's coach, Juergen Klinsmann. \"I have the highest estimation of Hoffenheim because they've built the squad very ambitiously, rationally and with very good players,\" Klinsmann told DPA news agency. \"They can be proud of that.\" Klinsmann said he thought that the club could establish itself among the top three or four sides in Germany in the years to come and qualify for international competition next season. He also had words of praise for Hoffenheim's software billionaire patron, Dietmar Hopp, whose money has funded the club's ascent. \"There's nothing negative about it,\" Klinsmann said. \"He used to play for the club, is a soccer man through and through and helped the team get on its feet.\" Some fans have criticized Hopp and Hoffenheim for paying inflating salaries and luring talent away from other clubs instead of developing homegrown players. In fact, Hoffenheim's official salary budget is about average for the Bundesliga. Hoeness sounds his horn But while Bayern's coach was praising his opponents to the skies, Munich's commercial manager Uli Hoeness has been trying to play with their heads. On the heels of Bayern's convincing win over Leverkusen last weekend, Hoeness is back to taunting rivals. \"The performance we showed in the second half against Leverkusen will be enough against Hoffenheim,\" Hoeness told the German soccer magazine kicker. Hoeness also dropped a none-too-thinly-veiled hint that Hoffenheim's personnel expenditures were far higher than the officially released figures and scoffed at the idea that strategy would determine the outcome of Friday's match. \"Games are decided by the better players, not by tactics,\" Hoeness said. \"And of course, we've got better players than Hoffenheim.\" But that particular verbal attack may represent some wishful thinking of the manager's part. Hoffenheim coach Ralf Rangnick is one of only two current Bundesliga skippers with a winning record against Munich. Rangnick, whose team cruised past Bielefeld last weekend to keep Bayern three points back, reacted to Hoeness' remarks with a shrug. \"We're preparing for Munich exactly the same way we did against Bielefeld,\" Rangnick said. In any case, soccer fans in Germany know what they'll be doing Friday evening -- finding a bar with cable sports television to watch a top match that no one, before the start of the season, would have considered possible.",
        "generated_story": "Hoffenheim's Commercial Manager Reacts to the First Half of the Bundesliga Season HOFFENHE'S commercial manager Ralf Rangnick has opened up about the first half of this season's Bundesliga campaign. \"We are very happy with the way we have started the season. We have a lot of good things to do, and we are looking forward to a good start in the second half,\" said Raff Rangsnick, Hoffenheimer's commercial director. The Bundesliga's first-half is expected to be a busy one for the German club, which has been struggling to find its footing since the end of last season, but it is also expected that it will be an exciting one, too. After a disappointing start to last year's campaign, Hoeness has taken to social media to express his delight at the prospect of starting the new season on a positive note. He said he was \"very happy\" with his team-mates' attitude and that they had \"a lot to learn from the last few weeks.\" \"I am very pleased with how they have done so far,\" he said, adding that he would like to see the team improve on their form in December, when they face Bayern Munich and Bayer Leverkusen. But he also wants to make sure that the club's new coach, Dietmar Hopp, doesn't get too carried away in his new role as the head of marketing and sales. Ragsnick said that \"we are going to have to work very hard to get the best out of our players and our fans.\""

The move has been questioned by officials, with some saying it places the EU at-risk of taking sides in an internal dispute. The European Commission's decision to launch the rule of law procedure on Warsaw puts the EU's executive institution at-risk of taking sides, Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Konrad Szymanski told reporters in the European Parliament. \"I have the impression that the [European] Commission risks taking a role as a side in a political dispute inside Poland,\" Szymanski noted. On Wednesday, European Commission Vice President Frans Timmermans - a former Dutch foreign minister - announced the move, marking the first time the EU has used the mechanism. Timmermans said that the move was aimed at entering \"into a dialogue with the Polish authorities, to clarify the facts in an objective way and help find solutions if necessary.\" He added that the procedure is focused on seeking answers regarding the new right-wing Polish government's actions not to apply two judgments by the country's constitutional court, and the reasons behind the president and vice-president's terms were shortened. Preserving rule of law However, Poland's deputy foreign minister said that the European Commission was informed of the reasons behind the government's actions. \"We would insist that the questions are phrased precisely because we have provided much information to the Commission in recent days and we are not entirely clear as to what the Commission is still not clear about,\" Szymanski noted to reporters at the European Parliament. New media laws, giving the government the power to hire and fire senior figures at state broadcasters, were also called into question by Timmermans. The controversial legislation prompted mass pro-democracy protesters in the European country. \"The rule of law is one of the EU's fundamental values. Making sure the rule of law is preserved throughout the Union is a key part of the European Commission's responsibilities,\" Timmermans wrote on his official Facebook page. The Rule of Law Framework was created two years ago as a response to criticism that the 28-nation bloc had not adequately responded to possibly-authoritarian moves taken by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban during his tenure. ls/jil (Reuters, AFP, dpa)",

On Wednesday, the commission said it would not intervene in any way to prevent Poland from becoming a \"party state.\" The commission, which is responsible for the rules of procedure in EU member states, had called on the government of Poland to take legal action against the Polish government. It also called for an independent investigation into the matter, according to a statement from the German Foreign Ministry. In the past, it had said that Poland was not a party state, but rather a country governed by a democratically elected government led by Viktor Orban, who was elected Prime Minister of Hungary in 2007. However, in recent months, that position has been challenged in court by the right-wing populist party in parliament."

        "target": "Turkey, Greece seek NATO mission in Aegean, says German official Germany, Greece and Turkey will ask NATO to approve a maritime surveillance mission in the Aegean to combat illegal people smugglers. Greece had previously voiced reservations about the proposal. The proposed mission to be discussed at a NATO defense ministers meeting in Brussels on Thursday comes days after German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutolgu said they would raise the issue of refugees with the Alliance. According to a Reuters report citing a senior German official, initially reticent Greece has now given the green light for the operation, which could see NATO assets deployed in the Aegean in a mostly intelligence and reconnaissance role. Under the proposal, which would need to be approved by Alliance members, NATO maritime assets would provide information to national coastguards and the EU border agency Frontex to combat illegal smugglers using rickety boats to bring migrants to Europe. Turkey would then take back the refugees, as envisioned as part of a 3 billion-euro ($3.2 billion) EU-Turkey deal agreed to last year. According to German sources, the mission would not be similar to the NATO mission in the Mediterranean intercepting migrant boats making the dangerous run from Libya to Italy. However, NATO ships could intervene in emergency situations to save passengers. \"It is not NATO's remit to push back or stop refugee boats,\" the official told Reuters. The mission would use assets from the Alliance's standing naval group, a permanent reaction force deployed in the Mediterranean. The naval group's current flagship is the German combat support ship \"Bonn.\" Denmark has already said it would provide additional ships to the mission, according to the official. However, it is unclear whether NATO members will approve the mission which may fall outside the bounds of the Alliance's mandate. Complicating matters is a long-running maritime dispute between Greece and Turkey over sovereignty in the Aegean, where the two NATO members' jets regularly engage in dogfights. Turkey has taken in more than 2.5 million Syrian refugees, and is a major transit point for migrants from Asia and Africa. More than a million migrants and refugees reached Europe last year, many making the dangerous boat journey from Turkey to Greece by boat. So far this year, more than 340 have perished in the cold waters trying to reach Europe. cw/msh (AFP, dpa, Reuters)",
        "generated_story": "NATO's Standing Naval Group in the Aegean to combat illegal smugglers Frontex, the European Union's border agency, has been deployed to the Mediterranean Sea to fight illegal migrants. The NATO-led military alliance has deployed a naval ship to patrol the waters off the Turkish coast. It is the first such deployment in Europe since the end of the Syrian civil war in 2011, when Turkish President Ahmet Davutolgu ordered the deployment of an air force ship. \"We are going to do everything we can to protect our borders,\" he told reporters in Bonn, Germany, on Thursday. He added that the ship, which is based in southern Turkey, would be deployed in a few weeks, and that \"we will be able to monitor the flow of migrants and refugees into Europe.\" The ship's crew is expected to arrive at the port on Friday, according to German news agency dpa. German Prime Minister Angela Merkel said she was \"very pleased\" with the move, adding that it was a \"positive step\" for the alliance. Germany's defense ministry, however, said it had not yet decided whether to deploy the vessel, but it would take the necessary measures to ensure the safety of refugees and migrants, as well as the security of other EU member states, including Greece, Italy, Spain, Denmark and Italy. According to a statement from the German Defense Ministry, \"the ship is being deployed as part of a joint operation between the NATO and the EU forces.\" Germany and France have also deployed ships to search for migrants who are trying to reach Europe through Turkey. Turkey has also sent a ship out of its territorial waters to try and stop migrants from entering the country. In addition, it has sent ships out to help Syrian refugees who have fled to Europe in search of safety and protection. However, German defense minister Sigmar Gabriel said the ships were not meant to be used to carry out the mission, saying they were meant for humanitarian purposes only, not as a means of combating illegal migration. A German military spokesman said Germany was also sending troops to Turkey in response to reports that a Turkish ship was being used by smugglers to smuggle migrants across the border. Turkish officials said they had received information that Turkey was attempting to enter Europe via Turkey's southern port of Bursa, near the Greek island of Danube. They also said that Turkish ships had also been sent to Greece and Turkey to take in refugees from Syria, where they are being held by Turkish forces. But they did not provide any information on the situation in northern Syria. On Thursday, a German official told Reuters that they would not be allowed to speak to Turkish media about the operation, citing a lack of cooperation between Turkish and German officials. Berlin's Foreign Ministry said in an official statement that Ankara was working closely with Germany to find a way to resolve the issue. Ankara has denied the allegations, calling them \"basically a false narrative.\" \"The Turkish government is not a party to this,\" said German Foreign Minister Sigman Gabriel."

        "target": "Opinion: The pope's impossible mission in Mexico Pope Francis's trip to Mexico is a dangerous mission - a diplomatic as well as political balancing act, one that brings with it enormous expectations. Francis won't be able to meet them, says DW's Astrid Prange. Dead prisoners, disappearing students, refugees shot dead and murdered priests. Mexico has lived through one violent episode after the other. The mood in the nation is explosive. And now this: just a day before the pope is set to arrive, more than 50 people died in the largest prison revolt in the country's history. What meaning does the pope's presence hold on such an occasion? Only one thing is certain: Francis won't be able to resolve the problems of the world's second largest Catholic nation in just a five-day trip. The unrealistic demands placed on him are not something he can fill. Yet the pope carries with him an important message: you don't have to love your enemies but you do need to speak with them. And he's living the example himself by meeting with the Russian Orthodox Patriarch Kirill on a stopover in Cuba on his way to Mexico. Cuba all over again It's sensational! Bannings and mutual ex-communications are ancient history. Nearly a millennium after the split, the head of the Roman Catholic Church and the head of the Russian Orthodox Church are speaking to each other. It's not as if the two will become friends - their positions are far too different. Yet their centuries-old enmity feels out of place and in view of the massive worldwide persecution of Christians, almost unchristian. And both of these church leaders know this. In Mexico, efforts to stem the polarizing forces at play in society have not been successful. The extreme differences between rich and poor are dividing Mexican society. President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto has prioritized economic growth over dialogue with his critics - a group which includes students as well as teachers and union members who regularly protest against government policies. They demand an end to lawlessness and corruption. The presumed murder of 43 teaching students in Iguala in September 2014, a crime which remains unsolved, stands as a symbol of the lawlessness sweeping Mexico. The recent mutiny in a Monterrey jail serves as further proof of the country's shortcomings in regard to human rights and the rule of law. With a visit to Ciudad Juarez and the largest prison in Mexico, Francis will only make that deficiency more transparent. Even the pope of peace has enemies. The route he's chosen to take on his travels through the country has displeased the staunchly Catholic president. A meeting with the relatives of the Iguala victims is therefore hush-hush and participation in a holy mass remains secret. Considering the tense situation in the country, it's still possible that the pope's route will change once again. The church in the pillory Even within his own church, Francis has met with opposition. A meeting he requested with victims from the church's abuse scandal will not take place - a bitter disappointment for many former seminarians who were abused by Marcial Maciel, the founder of the Legion of Christ, and members of his order. It's just one example of how impunity continues even within the church itself. None of the perpetrators have yet to answer for their crimes in court. It appears as though the pope has accomplished more on the world stage than he has brought on reforms to the Vatican. Despite the revolutionary coming together of Cuba and the US and the revolutionary meeting with Patriarch Kirill, the revolution in Rome has yet to materialize. Do you have something to say? Add your comments below. The thread to this editorial closes in 24 hours.",
        "generated_story": "Pope's impossible mission in Mexico Pope Francis has failed to reach Mexico's capital, the capital of the Roman Catholic Church. The pope's difficult mission to Mexico has left the country in a state of disarray. President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto and his wife, Kirill, have been at the Vatican for more than a year and a half, but they have not been able to make it to the Holy See in time for the upcoming Holy Week, which is to be held in Rome on Sunday. \"We are not going to give up on this mission,\" the pontiff said in an interview with DW. He added that he was \"very happy\" with the results of his visit, adding that it was the first time he had visited Mexico since the end of World War II, when he visited his hometown of Iguala, where he met with Pope Benedict XVI and Pope John Paul II in September 2014. Since then, he has traveled to several other Latin American countries, including Cuba, Cuba and Cuba. In Mexico, his first stop was in Ciudad Juarez, a city of 1.5 million people. But he also visited Cuba several times in the past two years, and in Cuba twice in 2014 and again in 2015. His visit to Cuba was also a success, as well as the visit of a Russian Orthodox priest, Marcial Maciel, who had been visiting Mexico for several years. Both of these visits, however, were not successful. On the one hand, they were very difficult to get to and from, while on the other, it is possible to travel to other parts of Mexico without having to pay a visit from the Pope. However, there is no way to know for sure that the pope will reach the Mexican capital without a trip to Rome. That is, until he gets there. And that is when the question of whether he will be allowed to do so will come up. If he does decide to go, then he must decide whether or not he wants to stay there as long as he can. For now, though, this is the only way he knows how to handle the situation. It is not an easy task for a pope to visit a country with such a long history of violence and poverty. There is a lot of pressure on him, of course, because he doesn't want to spend his time in his own country. At the same time, that pressure is building on his country's political leadership. This is why he is trying so hard to convince the people to come to his aid, even if it means risking their own lives and the lives of their loved ones. After all, if he's not there, what is he really doing? He's trying to help the poor in this country? \"I'm not giving up,\" he said. 'It's a good thing that I'm here because I don't know what I can do for them. I think that's the best thing for my country.\" He also said he would like to see the government of Cuba to have a chance to \"do something for us.\" The Vatican has been working on a plan to improve relations between the two countries for some time and that would be a great step forward for both of them, given the current political and economic situation in Latin America. So far, so good, in fact. We are hopeful that this will not be the case for all of us. Just ask Vladimir Putin, whose country is currently suffering from a severe economic crisis, for example. Putin has repeatedly called for an end to economic sanctions against the United States and other countries that are causing economic and social problems. Russia, too, has called on Mexico to step up its efforts to protect its citizens."

Scalia was visiting Texas for a hunting trip, and his body was discovered after he failed to appear for breakfast in the resort where he was staying. US President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama extended \"their deepest condolences to Justice Scalia's family,\" White House deputy spokesman Eric Schultz said. Texas Governor Greg Abbott described the conservative justice as a \"man of God, a patriot and an unwavering defender of the written Constitution and the rule of law.\" \"He was the solid rock who turned away so many attempts to depart from and distort the Constitution. His fierce loyalty to the Constitution set an unmatched example, not just for judges and lawyers, but for all Americans,\" Abbot said. Battle for the empty seat His passing is likely to open a new political front between President Barack Obama and the Republican Party, as Scalia's replacement could shift the composition of the court towards a more liberal persuasion. Several Republican lawmakers have already urged Obama to leave the decision to the next president who will be voted in later this year. \"The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court justice,\" Senate Republican majority leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement, referring to the upcoming November general election. \"Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president,\" McConnell concluded. President Obama, however, said he would fulfill his constitutional duty and nominate Scalia's successor \"in due time.\" \"These are responsibilities I take seriously, and so should everyone. They are bigger than any one party,\" he said. Decades of controversy Scalia joined the Supreme Court in 1986, becoming the first Italian-American to serve in the top judicial body. He was nominated by US President Ronald Reagan. Throughout his long carrier, Scalia voted in favor of privacy and protecting defendants' rights, but also against legalizing abortion, same-sex marriage and gun control. He also drew public attention for his theatrical flair and sharpness of tongue, as well as his alleged unwillingness to compromise. In June last year, the nine-person Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage with a five-to-four vote. Scalia, who was in the minority, commented he would \"hide my head in a bag\" if his own name were associated with the decision. He also said that the majority opinion was \"couched in a style that is as pretentious as its content is egotistic.\" dj/jm (AP, Reuters, AFP, dpa)",
        "generated_story": "The death of Justice Antonin Scalia in his sleep in Texas AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- The US Supreme Court on Saturday ruled that President Barack Obama's nominee to the US Court of Appeals for the United States' highest court should be allowed to stay on the bench. The conservative justices of the high court have been in a state of mourning for more than a year. President Obama has been mourning the loss of a conservative jurist who was the first justice to be confirmed by the U.S. Senate by a unanimous vote of both houses of Congress. In his final days in office, Scalia died at the age of 85. He had been serving as a federal appeals court judge from 1986 to 1986, when he was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison for his role in the death. Scalia's death came just days after his wife, Michelle, died of cancer. His body was found at a hospital in Houston, the state capital of Texas. It was not immediately clear whether he had died from a heart attack or a stroke, but it is believed that he suffered from the effects of alcohol and drug abuse. \"It's a sad day for our country,\" said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) \"We're going to have to do something about this,\" McConnell said in an interview with the Dallas Morning News. McConnell, a Republican, said he would not rule out the possibility of overturning the lower court's decision on whether to uphold the Constitution. Republican Senator Greg Abbott (D-Texas) echoed McConnell's sentiments, saying the justices' decision was \"a very good one.\" \"I think it's the right decision,\" Abbott said, adding that it was a \"very good decision\" to overturn the constitution, which was written by President Ronald Reagan in 1986. But he added that the decision would have no impact on his party's prospects in November's midterm elections. Democrats, meanwhile, have vowed to continue to push for a constitutional amendment that would make it easier for conservative judges to reach their own decisions. Republicans, however, are not ready to give up the fight. They want to make sure that they have the votes to pass a new constitution that will protect the rule of law and the rights of all Americans to live and work without fear of being accused of treason. That would be a huge step forward for their party, he said. On Saturday, Abbott, who is running for re-election next year, called on McConnell to step down from his post as Senate majority leader to take over the Senate seat vacated by Republican John McCain. Abbott and McConnell have both said they will continue their efforts to repeal the constitutional amendments that were passed by their respective chambers of state legislatures in 2006. Both have said the amendments will be voted on by both chambers, and they are expected to become law by mid-year. If they do not, they say they won't be able to implement the changes that McConnell has promised. And they're not sure whether they'll be implemented until after the November elections, as the Republican-controlled US Senate has already passed a law that makes it impossible for conservatives to get a majority of seats in Congress to form a minority government.

The 53-year-old will be leading Germany's second biggest lender. After successfully weathering the Great Recession, Commerzbank's board of directors appears to want to signal a continuation in its growth trend with Martin Zielke's appointment as the new CEO as of May 1. Outgoing head Martin Blessing announced last year he would not renew his contract. Zielke had previously been put in charge of implementing reforms in the company's private banking sector following the recession. His restructuring measures attracted 800,000 new customers to the bank and changed the image of the 146-year-old financial institution. The 53-year-old has an illustrious career across several German financial institutions to look back on, having started at the teller of a local branch in 1983. Zielke's crowning achievement The beleaguered German financial institution recorded a profit of more than a billion euros (more than $1.1 billion) last year. It was the first time in five years that Commerzbank had made such profitable gains, which it said would translate into paid dividends for shareholders. A good portion of the yields were achieved by a restructuring and expansion drive of Commerzbank's private banking arm under Zielke's leadership. However, some of that money will go to the German government, as it had to step in and rescue the bank in 2009 to the tune of 18 billion euros ($25 billion at the time) by chiefly acquiring more than 15 percent of the shares, effectively nationalizing part of Commerzbank's operations. ss/jlw (dpa, Reuters)",
        "generated_story": "Martin Zielke to be Commerzbank's next CEO The German bank's new chief executive is set to take over as CEO on May 1, the company's board of directors has announced. Martin Blessing will be the first CEO in the country's history to step down from his post as Commersbank's CEO. He will take the helm in a year's time, according to a statement from the board, which also said he would be stepping down at the end of the year. \"We are very happy with Martin's appointment,\" the statement said, adding that he was \"very pleased with the way he has been able to turn around the business and the direction he is taking it in.\" The board also announced the appointment of a new head of financial services. The new CEO will have the responsibility of overseeing the financial sector for the next five years, it said. It added that the CEO would also be responsible for managing the German economy. In his first year as chief financial officer, Martin had been in charge since 1983, when he took over the reins from Martin, who had taken over in 1983. Since then, he's managed the bank for more than a decade, and has overseen a number of mergers and acquisitions, including the purchase of several German banks. His first job, however, was to run the firm for three years until he stepped down in 2009. That was the last year he held the position, after which he became CEO from 1983 to 1985. Now he'll be looking to expand his role to include the role of chief operating officer. This will give him the opportunity to make a significant contribution to the economic recovery in Germany, as well as in other countries, such as the United States, France, Italy, Spain and Spain. Zilke will also take on the task of taking over a company that has suffered from a severe financial crisis since the late 1980s and early 1990s. But he won't have to do it alone, because he also has the experience of being a successful businessman in his own right. On the other hand, his experience in banking and finance has not been as good as that of his predecessor. For example, in 1985 he oversaw the creation of over 18 billion euros of bank deposits, while in 1986 he managed to raise $1.1 billion in bank loans. At the same time he inherited a bank that was struggling to pay off its debts and was unable to keep up with rising interest rates and a falling stock market. And he had to find a way to stay on top of that, too, despite the fact that it was a difficult time for him to get the job done. After all, there's a lot of money to spend. So he can't be too hard on himself and his team, especially when it comes to finding the right people to help him get through the tough times. There's also the issue of how to deal with financial crises. What is the best way of dealing with these crises? How do you decide which companies to invest in? What can you do? Do you have a good idea of what the future holds for you?"

        "target": "A quarter of deaths caused by environmental degradation, says UN A new United Nations report warns that pollution and global warming are causing millions more deaths than conflicts. The UN's environment agency has called for an urgent roll-back on harmful substances and fossil fuels. In its report \"Healthy Environment, Health People,\" the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), the World Health Organization and several other environment organizations said that, in 2012, an estimated 12.6 million deaths were attributable to deteriorating environment conditions. The largest numbers of deaths took place in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific regions, followed by sub-Saharan Africa, where around a quarter of deaths were likely caused byair pollution, chemicals, climate change and a lack of access to sanitation. \"By depleting the ecological infrastructure of our planet and increasing our pollution footprint, we incur an ever-growing cost in terms of human health and well-being,\" said UNEP Executive Director Achim Steiner. He added that humanity's life support systems had been compromised by globalization and powerful economic interests. The report was released during UN climate talks in the German city of Bonn which are drawing up rules pertaining to the Paris agreement, which seeks to lower carbon emissions. The document suggested that several drivers were responsible for the threat to human health, including ecosystem disruption, climate change, inequality, unhealthy and wasteful lifestyles, along with unsustainable consumption and production. Worsening effects UNEP estimated that an extra 250,000 deaths could occur each year between 2030 and 2050 as a result of climate change, leading to malnutrition, malaria, diarrhea and heat stress. Between them air pollution and a lack of access to clean water and sanitation cause almost 8 million premature deaths each year. Environmental impacts are responsible for the deaths of more than one quarter of all children under the age of five, the report states. UNEP called for governments to act to remove harmful substances from working environments, reduce the use of carbon fuels and rely instead on renewable energy, and change lifestyles to allow a more sustainable use of the world's resources. The report also called for a bigger investment to protect the planet's natural ecosystem. UNEP predicted a further increase in emerging zoonotic diseases (spread between animals and humans), and called on developing countries, in particular, to prioritize prevention methods. \"Never before have so many animals been kept by so many people - and never before have so many opportunities existed for pathogens to pass through the biophysical environment and wild animals to livestock and people,\" the report warned.",
        "generated_story": "A quarter of deaths due to environmental degradation in the Western Pacific have been linked to climate change, UNEP says. The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that the number of people who die from environmental pollution is at a record high. According to the WHO, more than half of the world's deaths are caused by human-caused greenhouse gas emissions (GHG emissions). The WHO said in a report released on Thursday that \"the world is facing a crisis of health and well-being\" as a result of global warming. \"We are faced with a situation where we have to deal with the consequences of our actions,\" said WHO Executive Director Achim Steiner. He said that by 2030, \"we will be able to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases that are released into the atmosphere.\" He added that it was \"unacceptable\" for people to live in an environment that is so polluted that they can't even breathe. In 2012, the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) published its annual report on the global health crisis. It found that nearly half the deaths attributed to pollution were caused to people living in countries with high levels of CO2 emissions. This was the first time that a WHO report had been published, and it is the second time since the Paris agreement was signed in 2012 that people have died from the effects of climate-related pollution. WHO's Environment Programme (EPP) says that in addition to human health, there are other causes of pollution, including the spread of diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis and tuberculosis, which can lead to premature death and premature birth. World health officials say that about one-quarter of all deaths from pollution are attributable to humans. They say this is because people are not aware of how much pollution they are contributing to their health. And it's because of this, they say, that many people do not have access to clean drinking water and sanitation facilities in their homes. That's the main reason for the increase in deaths, according to WHO. But it also means that more people die every year, as well as from diseases like cancer, AIDS and HIV-AIDS. What's more, most of these deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa, where there is a high level of air pollution and the risk of respiratory diseases and other health problems. There is also a risk that some people will die because they don't have enough food or water to feed their families, says the report. Experts warn that this could be the case for many countries, especially in developing countries like Southeast Asia, Africa and Asia. For example, China, South Asia and South Africa are the most polluted countries in Europe, with over a third of their population living on a diet of fish and fish-borne diseases. These countries are also the poorest in Africa. So, in order to protect the environment, WHO is calling on governments to take action to tackle the problem, it recommends that governments take steps to ensure that all countries have the resources they need to do their part to mitigate the impact of human pollution on their environment. However, this doesn't necessarily mean that countries will follow through with their pledges to cut emissions, but it does mean they won't do anything to stop the pollution from reaching their own people. At the same time, many of those who have already died are still suffering from severe health effects from climate impacts, particularly from exposure to toxic chemicals, like mercury, arsenic and PCBs. Some of them, however, are already dying from heat and dust from contaminated water."

        "target": "Opinion: Yet another crisis for Merkel A summery turquoise blazer and fresh makeup could not hide the fact that Angela Merkel was \"not amused.\" Now she is needed as a champion in the fight against populist forces, DW's Kay-Alexander Scholz writes. Britain-EU divorce proceedings will probably last about two years. Until then, the status quo must be maintained, German Chancellor Angela Merkel emphasized in her press statement. If she is no longer chancellor after the upcoming parliamentary elections in 2017, then others will have to live with the consequences of Brexit. But that is not what she is actually thinking. It is not coincidental that foreign ministers and government leaders are visiting Berlin in the coming days. They want to discuss how things will continue. Berlin, under Merkel's chancellorship, has become a center of power outside of Brussels. Difficult international politics The Brexit decision has disrupted Europe's equilibrium. Germany has lost an important ally on European issues related to economic growth and budgetary discipline. Now, France presumably will be the next to raise its voice against Maastricht Treaty criteria. If the Netherlands and Denmark also decide to leave the EU, Germany will become isolated, as Eastern Europe is not as tight with Germany as it once was. Poland now plays a key role for the Balkan nations and the Visegrad Group (Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic and Slovakia). And Poland is still annoyed about Merkel's refugee policy. What about Germany's populists? They're giddy with glee as they feel that their anti-establishment policies have been validated. They are teaching potential AfD (Alternative for Germany) voters a lesson: \"Here, have a look: it's possible. There is always an alternative. Vote for us!\" Those are exactly the words that protest voters want to hear. Germany's AfD has forged ties with other right-wing parties in Vienna, Paris, The Hague and London. They are all pursuing a \"European\" plan to gain power. The recent Austrian presidential election was significant, as the populist candidate lost by a very narrow margin; in fact, the final election results are still undecided as they are being contested. The Brexit vote was also triggered by populist powers. Domestically difficult Many populists believe that the stronger populism becomes - no matter where - the more advantages there would be for individual parties of their persuasion. Many would also like to see Donald Trump as US president. That is how AfD may become even stronger in Germany, which also means that political majorities would fluctuate even more. Will there be enough seats after the next election for a Christian Democrat and Green coalition, or will yet another grand coalition made up of Christian Democrats and Social Democrats be formed? Can Angela Merkel change course? Can she counter the trend with a new political model in Europe and Germany? Or do we stand on the edge of a new era, a \"political revolution,\" as the AfD calls it? Until now, Europe has survived attacks on its currency (euro crisis), the principle of peaceful coexistence (Crimea crisis) and its open borders policy (refugee crisis). Merkel deserves credit for defending these values, despite mistakes that have been made along the way. The outcome of the Brexit crisis is, however, still open. Have something to say? Add your comments below.",
        "generated_story": "AfD and the Brexit Crisis Alternative for Germany ( AfD) is a political party that aims to bring about a change in Europe. It is an anti-immigrant party, which is opposed to the European Union. The party's leader, Angela Merkel, has called for a referendum on the EU's membership in the bloc. \"We are not going to allow it to happen,\" she told DW in an interview published on Monday. She also said that she would not allow the US to take part in a vote on whether or not to recognize the new EU member state as a member of the Union of Europe (UEFA). \"If we do, we will not be able to do that,\" Merkel said, adding that it would be \"very difficult\" for the German government to accept the result. But she added that the party would continue to fight for an EU membership that would allow Germany to remain part of a single EU. In the end, Merkel and her conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) will have to work together to make sure that Europe's future is secure, she said. Germany's Social Democrats, the largest party in parliament, have also called on Merkel to step down as Chancellor of Germany, who has been in office for more than a year. Merkel has said she wants to stay in power, but she is not ready to give up her position as head of state. And she has not ruled out the possibility that Germany could be left without a European parliament. Her party is currently in coalition with the Green Party (SPD). The Greens, a Christian Democrat, are also in opposition to Merkel. They have said they will work with her to form a coalition government, and that they would support her in any way she chooses. However, they do not want to be the only party to oppose the current US president, Donald Trump, or any other European leader. For now, though, it is the Greens who are the most likely candidate to win the next election in Germany in 2017. Meanwhile, other parties, including the Social Democratic Party, will also be pushing for changes to EU rules on immigration and refugees. On the other hand, there is no doubt that there will be a lot of pressure from the left and right on Europe, as well as from within the United States. There is also the fact that many of Merkel's party members have expressed concern about the future of European integration. Some of them, however, believe that this is unlikely to change at all. After all, Germany has a long way to go in order to achieve its goal of making Europe a more open and open place for people to live and work in. That is, if they are willing to cooperate with each other. So far, so good. If they don't, that is what we are hoping for, because we have a very good chance of success. We are hopeful that we can make it happen. What we hope for is that people will come to a consensus on how to deal with this. This is one of those things that will make the world a better place. I think it's a good place to start. DW's Kay-Alexander Scholz reports from Berlin, Berlin and Vienna.

The base hosts Air Force One, used by President Obama. An active shooter exercise at Joint Base Andrews was mistaken for a real shooting situation on Thursday morning, triggering a lockdown at the military base that houses the president's aircraft. Joint Base Andrews outside Washington, D.C., issued a \"shelter in place\" order after an active shooter incident was reported at the Malcolm Grow Medical Facility at approximately 9 am local time. The base said on Twitter that there was an active shooter exercise scheduled, but a real active shooter situation was reported. It later cleared the facility. The lockdown delayed the travel of Vice President Joe Biden, who was scheduled to fly to Ohio for a campaign event. The Joint Base Andrews is located in Camp Springs, Maryland, just outside the US capital. The base serves as the home of Air Force One, the US president's aircraft, and is used by other senior government officials.",
        "generated_story": "Lockdown lifted after active shooter incident at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland US President Barack Obama has lifted a lockdown at the US military base near Washington, D.C. The lockdown was lifted on Thursday after an active-shooter incident that left at least one person dead and several others injured. Officials said the incident took place near the Malcolm Grow Medical Facility in Camp Springs, Maryland, where the facility is located. Police said they were searching for the suspect, who is believed to be in his 30s. \"We have no suspects at this time,\" President Obama said in a statement. He also said he was not aware of any active shooters in the area, adding that he had been briefed on the situation by the Pentagon and that there was no threat to the general public. Obama, however, did not immediately respond to questions about the lockdown, which he said was being lifted by law enforcement officials. According to a US official, no one was injured in Thursday's incident, but that is not the case at all. There were no immediate reports of injuries, and no arrests have been made in connection with the shooting, the official said. However, it is understood that the man who opened fire was armed with a rifle and was carrying a handgun. It is unclear how many people were injured and whether the shooter was able to flee the scene. A spokesman for Obama's office, Joe Biden, said it was unclear what prompted the decision to lock down the base. In the past, Obama had called for an orderly evacuation of all military personnel, including military officers, as well as civilians, to ensure the safety of civilians and the security of the military. On Thursday, he also called on all US citizens to stay away from the site, saying he would not allow anyone to enter the building without their consent. This is the first time that a military facility has been shut down by a government agency since the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001, when President George W. Bush was still in office. That prompted Obama to call for a special meeting of his cabinet to discuss the matter. But he has yet to take part in that meeting, according to his spokesman, John Kirby. Kirby said on Twitter that \"the president is in no position to comment on this incident.\" \"The president will not be allowed to speak about it,\" said Kirby, referring to an incident in which a man was shot and killed by an Air Force One helicopter in 2009. Vice President Biden said Thursday that Obama was \"not in any way responsible for any of these incidents.\" Obama is expected to meet with Biden on Friday, a day after he took office as vice president in January. Biden has said that if the president were to step down from his post as US president, \"I would be very surprised if he does not resign immediately.\" The president has not yet commented on whether he will be stepping down, Kirby added, calling it an act of political cowardice and a \"outrageous act\". \"This is a very sad day for all of us,\" Biden told reporters in an interview with The Washington Post. ''I think it's a shame that we have to go through this again and again. I think we need to do something about this,\" he added. 'It's very unfortunate that this kind of thing is happening in our country and we don't want it to happen again in this day and age. We have a lot of people who are suffering from mental health issues and this is just another example of what we are going through right now.\" He added: \"There is no reason for us to think this will ever happen in America again, because we will never be the same again.\""

        "target": "Rethinking the term 'honor killing' The murder of 28-year-old Samia Shahid comes less than two weeks after Qandeel Baloch was killed by her brother. The media was quick to report them as \"honor killings.\" We have to rethink that term, writes Gouri Sharma. When news broke that Samia Shahid, a British-Pakistani woman, had been found dead while visiting relatives in Pakistan at the end of July, mainstream media outlets were quick to report it as an honor killing. It was the second time in two weeks that the media had reported a killing of a woman this way - the first being the murder of Pakistani social media star Qandeel Baloch. There are strong similarities between the cases. Both were murdered in places where they would have felt they were at their safest - in their family homes. It's likely they knew their killers - in Baloch's case, her brother has admitted to strangling her, and Shahid's father and cousin have already been questioned. And as more reports emerge about Shahid's death, it's clear that both were killed because they didn't behave in a way deemed acceptable in a conservative, patriarchal society. 'Deeply offensive' term The debate around terminology in \"honor killings\" isn't new, and after Baloch's murder there were members of the media - such as ABC Australia journalist Juanita Phillips - who decided against using the term, calling it \"deeply offensive\" and referring to it as a \"family killing\" instead. And there are outlets, like the Guardian, that already use inverted commas with the word honor. But some commentators argue that more needs to happen if media consumers are to gain a better understanding of the problem. \"I think an important step for the media would be to refuse to give weight to the term 'honor crimes,'\" said UK-based freelance journalist Shehnaz Khan. \"While it is imperative to highlight that these crimes and murders stem from the roots of misogyny and therefore a false sense of 'honor,' there is absolutely nothing but'shame' within them, as murder is nothing but dishonorable.\" \"The word 'honor' can sometimes carry an almost positive connotation that we are inclined to automatically accept just because it's not happening to us, when the reality is, this a huge problem affecting thousands of girls and women across the world,\" she added. Naming the issue But this isn't a view shared by all journalists. Ruby Hamad, a writer at Australia's Daily Life newspaper, said that the first step in dealing with the issue is naming it. \"There are some deeply patriarchal societies that still limit women's freedom according to old tribal concepts of honor, where, unfairly, the behavior of women reflect on their entire family,\" Hamad said. \"By naming these 'honor killings,' we are acknowledging the role that this misogynistic concept of honor plays, not only in the murders themselves but in these entire societies, and how it entraps both men and women.\" Through the eyes of the perpetrator? There are other issues with the term though. Some have argued that by framing it as such, media outlets are showing the crime through the eyes of the perpetrator - and not through the victim - as they should. And with such cases regularly hitting the headlines, framing is important. The United Nations estimates that around 5,000 women - predominantly from Asia and the Middle East - are killed annually in honor-related crimes, a figure that women's advocacy groups say is closer to 20,000 worldwide. This raises an important cultural element for the media to consider - how far does the term play into cultural stereotypes? \"When honor is considered the most important thing in life, then all family members become expendable,\" Hamad said. \"The collective outweighs the rights of the individual. Does this feed into cultural stereotypes? Perhaps. But that doesn't mean we should pretend that this cultural context isn't there.\" Looking for answers - and alternatives There have been many alternatives put forward by women's advocacy groups, including hate crime, misogynistic murder, femicide and shame killings. But which one should we pick? Al Jazeera for one has decided which one they won't use. \"We are always updating our style guidelines to convey a deeper and more authentic understanding of world affairs. Recent events in Pakistan ignited a healthy debate in Al Jazeera on the term 'honor killings' in particular. Our editors are currently studying alternatives to the term, but'misogynistic murder' is not one of them,\" said an Al Jazeera spokesperson. Terminology in the media matters, and for murders as complex as these, it's the media's responsibility to find a name that better fits the crime. Only then will it become easier to work towards a solution.",
        "generated_story": "Rethinking Honor Killings: A Cultural Perspective Rethinking Honor Kills: An Ethical Perspective A cultural perspective on the death penalty in Pakistan has been published in a new book. The book is titled \"The Ethic Perspective\" and is based on a study by journalist Samia Shahid and journalist Gouri Sharma. In the book, the author explores the issue of honor killings in the Middle East and Asia. Shehnaz Khan, who was killed by a Pakistani soldier in July, is one of the first to speak out against the killing of a British journalist. Her death sparked a debate in Australia and the United Nations (UN) about the right to free expression of human rights. According to the report, \"Honesty is the most important thing that can be done to change the way we treat people's lives.\" The report also examines the role of social media stars such as Ruby Hamad, Sami Shahidi, and Yannick Khan as well as the impact of their work on society. \"I think it's important that we take a look at how people are treated in our society,\" she told the Guardian in an interview published on July 24, adding that she was \"very proud\" of her work as a journalist and that her death was a \"victory for all of us.\" \"It's a tragedy that so many people have been killed in this country for so long. I think that's why we need to do something about it. We have to make sure that the perpetrators of these killings are held to account,\" said Juanita Phillips, co-editor of Daily Life, a daily newspaper published by the UK's Guardian newspaper. 'We don't want them to be glorified,' she added, referring to \"the fact that they are glorifying the murder of innocent people.\" She added that \"it's not just the victims who are killed, but the families of those who were killed. It's also the people who have suffered from the trauma of being killed.\" In a recent interview with The Guardian, she said: \"This is a very sad day for our country, because we have lost so much of our culture and our values.\" Read more: 'I'm not a victim of honour killings' The case of Qandeel Baloch was the subject of an international investigation, which led to an investigation into the deaths of thousands of people in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Pakistan, Iran, Libya, Lebanon and other countries in recent years. But it was also a case in point that it wasn't just a murder that had been committed by people of different ethnicities. There were also cases in which people were murdered by their own families. This was not the case with the British, for example, when a man was shot to death by his own family. That's what happened to her and her mother. And that is why I'm writing this book because I want to share it with you. You can read more about that here. If you're reading this, you can find out what I mean by \"honesty,\" which is how I saw it in my own life. What I am trying to say to you is that I have a lot of respect for my mother, my father and my sister. How did I get to know her so well? What did she do in her life? I can tell you I was very proud of what she did for me, as I've done for many of my friends and family, including my brother and sister-in-law. My father was an Afghan-Pakistani journalist who worked for a long time for Al Jazeera. He died of natural causes in his home country of Pakistan in 2006, after being shot by an unknown assailant. Now, he is alive and well and has returned to his hometown of Karachi, where he lives with his wife and two young children. His death is being investigated as an act of revenge for his father's murder."

        "target": "A Brief History of the Seaside Holiday These days, millions take seaside holidays for granted as one of life's pleasures. But 200 years ago, a dip in the sea was more a test of courage. Hardly anyone could swim. As late as the 18th century, many Europeans still thought of the sea as the realm of Satan: storm-tossed and inhabited by terrifying monsters. \"Unlike the mountains, the coasts were terra incognita as a holiday spot,\" says Manfred B\u00e4tje, director of the Bade-Museum on the North Sea island of Norderney. Anyone who set foot in the water was \"stepping into the unknown\". Brighton showed the way That only began to change after the British aristocracy discovered the healing power of salt water. As early as 1780, Brighton, England's biggest and oldest seaside resort, was a bustling spa. Philosopher and physicist Georg Christoph Lichtenberg (1742-1799) of G\u00f6ttingen gave Germans the starting signal with his 1793 essay \"Why doesn't Germany have any large public seaside resorts?\" In it, he called for the creation of a resort in Cuxhaven on the North Sea. He received support from the most notable German physician of the time, the Prussian king's court physician, Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland. But things turned out somewhat differently. Germany's first seaside resort was indeed built in September, 1793, but in Heiligendamm on the Baltic Sea. Four years later, permission was granted for construction of Germany's first resort on the North Sea, on Norderney. \"For the first bathing season on July and August of 1800, only around 250 guests turned up. Now, the nearly 6000 residents host a good 530,000 bathers annually, plus around 230,000 day-trippers,\" B\u00e4tje reels off the figures. Romanticist inspiration In the 19th century, the landscapes of Caspar David Friedrich, such as his famous Chalk Cliffs on R\u00fcgen (1818), gave seaside holidays added impetus. From then on, the sea was no longer a voracious beast. From the shore, the cultivated, modern European contemplated the vast melancholy of the deep. \"The calm sea became an embodiment of unspecified yearning, the waves an expression of vitality and dynamism,\" soliloquizes museum director B\u00e4tje. But the journey to the sea long remained an arduous, time-consuming one. It took the mail coach a good thirty hours to cover the distance from Hamburg to the North Frisian town of Aurich over bumpy, muddy roads. The express cab from Bremen only took about 16 hours to reach the East Frisian town of Norden - including six changes of horses along the way. \"It wasn't comfortable,\" explains B\u00e4tje. Not until the introduction of seaside tourist steamers out of Hamburg and Bremen to the islands and the expansion of the railways did the journey become easier. Strict bathing rules At first, it was primarily the well-to-do bourgeois and nobility who were able to afford a seaside holiday. Victorian-era society is known for its extreme prudishness, and the beach was not exempt. Bathing machines were essentially changing cabins on wheels that could be rolled into the surf. The sexes were kept strictly separated. Wet swimsuits could not be allowed to cling, thus revealing the body's contours. Women sported baggy flannel garments with bloomers underneath that swiftly became waterlogged to where the bather was risking her life. Hardly anyone really knew how to swim anyway. \"Most bathers wouldn't stay in the water any more than two minutes, often just seconds at a time. The English had a rule: 'Three dips and out',\" quips archivist Manfred B\u00e4tje, whose Bade-Museum is housed in a building for a former wave pool, just a few steps from Norderney's Weststrand, where, during the summer months, vacationers sunbathe in wicker beach chairs and on blankets, cooled by a salty sea breeze. Sunbathing first came in style early in the 20th century, and the first true swimsuits were produced in the United States. \"Starting in 1919, today's bathing culture gradually began to take shape,\" B\u00e4tje looks back. At the same time, ideals of beauty were in flux - such as the attitude towards tan skin, which had long been regarded as a mark of farmers and manual laborers. B\u00e4tje: \"People were still cultivating their genteel pallors.\" Water, Waves, Wellness Today, the sun worshipers are the devout masses, and seaside holidays are their pilgrimages. The North Sea resorts alone count some 12.9 million overnight stays annually. Health is once again a primary concern: sea air, sea water, sea salts and the algaes and mud used in",
        "generated_story": "A Brief History of the Seaside Holiday in Germany The Bade-Museum in Norderney, Germany, is a museum dedicated to the history of Germany's seaside holiday. It is the first museum in the country to feature a full-scale exhibition of German culture and history. The exhibition, which runs through September, focuses on the 18th century, with a focus on German history and culture. In the exhibition's first year, the museum's director, Manfred B\u00e4tje, said he was \"very impressed\" with the collection. \"I think it's a great exhibition,\" he said, adding that he would like to see more of it. He added that it would be a good opportunity for visitors to \"experience the wonders of Europe\" and \"to experience the rich and famous.\" The museum also has a large collection of artworks from the 19th and early 20th centuries, such as the Chalk Cliffs in North Frisian and the Bremen Museum, where he worked as an archivist for more than a century. His work has been published in German, German and English, and is available in English as well as German. But he has also written a book about his experiences in his time in England, in which he described his experience as \"the best of all time.\" He also spoke of his own experiences as a child, when his father died in 1818 and his mother, his sister and brother-in-law lived in a house in Cuxhaven, near the village of Aurich. They had been married for a year and a half and had a son, Caspar David Friedrich, who was born in 1780. After that, they had two children, one of whom died of a heart attack and one who died from a stroke. Both of them died at the age of 18. Their deaths were the result of an illness that left them with no memory of their father. And they were not the only ones who suffered from this illness. For example, their mother died when she was in her early thirties. Her son died a few years later, after a long illness, of which the family was unable to get a proper medical care. This was the last time they would have been able to go to a hospital in their home state of Humboldt. Since then, a number of people have died, including the children who were born during the time of Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland's death. There have also been many attempts to find a cure for the disease, but so far, no one has come up with an answer for that. Instead, there is only one solution: to treat it as if it were a disease. That is, to give it a chance to be cured and to make it easier for people to come back to their homes and families to have a normal life. As a result, it is possible to do that without having to worry about their own health and well-being. At the same time, this is also a very good time to visit the museums, as there are a lot of museums that are open to visitors from all over the world. You can visit them, too, if you want to take a look around and see what they have to offer. If you're interested, you can check out the website for further information on how they are made available. I would also recommend that you visit these museums in order to learn more about the area. These are the places where the German museums are located, not just in Berlin, Berlin and Hamburg. Also, I'd recommend visiting the National Museum of History and Culture in Brighton, Brighton and Brighton."

        "target": "Reports: Merkel to run for fourth term as German chancellor German Chancellor Angela Merkel has confirmed that she will stand for the chancellery in the 2017 election, German media reports. The Christian Democrat Leader (CDU) first took office in 2005. After months of speculation, German Chancellor Angela Merkel reportedly told her fellow Christian Democrats (CDU) in Berlin on Sunday that she is prepared to lead the party into next year's election. An official statement is expected from Merkel at 7 p.m. local time (1800 UTC) on Sunday. The 62-year-old has faced a number of difficulties in recent months, from criticism over her handling of the migration crisis to falling support amid a rise in right-wing populist sentiment. Since taking office in 2005, however, Merkel has also been praised for navigating Europe's largest economy through the financial and eurozone crises. According to an Emnid survey published in the German newspaper \"Bild am Sonntag\" 55 percent of Germans are in favor of Merkel remaining head of the German government for another four years. Thirty-nine percent said they were against her re-election. Sign of stability Should she be elected next September, another full four-year term would put Merkel on a par with her mentor Helmut Kohl who set the post-war record and presided over the Fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. In light of the UK's shock vote to leave the European Union in June and Donald Trump's election last week as US president, Merkel's re-election is likely to be welcomed in many capitals as a sign of stability. During his final visit to Berlin this week, US President Barack Obama said that if he were able to, he would vote for his longtime partner and friend. In an interview with German magazine \"Spiegel\" and broadcaster \"ARD,\" Obama said: \"She has great credibility, and she is willing to fight for those values in a way that is very, very important.\" \"I'm glad that she's there and I think the German people should appreciate her. Certainly, I've appreciated her as a partner.\" Winning back votes With the less that a year until Germany heads to the polls, Merkel's CDU is now turning its efforts to wooing back disenchanted voters who have left the conservative camp to support the right-wing populists, Alternative for Germany (AfD). Formed as a Euro-sceptic party in 2013, the AfD won 4.7 percent of the popular vote in the last federal elections in 2013, just falling short of the 5 percent threshold required to enter the Bundestag - Germany's lower house of parliament. After benefiting from the rise in europsceptic, anti-immigration sentiment, seemingly sweeping across western Europe, the party now holds seats in nine of Germany's 16 states.",
        "generated_story": "Merkel's re-election bid comes amid growing populist sentiment in Germany Chancellor Angela Merkel has announced her intention to seek a second term in office. She is expected to run for a third term as chancellor in 2017. The CDU's Helmut Kohl announced his candidacy on Sunday, a day after the German parliament voted to approve a new constitution that would make Germany a European Union member. Merkel, who has been in power since 2005, said she would run again in the next parliament. \"We are going to have to make sure that we have the right policies,\" she said in an interview with German newspaper Bild am Sonntag. Germany's conservative Christian Democrat (CDU) party, which is currently in opposition to the current constitution, is hoping to avoid a repeat of the 1989 fall of Berlin Wall, when the US President Donald Trump was elected as the first German president to take office in a generation. In the past few years, German voters have been increasingly disillusioned with the way the country is governed, and the lack of political stability in recent years has made it increasingly difficult for them to form a coalition government. This year, however, the party's parliamentary majority in parliament has shrunk to just two seats, with only one seat being up for grabs. It has also been unable to secure a majority of seats in next year's federal parliament, where Merkel is due to face a tough reelection bid in September. Many of Merkel's supporters believe that the new government will be able to win over voters who are more likely to support the left-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD), a party that is seen as a far-right alternative to Merkel and her conservative coalition. But it is not just Merkel who is facing the prospect of a fourth term. There is also the possibility that she could be forced to step down from her post as Chancellor of Germany in order to stay in her current role as head of state. That would be a major setback for the AfD, whose main opposition is the Social Democrats (SPD). The party is seeking to replace Merkel with a more moderate, more conservative chancellor. German media have long been critical of Trump's policies on immigration, particularly in his first year as US president, as well as his use of Twitter and social media to promote his policies. On the other hand, many of his supporters have expressed their support for him, saying he is a \"great man\" and that he has a lot of respect for German values. However, it's not clear whether he will win the election, given that his party has already won the most votes in opinion polls, or whether it will have a chance of winning the general election in November. If he does win, Merkel will face an uphill battle to retain the support of her Christian Democratic Party, but she is unlikely to be the only candidate to do so, according to a poll published by German daily Bild. A number of German politicians have said they are ready to accept the results of Sunday's election. Some of them have called for Merkel to stand down, while others have suggested she should stay on the sidelines. Others have also called on her to remain in government until she can get a grip on what she wants to achieve. For example, former US Secretary of State George W. Bush has said he won't be leaving office until after his term ends in 2022. Meanwhile, some of those who have supported him have criticized him for his decision to leave the EU, including former President Barack Obama, for failing to recognize the need for an EU-wide \"European Union\" membership. They also say he should not be allowed to return to Germany until he leaves office, despite the fact that Germany is already a member of NATO. And they say that this is an important step forward for democracy in Europe."

        "target": "France's conservatives: Combating the National Front with a swing to the right A staunch conservative is joining the race for the French presidency. Republican candidate Francois Fillon could turn into a big problem for right-wing extremist Marine Le Pen's National Front. France's Republicans are moving to the right: by choosing Francois Fillon, voters nominated a presidential candidate who has a reputation as a staunch conservative. The former prime minister has already announced that he intends to refocus politics with the traditional family in mind. Fillon takes a dim view of homosexual couples adopting children. He wants to introduce a cap on the number of refugees allowed into France, he intends to make it harder for foreign nationals to access the social welfare system, and he wants to put Muslim communities and mosques under government control. In addition, Fillon advocates a renationalization of school curricula. Fillon makes gains in FN territory Fillon's agenda could turn out to be a problem for the \"National Front\" (FN). The 62-year-old appeals to similar sentiments as the right-wing party's base: concern about foreign domination and loss of identity, fear of terrorism and crime. \"For a long time, FN was the only political force that addressed those fears,\" said Henrik Uterwedde of the German-French Institute (dfi) in Ludwigsburg. \"Now a politician has arrived on the scene who addresses those fears using a different language and makes them a political offer.\" In rural, Catholic France especially, where traditions still matter a great deal, the avowed Catholic Fillon strikes a chord with his proposals pertaining to family and society policies. He receives support from traditional Catholic groups who, for years, have been able to mobilize crowds for demonstrations against gay marriage. During the intraparty election campaign, Fillon predominantly traveled to France's villages and small towns - regions which FN leader Marine Le Pen had labeled the \"forgotten France,\" regarding herself as their foremost lobbyist. \"Fillon has made gains in an environment that is also canvassed by Le Pen,\" Andreas Jung, Chairman of the Bundestag's German-French parliamentary group, told German broadcaster rbb-Inforadio. \"He does not represent the lofty levels of Parisian politics, but rather provincial entrenchment. Fillon is committed to traditional values, like the family. Therefore, he may not only be capable of defeating Le Pen, but also of taking the lead during the first ballot.\" 'Most dangerous candidate for FN' Consequently, the FN camp is less than enthusiastic about the conservative's candidacy. \"Because of Fillon, we now have a strategy problem,\" Marion Marechal Le Pen, the FN leader's niece, recently told journalists. \"He is the most dangerous candidate for the National Front.\" Pollsters' findings appear to support that statement. Recent surveys establish Fillon as the current favorite in the French presidential election scheduled for next May. However, Fillon's election is not a foregone conclusion. By denouncing the conservative candidate as a member of the establishment, FN tries to win over those who are frustrated with politics and politicians in general. There is persistent opposition against his economic-liberal plans in particular. Fillon wants to abolish the 35-hour working week and raise the retirement age to 65 years. In addition, he wants to cut 500,000 jobs in the public sector and reform industrial law. Fillon is known as an admirer of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. \"Issues pertaining to liberal economic policy have always been heavily contested in France,\" said Uterwedde. \"Fillon's adversaries have already taken up their positions, criticizing what, in France, is called 'ultra-liberalism.'\" That was one of the nastiest words in French politics, he added. An offer for the left Fillon wants to raise VAT by 2 percent. This would predominantly hurt low-income households. Exactly that clientele, however, is wooed by FN with a program that is regarded as rather left-wing. The right-wing extremists are on a clear anti-globalization course, intending to seal off the French economy against foreign countries and exit from the European Union. The party is already trying to present Fillon as a symbol of anarchic, ultra-liberal capitalism. \"Francois Fillon will even go beyond EU demands for austerity and liberalism,\" David Rachline, Marine Le Pen's election campaign manager, wrote on Twitter. According to current polls, it is very likely that Fillon will have to face Marine Le Pen in a runoff election in May. The main hazard for the Republican candidate: his economic-liberal course could deter left-wing voters from choosing the conservative in order to avert Le Pen. \"Francois Fillon will have to start making offers, also to those voters who are closer to the center and more moderate,\" said France expert Uterwedde. \"And he will, prior to the runoff election at the latest, have to make offers to left-wing voters - without changing his original course.\"",
        "generated_story": "Francois Fillon is the most dangerous candidate for the French presidential election, says German-French Institute President Henrik Uterwedde. The former French prime minister faces a tough re-election bid in France on Sunday. French media have been bombarded with accusations that he is a right-wing extremist who wants to destroy the European Union and the country's democratic institutions. But in the long run, he has been able to win the support of his own party, the far-right National Front (NFP), which is currently in third place in polls. In the first round of voting, candidates are expected to face off against each other in a runoff between the two main parties, which could decide the outcome of the election. For example, Marine Le Pen, who is seeking a second term as the party's presidential candidate, faces an uphill battle to become the next leader of France's conservative party. \"I think he's a very dangerous person,\" said German journalist Andreas Jung, whose research center is based in Ludwigsburg, near the German state of Bavaria. He added: \"If he wins, it will be because he believes he can make a strong case for himself and his party,\" he said, referring to the fact that his father, former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, was born in Germany and had a German father who was also a French-born French citizen. His father had been a member of parliament for more than 30 years, and he was one of only a handful of French politicians to have held that position. And that was before the Second World War, when the Nazis were in power. Since then, however, French and German politicians have come to terms with the idea that they should not be allowed to vote for their own candidate. On the other hand, there are a number of other candidates who are also considered to be more dangerous candidates. One of them is former German Chancellor Angela Merkel, for example. Another is French President Emmanuel Macron (pictured above), who has said he would be willing to run for president if he could get a third term. Other candidates, such as former Chancellor Francois Hollande, have said they would not accept a fourth term in office if they were to lose the presidency. Some of these candidates have also been accused of being too moderate in their views on the EU. Others, though, say they are more moderate and more conservative than their French counterparts. They have called for a referendum on EU membership, while others are calling for an EU-wide withdrawal from the bloc's single currency bloc, leaving France to negotiate a new deal with Germany. However, they have not ruled out the possibility of a return to a single EU member state, as long as it is agreed to by the 28-nation bloc. That would mean that France would have to leave the eurozone and join the single market in order to compete with other countries. This is not the case in Europe, of course, but it could be a long time before that happens. There is no doubt that the current French government is in danger of losing the euro. It is, after all, a country that has a lot of people who want to make the world a better place for themselves and their children. What is certain is that French voters are not ready to give up their right to choose a candidate who they don't think they can be trusted with? The French president has already made it clear that she will not stand for another term, even if it means losing a seat in parliament. She has also said she won't accept an extension of her parliamentary term if she is elected to parliament in 2021."

Minister wants ban on meat names for plant-based foods Terms like \"vegan sausage\" and \"vegetarian schnitzel\" confuse consumers and need to be replaced, according to German Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt. He wants new names for plant-based dishes. Germans shouldn't be biting into a \"vegan sausage\" or cutting a slice of \"vegetarian schnitzel,\" German Minister for Food and Agriculture Christian Schmidt told the daily \"Bild\" newspaper on Wednesday, adding that names traditionally used for meat-based dishes should not be applied to plant-based foods. \"I don't want anyone to pretend that these pseudo-meat dishes are actual meat dishes,\" Schmidt said. The minister said manufacturers should come up with distinct names for plant-based meat-substitutes. Schmidt also said meat was part of a healthy and balanced diet and belonged on the menu in schools and kindergartens. Soy? Steak? Soy-steak? Schmidt's statements echo demands from the German Farmers Association and German Butchers Association. Both lobbying groups have asked for a ban on terms such as \"vegetarian ham\" or \"soy steak.\" Schmidt's call for plant-based foods to have their own name was also made in October in the state of Lower Saxony, a state with many large livestock farms. The German Vegetarian Association, however, argued against the proposal. A spokesperson for the organization said that \"names that are used for animal-based products should without a doubt also be legal to use for vegetarian substitute products.\" More meatless 'whatever-you-want-to-call-thems' The market for vegetarian and vegan dishes has grown steadily in the past few years in Germany, partly at the expense of the meat industry. According to a research paper by the Institute for the Study of Trade (IfH), revenue for vegetarian and vegan products in Germany was 454 million euros ($474 million) in 2015 and grew by more than 100 percent between 2010 and 2015. In the same time period, the demand for meat products fell by almost 10 percent. mb/sms (dpa, epd)",
        "generated_story": "'No more'veggie sausages' and no more'vegetarian schnitzel' German Minister for Food and Agriculture Christian Schmidt has announced that he will no longer be minister for food and agriculture in the next few months. The announcement comes as the German Farmers Association (DFA) announced on Wednesday that it would be taking steps to reduce the number of its members from 454 million to 1.4 million by 2015. \"We are not going to be able to do this anymore,\" the association said in a statement, adding that the decision was made \"to make it a bit easier for our members to have their own vegetable garden.\" The association, which represents more than 4.5 million farmers in Lower Saxony, has called on Schmidt to step down from his position as agriculture minister. Schmidt, who has been in charge of the agriculture ministry since 2010, said he would not be stepping down until the end of October. He also said that his ministry would continue to work with the federal government on the issue of food security and agricultural policy. But he added that \"we will continue with our efforts to make sure that we have the right policies in place to protect our farmers' interests.\" Schmidt's announcement came after a series of cabinet ministers met on Tuesday to discuss the government's plans for the country's agricultural sector. In the first half of 2015, the ministry announced plans to introduce a new \"veggie garden\" policy that would allow farmers to sell their produce to the public in exchange for agricultural subsidies. However, it was not immediately clear whether the move would have a positive impact on German farmers. It was unclear what the new policy would look like, however, and Schmidt did not rule out the possibility of a change of government. On Wednesday, he said the Ministry of Agriculture (Minister for Agriculture, Agriculture and Rural Affairs) would take a closer look at the proposal, saying it is \"not a good idea\" to impose a \"zero-tolerance\" approach to meat and dairy products. According to a report by the Institute for Study of Trade (IST) in its annual report, \"The German market for veggie products is expected to grow at a faster rate than in previous years.\" \"It will be a very difficult decision for us,\" Schmidt said. 'We will have to see what we can do to improve the quality of our products and the way we produce them. We will do our best to ensure that there is a level playing field for all of us, not just those who want to eat meat, but also the ones who don't want it. That is not to say that meat is the only thing that can be eaten in Germany. There is no need for meat in this country, for example, because it's not a meat that is available in other countries. I think that's the main reason why we are doing this. If we do not have meat at all, we will need to look for other products that are available to us. This is because the meat we eat is very expensive and we cannot have it in our own country. So we must be very careful with meat,\" he told the IST."

        "target": "The Shift in Libya's Relations to the West The La Belle disco bombing in Berlin on April 5, 1986 was ruled to be Libya's doing. Twenty years later, relations between Libya and Europe have done an about-face. The Berlin disco \"La Belle\" was packed as usual on the night of April 5, 1986. Among its guests were many US soldiers, who were certainly not thinking of politics, the Middle East or strained relations between the United States and Libya. But reality caught up with them: a bomb detonated near the dance floor that night, killing two Americans and a Turkish woman. Over 200 people were injured. A Berlin court ruled that Libya and its intelligence services were responsible for the bombing. In 2001, following a nearly four-year long trial, the judges convicted a Libyan diplomat and three others to prison sentences between 12 and 14 years. The big oil-exporting country in the meantime was busy working on its reputation. Already in the 1990s, Tripoli began striving to improve its relations to the European Union. Financial reparation opened the door to Europe In 2004, the Gaddafi International Foundation for Charity Associations and the legal representatives of the German La Belle victims settled on $35 million in compensation. This opened the door to Europe. Just a few weeks later, Germany's chancellor at the time, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, visited Moammar Gadhafi in a traditional Bedouin tent outside of Tripoli. Britain's Prime Minister Tony Blair also paid Gadhafi a visit. A few months earlier, in April 2004, the European Union had welcomed the Libyan leader to Brussels. It was Gadhafi's first official visit to Europe in 15 years. Bernd Westphal, the German ambassador to Libya, said bilateral relations had been through difficult times. \"The German Embassy in Tripoli today is working for a quick return to the liveliness of close relations between Germany and Libya,\" Westphal said. \"We want to build on our traditional friendship with Libya and we want to strengthen the political, economic and cultural cooperation between our two countries and peoples.\" Business interests booming in Libya In the past few years, Libya has moved from being the supporter of international terrorism to an attractive economic partner for the West. European business representatives have been increasingly knocking on Libya's door. Even the United States is showing increased interest in the northern African nation. Washington is pleased that Libya announced at the end of 2003 that it would discontinue its efforts to develop and produce weapons of mass destruction. Libya's ambassador to Germany, Said Abdulaati, said political and economic relations between Libya and Germany were \"excellent.\" Libya is one of Germany's strongest trading partners in northern Africa. Last year, Germany exported goods to Libya worth 657.7 million euros ($805.7 million), according to the German Federal Statistics Office. \"The economy is the driving power in German-Libyan relations,\" said Abdulaati in an interview with the Arab-German association for trade and industry. But Germany isn't the only European country making deals in Libya. France last month signed an accord with Libya on peaceful nuclear research. \"This accord represents a qualitative leap in relations between the two countries and proves that Libya has transformed its weapons of mass destruction into constructive weapons,\" Public Works Minister Maatuk Maatuk said at the signing ceremony in March. \"We are telling the world that we are moving towards the development of Libyan nuclear technology for peaceful purposes.\" This week, the Netherlands' Economics Minister Laurens Jan Brinkhorst will visit Libya to negotiate gas and oil agreements. It will be the first high-level visit by a Dutch official since Gadhafi took power in 1969.",
        "generated_story": "The Shift in Libya's Relations to Europe The shift in Libyan relations between Germany and the United States has been marked by an increase in tensions between the two countries, according to the German Federal Statistics Office (FSO). In the first half of the year, the country's government in Tripoli, Libya, announced that it was withdrawing its troops from the eastern city of Misrata. The move came after a series of deadly clashes between Libyan rebels and pro-regime forces in the east. At the same time, Germany's Prime Minister Gerhard Schr\u00f6der said that the Libyan government, which had been in power since the fall of dictator Moammar Gadhafi in 2011, was also withdrawing troops. \"We are not going to give up on Libya,\" he said, adding that \"we will continue to do our best to help the people of Libya.\" In addition, he added that he was \"very happy\" with the new government's decision to withdraw troops, saying it would be \"a very positive step for the whole country.\" \"It will be a good thing that we have a lot of people who are willing to work for us and for our country, and we are very happy to be able to contribute to that.\" The German federal statistics office, based in Berlin, said in a statement that Germany was the only country in Europe to recognize that Libya was a \"safe country\" for its people. Germany, however, did not recognize Libya as a safe country until the end of its civil war in 2003, when it took place in eastern Libya. According to its official website, \"the country is a very safe place for people to live, work and play,\" but it is not clear how much money is being spent by the government. It is unclear whether it will have enough money to pay the salaries of Libyan soldiers, who have been fighting for more than a decade. But it's clear that there is no shortage of money in this country. In fact, there are a number of countries that have taken part in similar efforts, including the US, Britain, France, Italy, Spain, Japan, Turkey and even the Netherlands. This is the case in Germany. There is also the fact that many of these countries do not have the resources to invest in education, health, education and other social services, such as health care, for example. And there's the issue of how to spend the money, as well as the lack of funds for education in schools, hospitals, schools and universities. For example, in Belgium, where the education system is run by a German-based NGO, it has a budget of about 1.5 million euros ($2.7 million) a year. That's about $1.3 million. However, that's not enough to cover the cost of education for all of us. You also have to take into account the costs of living in countries like Libya and Syria. If you're not a member of a European Union, you don't have access to education at all. So you can't go to a university and study abroad. What you need to know is that education is very important to you, but you also need the knowledge that you have in order to get the right education. As a result of that knowledge, your knowledge and skills can be used to improve the quality of life in your own country and to make you a better person. I think this is one of those things that can help you get a job, because you know you've got the skills and knowledge to succeed in life. Just ask the Germans. They are the ones who can teach you the basics, not the Americans. We have learned that they can do that in other countries too. Let's be honest, though. When you think about it, they are just as important as you are in America."

        "target": "EU Mulls Warning Labels to Curb Alcohol Abuse While still targeting smoking, European Union's public health commissioner is considering adding alcohol to the list of vices the bloc should clamp down on. In a report commissioned by the European Commission, the London Institute for Alcohol Studies recommended raising the legal age to buy alcohol to 18 (in some countries, such as Germany, 16-year-olds can buy beer), lowering the permitted blood alcohol level while driving to 0.5, banning alcohol advertising on TV and in movies as well as adding warning labels to bottles as ways of preventing alcohol abuse across the bloc. Which of the methods EU Health Commissioner Markos Kyprianou actually introduces will be announced \"sometime in the autumn,\" according to a spokesperson. Other options include a 10 percent increase in the price of alcohol. Kyprianou has, however, hinted that he favors warning labels -- similar to those that appear on packs of cigarettes -- that make the dangers of alcohol clear. \"Drinking harms your unborn baby\" on bottles? Brewers and wine makers across Europe, however, have come out against placing \"Drinking Kills\" or other labels on bottles of beer. \"Warning labels are the completely wrong way to go,\" Peter Hahn, head of the German Brewers Association told Germany's Express newspaper. \"The do not deter people who have lost a sense of how much to drink and unsettle the people who enjoy a beer after work.\" Industry groups also opposed implementing EU-wide guidelines in countries with traditionally different ways of approaching drinking and drinking problems. \"Policies that do not consider cultural and regional differences, will fail to deal with the social problems, while at the same time generate a rising level of political objections,\" said Rodolphe de Looz-Corswarem of Brewers of Europe. Keeping social vices separate Green party EU parliamentarian Hiltrud Breyer meanwhile called on the alcohol industry to stop \"saber rattling\" before it sees the a final version of the EU's strategy to prevent alcohol abuse. German Consumer Affairs Minister Horst Seehofer said he would wait to see what Kyprianou's actual suggestions are before commenting. Other German politicians, however, were more willing to voice the opposition to putting a sip of wine on the same footing with a puff of a cigarette. \"People should not expect that a skull and crossbones end up on every bottle of beer and wine,\" German EU representative Karl-Heinz Florenz told Der Tagesspiegel newspaper, adding that when it comes to alcohol, each member state should be responsible for how it deals with alcohol abuse. The harm of \"passive drinking\" While cigarettes are a health risk from the first puff, moderate drinking can actually be healthy and there is no danger from \"passive drinking,\" Peter Liese, a German EU representative, told the paper. The commission's report disagreed with Liese's conclusion, saying alcohol abuse had a major role in as many as 200,000 deaths in Europe due to car accidents and disease and played a role in some 60,000 underweight births. The report also estimated the effects of alcohol abuse of costing the EU 125 billion euros ($161 billion) in 2003. Some 25 percent of men and 10 percent of women in Europe drink what the EU considers to be more than healthy amounts of alcohol and between 3 percent and 5 percent are suffering from alcoholism, according to EU statistics.",
        "generated_story": "The harm of \"passive drinking\" on bottles of beer? What is the harm to the German Brewers Association (BBA) and the European Union (EU) when it comes to alcohol consumption? The European Commission (ECB) has issued a warning about the harmful effects of drinking alcohol. The EU's consumer affairs commissioner, Peter Liese, said in a statement that \"few people drink alcohol in their own home.\" He added: \"We do not condone the consumption of alcohol, but we are not against it, and we will not tolerate it in our own homes.\" The Commission has also warned that alcohol use is a serious problem in Germany. \"It is not something that should be tolerated,\" he said, adding that it should not be allowed to happen in public places. But the Commission's warning comes at a time when the EU is trying to reduce the number of people who drink beer, which is one of the most popular drinks in the world. In the past few years, German consumers have been drinking more and more alcohol than any other country in Europe. This has led to an increase in underage drinking, as well as a rise in alcohol-related crime, according to a study by the University of London Institute for Alcohol Studies (LISA) in 2003. It was the first time that a German beer was sold on the market in more than a decade, the study found. And it's not just the beer that is being sold. There are other products, too, such as wine, beer and beer. These are the products that are sold in supermarkets, restaurants, bars, cafes and bars. They are also sold at the grocery store, where they are often sold for around 1.5 million euros ($2.4 million) a year. That's a lot of money for a single bottle of a beer in one day. What's more, there's also the fact that there are many other types of alcoholic drinks available, including wine and spirits. For example, alcohol is used to make you feel better about your own health and well-being. You don't have to buy alcohol to be able to have a good day, you just need to drink a glass of water and enjoy it. I think that's the best way to do that, because you're not going to get a bad night's sleep and you won't get sick. So, what do you do when you have an alcoholic beverage? You drink it and then you go to bed. If you want to go out and get some rest, go for it again. We have already had a very good night, I would recommend that you try to stay awake and stay up to date on what's going on in your life. (Reuters, AP, dpa, AFP, Reuters)"

        "target": "All or nothing for Bayern in Champions final Bayern Munich have one last chance to salvage a season that has otherwise been marked by their inability to beat Borussia Dortmund: a win against Chelsea in the Champions League final at their home stadium. All season long, Bayern Munich have been consumed with achieving one goal: reaching the final of the Champions League, held at their own Allianz Arena in Munich, and raising the trophy in front of their home fans. After finishing a distant second place to Dortmund in the Bundesliga and dismally losing to them 5-2 in the German Cup final, Bayern Munich are in a must-win situation Saturday against Chelsea. A loss would be the final straw in a disappointing season for a team that can't stand second place. A win for Bayern would mean redemption, to some extent, for their shortcomings in the league. Key players were rested down the stretch in the Bundesliga, especially before the two legs of Bayern's European semifinal against Real Madrid. That was an indication that Bayern had given up on the league and put all their eggs in one basket, hoping for a big payoff with the Champions League title. The same can be said for the German Cup final against Dortmund: true, Bayern essentially beat themselves by making mistake after mistake, but Bayern could, if they win Saturday, wipe the slate clean. Saving the season Win this match, and all will be forgiven in Munich. Lose, and it will be Bayern's second straight season without a piece of hardware, not to mention the heartbreak of losing the biggest match at Allianz Arena since it opened in 2005. \"We must not even think about [losing],\" said Bayern's Franck Ribery on Thursday. \"If we win the Champions League, then we can forget about not winning the league or the cup, nobody will care about that.\" Bayern are a team that thrives under pressure, and the high stakes of this match will be good for them. Chelsea are a team that showed in their semifinal upset of Barcelona that they can rise to a challenge, even if that challenge is simply holding on against a superior opponent. \"We are not the favorites of the game, we are playing away,\" Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech said on Thursday. \"It is very rare when you have the home team playing in the home stadium, using the home dressing room, so I think the advantage goes to Bayern Munich because of that. But we know we have a chance and we will fight for it.\" But this match will come down to the team that can better take advantage of holes that have been blown in each team's defense due to injuries and suspensions. Filling the gaps Between the two sides, seven starting players will miss out on the final. Chelsea saw Raul Meireles, Ramires, and Branislav Ivanovic each get their third yellow card in the second leg against Barcelona, and captain John Terry was given a straight red. Terry and Ivanovic are fixtures on Chelsea's backline, which was already at half-strength due to hamstring injuries suffered by Gary Cahill and David Luiz. Chelsea coach Roberto di Matteo hopes those two are fit enough for the final, since Chelsea will need all the help they can get in the back. For Bayern, David Alaba and Holger Badstuber - both defenders - and Luiz Gustavo, a defensive midfielder, are also suspended for picking up three yellow cards. The impact of the suspensions will hit Chelsea the most. In addition to a weakened back line, Meireles and Ramires are mainstays on offense, supporting strikers Didier Drogba or Fernando Torres. With Ramires out, Drogba could start as striker, with Torres moving to the wing. At any rate, there is more uncertainty in The Blues' lineup than there is in Bayern's, who will be able to rely on striker Mario Gomez and the dynamic-duo of Arjen Robben and Ribery on the wings as they have all season. Most of the question marks will still be defensive for both teams, but to think that this is an indication of a high-scoring affair on Saturday would be a discredit to both team's last lines of defense. Between the posts Neither side would be competing in the final if it wasn't for the heroics of the teams' keepers. Cech defended against wave after wave of attacks from Barcelona in the semifinal for Chelsea, and Manuel Neuer showed nerves of steel in Bayern's penalty shootout in the final leg against Real Madrid, blocking penalties from Madrid stars Cristiano Ronaldo and Kaka. Chelsea's best shot will be to come out of the gate at a sprint and gain an early advantage against Bayern, who will be doing everything they can to keep their long-cultivated dream-final in their control. Otherwise, Bayern's determination to salvage their season may be enough to carry them through to the trophy ceremony - at home, just like they planned it.

        "generated_story": "Chelsea vs Bayern Munich in Champions League final The Blues will face Barcelona on Saturday in the first leg of the German Cup final at the Allianz Arena in Munich. David Alaba scored the only goal for the hosts, but the Blues were unable to equalize. The German champions, who have won the last three Bundesliga titles in a row, will have to settle for a place in next year's final, which they hope will be won by their former coach Roberto di Matteo. Jose Ramires of Borussia Dortmund, meanwhile, is set to take over as Bayern's coach. \"I think we are going to have a very difficult time,\" he said, adding that he was \"very disappointed\" with his side's performance on Thursday night, when they lost 3-0 to Real Madrid in their last-16 tie at home to the Bernabeu. In the end, they were able to win the game 2-1, with David Luiz scoring the decisive goal in stoppage time. It was a great moment for both teams, as both of them had been on the brink of a title-clinching win over Barcelona. However, it wasn't enough to get the result they wanted. Barcelona's Cristiano Ronaldo was the man they needed to beat to reach the final. At the same time, Manchester United's Kaka was on hand to help them to their first-ever Bundesliga title. He was also a key player for Bayern, scoring a brace and setting up the winner for their new coach, Manuel Neuer, in his first match in charge since the summer of 2005. But he did not play a single minute in Dortmund's 1-2 draw with Bayern on Wednesday, and he didn't get a chance to do so either. After the match, the two sides met again at half-time. Both teams have been struggling to find a way to make it through to next season's Bundesliga final in Germany, where they are currently in fourth place. That is, if they can keep their form and keep up with the pace of their opponents. And that is a good thing, because it means that they have the opportunity to improve their chances of reaching the next round. For the second time in three years, Pep Guardiola's side have reached the quarter-finals in four consecutive years. Last season, Bayern were the defending champions. They were also the favorites to be crowned champions in 2006 and 2007. This year, though, their hopes are not quite as high as they once were. On the other hand, there is the possibility of an even higher run of form in this competition. If they do not win, then they will not be the champions of Germany and the Bundesliga. There is no chance of that happening this time around. Bayern have already been eliminated from the competition, so it is not a surprise to see them lose to them. Meanwhile, Chelsea are expected to face a tough task in Saturday's second-round tie against Bayern. Despite the fact that their players have struggled for some time to adapt to a new style of play, Jose Mourinho's men have made a strong start to this season and are looking to build on their recent success in Europe's top-flight. As a result, that will give them a lot of confidence in themselves and their ability to continue to play well, even if it's not the most difficult of games. With the loss to Barcelona, a number of teams are likely to come up short in Group A, although they could be a step up from last season when it comes to defending their title, too. Nevertheless, at least one of those teams is still in contention for that trophy. Manchester City, Barcelona and Bayern are the favourites to claim the top spot, while Chelsea have yet to qualify for next summer's UEFA Cup in Russia. Barca are also in danger of missing out on a spot in that competition as well. Arsenal have also been knocked out by Bayern and Barcelona in recent weeks. Chelsea, however, are in pole position to defend their place, having already won their second title in as many seasons, after losing to Bayern last year. What's next for Chelsea? \"We are hoping that we can get back to where we were in 2005,\" said Raul Meireles of The Daily Telegraph."

Security forces are on high alert amid fears of unrest. UN leader Ban Ki-moon expressed \"deep regret\" on Monday that political leaders had failed to make progress on a constitution in Nepal, expressing concern about instability within the country. Security forces were put on high alert, with riot police patrolling streets after calls by the opposition for the resignation of Maoist Prime Minister Baburam Bhattarai. \"Nepal has entered an uncertain constitutional and political period,\" Ban warned in a statement read by his spokesman Martin Nesirky. \"The government and the political leaders, as well as leaders of various communities, need to demonstrate the courage and wisdom to come together to address the challenges the nation faces,\" the statement added. Repeated deadlines expired Politicians were to have agreed upon a new framework for the country's political future by Sunday. However, the representation of ethnic minorities and castes within a federal structure has proved a major sticking point in efforts to draw up a secular constitution. Bhattarai on Sunday said that parliament, elected in 2008 after a decade of civil war, would be disbanded after repeated deadlines had been broken. New elections are due to be held in November, but the opposition has criticized the premier's unilateral decision to call the poll. The country's Hindu monarchy, which ruled for centuries, was abolished after Maoist rebels gave up arms and won elections in 2008. Some 16,000 people died in the civil war between 1996 and 2006. rc/msh (AFP, AP)",
        "generated_story": "Nepal elections in Nepal are in the midst of unrest The Nepalese government has announced that it will hold elections on Sunday. The country's elections are expected to be held in a few days, but the situation is not yet clear. Opposition parties have called for the postponement of the polls, which are due to take place on November 6. Nepal's Prime Minister, Baburam Bhattarai, has said he will not contest the elections. \"We will have to wait and see what happens,\" he told reporters in Kathmandu on Monday, adding that he would not rule out the possibility of a general election. He also said that the country would hold a referendum on whether to allow candidates to run for office, a move that has been widely condemned by the Nepali government and the UN Security Council. In the past, Nepal has held elections for a number of years. But in recent years, it has become increasingly difficult to predict what will happen. On Sunday, protests broke out in several parts of Nepal, where the government was forced to step down after a series of violent clashes between the Maoist and secular forces. At the same time, the opposition has called on the prime minister to resign, accusing him of failing to do enough to stop the violence. According to the Nepal government's spokesman Martin Nesirky, who was not present at Sunday's election, \"the country is facing a serious political crisis,\" the spokesman told AFP news agency. It was the first time that a democratically elected government had been able to form a government since the 1990s, when the Communist Party was in power. Since then, elections have been held every year, and in some cases in 2006 and 2008, as well as in 2008 and 2006. There have also been sporadic incidents of violence between Maoists and Hindu groups, according to local media reports. Many of these incidents took place during the 2008-2009 Nepal elections, in which thousands of people were killed and hundreds of thousands were displaced. This is the second time in six years that Nepal was unable to secure a parliamentary majority. Last month, an election was held to elect a new government with the aim of making Nepal a more democratic country. However, many of those who were elected to office were not convinced that they would win the right to vote. Some of them, however, did not vote at all. Instead, they voted in favor of candidates who had campaigned against the incumbent government, while others voted against them. They also voted for candidates they thought would be more popular than the current government. These were the most popular candidates for prime ministers and other elected officials. Most of their opponents, though, are Hindu, Hindu and Buddhist. And they are not the only ones who are unhappy about the election results. That's because they want to see a change of government in their own country, says the head of state, Ram Bahadurami, whose family is a prominent Hindu nationalist. His supporters have said they will continue to campaign for him, despite the fact that his father was killed in an anti-government uprising in 1996. Meanwhile, opposition parties, including the ruling party, have vowed to continue their efforts to ensure that elections will be free and fair for all, even if they lose their seats in parliament. UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said in his statement that there was \"no reason for this to happen\" for Nepal to go ahead."

        "target": "Oracle loses court fight over software resale rules A European court has ruled that it's permissible to resell software licenses even if the package has been downloaded directly from the Internet. It sided with a German firm in its legal battle with US giant Oracle. The European Court of Justice on Tuesday ruled that used software licenses may generally be resold by individuals or companies. The Luxembourg-based court thus sided with the German firm UsedSoft in a protracted legal battle with US software giant Oracle. The ruling made it clear that trade in used software was permissible even if the software had not been shipped on a physical medium such as a CD or DVD, but had been digitally downloaded from the Internet. UsedSoft's business model hinges completely on reselling used packages or legally obtained license keys for them. By reselling the keys to clients, the latter are then able to download the latest version of a given program directly from a company's Internet site and obtain all new updates and patches in the process. Legal clarity Oracle had sued UsedSoft over its business model, trying to prevent buyers of used software licenses from downloading programs again. But the European court ruled that the so-called principle of exhaustion applied whenever software was originally sold to a customer for an unlimited time span, not giving the maker of the software the right to prevent the resale of that software. \"The door for the trade in used software has been pushed wide open throughout the European Union,\" UsedSoft said in a statement, welcoming \"perfect legal safety on the market.\" The court in Luxembourg emphasized, though, that whoever resold pieces of original software and their accompanying licenses must erase every copy on their own computers in advance and was not allowed to keep a copy after resale. hg/mz (AFP, dpa)",
        "generated_story": "European Court of Justice rules against reselling software The European court of justice has ruled that it's permissible to resell software without a license from the European Union. The EU's top court ruled on Tuesday that resellers of software should not be allowed to sell it without an agreement with the EU. It also ruled against the use of the software by companies such as Oracle (ORCL) and used soft disk drives (CDs). The court's decision comes after the US-based software giant, Oracle, sued to block the sale of its software in Luxembourg, saying it violated EU law. Oracle has denied the request and said it would appeal the decision, which the court said was based on a \"misinterpretation of European law.\" Oracle is the largest software company in Europe, but it is not the only one to do so. In Luxembourg's case, a court in the United States ruled in favor of Oracle in a case brought by a German court, arguing that the company's software does not infringe on the rights of people who use it. \"This is an important step in our efforts to protect the privacy of our users,\" the judge said, adding that Oracle was \"not a party to this case\" and that \"we are not going to allow it to be sold without the consent of all users.\" The decision came after a three-judge bench ruled last week that software companies could sell their software to anyone who wanted it, including customers who didn't want to pay for it and who did not wish to give it away, according to a statement from Oracle's lawyer, Hg/mz (AFP, dpa). Oracle had appealed the ruling to European courts in Germany, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and the Czech Republic, where the case was heard last year, and Germany's Constitutional Court in Strasbourg. Both countries have said they will not allow the resealing of any software that has been downloaded from a computer, as well as those who do not have access to the Internet. This is a significant step for Oracle and other companies, who have been accused of copyright infringement and copyright violations for years. According to court documents obtained by AFP, it was the first time that an EU court had found that a software firm had infringed the right of a user to access the data of their users without their consent in order to obtain a copy of an application. That's the second time in less than a year that Europe's highest court has upheld a similar ruling, with a decision by the Luxembourg court last month upholding a previous ruling by an appeals court that had upheld an earlier ruling in which a US judge had said that such software could be used for the purpose of selling CDs and DVDs. But Oracle said the move was not an infringement on its right to free speech rights because it had not done enough to prevent the downloading of infringing software."

The Curiosity rover will soon re-start its sluggish search for signs of life. NASA's Mars rover, \"Curiosity,\" will wrap up a lengthy self-testing phase on Thursday, freeing it up to continue exploring the surface of the Red Planet. Mission manager Jennifer Tropser told reporters in a conference call on Wednesday evening that the plan, once the final checks were completed, was to \"drive, drive, drive\" until Curiosity discovers a rock suitable for analysis. She added that the instrument checks have delivered positive results. \"Through every phase of the check-out, Curiosity has performed almost flawlessly,\" Tropser said. \"The success so far of these activities has been outstanding.\" Many of the tests have concerned Curiosity's robotic arm. The 2.1-meter (7-feet) appendage will be used to pick out and sample rocks and soil. NASA is investigating whether Mars can sustain life, or whether it could in the past. The tests were designed to identify any damage sustained during its interplanetary flight and also to ensure that the arm still functioned properly on Mars, with its different temperatures and gravity. The Mars rover landed in the giant Gale Crater, near the Martian equator, on August 5; it has so far moved about 109 meters within the crater. The rover is traveling east, heading first to an intersection called Glenelg, where three types of terrain meet. This is likely to be the location for the first rock and soil samples, though NASA said Curiosity was unlikely to arrive there for several weeks. Curiosity's ultimate destination is the nearby Aeolis Mons or Mount Sharp, a 3-mile-high mound of rock rising out of the crater. Mount Sharp is about 4.3 miles (7 kilometers) away from Curiosity's landing site. The $2.5-billion (1.93-billion-euro) six-wheeled rolling science lab is designed to last two years in order to complete its Mars mission. msh/jm (AFP, AP, Reuters)",

The rover, launched on August 5, has tested the Martian surface for the first time on the Red Planet, Mars, and Europa. It's the second time in as many months that it has successfully tested Mars' surface. In the past two weeks, it's been testing the rover's ability to detect the presence of dust, dust and other debris in the Gale Crater. On Thursday, Curiosity tested its own soil and found it to be safe enough to land on Mars. \"The rover is doing well,\" said Jennifer Tropser, head of the US space agency's Mars Mission Directorate in Washington, D.C. She said she was pleased with the results, which she said were \"very, very good.\" \"It's a good start,\" she added, adding that she hoped the test results would be replicated in other areas of Mars as well, such as the red planet's surface, where dust can be found. But she cautioned that the tests would not be sufficient to prove that Mars was safe for humans to explore, as Mars is not a safe place for human habitation, she told AFP news agency (AFP, AP, Reuters). \"We're going to have to wait and see what happens, but we're hopeful that we'll be able to do something about it. We'll see how it goes.\" The test was carried out in Glenelg, near the southern end of Gale crater, on Wednesday and Thursday evening, before landing at the base of Mount Sharp, about a mile (1.93 kilometers) from the crater's edge. Curiosity is now in its second phase of testing, with a mission to Mars to test the soil's stability and stability. Its first test, in early August, was conducted on a rover called the Curiosity Mars rover. This is the third time Curiosity has test-bedbeded Mars in a series of tests that have been run on land and on water. All three tests were positive for a total of 1.94 billion euros ($2.5 billion) in total. That's more than a quarter of a billion dollars, according to the mission manager, who was not available for comment. More than half of those tests, however, came back positive, he said. For now, though, that's good news for Curiosity and for all of its mission managers. They're hoping that Curiosity will have a better chance of success than they had hoped for, given its success in testing Mars and its rocky environment. And they're optimistic about the future, too. So far so, they've had good results. Read more: Curiosity test: How to get the most out of your rover? How do you feel about Mars? Is it safe? Do you think Mars will be a place you want to go?

The Martian landscape looks very different than it did on Earth? Mars has a lot of interesting features, including the fact that there are so many different types of rocks. What's interesting is how many of these rocks are different from Earth's crust? And how much of them are the same rocks that are similar in size and shape? In some cases, there's even a difference between Earth and the Earth. Mars itself is a different kind of rock. You can see the difference in how the Mars surface is shaped by the sun."

        "target": "A borderline war The crisis in Syria is in danger of drawing in neighboring countries. Despite the Syrian government's immediate apology, the shelling on the Turkish border has led to concerns about possible escalation. These weren't the first incidents on the Syrian-Turkish border, but the fact that several people on the Turkish side were killed by Syrian shells on Wednesday (03.10.2012) has brought the conflict between the two countries to a new level. It has led the Turkish military to retaliate for the first time. Several people were killed when Turkey shelled Syrian territory. But neither Turkey, which is a member of NATO, nor Syria would benefit from a broader conflict. An adviser to the Turkish president tweeted, \"Turkey has no interest in a war with Syria.\" Volker Perthes, director of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs in Berlin, agrees: \"Assad has no interest in an escalation,\" he told DW. \"That can be seen from the fact that the Syrian information minister apologized and expressed his regret over the victims immediately after the attack on Turkish territory.\" Perthes doesn't think it's likely that the Syrian President, Bashar Assad, wants to provoke Turkey to intervene in Syria. \"That would only accelerate the fall of his regime,\" he said. It's not yet clear who was responsible for the shelling. According to Syria's ally, Russia, it was a \"tragic accident.\" Relationship damaged The armed incidents on the Syrian-Turkish border have been going on for months. According to Amnesty International, some 300,000 Syrians have left their country since the start of the uprising against Assad, and many of them have fled to Turkey. The relationship between the two countries, which used to be close, has deteriorated dramatically, and the Turkish government is now openly supporting the Syrian opposition. \"Turkey is itself a player in the Syrian conflict,\" said Perthes. \"It provides shelter for many refugees and it's through Turkey that supplies come for the opposition.\" NATO has lined up behind Turkey and told Syria to end its \"flagrant violations of international law.\" Call for 'great discretion' The German chancellor, Angel Merkel, has also positioned herself alongside Turkey. \"We call on all parties to show great discretion,\" she said in Berlin. The foreign minister, Guido Westerwelle, declared that everything must be done to deescalate the situation, so that the Syrian conflict did not turn into a conflagration in the region. Indeed, the Syrian crisis is not only spreading to Turkey, but also to Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon. According to Perthes, \"The neighboring countries are partly victims and partly instigators. Jordan too has taken in refugees and supplies the rebels. On the other hand, Iraq has tended to support the government of Bashar Assad.\" Even so, he said, all the neighboring countries had an interest in ensuring the conflict was confined to Syria. Appeal to the international community But the number of Syrian refugees is rising by the day. Ruth J\u00fcttner, a Middle East expert with Amnesty International, believes this will continue in future months. \"It's important that the countries bordering on Syria are supported by the international community in providing accommodation, medical and psychological care and schooling for children,\" she told DW. It's an appeal she directs especially to European countries. The shelling on the Syrian-Turkish border has made it more likely that there will be armed conflict between Syria and its neighbors. According to Perthes, \"It's probably the case that political resistance in Turkey to intervention in Syria is decreasing right now.\"",
        "generated_story": "German Institute for International and Security Affairs says Turkey's response to the Syrian conflict is \"not likely\" Germany's Foreign Minister Volker Perthes said on Wednesday that it was not likely that Turkey would intervene militarily in Syria. \"Turkey is not going to intervene,\" he told DW in an interview, adding that he was \"very concerned\" about the situation in the country, which has been suffering from an acute humanitarian crisis since the beginning of the year. The Turkish Foreign Ministry has said it will not intervene in any way to prevent the conflict from spreading to other parts of Syria, where it is believed to be the main source of humanitarian aid. In addition, the Turkish foreign ministry has warned that any military intervention would not be enough to stop the violence. On Wednesday, German foreign minister Guido Westerwelle said Turkey had \"no intention\" of intervening in a conflict between the two countries. He added that \"if it did intervene, it would be very difficult for Turkey to do so.\" \"If it didn't, then we would have to take a very hard line on it,\" the Foreign ministry spokesman said at a news conference in Berlin. According to German news agency DW, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has called for a \"total and complete withdrawal of all military forces\" from Syria and Iraq. Turkey, however, has so far refused to step in, saying it has no intention of doing so, according to a report by the German institute for international and security affairs (DIY), which is based in Germany. DW also reported that Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu had called on the government of President Bashar Assad to withdraw its troops from the war-torn country. But he did not say whether that was the case. Instead, he said, \"I think it's a matter of time before we get to that point.\" The German IISS, a think tank, said that if it had to, Turkey should have taken action immediately. It also said there was no reason to think that Assad would take any action at all, given the current situation, and that Russia should be ready to act quickly. However, there is a strong possibility that Ankara could take action in response, as well as other countries, including Jordan, Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey. If it doesn't intervene immediately, Russia will have no option but to use its military force against Assad's forces. Meanwhile, in neighboring Iraq, Syria's president, Hafez al-Assad, is due to return to power within the next few weeks. That would mean that Syria would face a new round of military action from Russia, Iran and the West, but not the same kind of response from Turkey and Russia. At the moment, though, that is unlikely, because of a lack of coordination between Ankara and Moscow. This is the first time that Germany has taken a step toward a military response against the Assad regime. For the past three years, Ankara has acted as a mediator between Assad and his opponents. Since the start of this conflict in 2011, this has led to an escalation of tensions between Moscow and Damascus. Last year, Germany and Jordan have been at loggerheads over the role of Turkey in Syrian politics, while Turkey has played a key role in supporting Assad in his fight against IS. Both sides have also been accused of using chemical weapons to try to weaken Assad. Russia and Iran are also at the forefront of that conflict, with the latter accusing the former dictator of violating international law and human rights. Syria is one of several countries in which the US and NATO are at odds over its role as guarantors of international security. Iran is also a guarantor of Syrian stability and stability, although it does not have the backing of Russia or the United States."

        "target": "Armstrong stripped of Tour de France titles Cyclist Lance Armstrong has been stripped of his seven Tour de France titles and banned from cycling for life, in a much-anticipated ruling by the sport's international governing body. Monday's announcement by Pat McQuaid, the president of the International Cycling Union, ratified recommendations in an October report from the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), which ordered Armstrong's Tour de France titles be wiped out. \"Lance Armstrong has no place in cycling,\" said McQuaid. Addressing his remarks to cyclists, McQuaid said the fight against doping was his priority. \"UCI is listening and is on your side. We\u2019ve come too far in the fight against doping to return to our past. Cycling has a future and something like this must not happen again.\" The scathing USADA report included testimony from 11 former teammates, accusing Armstrong of running the \"most sophisticated\" doping program in the sport's history. The USADA said it had collected evidence to prove the seven-time Tour de France winner had engaged in the biggest doping conspiracy to date. Effect on cycling and sponsorship Monday's decision comes as the sport of cycling reels from Armstrong's well-documented fall from grace. Organizers of the Tour de France will be trying to move on from the scandal as the race prepares to celebrate its centenary next year. Sponsors have been deserting Armstrong and the sport in general. Last week, Nike - one of Armstrong's main corporate sponsors - said it was terminating its relationship with the cyclist and accused him of deception. Trek, the company that made the bicycles Armstrong rode to seven titles, announced on the same day it would terminate its sponsorship contract - as did the beer maker Anheuser-Busch. The Dutch institution Rabobank ended its association with professional cycling after the doping allegations came to light, leaving 17 riders in need of a sponsor. Last week Armstrong also announced he would step down from his own charity, the Lance Armstrong Foundation, also known as Livestrong, a move believed to have been intended to limit the damage to the organization from the USADA report. Armstrong appears Lance Armstrong spoke briefly to thousands of riders in Texas at a benefit organized by his charity, the day before UCI's decision. \"I've been better, but I've also been worse,\" he said. \"Obviously it has been an interesting and difficult couple of weeks.\" jr/rc (Reuters, AFP, AP)",
        "generated_story": "Lance Armstrong stripped of Tour de France titles Lance Armstrong has been stripped by the International Cycling Union (IUCU) after he won three consecutive titles in October and October. Armstrong was stripped on Monday of his three major titles, including two in the Tour of France. \"I am very disappointed,\" Armstrong told reporters at a news conference in New York, adding that he would not be able to defend his titles for the first time in his career. He said he was \"very disappointed\" with the decision to strip Armstrong of the titles he had won in 2012 and 2013, when he led the team to victory in a stage race in which they were the favorites to win the overall title. The decision came after Armstrong, who won the title in 2004 and 2005, was accused of doping and had been banned from cycling for three years. His disqualification comes as the world's top cycling body, Rabobank, has announced that it will not renew its contract with Armstrong's team until the end of next year. It is not clear how long Armstrong will be banned, but it is unclear whether he will continue to compete in cycling, which is the sport's most important sport. In October, Armstrong won two titles at the Paris-Roubaix, the most recent of which came in 2005 and 2006, and in 2014, he also won four more titles. This time around, it was the second time he has won a major title, after winning the 2013 and 2014 editions. Both of those titles were won by Armstrong and his wife, Lance, in 2011 and 2012. Lance was also the runner-up in both the 2014 and 2015 editions, as well as in 2015 and 2016. However, last year he lost his third title to Armstrong in 2013 after a doping scandal that left him banned for life for a year and a half. On Monday, a judge stripped Lance of three titles and stripped him of two more, saying he did not have enough time to recover from his doping problems, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal (Reuters, AFP, AP) and the Associated Press (AP, Reuters) in an interview published on the website of a Dutch newspaper, \"The Independent\" (AFP) which reported that Armstrong had not been allowed to take part in any of these events, citing a lack of interest from the cycling and cycling federations. According to the report, an investigation was launched into Lance's alleged doping. But the investigation has not yet been completed and it has yet to be concluded whether Armstrong is guilty of any wrongdoing, although it could take several years to reach an agreement with his former team-mates. Read more: Lance has denied doping allegations against him, claiming he is a victim of \"a vicious cycle of abuse\" by cycling's governing body. 'I don't know what I would have done if I didn't have the opportunity to do with my life right now,' Lance told the news agency, referring to an incident that took place at his home in Austin, Texas, earlier this year that led to him being stripped from a cycling title by a local cycling federation. Anheuser-Busch (ABN) said it would investigate the allegations and that the company would take legal action against Armstrong if it found that Lance had violated the rules of sport, sport and sport by failing to comply with anti-doping laws. Further investigation is ongoing into the case of Lance and Lance\u2019s alleged involvement in doping in various sports, such as cycling. A number of other athletes have also been suspended for doping offences, with Lance being suspended from competition for two years for failing a drug test, while Lance is also barred from competing in several other sports due to his involvement with a sport-related drug. And Lance will have to undergo a medical examination in order to regain his status as a professional cyclist. That would be the last chance for Armstrong to return to competition, even if he does not receive a clean bill of health."

        "target": "Bayern blast five as Schalke draw Bayern Munich stamped their authority over the Bundesliga on Saturday, with a ruthless 5-0 drubbing of Hannover at home. Meanwhile, second-placed Schalke and third-placed Frankfurt were forced to share the points. With many critics saying Bayern might as well be given the giant Bundesliga dish already, perhaps the struggle for second is shaping up to be the more compelling battle. But Saturday afternoon's clash between second-placed Schalke and third-placed Frankfurt did not take a decisive turn, with the game ending in a 1-1 draw. Schalke drew first blood in the 11th minute, when Frankfurt's Stefan Aigner was dispossessed in midfield, and Lewis Holtby released Klaas-Jan Huntelaar in front of goal - the Dutchman's first in the Bundesliga since September. But the hapless Aigner waited just over 100 seconds to make amends for his error, when the Royal Blues allowed him a free header that left goalkeeper Lars Unnerstall with no chance. But neither side could make inroads in the second half, which allowed Dortmund to leap-frog both sides and claim second place. Bayern take command Meanwhile the imperious Bayern Munich dispelled any talk of winter form-dip - following last week's draw to Nuremberg - with a brutally efficient 5-0 win at home to Hannover. The Bavarians stormed to a 3-0 lead in just 37 minutes, celebrating a nifty overhead kick for star signing Javi Martinez in the fourth minute. Toni Kroos and Franck Ribery scored the next two against a Hannover side that were torn open at will. The overhead kick was the first for the 40-million-euro ($52-million) signing Martinez, and in the second half new defender Dante also opened his account with a straightforward header from a Kroos free-kick. The festival of football continued just four minutes later, when Mario Gomez - making first Bundesliga appearance of the season - slammed the ball into the net from a tight angle just 30 seconds after replacing Mario Mandzukic. Dortmund win The champions Dortmund, meanwhile, are still nine points behind Bayern after beating Mainz 2-1 away. It was a potentially tricky fixture in the town where J\u00fcrgen Klopp began his coaching career, and Mainz showed their brilliance in the fourth minute, when Elkin Soto knocked a dream ball into the path of Marco Caligiuri, whose volley fairly screamed into the top right corner. Dortmund's own star-Marco - national team player Marco Reus - leveled the scores just eight minutes later. Reus worked himself some room at the outer edge of the penalty area, and slotted a beautiful 17-meter effort into the far corner. And Dortmund's second goal, just before half-time, was equally aesthetic - a vertical ball bisected the Mainz defense perfectly down the middle, where Polish predator Robert Lewandowski got his eighth league goal of the season with a deft lob over the onrushing Christian Wetklo in goal. Allofs' homecoming Bremen's 1-1 draw at Wolfsburg had a special frisson of its own, as Wolfsburg's newly-minted sporting director Klaus Allofs faced the club he had served as general manager for over a decade. And there was some gesticulating from the Bremen bench in the general direction of the Wolfsburg management when the guests took the lead in the 35th minute. Just seconds after Wolfsburg missed several chances, Marko Arnautovic was left free in the box after Eljero Elia found space on the left and cut the ball back for the Austrian to finish. But Wolfsburg got their own back in the second half. In the 62th minute, Bremen were reduced to ten men when Lukas Schmitz was given second yellow card for a hard tackle on Adelino Vieirinha. Just two minutes later, Bas Dost took advantage of their guests' disorgnaization and smashed the ball into the goal after neat piece of play from Vieirinha. Dirty derby The Franconian derby between Greuther F\u00fcrth and Nuremberg was a cagey affair that ended in a frustrating 0-0 draw. The first half was marked mainly by a straight red card for Nuremberg's Markus Feulner after an ugly, flying lunge on Stephan F\u00fcrstner. But the home side's numerical advantage was short-lived - Sercan Sararer was also sent for an early ice bath after his high elbow on Javier Pinola was adjudged worthy of a second yellow card in the 61st minute. But the aggression in the tackles was not matched by ruthlessness in front of goal, and neither side could eke out any clear chances.",
        "generated_story": "Bayern Munich host Wolfsburg in the first Bundesliga game of the season on Saturday. The Bundesliga's top team is expected to be boosted by the return of star striker Javi Martinez, who is set to make his Bundesliga debut for the Bavarian club on Sunday. Bayern Munich will be looking to build on their impressive start to the Bundesliga season, which has seen them reach the quarter-finals in three consecutive seasons. They have already won three of their last four league matches, and they are looking forward to their first Champions League appearance since the end of last season. On Saturday, they will take on Mainz at home, where they have won the last three Bundesliga matches in a row. In the second half, the German side will have to settle for just one point, as the hosts have been struggling to find a way to keep up with the pace of Bundesliga play. \"We are not going to give up,\" said Bayern coach J\u00fcrgen Klopp, adding that he was \"very pleased\" with his side's performance in their 2-0 win over Nuremberg on Friday. He added that \"we will continue to work hard to get the best out of our players and our fans.\" The Bavarians, meanwhile, are hoping for a strong performance from the Dutchman who has been a key part of Bayern's title success in recent years. After a disappointing first half in which they were beaten 3-1 by N\u00fcrnberg, Bayern were able to come back and win the game. However, it was not enough to stop the Germans from making the most of a difficult Bundesliga campaign. At the same time, their coach, Franz Beckenbauer, said that they would be \"extremely disappointed\" to lose to a German team that has struggled for form for some time. But, he added, \"I am very happy that we are in this position. We have a lot of quality in our squad and we will try to do everything we can in order to win this game.\" In a statement, Bayer Leverkusen sporting director Stefan Aigner said: \"It is a very important moment for our team. It is the beginning of an important season for us as a team and for all of us, we have the opportunity to improve on the form we've had so far this season.\" He also pointed out that Bayern will not be without a few key players, such as Mario Mandzukic and Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, but that the team will still be in good shape. That is not to say that it won't be an easy task, however, because the two teams have had a good run in Germany's second-tier Bundesliga. Both teams are struggling with injuries and a lack of fitness, so it is important to focus on that. For example, at the weekend, Bremen were playing without their best player, Franck Ribery, in an effort to strengthen their defense, while Bayern had to rely on a number of young players who have struggled to score goals. As a result, Dortmund were unable to secure a point against their Bundesliga opponents. And that was a big reason for their failure to qualify for next season's Bundesliga, when they lost to Hannover 96 and drew 1-2 with N.B. Bavaria. Despite the fact that their top-four opponents have not won a single league game in four years, a third-place finish is still in doubt for this year's competition, with only two points separating them from fourth-placed Borussia Dortmund and Bayern in third place. This is also the third consecutive season that Dortmund have missed out on qualification, after losing to Bayern last year and Dortmund last time out. Last year, Schalke were the only team to beat Bayern. Now, that is no longer the case. Instead, there is an opportunity for Bayern to take a step forward and get back into the top four. If they do that, then they can be even more successful."

        "target": "Is China seeking regime-change in North Korea? The sudden reduction in aggressive rhetoric and actions by North Korea has led to suggestions that Pyongyang has realized it has pushed its only ally in the region to the brink of severing its friendship. The announcement in Pyongyang on May 13 of the promotion of Jang Jong-nam to \"minister of the People's Armed Forces\" came out of the blue. Until recently, the little-known commander of an army corps in coastal Kangwon Province, Jang has replaced Kim Kyok-sik, a four-star general with a long track record of loyal service to the regime. The reasons for 70-year-old Kim's replacement are not clear - as with most of the political maneuvers in North Korea - but it may have been his loyalty that cost him his position in the politburo. Kim was widely seen as a hawk in the regime and is believed to have been in command of the operation to shell the South Korean island of Yeonpyeongdo in November 2010, an incident that killed four people, destroyed civilians' homes and infrastructure and dramatically worsened the already strained relationship between Pyongyang and Seoul. By sacrificing Kim, analysts believe, North Korea is signaling that it is backing away from the confrontational stance it adopted after the United Nations imposed new sanctions in the wake of the nation's third underground nuclear test in February. And there are other indicators that Pyongyang is seeking to return to the status quo. The North's troops have been permitted to step down from the highest state of preparedness for war that was initially ordered when South Korea and the US began a series of annual military exercises. Missiles withdrawn Similarly, two Musudan intermediate-range missiles that were identified as being on mobile launchers being operated in eastern areas of the country have apparently been ordered to return to base. In late April, there was concern that test-launches of the missiles would be a further escalation by Kim Jong-un's government and a message that it would not bow to international pressure to halt its nuclear and missile development programs. But the analysts believe the tokens of Pyongyang's goodwill have come too late. \"For the North Korean leader, this is a very difficult time,\" Toshimitsu Shigemura, a professor at Tokyo's Waseda University and an authority on North Korean affairs, told DW. \"Timing is very important here and it is possible that China is moving to abandon Kim Jong-un. The atmosphere between the two nations is changing. China may have decided that it is time for a regime-change in the North, they will not permit the collapse of the country because they do not want chaos on their own borders.\" Further evidence that Beijing is slowly tightening the screw on its erstwhile ally comes as more state-run financial institutions sever their links with banks in North Korea. The latest institution to adhere to the government's orders to halt transactions across the border is the Bank of China, one of the four major banks in the country, which announced on May 7 that it would cease dealings with the Foreign Trade Bank of North Korea, which has been identified as being involved in Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs. Contingency plan in place Intelligence sources have passed on to DW information that Beijing has a contingency plan in place for when Kim Jong-un's control over the country crumbles. The reports confirm that China is indeed quietly encouraging regime change and is grooming Kim's brother, Kim Jong-nam to take over his role. At 42, Kim Jong-nam is the oldest son of Kim Jong-il, the dictator who ruled North Korea with an iron fist for 17 years until his sudden death in December 2011. Kim Jong-nam had been expected to assume the leadership after his father's death, but fell from favor spectacularly in 2001 when he was detained with two women and a boy aged 4 at Tokyo's Narita International Airport travelling on a forged Dominican Republic passport. He later admitted that he had wanted to visit Disneyland. He subsequently lived in Macau and Beijing, under the close watch of the Chinese authorities. The reports suggest that after Kim Jong-nam is installed in Pyongyang, his brother will be permitted to go into exile, probably in China. The tactic is not without its pitfalls, however, in part due to the efficiency of the campaign to deify their young leader as the future of the nation. Kim Jong-nam as 'new king' \"China may be dreaming of appointing Kim Jong-nam as the new king - and he is more preferable to the West than Kim Jong Un - but the problem is that he is not known in North Korea,\" said Ken Kato, director of Tokyo-based Human Rights in Asia. \"Many people in Japan know much about the North Korean 'Royal Family,' but this information is hidden in North Korea,\" he said. \"Even residents of Pyongyang know very little about Kim Jong-nam.\" Yet the reports are gaining credence among North Korea-watchers. Jun Okumura, a political analyst with the Eurasia Group, told DW that North Korea withdrawing",
        "generated_story": "North Korea's 'new king' Kim Jong-un has become the new king of North Korea. The North Korean leader has been in power for more than a decade. He is also the country's most powerful leader. In 2011, he became the first person to be elected to the presidency of the Republic of Korea (ROK) by the People's Armed Forces. Since then, his popularity has soared, and he has won a lot of praise from the international community for his leadership. On May 7, Kim was sworn in as the nation's new head of state in a ceremony held in Pyongyang. Kim, who was born in 1950, was also sworn-in as a \"king\" by his father. His father, Jang Jong Nam, had been the leader of his country since the 1950-53 Korean War, which ended in the end of World War II in 1953. \"He is a very strong leader,\" Kim said at the time, adding that he was \"a very good man.\" Kim has since become Kim's successor, but he is not the only one who has made the decision to step down from his post as leader, according to Kim. According to a report in The New York Times, \"Kim is the most important person in our country.\" He has also been a strong critic of US President Donald Trump's economic policies, saying that the US should not be allowed to impose sanctions on the North because of its nuclear and missile programs. But he also said that it was a mistake to allow Kim to take over the leadership of a country he had ruled for so long. That's not to say that Kim did not have the right to rule over his own country, though, as he did during his time in office, when the United Nations Security Council (UN) sanctions were imposed on Pyongyang in December 2011 for violating the terms of an arms embargo. It's also not clear whether Kim will be able to continue his rule as long as Kim is alive, or whether he will continue to seek to use his power as an instrument of political and economic power. If Kim does not, it's because he won't have a chance to do so. As for Kim himself, there's no doubt he would like to see Kim succeed in his quest to become a new ruler. However, that doesn't mean he's going to give up on his plans for a nuclear-armed country. For now, the two leaders are working on a plan to make it a more peaceful and stable one. They have been working together for the past year and a half, with the aim of creating a stable, stable and prosperous regime in which Kim can rule with his family and close ties to his people. And they're working hard to ensure that they can do that. So far, they've managed to achieve that by working closely with each other and working with other countries, including China, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, China and Taiwan. This is one of those countries where the UN has called for an end to sanctions against Pyongyang's nuclear program. China's Foreign Trade Bank (FTR) and the Bank of China (BoC) have also called on Kim and his government to work together to end the nuclear weapons program in order to prevent it from being used against the West.

        "target": "UK lawmakers propose jail sentences for reckless bankers A British parliamentary commission has completed its work on the overhaul of the domestic banking sector. Among other things, it proposed jail terms for bankers displaying grave malpractice and causing huge damage. Members of the UK's Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards agreed Wednesday that Britain needed a radical overhaul of its scandal-hit lenders. The panel, which was mostly composed of lawmakers, concluded in its final report that senior bankers must be made personally responsible for malpractice through the introduction of a new criminal offence of reckless misconduct. It would carry a prison sentence. The reputation of the country's banking sector had been damaged in recent years by a string of scandals, including Libor rate-rigging, credit insurance mis-selling and a controversy over staff behavior and bonuses in the run-up to the 2008 global financial crisis. The level of malpractice had been \"shocking and widespread,\" said the commission's chairman, Conservative party lawmaker Andrew Tyrie. RBS cut in two? \"Taxpayers and customers have lost out, and the economy has suffered,\" the 500-page report said. \"Under our recommendations, senior bankers who seriously damage their banks or put taxpayers' money at risk can expect to be fined, banned from the industry or in the worst cases go to jail.\" The commission called for bankers to sign up to a new code of conduct under which all key responsibilities within a bank would be assigned to specific senior officials who would be held responsible. The panel also proposed that more remuneration for bankers should be deferred for longer periods of up to ten years in order to \"reflect the longer run balance between business risks and rewards.\" The commission recommended that the government consider splitting the state-rescued Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) into a good bank and a bad one mopping up toxic assets. The report was published ahead of a key speech by Finance Minister George Osborne on his bank reform plans. hg/ipj (AFP, Reuters)",
        "generated_story": "Reprehensibility of Bank Mafia: A British Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards (PBS) has issued a report on the banking mafia in Britain. The commission, led by former finance minister George Osborne, said it was \"reprehensible\" that the Libor benchmark, the benchmark interest rate (Libor), was set at 0.5 per cent in 2008. \"It is reprehensibly high,\" the commission said in its report, which was published on Wednesday. It said the bank Mafia was responsible for the rise in the value of the British pound, and that it had become increasingly difficult for people to understand how it could be so easy for a bank to raise interest rates without the help of a central bank. According to the Commission, it is not the first time that this has happened. In 2008, Britain's banking system was the world's most complex, with a total of more than 1.6 trillion pounds ($2.4 trillion) in reserves, according to a parliamentary commission on banking standards. Since then, however, there have been a number of scandals, including a scandal involving the misuse of bank accounts by the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), which has been the subject of widespread criticism for years. This is the second time in as many years that Britain has had to deal with the financial mafia. At the time of its 2008 financial crisis, British banks were the biggest banks in Europe and the United States, accounting for around one-third of all deposits in British banking institutions. But that has changed in recent years, as the scandal has spread to other financial institutions across the UK and in other parts of Europe. That has led to an increase in speculation about the size of banks and how much they are able to spend on their own. There have also been reports that some banks have taken advantage of this phenomenon to increase their profits, while others, such as Standard Chartered Bank, have not done so at all. For example, Barclays and HSBC are the only two banks that are allowed to charge interest on deposits, but the other banks are not. And that's not to say that they don't have the right to do so, because they do have a lot of money in their accounts. However, that doesn't necessarily mean they can't do it, either. If they have to, they should be doing it in a way that makes it easier for them to get their money out of their account, rather than just borrowing from the banks. So, what do you think? The Commission's report is based on its findings from a study conducted by Andrew Tyrie, an economist at the University of Oxford, who has written a book on bank fraud. He said that \"there is no doubt that there is a huge amount of fraud going on in this country.\" The bank mafia, he said, had been operating at a high level since the 2008 crash, when the government was in power. They were also accused of stealing money from British taxpayers and using it to finance their lavish lifestyles in order to enrich themselves and their families. On Wednesday, a committee of lawmakers from both the Conservative and Labour parties met in London to discuss the issue. Tyri said they were \"very concerned\" about how the money was being spent, adding that banks had \"a lot to hide.\" \"We are very concerned about this,\" he told reporters in an interview on BBC Radio 4's \"Today's Agenda\" program, \"and we want to make sure that we are doing everything we can to prevent this from happening again.\" He added: \"I think we need to be very careful about what we do in terms of how we spend our money.\""

They were originally arrested for taking photographs of restricted areas. Slovak citizens detained by the Iranian authorities on suspicion of taking photographs out of bounds have returned home, said Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico. Eight people in total were arrested in May after taking photographs of restricted areas. A Slovakian news website said the group was detained near the central city of Isfahan, where Iran has nuclear facilities. The six that have been freed attended a news conference held by Prime Minister Fico in the capital, Bratislava on Sunday. Fico told reporters that the government was working to secure the release of the remaining two paragliders who are stiil in custody. \"Negotiations were fair and their result is the release of six out of eight detainees,\" Fico was quoted as saying on the government's website. He added that Slovakia had not made any \"financial commitments\" in the negotiation process. Detainees 'unaware' of rule-breaking One of the released paragliders, Vladislav Frigo, said the group did not break any rules it was aware of. \"We had information that there was a ban on taking photographs below the height of 2,300 metres. We were taking pictures from higher (altitudes),\" said Frigo. He added that the detainees were well treated, had access to television, a refrigerator and could cook for themselves as well as getting regular meals. Foreign nationals accused of spying In recent years, Iran has levelled accusations of espionage against both foreign nationals and Iranians. Two U.S. citizens - Josh Fattal and Shane Bauer - were sentenced to eight years in jail for spying after being arrested while hiking along the Iraq-Iran border in 2009. They denied espionage - neighbouring Oman helped secure their release in 2011 by posting bail of 1-million US dollars (756,000 euros). Last year, Iranian-American Amir Hekmati was sentenced to death for spying for the CIA, but judges overturned the decision and ordered a retrial. lw/ipj (Reuters, dpa)",
        "generated_story": " Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico has ordered the release of six Americans suspected of spying for the United States. They were arrested on Sunday in the eastern city of Bratislava. The Americans, who are believed to have been spying on Slovaks for years, have denied any involvement in any of the alleged crimes. \"We are not aware of any wrongdoing by the Americans,\" the head of Slovakia's intelligence agency said in a statement, adding that they had not been charged with any crime. Slovakia has been cooperating with the U.S. government in its investigation into the case, which began in 2009, and has since expanded to include other countries, including Iran, Iraq, Syria and Iraq. In the past, the US has accused Slovakia of being a \"hostile country\" for Iranian spies. On Sunday, Slovakia announced that it had arrested six American citizens on suspicion of espionage and attempted to extradite one of them to Iran for questioning, according to a court filing. Slovakers have said they have not yet been able to prove their innocence, but that the charges against the six were politically motivated and could be brought to an international court. According to the court document, they are being held without bail until the end of May, when they can be extradited back to their home country of Isfahan, where they will face charges of attempted espionage, money laundering and other offenses. Prosecutors have also asked for their arrest in connection with a case in which they say they were involved in an attempt to obtain information on the whereabouts of Americans in Iraq and Syria. Officials said the men had been detained for several days and were being questioned by authorities in their homes and offices in eastern Slovakia. (Reuters, AP, AFP, dpa, Reuters) \"They are accused of trying to influence the outcome of a political process in Slovakia,\" said a government spokesman, Vladislav Frigo. He did not give a reason for his detention, however, saying it was \"a matter of national security.\" \"It is not a crime to spy on people,\" he said, referring to US intelligence agencies and the intelligence services, he added. 'It's not something that we want to do. It's something we have to think about and we will do as a country and as an institution. We don't want it to happen to us.\" The government has said it will continue to monitor the situation and take appropriate measures to ensure that no one is caught up in what it is doing. But it has not ruled out the possibility of an extradition request, or even a trial, for which it could take place, as long as the extradition process is completed. If that happens, it would be a long time before Slovakia is allowed to make a decision on whether to seek extradition. That is, if it can find a way to get a fair deal with Iran. For now, that is the only way that Slovakia can get out of its current political mess. There is also the option of extraditing the American man to Tehran. This is a very difficult situation for Slovakia to resolve, because it does not have a lot of political power in this country. However, there is no way of knowing what will happen when it comes to its political future. As the country prepares to leave the European Union next year, a number of politicians are expected to step down from the post of prime minister in order to focus on other issues, such as its economy and its prospects for a new government. A few weeks ago the Slovaker parliament passed a law that would allow the government to take steps to remove the president from office. At the same time, some lawmakers have called for an end to visa restrictions on travel to Washington, D.C. to avoid the travel ban, while others have expressed concern about the prospect of travel restrictions."

The 89-year-old did not say when exactly his resignation would take effect. Calling the move a personal decision, President Giorgio Napolitano made his announcement during an end-of-year speech on Wednesday. \"I'm about to step down, to resign as the constitution expressly allows,\" he said, adding. \"I've reached an age that brings with it growing limitations and difficulties for me to do my institutional duties, which are complex and very demanding.\" Though he did not say when his resignation would take effect, a potential date is January 13 when Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi is due to give up the country's rotating six-month presidency of the Council of the European Union. Renzi faces a political challenge in organizing a replacement for Napolitano, dubbed by Italian media as \"King George.\" The president has served as a key intermediary between political parties through numerous changes in government and other tricky political situations. Napolitano, a former communist respected by Europe and Washington, took office in 2006. At the end of his seven-year mandate in 2013, he was asked to stay on because parliament could not agree on his successor. At the time he warned he may not serve out the full term, given his age. In Italy, presidents have loosely-defined powers including the ability to nominate prime ministers, dissolve parliament and veto legislation, as well as use the moral authority of the office to influence politics. se/cmk (dpa, Reuters)",
        "generated_story": "Giorgio Napolitano resigns as Italy's president The Italian president has resigned as president of the European Union (EU) following a series of resignations. The resignation comes a day after he was forced to step down by Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, who had been in office for more than a year and a half. \"I am resigning because I am no longer able to serve in the position of president. I have been unable to do so for a long time and I do not want to be a part of this mess,\" the prime minister said in a statement on Wednesday, adding that he had \"no choice but to resign.\" The president's resignation came after the EU's executive Council of Ministers voted in favor of his resignation on January 13. It was the first time the bloc's top executive body, the Council, had taken a decision on whether to take the presidency or to stay on as head of state until the end of next year, according to a report by the Italian news agency dpa, which cited a US official as saying that the president had resigned because of \"a lack of confidence in his ability to lead the country.\" \"There is no doubt in my mind that this is a very difficult decision for me to make,\" said the official, referring to the decision to quit the post in which he has been serving since 2006, when he took over from former Italian Prime Ministrado Renz (RENA) and was elected by a majority of Italian voters in 2006. He was replaced by Renzo, whose term ends in January 2013. After the resignation, Renza said he would not seek re-election, but he did not rule out the possibility of a second term. Renzan said that Renanz would seek a third term and that his successor would be elected in 2014. However, he refused to say whether he planned to seek another term, saying he wanted to focus on the economy and the people of Italy, rather than on his own political future. In a rare move, a new president will be chosen for the role of vice-president, and he is expected to remain in that role for at least the next five years. According to an Italian newspaper, \"The New York Times\" reported that \"Renzi will seek to replace the outgoing president with a technocrat who will take over the reins of power at the same time as the new President.\" RenZ has said his government will continue to work on economic and social reforms, including a plan to reduce the number of EU member states. But he also said it was too early to talk about the future of Europe's relationship with the United States and how it might be affected by Trump's move to impose tariffs on imports from the U.S. and other European countries, as well as how the US would react to his decision. Napoli resigned from his post as EU president on Tuesday, citing a \"personal conflict of interest\" between the two countries. His resignation was announced after a two-day meeting of European leaders in Washington, D.C. that was held in an attempt to reach a consensus on how to handle the situation in Italy. That meeting, however, failed to produce any agreement on a deal on immigration, migration and EU membership. Instead, it came as a surprise to many Italians who were expecting a change of government. They were disappointed to learn that it had not been agreed to, despite the fact that they had already been given the opportunity to have a chance to discuss the issue with their counterparts in Brussels, Washington and Rome. This was not an easy decision, they said, given that there was a lot of uncertainty about what would happen in their own country's future in terms of immigration policy. There was also a sense of unease among Italians about whether they would have the right to travel to Washington. For example, there were reports that Italy was planning to move out of its current EU-member bloc of 28 members. These reports are not true, though, since the current government has not yet made any mention of any such move. Many Italians have expressed concern about how this would affect the relationship between Italy and Washington in recent years, especially in light of recent US sanctions on Russia and China."

        "target": "Libya factions declare ceasefire After two days of peace talks in Geneva, a tentative ceasefire has been called in the restive North African country. Although they sent no representatives to Switzerland, Islamists have agreed to halt the fighting. The Islamist-backed militia alliance that took over Tripoli and installed its own government announced a ceasefire on Friday, following a breakthrough in Geneva-based peace talks. Despite not attending the UN-brokered meeting, the militias have agreed to \"a ceasefire on all fronts,\" according to a statement issued by Islamist group Fajr Libya (Libya Dawn). The only condition is that \"the other parties respect the truce.\" The announcement came hours after the United Nations declared that Libya's warring factions had agreed to a roadmap for forming a unity government. Nearly four years after a NATO-backed revolt saw Moammar Gadhafi removed from power, two rival governments each backed by different groups of militias have plunged the country back into chaos and threatened all-out civil war. After the elected government of Prime Minister Abdullah al-Thinni was forced out of Tripoli by Libya Dawn, it was forced to move to the far eastern city of Tobruk while Libya Dawn reinstated the old parliament known as the GNC. The fighting and violence has displaced hundreds of thousands of civilians, left hundreds killed and thousands wounded. Most foreign diplomats fled the country and shut their embassies last year. The Tobruk government, as well as a few other factions who favor a peaceful resolution, came to Geneva to work on \"confidence-building measures,\" which includes the release of detainees from both sides, opening closed ports and securing safe freedom of movement around the country. es/bw (AP, AFP, Reuters)",
        "generated_story": "Fajr Libya declares ceasefire after two days of peace talks Libya has declared a ceasefire in the second day of a two-day ceasefire talks in Geneva, Switzerland, on Friday. The two sides have agreed to hold talks at the GNC headquarters in Tobruk, the capital of the North African country, until the end of this week. A ceasefire has been declared by the Libyan government, which has called for an end to the violence that has gripped the country for more than two weeks. It is the first time in two years that the government of former dictator Moammar Gadhafi, who was ousted in 2011, has announced that he will step down from his post as prime minister. \"We will continue to negotiate,\" said Abdullah al-Thinni, head of Libya's General National Congress (GNC), which was set up in February to try to end the civil war between the two rival factions that have been fighting for two decades in Tripoli and the eastern city of Misrata for the past three years. On Friday, a truce broke down after a week-long ceasefire broke out between rival groups in a bid to break the deadlock, according to a statement released by a Libyan military spokesman. In the meantime, talks were continuing on the sidelines of an international peace conference in Switzerland in which the three sides agreed on a cease-fire and a roadmap for a peaceful transition of power. Both sides said they would resume talks on Saturday, but that they had not reached a deal on what to do with the ceasefire. They had been holding talks since the beginning of last week, when a group of armed groups, including the Islamic State (IS, formerly known as the \"Islamic State\"), seized control of Tripoli from the army. Since then, they have held talks with a number of other rebel factions in Libya, as well as a handful of Islamist groups. At the start of Friday's talks, both sides promised to reach an agreement on how to deal with each other. However, it was not immediately clear if the truce would be reached, and it is not clear whether the talks would go ahead as planned, or whether they will be held at a later date. According to an official statement, there was no immediate announcement of any new ceasefire, although a UN peacekeeping mission had said it would hold a meeting on Monday to discuss the situation. But the UN has said that it has not yet decided whether or not to impose a new round of ceasefire on Libya. UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said in an interview with Reuters that \"the ceasefire will not take place until at least the next day.\" \"The ceasefire does not have to be agreed upon immediately,\" he said, adding that Libya would not be able to agree on any terms. He added that negotiations would continue until a final deal was reached on Thursday, after which it could be decided on which side to resume the peace process. Last week's ceasefire was called off, following a failed attempt by rival forces to force the withdrawal of troops from Tripoli. That was followed by talks between two rebel groups that had tried to prevent the return of civilians to their homes in eastern Libya for several days. This was the third time that talks had failed, however, with one rebel group claiming to have won the right to return to its home base in Benghazi and another group seeking to take over the city's capital, Tripoli, from a former regime loyal to Gaddafi. Another rebel faction has also demanded a change in leadership, saying it should be allowed to remain in power for as long as there is a transitional government in place. Libya is currently fighting a three-year-old uprising that began in January."

        "target": "Report: Torture is a European problem too A day after Amnesty International published a report on Europe's collusion with the CIA's torture program, the Council of Europe published its own shocking survey of abuse in detention centers across the continent. Prison guards in several European countries carried out reprisals against detainees who talked to the Council of Europe's Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT), the new CPT report has revealed. The council considers this a violation of the spirit of cooperation between the CPT and the Council of Europe's member states. According to the CPT's 24th General Report, released on Wednesday, reprisals were carried out against prisoners in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Greece, Hungary, Moldova, Russia, Spain, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and Ukraine. \"Intimidation or retaliation against persons the CPT has interviewed may not only violate their human rights but also strikes a blow to the preventive mechanism established by the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture,\" CPT President Letif H\u00fcseynov said in a statement. \"I urge national authorities to respect their obligation to prevent, investigate and punish such actions.\" The report also highlighted several problems with the detention of juveniles around Europe, and proposed a series of practical measures to protect young people's rights when detained. Ad hoc visits The little-known CPT, now 25 years old, represents a unique approach to international torture prevention. A team of specialists make roughly 180 visits a year to all kinds of detention centers (including prisons, police stations, holding centers for immigration detainees, psychiatric hospitals, and even social care homes) all across the 47-member Council of Europe - one of the few international blocs that offer platforms for dialogue with Eastern European regimes considered to have poor human rights records, such as Russia, Azerbaijan, and Ukraine. The method combines the carrot of talks with government officials and the stick of ad hoc visits, which all members are committed to allowing into their prisons. Once inside, the CPT also has the right to interview any detainees it chooses - in private, though of course the detainees have the right to refuse. \"The first thing to say is how important the CPT is,\" said Carla Ferstman, director of Redress, a UK-based organization that helps torture survivors. \"As a result of their boot work over a very long period of time, the UN has set up a global system which in many ways mirrors the approach of the CPT.\" But given that the committee has no powers to enforce its proposals to governments, there are question marks over its effectiveness. \"In the report, they complain about how some of the recommendations they've made have not been implemented,\" said Ferstman. \"It's a sign that they're a little bit frustrated.\" But in the long run, she maintains, the CPT has more than proved its value. \"The dialogue that they are able to have is really important,\" she said. \"Looking long-term, they have been very effective.\" CIA collusion, asylum seekers The CPT's report comes a day after Amnesty International released its own report on European collusion with the CIA's torture program. While the CPT's report examines more prosaic day-to-day mistreatment, rather than mass rendition of terrorist suspects at the behest of the US, there are obvious links between the two, since some countries - such as Poland, Macedonia, and the UK - are highlighted in both reports. \"What is finally coming out in all of this is that the Europeans, despite all the criticism of the Bush and Obama administrations on the use of torture - so many of them connived,\" said Judy Dempsey, senior associate at Carnegie Europe. \"It's really a double standard. This report is quite damning and quite shameful, and it follows the Amnesty International one as well.\" The CPT's work also mentions the mistreatment of asylum seekers, a problem increasingly afflicting European countries that take in the largest number of asylum seekers - particularly Spain, Italy, and Greece. \"With Greece there are two things to remember,\" Dempsey told DW. \"A - the appalling situation of the prison system, and B - the lack of training among police of how to deal with asylum seekers. Awful things have happened. Parallel to this is the illegal detention centers. There have been lots of cases of terrible mistreatment over the last several years.\" \"Immigration detention is a growing issue,\" added Ferstman. \"In the UK, there was a whole parliamentary inquiry into one immigration detention center, where some of the women alleged that guards propositioned them in order to get quick treatment on their claims. Each country has its own history of torture.\"",
        "generated_story": "The CPT is a European problem, and it's time to step up its game. The US has been accused of torturing its own citizens for decades. But the US is not the only one. It is also the first country in Europe to use torture as a form of torture. In the United States, torture has become a major problem for human rights groups, including Amnesty International and the Committee for the Prevention of Torture (Redress), which is working to end the practice. For example, the U.S. has used torture in the past, but it has also been used in other countries, such as Italy, Greece, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, Serbia, Ukraine, Bosnia and Ukraine. This is the second time in a long time that a US president has tried to torture his own people. Last year, US President George W. Bush accused the CIA of using torture to extract confessions from victims of crimes against humanity (CPT). The CIA, however, has denied the allegations, saying it was not aware of any torture at all. \"The US government has not done anything to stop the torture of its citizens,\" Bush said at a news conference in Berlin on Wednesday. He added that \"the US should be doing something about it.\" \"We should do something,\" he said, adding that he was \"not going to be able to do anything about torture.\" He also said that torture \"is not something that can be tolerated in any other country,\" and that it should not be allowed to take place in countries where torture is legal. That's why we need to get rid of it, he added. And that's what we're doing right now. We're working on it. Letif H\u00fcseynov, head of Redress, told DW: \"It's not a matter of whether or not we have to put up with torture, or whether we should just let it go.\" In a letter to the president, Obama said he would be \"very happy\" with the outcome of the G7 summit, which will be held later this year in Poland and Romania. However, it is important to remember that this is only the beginning of a very long and difficult process. There are many more countries that are still trying to implement the Geneva Convention. I think it will take a lot of work to make sure that we are doing the right thing, because we don't want it to happen again.\" The UN's General Assembly is expected to hold a special meeting on Thursday to discuss the issue at the end of this week's session. According to a report by the committee's chairman, Carla Ferstman, a former US torture expert, President Barack Obama will not attend the meeting. She said it would take \"a lot longer\" to reach a consensus on the subject, given that the UN has already made a number of recommendations on how to deal with this issue. On Wednesday, she said she would not rule out the possibility of an EU-wide vote on whether to ratify the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR) until the year's end, when the EU's executive committee will meet in Brussels to decide on a new draft resolution on torture and other issues. At the same time, there will also be a chance for a vote of no confidence from the Council of Europe on EU member states, as well as the International Criminal Court (ICC) to approve a resolution that would allow the use of force against the perpetrators of mass torture. If that happens, then it could be the start of another long-term debate about whether torture should continue."

        "target": "Dresden marks 70 years since massive Allied bombing Seventy years ago, Allied bombers attacked Dresden, killing tens of thousands of people, the majority of them civilians and refugees. Every year, the East German city remembers its dead. DW's Naomi Conrad was on hand. As the tram trundled through Dresden's drab suburbs on Friday morning, a prim, elderly woman suddenly turned to her friend sitting on the seat beside her: \"You know, my mother never told me about the bombings.\" She shrugged, then, after a moment's pause, continued. \"It must have been such unspeakable hell that she just couldn't talk about it,\" the woman said. She was referring to February 13, 1945 - the morning, exactly 70 years ago, when Allied bombers swooped down on an unsuspecting city famous for its baroque architecture and that, until that point, had survived the war mostly unscathed. That was to change in the course of three dreadful days: As the bombs rained down on the city, its churches and palaces were turned to rubble. Up to 25,000 people - many of them refugees fleeing the advancing Soviet Red Army - died in the inferno that raged in the city for days. \"There was nothing left, nothing,\" a frail, bent man with a checkered cap recalled, \"just rubble and death.\" He was leaning on the balustrade of a viewing platform in Dresden's old gasometer, staring down at the 360-degree painting by the Iranian-German artist Yadegar Asisi; sirens howled from hidden speakers and strobe lighting illuminated the ruined churches and black smoke billowing from the burnt skeletons that were once buildings. The man swallowed, his voice hoarse, barely audible: \"It's so hard being here.\" The soundtrack and images, he said, \"bring back too many memories.\" 'So, so many dead' He was 15, he recalled, working on a school essay when the sirens began to wail. He never finished the essay. Instead, he ran for shelter with his family. When they returned home three days later, the roof had been blown off, the windows smashed. \"But we were lucky: We survived,\" he said. \"There were so, so many dead.\" His voice broke and, muttering an apology, he shuffled off. The bombings were intended to break the German population's morale - a decision that to many was incomprehensible, given that the war had long been decided and Dresden's economic and strategic importance was relatively minimal. Consequently, the death and destruction wreaked by the Allied bombers quickly became a tool, first for the Nazi propagandists in the last months of the war, then by the East German regime for its anti-West propaganda, and then later by neo-Nazi groups, who traditionally congregate on February 13. Even today, \"the debate continues about guilt and innocence, even about the exact number of victims,\" Dresden Mayor Helma Orosz told a packed audience, including delegations from abroad, gathered for a memorial service in the city's Frauenkirche, which in 2005 was rebuilt with the help of private donations after Germany's reunification, many of them from the United States and Great Britain. Call for peace \"War, hatred and violence begin in people's minds,\" Orosz said. \"We must resist any attempt at once again categorizing people based on their origin and skin color,\" she added, referring to what has often been described as a right-wing catchall movement called PEGIDA, generally translated as Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West, which has taken to the streets in Dresden since October. Later, on a platform overlooking thousands of people, many of them wearing white roses as a sign of peace while bracing the icy cold outside the church, Orosz called on Dresden to remember every victim of the Nazi terror - a plea that was reiterated by German President Joachim Gauck when he took to the microphone: \u201cWe don't want the pain that people suffered here to be misused by others.\u201d Behind him, the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, who, back in the Frauenkirche, had talked of the \u201cmiracle that peace in Europe represents,\u201d leaned in closer to his interpreter. Then, as evening fell over Dresden and church bells tolled, thousands - possibly as many as 10,000, according to the city's press office - lined up along Dresden's riverfront, holding hands to commemorate the dead and call for peace as police men dressed in black riot gear looked on. \"I can remember it all,\" Siegfriede Leonhard, a vivacious woman in her late 70s said. She was 7 when the bombs fell, she said, and had been coming to the commemorations in Dresden \"for at least 60 years.\" Sometimes, she said, stomping her feet to keep warm, she wondered whether she shouldn't remember at home, alone. \"",
        "generated_story": "Dresden, Germany (AFP) -- German Chancellor Joachim Gauck was assassinated on February 13, 1945 in Dresden, the capital of the former Soviet Union. The German capital was hit by a series of Allied bombings in February 1945, when the Soviet Red Army attacked the eastern city of Dresden. It was the first time Germany had been targeted by an Allied bombing campaign since World War II. In the days following the bombing, Dresden's mayor, Helma Orosz, was killed in a car bomb attack. She was a member of parliament for the Communist Party of Germany, which was founded in 1945. \"The bombing was carried out by the German army,\" she told DW in an interview on Friday, adding that she was not aware of any such attack until the day before the attack, and that it had taken place in the city's old city hall. German police said they were still investigating the incident, but that they had not found any evidence of an attack on Dresden or any other part of eastern Germany. They were not able to provide any information on the bomber's location, however, because of a lack of information about the bomb. According to the Berliner Zeitung, a number of people were killed, including a woman who was shot and wounded during a bombing raid. Many of those killed were civilians, according to eyewitnesses. Some of them were children. Others, like Yadegar Asisi, were from the East German town of Kirche, near the border with Iran, where the Germans had fled to after the fall of their country in 1941. A German journalist, Naomi Conrad, has written that the bombings were the result of German efforts to stop the spread of Nazism in eastern Europe. But she also said that \"the bombing did not take place at all.\" \"It was an act of war, not a political act,\" Conrad said, referring to Germany's war against Iran. Berlin has been accused of harboring Nazist sympathizers for more than a century, she added. Germany has also accused the United States of harbouring anti-Semitism, as well as the British government, of trying to influence the country's political and economic policies. However, German authorities have denied this, saying it is not the case. Instead, they have accused Britain and the US of being complicit with the Nazi regime. This is the second time that Germany and Britain have been involved in this kind of violence in recent years. On February 14, 2005, Berlin was bombed by German bombers, killing hundreds and injuring thousands of civilians. At the time, it was thought that German forces were preparing to take part in Operation Barbarossa, an offensive against the West. Since then, many of Berlin's citizens have come to Dresden to seek refuge in exile, while others have sought refuge elsewhere in other parts of Europe, such as France, Austria, Britain, Italy, Spain, Russia, Iran and Russia. There is no evidence that this has happened, though, so it's not clear how many people are still living there. For example, in Berlin, there are no plans to return to their home country of East Germany for a referendum on whether or not to vote for an EU-wide referendum. That would be the last chance for Germany to elect a new president, despite the fact that most of its citizens would have voted in favor of leaving the EU. And it would not be easy for Berlin to do that, given the current political situation in Europe's most populous country. So, we have to think about what the future holds for Dresden and what it will be like if it does not happen."

Many others were wounded when the float they were traveling on made contact with a power line. Officials in Port-au-Prince said the accident occurred as thousands of revelers filled the streets of the city center of the Haitian capital in the early hours of Tuesday. The Associated Press quoted witnesses at the scene who reported seeing somebody on one of the floats used a stick or pole to move a power line so that the vehicle could pass under it. Reuters cited a witness who reported seeing the head of a singer from the hip-hop band Barikad Crew make contact with the power line. Some of the victims were electrocuted instantly, while others jumped off the float, causing panic among the revelers who lined the street. Many of the at least 18 deaths came as a result of the ensuing panic, while at more than 40 others were injured, according to local authorities. There was some confusion about the number of fatalities, with the Associated Press putting it at 20, and AFP later reported that only around 10 had died. Haitian President Michel Martelly used his Twitter account to express his condolences to the injured and bereaved. \"My sincere sympathies to the victims of the serious incident that occurred this morning at the Champ de Mars (area in downtown Port-au-Prince),\" the president said. pfd/rc (AP, Reuters, AFP)",
        "generated_story": "At least 18 people killed in Haiti Carnival mishap At least 17 people have been killed and dozens injured in a Carnival-related accident in the Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince, officials said Tuesday. The accident occurred during Carnival celebrations, which began at the end of the Carnival season on the island of Champ de Mars. Police said they were searching for a group of people who were suspected of being involved in an accident that left at least 16 people dead. Authorities have not yet released the names of those killed or injured, but they are expected to release more details on Tuesday, the Associated Press news agency said. \"We are still trying to determine the exact cause of this accident,\" said Michel Martelly, Haiti's president. He said the victims were all from the city of St. Martin in northern Haiti, where the carnival began on Carnival Day, and that they had been celebrating the festival with friends and relatives in Champ De Mars, a popular tourist destination in central and southern Haiti. Barikad Crew is a hip-hop band from France, who are known for their raucous music and dance routines. They are also known to be hip hop artists, according to local media. Many of them are Haitian and Haitian-born, while others are from French-speaking countries such as the United States, France and the Netherlands. Several people were also injured during the accident, police said, adding that several people had also been arrested in connection with the incident. It was not immediately clear how many people died, however, whether the deaths were caused by a car accident or by the fact that the car was deliberately left on a highway, or whether it was a result of a road accident. There were no immediate reports of any injuries or fatalities. However, authorities have said that more than a dozen people are believed to have died from injuries suffered during Sunday's Carnival, when a vehicle collided with another vehicle, causing it to overturn and overturn. Officials have also said there are no suspects in relation to the crash, although it is not clear what caused it. A police spokesman said police were looking for the driver who was driving the vehicle. According to a local newspaper, \"The Haitian Press\" (AP, Reuters, AFP) reported that a police officer was also killed when he tried to stop a man from driving into a crowd of mourners at a bus stop outside the port. In addition, several other people, including a policeman, were injured when the van was hit by an unknown vehicle and another car, as well as a number of other vehicles and other debris. Investigators have yet to confirm the identities of all the dead and injured. Some reports suggest that some people may have fled to neighboring countries in search of safer places to hide. Other reports have suggested that police are searching the area for possible suspects. Others say that authorities are looking into possible links between the deadly accident and a gang of suspected drug traffickers. Haiti has been plagued by gang violence and drug trafficking in recent years, with some of its most notorious gang members being arrested and charged with murder and attempted murder. But the government has denied any involvement in any of these crimes, saying that it has not done anything to try to prevent the perpetrators from being caught up in their activities. That's not the case in this case, though, because the investigation is still ongoing. For the first time in several months, security forces have opened an investigation into the death of several suspected gangsters. On Monday, an AFP reporter was able to verify the identity of one of their victims, calling it \"a case of mistaken identity.\" The investigation was launched in response to an incident in which a Haitian policeman was shot and killed while attempting to arrest a suspect. More than 100 people in total were wounded in Tuesday's car crash that killed two men and wounded another man."

Meanwhile, US Secretary of State John Kerry has urged all parties to find a political solution to the conflict. \"We have made a decision that the cease-fire will begin this Tuesday, May 12, at 11.00 pm and will last for five days subject to renewal if it works out,\" Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir told a meeting of Gulf ministers in Paris on Friday alongside US Secretary of State John Kerry. The minister added that the cease-fire could be extended depending on the response from Yemen's Shiite Houthi rebels. Al-Jubeir said he hoped the Iran-backed rebels would \"come to their senses\" and agree to the truce. He urged them to stop fighting. \"We hope the Houthis will come to their senses and realize the interests of Yemen and the Yemeni people should be the top priority for everyone,\" he said. It is unclear whether the Houthis would reciprocate the Saudi gesture. \"The cease-fire will end should Houthis or their allies not live up to the agreement - this is a chance for the Houthis to show that they care about their people and they care about the Yemen people,\" the Saudi foreign minister emphasized. At this point, US Secretary of State John Kerry said anyone who cared about Yemeni people \"should take clear notice of the fact that a human catastrophe is building,\" adding that a cease-fire was \"not peace\" and that all parties must find a political solution to end the conflict. Kerry urged all sides to hold talks immediately. Saudi ultimatum Hours before the cease-fire announcement, Saudi Arabia declared a Houthi stronghold along its southern border a \"military target,\" giving an ultimatum to the residents to leave the area, Saudi state-run TV reported. Lately, the northern Yemeni province of Saada has become a battleground for the Shiite rebels and the Saud-led coalition forces as the Houthis carried out border attacks on nearby Saudi cities. More than 50 airstrikes hit Saada overnight and in the early hours of Friday morning, Yemeni officials said. A Saudi-led coalition of Arab states launched an air campaign against the Houthis on March 26. Riyadh accuses Tehran of backing the rebels, who have made significant territorial gains in the impoverished Middle Eastern country, capturing the capital Sanaa and ousting internationally recognized President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, who fled Yemen back in March. The Sunni Gulf states are wary of Iran's increasing influence in the region, and they see the Houthis' advance in Yemen as a move that threatens their regional and geopolitical interests. Over 1,200 people have been killed in Yemen since the start of the Saudi campaign, according to the United Nations. shs/bw (AFP, dpa, Reuters, AP)",

Yemen's Houthi-led government, which has been fighting for the last three months, has declared a ceasefire in the southern province of Saada, according to the United Nations. The truce, announced on March 26, is meant to last until the end of the month, the UN said in a statement. It was not immediately clear how long the truce would last, but it is expected to be extended for at least a few days, it added. A UN spokesman said the cessation of hostilities would take place within the next 24 hours, and that it would not be possible to extend it beyond the first week of May. On the same day, a Saudi delegation from Paris met with Yemeni President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi to discuss the ceasefire. Riyadh has said it will extend until May 13, when it hopes to resume talks between the two sides. Iran, Riyadh, Paris and Paris have all said they are ready to give up their blockade of Yemen for now, while the US, Britain, France and the European Union have also expressed their support for it. Tehran, meanwhile, says it has no plans to impose a blockade on Yemen, saying it does not want to interfere in its internal affairs. US Secretary of State John Kerry, who visited Riyadh last week, said he was \"deeply disappointed\" by the announcement. He added that he hoped to see an end to a conflict that had been going on for some time. In the meantime, he said, \"I am very disappointed that there is no end in sight to this conflict.\" The US and Saudi governments have been trying to reach an agreement on how to resolve the conflict. Washington has called on Riyadh to stop the fighting, calling for a halt to it, as well as the lifting of sanctions against Iran and other countries that have imposed sanctions on Tehran over its alleged involvement in Iran's nuclear program. But the Saudi government has refused to do so, instead calling on Iran to step up its efforts to help the Yemeni government. Meanwhile, Iran has also called for an immediate ceasefire between Riyadh and Tehran in an attempt to ease tensions between Tehran and Riyadh. According to US President Donald Trump, Tehran is also working with Riyadh on a plan to put a stop to any further escalation of its military intervention in Syria's civil war. However, Washington is not ready for that. Instead, its own Foreign Minister said Iran would continue its support of Riyadh's efforts, including through its nuclear weapons program, in order to prevent a military offensive in Sanaa, Yemen. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's government is currently in exile in Tehran. His spokesman, however, did not respond to questions about whether Iran was involved in any of these efforts. 'We are not going to allow it to happen,' he added, referring to Tehran's attempts to influence the outcome of a UN Security Council meeting in Geneva on Tuesday in which it was expected that Riyadh would hold a meeting on June 12 to decide on whether to suspend the military's military operations. Saudi officials have repeatedly said that they will not intervene militarily. They have not said whether they would, though, because they do not rule out the possibility that Iran could intervene.

        "target": "Aging health: WHO call to action as world population over 60 set to double by 2050 In a new report on aging and health, the World Health Organization is calling for action on \"population aging,\" as figures suggest the number of people over 60 will reach two billion by 2050. People worldwide are living longer, says the World Health Organization in its World Report on Aging and Health. This is both good and bad. It gives us the chance to \"pursue new activities\" as we get older, such as in education and family life. But it all depends on our health. And for that the WHO says world governments need to act now to make sure our societies worldwide are ready. What are the take home facts from the World Health Organization's 2015 report on Aging and Health? The WHO says that in the next 35 years, the global number of people aged 60 years and over will almost double from 12 percent to 22 percent. By 2020, there will be more people over the age of 60 than 5 year olds. And a majority of older people (80 percent) will live in \"low and middle income\" countries. It's estimated that the world's population aged 60 years and older will total about 2 billion in 2050, which is more than twice as much as now. Furthermore, worldwide, about 125 million people are aged 80 years or older. But by 2050, it is expected that this number of people - aged 80 and over - will live in China alone. But I'm not old, so why should I care? Well, all this is happening at a faster rate than ever before. And the WHO says \"all countries face major challenges to ensure that their health and social systems are ready\" for this major demographic shift. It will cost a lot of money to improve health and social infrastructures, especially in more developed countries where traditional families structures have changed dramatically. Surely, there's \"no typical older person,\" though. How does the WHO define aging? We tend to think of older people as physically and mentally frail. But that's not necessarily the case, not everywhere in the world. Old is a relative concept - especially in middle income to rich countries. For instance, some 70 year olds are as fit as some 20 year olds. Just think how many older folk are at your gym, and ask yourself whether you can keep up with all of them. But that still doesn't explain aging. What is it exactly? The WHO says that at a biological level, \"aging results from the impact of the accumulation of a wide variety of molecular and cellular damage over time.\" Basically, this puts people at a higher risk of disease and, of course, death. But aging can also be associated with \"life transitions,\" such as retirement or witnessing other people, such as friends and family, die around you. This can affect you psychologically and sometimes, as a result, physically. What sort of diseases come with old age? Some of the most common non-fatal conditions include hearing loss, cataracts, back and neck pain and osteoarthritis. Other conditions include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - which affects the lungs - diabetes, depression, and dementia. What needs to be done? The WHO is proposing a five-step plan of action, which includes: Committing to healthy aging and \"evidence-based policies to strengthen the abilities of older persons.\" Aligning health systems with the needs of older populations Developing systems for providing long-term care Creating \"age-friendly cities and communities Improving measurement, monitoring and understanding of \"aging issues\" worldwide. But don't forget: \"a longer life brings with it opportunities, not only for older people and their families, but also for societies as a whole.\"",
        "generated_story": "The WHO's Population Aging Plan: Actions Now The World Health Organization (WHO) has set out a plan to reduce the number of people living in poverty by 2050. The WHO said in a report released on Wednesday that the plan would be implemented by the end of the year. According to the report, the WHO plans to implement the new plan by 2020. It will be based on a five-year plan, with the aim of reaching a population of 1.5 billion people by 2040. This is the first step in the effort to achieve the goal of a one-percent increase in population over the next five years, according to WHO officials. \"The plan is to have a two-tier approach to aging and health,\" said WHO Director-General Margaret Chan, adding that it would not be possible for the world's population to reach 2.2 billion by 2030. Chan said that in 2050, \"the world will have reached a point where it is no longer possible to meet the needs of our aging population.\" \"We are not going to be able to do this alone,\" Chan added, referring to China, which has the highest population growth rate of any country on the planet. World health officials said they were \"very optimistic\" about the health of China's ageing population. But they also warned that China would have to take steps to address its aging problem, such as reducing the use of alcohol and other drugs. They also cautioned that if China did not take action now, it could be a long time before it can achieve its goal. In the meantime, China will continue to develop its own aging strategy, called the \"Ageing and Health Plan,\" which aims to prevent the spread of germs in future generations. China has already taken a step back in its efforts to tackle the problem of aging, but it's not clear how much longer it will take for China to make the necessary changes. That's because China is not the only country that is planning to adopt the age-based plan. Other countries, including the United Nations, are also taking action to cut its population aging rate to 2 percent by 2025 from the current level of 3 percent in 2015. Meanwhile, other countries are taking a similar approach. Japan, for example, has been pushing ahead with plans for a 5 percent cut in birth rates and a 10 percent reduction in childhood mortality. Beijing is also pushing back on its plans, saying it wants to see a 20 percent drop in mortality rate from 2015 to 2020, while the US is pushing for an 80 percent increase. Chinese officials have also called on Beijing to speed up the pace of cuts in health care spending."

Stephen Harper has stepped down as leader of the Conservatives after nine years in the top job. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper resigned as Conservative Party leader on Tuesday after the Liberals, led by Justin Trudeau, emerged victorious in legislative elections. \"I have spoken to Prime Minister Stephen Harper, and he has instructed me to reach out to the newly elected parliamentary caucus to appoint an interim leader,\" Conservative Party president John Walsh said in a statement. \"The people are never wrong,\" Harper said of his defeat. \"The disappointment is my responsibility and mine alone,\" Harper said, adding that he had called Trudeau to congratulate him. Trudeau calls for hopeful, diverse future In electing Trudeau, the charismatic son of a former popular prime minister, Canadian voters illustrated the growing discontent with nine years of Conservative rule that saw lowering of corporate taxes, avoidance of climate change legislation and disagreement with the Obama administration over the controversial Keystone XL pipeline. \"Canadians have spoken,\" Trudeau said, adding that he would be the man to lead the \"hopeful, positive\" country \"with a vision\" that they had asked for. In his victory speech, Trudeau said his government \"believed deeply in the diversity of our country,\" striking a contrast with the strain of nativism that had become apparent under Conservative rule. \"We beat fear with hope,\" said Trudeau, a 43-year-old former teacher. Liberals blow past projected results Projections ahead of the elections had Harper and Trudeau in a dead heat, but as polls closed on Monday night it became clear that the Liberals had won an outright majority, with a projected 175 of parliament's 338 seats. This represented a huge leap from four years ago when Liberals were handed their most crushing defeat in history with a mere 34 seats. Harper will stay on as a member of Parliament for his constituency, public broadcaster CBC reported, as he was re-elected to his seat.

Harper, who has been in power since 2011, will step down in the coming weeks. The former Harper cabinet minister, John Walsh, announced his resignation on Monday. \"I am stepping down,\" Harper said in a statement, adding that he would not seek re-election for a second term. He said Harper had been elected to the post in 2011 and that his successor would be chosen by the people of Canada. But Harper's successor, former Liberal Party leader Justin Trudeau, said he had no plans to run for another term in office, saying he wanted to focus on his own political career and not on the future of his party, the New Democratic Party (NDP) and the Liberals party (Liberal Party). Harper also said his government would continue to work with the federal government to ensure that the country's energy and energy resources are kept in good working order. In a rare move, Harper took over as party leader for the first time in more than a decade, leaving the Conservatives to fend for themselves as a party with a relatively small number of MPs. His successor will take over the reins of power from Harper in 2019, when he is due to take office in 2021. (Reuters, AP, Reuters)"

        "target": "Maldives revokes state of emergency citing improved security situation The president of the Maldives has lifted a state of emergency following an outcry from the international community. The government says the measures are no longer necessary because the security threat has subsided. The government said Tuesday it had rescinded the emergency measures \"with immediate effect\" and that \"all fundamental rights that were suspended have been restored.\" President Yameen Abdul Gayoom declared the state of emergency one week ago after the discovery of a homemade bomb and a stash of weapons near his official residence. The finding followed an explosion on Gayoom's speedboat in September - an incident the government labeled an assassination attempt. The president was not hurt in the blast, but his wife, an aide and a bodyguard were injured. The emergency regulations, intended to be in place for 30 days, gave security forces wide-ranging search and arrest powers, and suspended citizens' basic rights. They drew criticism from former colonial power Britain as well as the United States, the European Union and neighboring Sri Lanka. Reading out a presidential decree revoking the emergency, Attorney General Mohamed Anil said there was no longer a threat to the Indian Ocean atoll nation. He said investigations into the September blast and the recovery of weapons had made good progress. The foreign ministry said a number of people had been arrested. Lawmakers also used the security regulations to fast-track the impeachment of Vice President Ahmed Adeeb, who stands accused of plotting the alleged attempts on the president's life. Impact on tourism Attorney General Anil said pressure from the international community, as well as \"the possible adverse impact on Maldives tourism and the economy,\" had also played a role in ending the state of emergency. Foreign tourists visiting the tropical nation, known for its luxury tourist resorts, palm-fringed beaches and coral reefs, contribute close to a third of the country's gross domestic product. The Maldives has had a rocky road to democracy since holding its first multiparty election in 2008. The country's first democratically elected leader, current opposition chief Mohamed Nasheed, was forced to step down in 2012 after a mutiny by security forces. In March, he was jailed for 13 years on terrorism charges in a trial the United Nations said was illegal. President Gayoom is under intense international pressure to release him. Nasheed's opposition Maldivian Democratic Party welcomed Tuesday's announcement. But said declaring the state of emergency in the first place was a political move designed to stop a rally planned for last week calling for Nasheed's freedom. \"It appears that Yameen is willing to make up threats about the nation's security in order to settle political scores,\" the party said in a statement, referring to the president. nm/kms (AP, AF, Reuters, dpa)",

It also said that the government would continue to monitor the situation and take appropriate measures to ensure the safety of the people and the security of its citizens. Opposition leader Mohamed Nasheed called for the state to be lifted, saying it would not be possible to do so without the help of Britain and other European Union member states. 'We are not going to allow this to happen again,' he said, adding that \"we will not allow any further interference in our internal affairs.\" The United States, Britain, India and Sri Lanka have all condemned the move. Britain has also condemned it as a violation of international human rights law. In a letter to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, a British diplomat said the decision to lift the curfew had been taken \"in accordance with international law and international humanitarian law,\" according to the Associated Press (AP, Reuters, dpa) and Reuters (Reuters, AP, Dpa). \"This is the first time that we have seen this kind of situation in this country,\" she added."

        "target": "Belarusian president accuses Germany, Poland of coup plans Before being sworn in for a fourth term, the reclusive leader of Belarus fired a warning salvo at the European Union, accusing Germany and Poland of plotting a coup and threatening action against sanctions. Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko was sworn into office on Friday in a lavish ceremony boycotted by Western diplomats. The previous day, the 56-year-old leader openly accused Germany and neighboring Poland of planning a coup against him. \"There were [in Germany and Poland] plans worked out for an overthrow of the constitutional order,\" Lukashenko said in the Belarusian capital, Minsk, on Thursday. \"This is not an invention of our intelligence agencies.\" Lukashenko, who came to power in 1994, was re-elected last month with 80 percent of the vote in what the opposition and international monitors said was a rigged election. Relations between the reclusive Belarusian government and the West have been strained ever since. 'Belarus question must be answered' German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said in a statement that the accusations were \"baseless\" and an attempt by Lukashenko to draw attention away from his own wrongdoing. \"The EU needs to find a clear political answer to events surrounding the presidential election and the continued incarceration of opposition politicians and their supporters,\" Westerwelle said. A wide-reaching crackdown against the regime's opponents followed Lukashenko's re-election. Hundreds of his critics were arrested and dozens threatened with long-term jail sentences. Poland also dismissed the accusations as absurd and said that relations with Minsk would not be normalized unless all political prisoners were released. Sanctions threat The situation in Belarus pushed the European Union to adopt a resolution on Thursday in support of economic sanctions against the country. The threats earned a sharp rebuke from Lukashenko, who promised the \"hardest possible reaction\" should the bloc impose sanctions against his country. At the same time, the Belarusian prime minister, Mikhail Myasnikovich, travelled to Moscow in a effort to shore up Russian support for Minsk during its standoff with the EU. That meeting ended with a Russian promise not to impose its own set of sanctions on Belarus over an unrelated spat over oil exports and a commitment to resume a nuclear power plant project shelved after the 1986 Chernobyl disaster.

        "generated_story": " Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko's re-election bid was marred by accusations of corruption, the opposition said on Friday. The opposition has accused the former Soviet republic of widespread corruption and attempted to influence the outcome of the presidential election, which took place in the capital Minsk on Thursday. \"We are not going to allow this to happen again,\" opposition leader Mikhail Myasnikovich said in a televised address to the nation's parliament. He added that he would not allow the election of a new president to take place until the country's new constitution was approved. But he did not rule out the possibility that the new government would be able to form a government, he said, adding that it was \"a very good idea\" to hold a referendum on the constitution. However, it is not clear whether the results will be approved by the parliament or the president himself, who is expected to be sworn in next month. In a statement, I said that \"we will not accept any form of interference\" from the government. I am not aware of any such interference, but I have no doubt that there is a strong sense of responsibility for what has happened in Belarus. It is also not the first time that Belarus has been accused of having been involved in corruption. On Thursday, a parliamentary committee voted to approve a bill that would have allowed Belarus to become a European Union member state. That bill, however, was rejected by a majority of lawmakers who voted in favor of it. According to opposition lawmakers, this was the second time in as many years that a candidate for the post of President of Belarus had been elected to a position of power. This was followed by an election in which a number of opposition parties, including the ruling Communist Party, were barred from contesting the elections. There were also allegations of attempted bribery and money laundering, as well as the use of state funds to fund political and economic activities. Many of these allegations have been brought to light in recent months, with some of them being based on allegations made by former President Ilham Aliyev. Some of those allegations were made in connection with the 1994 Chernobyl disaster, when Belarus was still in power and the Soviet Union was unable to prevent it from becoming a country of its own. These allegations, though, have not been proven in court, and are unlikely to change the course of this year's election. Belarus is currently embroiled in an ongoing corruption scandal, one of which has led to an investigation into the role of former Prime Minister Sergei Sobieszka and his family. A court has ruled that this case was politically motivated, saying the case should not be allowed to go forward because it could be used as a pretext to try to force the President to step down. If the allegations are true, that could mean the end of his term in office. At the same time, Belarus will have to decide whether or not to seek a second term as prime minister, or whether to accept a third term. For the time being, there are no plans to do so, according to local media reports, although the current government has said it will continue to monitor the situation closely to ensure that all political processes are conducted in accordance with international law.

        "target": "Berlin court rules Google Street View is legal in Germany A Berlin court has ruled that Google Street View is legal. But that doesn't mean the lawsuits will end, legal scholars say. A Berlin court has ruled that Google Street View is, in fact, legal in Germany. Last Tuesday, the Berlin State Supreme Court (Kammergericht) announced its decision in a court case from late last year, in which a woman had sued Google, fearing that photos of her, her family and the front of her house would be posted on Google Street View and would thus violate her property and privacy rights. The court ruled that it is legal to take photographs from street level, rejecting her argument that Google was trying to take unauthorized pictures. Part of her argument rested on the fact that Google used cameras mounted at three meters (9.84 feet) high, which could see over her two-meter-high hedge. However, the court did not find this argument convincing, given that the photographs were taken from the street, and not the sidewalk. Furthermore, because Google automatically blurs faces and license plates and did allow Germans to opt-out of the service to have their house obfuscated as well, the court did not find any potential violations. This is the first high-level court ruling, which cannot be appealed any further, regarding Street View since the service debuted in Germany at the end of last year. An ongoing debate Since Google announced plans to launch Street View in Germany last summer, debate around the service has become heated, with some politicians trying to stop it at every turn, while German Chancellor Angela Merkel famously said that she would not remove her house from Street View. In November 2010, the company announced that 244,000 German residents in the 20 cities had chosen to opt out of Street View - less than three percent of residents. However, in Germany and everywhere else, the company also allows people to report abuse, inaccuracies or request that something be blurred using an online tool. \"Our job is to develop services that respect these cultural differences,\" Peter Fleischer, Google's global privacy counsel told Deutsche Welle in November 2010. \"We try to anticipate them. We're all internationally-minded people ourselves. We try to guess how people will react to them. But a lot of these services are new and have never been on the market before, so we learn and we adapt as we go along.\" A 'landmark decision' European legal experts called the Berlin ruling a \"landmark decision,\" saying that this would now become part of German case law regarding property rights. \"Yes, other people are now warned: Don't sue Google simply claiming that Google Street View violates personality [or] property rights,\" wrote Thomas H\u00f6ren, a professor of media and communications law at the University of M\u00fcnster, in an e-mail sent to Deutsche Welle. But, he also warned that this decision was very narrow, focusing on the issue of property rights, and not on the larger issues of data protection from Google. \"The problem of Google Street View - to be honest - has never been a problem of personality rights or property rights, but the enormous risk of personal data compilations in cases where people use Google Street View for compiling personal profiles (such as building insurance companies; future employees, et cetera),\" he added. \"And this risk has not been considered by the Berlin courts.\" Similarly, Viktor Mayer-Sch\u00f6nberger, a professor at the Oxford Internet Institute, agreed that this case was \"limited in scope,\" adding in an e-mail, \"The plaintiff never alleged an actual invasion of privacy, just a potential one.\" Author: Cyrus Farivar Editor: Nancy Isenson",

He added that \"the decision will not affect our future as a society.\" The court also ruled that Google could not sell the service, which is currently available to all German citizens in Berlin, without a license from the state government. According to a report by the Berlin State Supreme Court (MSI), the ruling \"would not have been possible without the consent of all citizens of Germany.\" \"The decision would have had a significant effect on German society and society in general,\" he said, adding that he was \"very pleased\" with the outcome. However, he did not rule out the possibility of a similar decision in other European countries, such as France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United States."

Now the country wants to keep a positive trade balance by having the value of the imported luxury cars matched by red wine exports. Porsche is currently enjoying record profits after a two-year downturn, but the export-reliant company has hit a pothole in Argentina. Buenos Aires-based Porsche importer Grupo Pulenta has signed an agreement obligating it to export several hundred bottles of red wine for each car it imports, the Argentine government announced Wednesday. Grupo Pulenta declined to comment when contacted by Deutsche Welle. Job creation During the past year, Argentina has held thousands of high-end vehicles in customs until companies agreed to export goods valued at the same amount. Most of those vehicles came from Germany. According to a spokeswoman for the Argentine embassy in Berlin, the country has been trying to safeguard domestic employment with a positive trade balance. \"Our government has negotiated with automakers to balance their imports of cars with an equivalent amount of exports,\" she told Deutsche Welle in a statement. \"Since March 2010 we have been working with the automakers and importers in order to increase local integration and reduce the trade deficit in this sector.\" Small market A Porsche spokesman said the company sells just short of 100 vehicles into Argentina each year. That compares to more than 40,000 sold worldwide during five months in 2010. \"For Porsche, Argentina is a rather small market,\" the spokesman told Deutsche Welle. \"Our importer, the Pulenta Group, also deals in wine. They have their own vineyards and export that wine. It has nothing to do with Porsche - we just have an import contract with them, and it seems they've found an individual solution with the Argentine government.\" Domestic production Volkswagen, which has an Argentine subsidiary producing the new \"Amarok\" pickup truck and transmissions, has thus far avoided mandatory exports. The company had reported an export surplus of 384 million euros ($545 million) for this year. Porsche's holding company owns 32.2 percent of Volkswagen, and the Porsche brand is intended to become integrated into Volkswagen's lineup. Daimler and BMW also have subsidiaries in Argentina. While Daimler produces its \"Sprinter\" there, BMW only imports to the country.

The company, which is based in Buenos Aires, said it was looking at ways to increase its sales in Argentina. \"We are going to be able to continue to grow our exports,\" the company said in a statement, adding that it would be \"very pleased\" with the results of its recent investment in Amarok, an Argentine wine importer. It added that the German company had invested more than a billion euros ($545 million) in the Argentine region in 2010, when it bought the brand from German car maker Daimler. In addition, it has been investing more in Brazil, Argentina's second-biggest market after Germany's Volkswagen, and in Germany, where it sold its first car in March 2010. According to the report, a total of 384 million euros was spent on the project, including the purchase of a new Porsche SUV, in order to expand its production capacity. That's a staggering amount of money for a company that is struggling to make ends meet. For the first time in its history, Porsche has made a significant profit from its wine exports. But it is not the only company to do so, as other companies have also made similar investments, such as BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Audi, Volkswagen and Porsche. And it's not just Porsche that's doing this, either, because of the fact that Argentina is the world's largest wine producer. Porsche, however, has also invested heavily in Brazilian wine, making it one of only a handful of countries in Latin America to import wine from Argentina and the Middle East. At the same time, there are also a number of German companies that have made significant investments in Argentine wines. Among them, BMW and Volkswagen are the largest importers of wine in South America, with sales of up to 1.5 million cases a year. Volkswagen is also investing in new wine production facilities, but it also has a strong presence in other countries, like the United States, Germany and Germany. This year, German wine giant Volkswagen has invested $1.4 billion in developing its own brand, while the rest of Europe is focused on producing German wines for the region. BMW is investing about a third of that amount, at a cost of about $500 million, to develop its brand-name brand. VW, meanwhile, plans to invest a further $5.7 billion to further expand the portfolio. Meanwhile, other German firms are investing heavily into Argentina as well as Brazil and Argentina in an effort to diversify the market. Germany has already invested a large part of their profits into Brazilian wines, producing around a quarter-billion euros worth of wines in recent years. However, this will not be enough to offset the loss of sales from the Argentina wine market, Deutsche Welle has reported, citing sources familiar with its plans. A German-German consortium of carmakers has taken a similar approach, saying it will invest about half of this amount in local wine and other products. German and German manufacturers have invested about 10 percent to 15 percent in their own production, compared with about 1 percent for German brands. They also have a stake in Spanish wines and produce around 40 percent of all the wines sold by the two-year-old company. These investments are expected to help offset a loss in sales for Porsche and Audi. On Wednesday, VW announced that they would increase their production by about 2 percent this year from last year's production of around 400,000 cars, up from just a few years ago."

The tournament will be held in Berlin from June 26-28, 2011. Germany is the host nation for the event, which will take place at the Berlin Olympic Stadium. It is Germany's first time hosting a major international event since the 1990s, when it was hosted by France and the United States. This year's tournament is expected to be the biggest ever in Germany, with more than 1.5 million spectators expected. Organizers of the tournament said they were looking forward to a strong showing from Germany. \"We are very excited to have the opportunity to host this tournament,\" organizers said in a statement, adding that it would be \"a great opportunity for women to showcase their talents in front of a crowd of millions of people.\" The event is being held at Berlin's Olympic stadium, and is scheduled to last until the end of June. There will also be live coverage on German television and online, as well as on the German radio and television channels. In addition to the games, Germany also has the chance to play host to an international competition, including the 2011 FIFA Champions League, in which the top two teams from each country will compete for a place in FIFA's elite tournament. For the women, it is a chance for them to show their skills and experience. They will have to work hard to make the most of their opportunities. That's why they have chosen Germany as their host country. But they are not the only country to take part in such an event. FIFA has also announced that they will not be hosting any international matches until next year. According to FIFA, the competition will run for three years, from 2011 to 2022. However, there is still a long way to go before Germany can host its first international game. And that's not just because Germany has not yet hosted a women-only tournament, but also because of its long history of hosting international events, such as the 2010 World Cups in France, Spain and Russia. Many of these events have already been planned for 2011 and 2012. Some of them are being planned in advance, for example, to coincide with the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro in Brazil. Others are planned to hold a tournament at a different venue, like Berlin, on June 28 and 29. Other venues include the Olympic Village, Berlin and Berlin. More than a dozen venues are also planned, according to organizers. One of those venues, however, is Berlin International Airport, where the venue is located. Berlin is also hosting an exhibition match between Germany and France."

        "target": "Beekeepers battle mites with technology Bees are useful, hard-working and vital for our ecosystem. Aside from making honey, bees pollinate most of our food crops. But summertime is also the season for one of the biggest threats to honey bees \u2013 the varroa mite. Dete Papendieck puts on a white veiled protective hat and takes out a metal jug with a beak-shaped spout. He sets fire to the container's contents \u2013 formic acid \u2013 and starts directing the smoke that is wafting at the beehives lined up in front of him in his garden on the outskirts of Bonn. The acid doesn't harm the bees, but it does kill the varroa mites, he says. And July, after most of the honey has been harvested, is the best time to treat his hives. The one millimeter-large varroa mite is a parasite that infests beehives and lays its eggs in the honeycombs, alongside the bees' larvae. \"It feeds on the bees' and the bee brood's blood, the so-called haemolymph,\" Papendieck explains. A third of bees killed in Germany Papendieck is an apiarist at the Bee Research Institute at the University of Bonn and he knows that the threat of mites is serious. If left untreated, varroa-infested colonies rarely survive a winter. In 2010, German beekeepers lost about 200,000 hives to the mite \u2013 one third of Germany's total bee population. And it is not just the honey and beeswax production that are affected by the mite. Many of our food crops depend on bees: Some 80 percent of all agricultural plants and 90 percent of fruit trees in Europe are pollinated by Apis mellifera, the European honeybee. Varroa introduced from Asia Had Dete Papendieck been a beekeeper forty years ago he would not have had to worry about mites. He says the varroa mite that was originally native to Asia, was introduced to Europe in the 1970s. \"It happened during a research project in which it was attempted to crossbreed the European honeybee with the Asian honeybee. The researchers were exchanging bee colonies between Europe and India, and that is how the mites came to Germany,\" Papendieck said. Unlike Asian bee species, the European honeybee cannot fight off the varoa mite by itself. According to Papendieck, bees easily transmit the mite to other beekeepers' hives in what apiarists call robbery. \"It happens when certain colonies are being robbed by other bees. Large numbers of bees from different colonies attack weak hives and steal their stocks. At the same time, parasites and diseases are exchanged\", he says. Researchers have been trying to breed varroa-resistant mites, but so far they haven't had much success. High-tech tools help fight the mite Klaus Maresch is also worried about his bees. He is an organic beekeeper from Bonn and he has been passionate about bees since he was a little boy. \"They are part of my family. When I open my hives and smell the honey and hear the buzzing of the bees it's like being in another world,\" he told Deutsche Welle. In addition to using formic acid to fight the mite, Klaus Maresch employs a high-tech tool \u2013 a special cylindrical scale that helps him determine when it is best to start the varroa treatment. \"Every day this hive scale sends data about the colonies to our server. The data, such as the temperature in the hive and the amounts of nectar and pollen collected, help me to find a good day to treat varroa,\" Maresch says. Maresch also makes the data about the activities in his hives available to fellow beekeepers who can treat their colonies accordingly. A driver's license for beekeepers? But it is not the mite that angers Maresch most. \"That's nature,\" he says, \"I feel angry about beekeepers who don't fight varroa. If the bees of neighboring beekeepers are infested, I also have a problem.\" The existing German pest regulation obliges beekeepers to treat their bees against varroa, but there are no strict controls. The majority of Germany's more-than-80,000 beekeepers are amateurs who keep between one and 20 colonies. This makes it difficult to impose and survey certain quality standards. Maresch, who sees himself as a kind of 'bee activist', would like to see the government introduce stricter rules. \"There should be a law that obliges every new beekeeper to learn about beekeeping before they are allowed to keep bees. They should get an education and there should be something like a driver's license for beekeepers,\" he says. In the mean time, Europe's bees are going to have to",
        "generated_story": "A German beekeeper fights the varroa mite with a high-tech hive scale. The honeybee expert in Bonn, Klaus Maresch, is fighting a pest that has been spreading across Europe for more than a century. He's fighting an insect that he says has spread across the continent for the past two decades. \"It's spread like a virus,\" he told Deutsche Welle, adding that the pest was spreading through the soil and spreading to other parts of the world, including India, China, India and the Middle East, where it has become a major problem for honeybees and other pollinators. In Germany, the insect is known as the \"virus of bees.\" The insect, which can spread from the ground to the air, can be easily killed by a hive-scale hive. It can also spread to neighboring countries, such as China and India. For example, in the Netherlands, it spreads from one hive to another. But in Germany it's not just the bees that spread the bug, but also the honey bees, who spread it throughout Europe and Asia. This is the first time that a honey bee hive has ever been used to fight a bug in Europe, according to a study published by the Bee Research Institute (BRI) in July. BRI is a bee research institute based at the University of B\u00f6n, Germany. Its main focus is to study the insects that pollute the earth, and to find out how they spread their diseases. A bee researcher at UB-Bonn is working on a project to develop a new honey-bee hive that will be able to be used in a variety of ways to protect bees from pests and diseases, he said. His project is called \"Virus Mite,\" and it is based on the idea that bees are the most efficient way to pollinate honey. According to his research paper, Virus mites are a common pest in many European countries and are spread throughout the whole of Europe. However, they are not the only pest to spread around the globe. They are also spreading the disease from Europe to Asia, spreading it across Asia and Africa, as well as in Asia-Pacific, Africa and Latin America. There is also a growing concern that it could spread into the European continent. That's why he's trying to prevent the spread of pest-borne diseases in his home country of Germany in order to keep bees at bay and prevent it spreading into other countries. And that's the main reason why the beekeepers are so concerned about it, because they don't know what to do when it comes to their bees. If they do know, then they should do their best to avoid it. So they're going to have to work hard to get rid of this pest. I'm not sure how long it will take to make it into Europe but I think it might be a long time before they can do that. After all, there's a lot of honey that needs to come from Asia to reach Europe before it can reach the EU, so it won't be too long before we can get to Europe in time. What's more, we're not even talking about the pests that are spreading around Europe right now. We're talking, of course, about insects, insects and insects. These insects are very important for bees to survive in their natural habitats. You can't just fly around and eat them, you can fly through them and fly into them. How do you know which insects you are feeding on? How can you feed on them? Do you eat honey? Is it a good idea for you to feed your bees? Or is it just a waste of time? I'd like to know."

        "target": "Heidi hits the Big Screen Heidi, the world famous girl from the Swiss Alps who first appeared in a novel 121 years ago, has hit the big screen in a fresh look. A century after the death of Heidi inventor Johanna Spyri, the lovable Alpine heroine is being portrayed in a new film which replaces grassy slopes and mountainous range with city skyscrapers and city streets. The $ 3.5 million \"Heidi\", funded by the Z\u00fcrich-based film company Vega and directed by German film maker Markus Imboden, is to be launched in Germany on Thursday. The making of the film was one of the highlights of a past year of events including exhibitions, lectures and fireworks celebrating the July 7 2001 centenary of the death of Spyri, whose novel \"Heidi\" sold 20 million copies and has been translated in 50 languages worldwide. It is thought to be one of the most successful books of all times. The book has inspired 17 films, including Shirley Temple\u2019s Oscar winning portrayal of Heidi in 1937 and a Japanese cartoon series. Imboden\u2019s remake is the 18th \"Heidi\" film. Blue hair in Berlin According to Vega, \"the film was transmitted to today\u2019s world without losing sight of the original novel\". But Imboden\u2019s new movie is far from the charming original, with its rosy-cheeked, curly-headed Heidi, delicate Clara and goat-tending shepherd Peter\u2019s frail old grandmother. In the first film, Heidi, who lives happily with her grandfather in a tiny hut in the Swiss Alps is plucked from her contented life by her Aunt Dete to live in a stiff, rich family in the bustling metropolis, Frankfurt. Heidi becomes so home-sick, she starts to sleepwalk and is eventually sent home. But not before she causes confusion in the otherwise prim household and brings laughter in the life of the disabled and homely, Clara. The Heidi in the latest film has blue hair, surfs the net and roams the streets of Berlin. Friend and shepherd Peter sheds his rustic pastimes and whizzes down streets on his mountainbike. Clara is not the weak, lame young girl of the Spyri novel, but a moody Britney Spears wannabe. Aunt Dete is a modern-day stylist living fashionably in the German capital. The new surroundings are a far cry from the tranquil days of cow milking, goat- tending and flower-plucking in the verdant meadows of the Swiss Alps. Transforming the Heidi myth According to a Berlin daily, the remake is a \"refreshing Heidi\", adding that the script writers had managed to transform the Heidi \"myth\" into an independent, self-assured girl and not into a \"transfigured mountain heroine\". However, it is just this portrait of a naive and charming alpine heroine that has made Heidi so popular all over the world. Heidi has become a well-known Swiss brand worldwide. Some 60,000 tourists \u2013 half from Japan \u2013 are said to visit the picturesque wine-growing village in Graubuenden, which boasts the original Heidi House and other Heidi related attractions such as winding mountain trails and pastures. Imboden\u2019s film, which is to be launched in Germany on Thursday, will also open elsewhere in Europe, and may reach fans in Japan and South Korea too. Whether Imboden\u2019s blue-haired, computer savvy Heidi will charm her Asian viewers, however, remains to be seen.",
        "generated_story": "The Remake of Heidi in the Swiss Alps In a film titled Heidi, Johanna Spyri and Markus Imboden are making a movie about Heidi House. The film is set in Switzerland's Graubuenden Alps, where Heidi was born in 1937. It is based on a novel by Norwegian author Johann Spyr, which was adapted from a short story by Swedish writer Johanne Spyra. Heidi is a German-born actress who lives in Z\u00fcrich, Germany. She is also the daughter of a Swiss architect, who died in a plane crash in 1938. In the film, Heidi has been living in Germany since 1937, when she was a young girl. Her father, Markus, was also born there, and she grew up there. Now, she is married and has three children, one of whom is German, the other German and one Japanese. \"I am very happy to be here,\" she said in an interview with the German newspaper Die Welt, adding that she had been inspired to write the novel \"Aunt Heidi\" (1937), which she wrote for her husband, Peter, about a year before he died. He also wrote a book about his experiences with his wife, Joanna, in which he wrote about her experiences as a child and how she fell in love with her father and his family. On Thursday, he told the newspaper that he was \"very happy\" that Heidi had come to Germany and that they had \"a great time together\" in their home country. But he also said that his father was not happy with Heidi's decision to move to Switzerland, so he decided to stay in his own country and not go to the U.S. for a few years. His wife is now a nurse and he has a daughter, Clara, whom he met at the age of 12. They have been married for three years and have two children. So, they have a son and two daughters, but they are not the same age as Heidi. And they don't get to see Heidi at all. For the first time ever, I have to say that I am not a fan of the movie. I think it's a bit of an oxymoron to think about it, because it is so much fun to watch Heidi and her children play together. That's the kind of thing that makes you want to go out and do something with your life. You can't just sit around and watch the world go by and think, \"Oh, my god, that's so cool.\" I'm so glad I got to work on Heidi because I was so happy when I finally got the chance to do it. After all, it was her first film and I didn't think I would be able to make it into a feature film at that age. When Heidi died, her daughter was the only one who could have done it for me. As a result, there was no way Heidi would have made it to Berlin. However, this is the second film she has made for the Berlin Film Festival this year, after the Oscar-award-winning film \"Shirley Temple.\" Heidi will be making her debut in Berlin on July 7, 2001, as part of her new film adaptation of \"The Hobbit.\" She will also be working on her second feature, The Hobbit, directed by German director Mark Imbulen, for which the director is adapting the original novel to a new language. This is her third film in four years, titled \"In the Alps,\" and it will feature her as the main character, a Japanese woman who has lived in Europe for more than a century and a half and who is still in her native country of Japan."

        "target": "Opinion: A decision against heart and mind The House of Commons has passed the Brexit bill - despite most parliamentarians being against it. But now they should take care that Great Britain does not move further away from Europe, writes Birgit Maass. If only they had done it out of full conviction. If they at least believed that they could really benefit their country by withdrawing from the EU. But many of the parliamentarians whose vote will finally set Brexit on its wayhave voted against their hearts, as well as their minds. It was a vote against their minds, because the withdrawal from the EU will almost certainly, at least on a short to medium term basis, have negative repercussions for the British economy. And it was a vote against their hearts, because for many, a view of the future, divorced from Brussels and increasingly reliant on an unpredictable US President Donald Trump, is somewhat alarming. In recent days, many members of parliament have described it as \"a catastrophe.\" No vote \"against the will of the people.\" Of course there are \"Brexiteers\" who believe that a Britain independent of Brussels will be able to return to its former greatness, once it is no longer held back by the \"Little Europeans.\" But they are in the minority - the majority of parliamentarians already declared their support for remaining in the EU during the referendum campaign. Yet despite this, Theresa May's government was able to push its legislative proposal through the House of Commons without any great difficulty. The predominant view, also amongst members of the two leading parties, is that to hinder Brexit and to fail to support the government in its endeavors to do so, would be to go \"against the will of the people.\" Anti-EU newspapers have targeted Brexit opponents. And those who have publically come out in support of the EU have had to reckon with death threats. The at times passionate debate in the lower house, that went on over several days, was a temporary highlight in this European tragedy, which in the worst case could contribute to the continent disintegrating into individual sovereign states. Don't be intimidated The British public supports the hard-line position taken by Prime Minister May in withdrawing from the common market. Polls are showing that her strategy is gaining increased support. There is no turning back now. The British are now looking for clarity on the repercussions of their withdrawal from the EU. They want the negotiations with the EU to start as soon as possible. It was an historical misjudgement by David Cameron that he could win the referendum. Most of the members of the lower house believed the then-prime minister and voted to hold a referendum. But now they can no longer stop Brexit. But they should not let themselves be intimidated by party discipline, nor the leading Brexiteers, nor by voter impatience. Over the next two years they should use every chance they can to influence the withdrawal process. May announced that although they are leaving the European Union, they will not be moving away from Europe. The parliamentarians must now hold her to her word. Have something to say? Add your comments below. The thread will stay open for 24 hours after publication.",
        "generated_story": "The Brexit vote is not a referendum against the will of the British people. It is a vote against Britain's sovereignty. The British parliament has voted to leave the European Union (EU) by a majority of more than 1.5 million votes. This is the first time the UK has ever voted for leaving the EU, and the second time since the referendum was held in 2009. Britain voted overwhelmingly in favor of a no-deal Brexit in the June 23 referendum, which was called by Prime Minister David Cameron's Conservative Party (PP) in an attempt to force Britain into a \"hard Brexit.\" The referendum will be held on March 29, the day after Britain leaves the bloc's single market, but it will not be the last. There is no doubt that the vote will have a significant impact on the country's future. That is why it is so important for the people of Great Britain to have the right to decide what they want to do with their lives. Theresa May and Donald Trump are the two most likely candidates for prime minister in Britain. They are both Remainers. But they are not the only Brexiteers who want a hard Brexit. Many of them are also Eurosceptics who believe that Britain should be left without a single EU member state. Some are even calling for an EU-wide referendum. Others, however, are more sceptical, saying that it would be a mistake for Britain not to be able to get a deal with the US and other EU countries. And some are saying they don't think it's a good idea at all."

        "target": "French presidential debate does little to woo undecided voters This year's French presidential race is perhaps the most closely watched election in recent history. Many voters are still undecided, including those in the Paris caf\u00e9 where DW's Jake Cigainero saw the latest TV debate. Just over two weeks ahead of the first round of voting in France's presidential election, all 11 candidates met for the second televised debate of the campaign. It was the first time in the history of French elections that the entire official ballot shared a television stage. This race for the Elysee is perhaps the most closely watched election in the history of the Fifth Republic in view of conservative candidate Francois Fillon's embezzlement charges, the deterioration of the left, political amateur Emmanuel Macron's surprise surge to the top, and the rise of Marine Le Pen's National Front. With so much media attention on the five main candidates, Tuesday's debate felt almost like a consolation for the six other candidates rarely in the spotlight. For French voters watching the televised debate at Cafe des Phares on Place de la Bastille, the saturated stage kept the candidates from detailed discussion of pressing issues. For those who are still undecided, the debate did little to bring them closer to choosing their pick for president. Vincent Couronne, a researcher, said it was good to see candidates who don't get as much media attention. However, 11 candidates at once for the political spectator was overkill. \"It wasn't very interesting. It's just one position after another. There's no real debate. It's not like when it was just five candidates.\" Boredom all round Charlotte Theuvenin and her friends, all students in their early 20s, tuned out early on from boredom and exasperation. \"It was too flat and too hypocritical. Fillon and Le Pen play with our money, then say they did nothing and that they are good for our country,\" she said. As though addressing the candidates in front of her on the TV screen, she added, \"How dare you talk about being president when you use our money for your own interests.\" Le Pen had come under fire over accusations that she misused public funds to pay bodyguards as parliamentary assistants. Francois Fillon of Les Republicains, meanwhile, is under investigation for allegedly paying family members more than 1 million euros ($1.1 million) for government work they never carried out. Frequently casting a blank stare at his opponents, Fillon also seemed bored, or at least more subdued compared to the first debate. Couronne said, \"Fillon seems to be not there. Probably because he knows all the small candidates can attack him on the criminal offenses he's accused of.\" Debate watchers cited Europe as the most important issue of this election, with many fearing Le Pen's promise to tear France out of the European Union in a so-called Frexit. Though no one at the cafe vocally supported Le Pen's plan, several acknowledged the EU is a pressure point for France. \"France's place in Europe in relation to Germany is a very important issue,\" said student Thibault Cirier. \"The general problem is France has lost its influence at the European level over the years, and that needs to be remedied, because France is one of the founders of Europe and should have a strong place in the union. The EU is also important for cohesion and to have a strong position internationally.\" Caf\u00e9 viewers say no to Le Pen Cirier was initially excited by Macron when he launched his campaign, but ultimately decided there was no substance. Now he says he will probably vote for far-left candidate Jean-Luc Melenchon. Kevser Taspinar also said she liked Melenchon for his fighting spirit and that \"he throws barbs.\" As a practicing Muslim who wears a headscarf, she said the most important issue for her is laicite, France's state institution of secularism. \"For me Hamon has the best interpretation of this. Maybe Hamon,\" Taspinar said hesitating. \"I'm still undecided, because there's Melenchon.\" Another viewer, Marie Dubois, said that although she really liked Melenchon, she had definitively decided on Macron. \"Melenchon has a way of putting humanity in politics and giving hope,\" she said. \"But Macron is the only possible candidate.\" With polls putting Le Pen and Macron in the second round on May 7, the undecided voters at this Paris cafe said they were certain which candidate they would not for vote for in that scenario. \"Definitely Macron. There is no way I am going to vote for Le Pen,\" Theuvenin said. \"I will never vote for that woman or Front National, no matter who is running against them in the second round.\" Tuesday was the final debate for Macron and Melenchon, two of the crowd-pleasers among the candidates. Both have pulled out of the third debate on grounds that it cuts too close to the first vote just two days later on April 23.",
        "generated_story": "French politician Francois Fillon: No, No and No? French politician Thibault Cirier: France's National Front has lost its grip on the country's political landscape. French President Emmanuel Macron has vowed to keep France in the European Union, despite the fact that it is not a member of the EU. The French president has said he wants to make France a European country. \"We are not going to give up on France,\" he told DW's Jake Cigainero in an interview published on Tuesday. He added that he was \"very happy\" with the results of his election campaign, which he called \"a great victory for France.\" \"I am very happy that we are in a position where we have the opportunity to be able to have a good relationship with our European neighbors,\" said the student, who is studying at the University of Strasbourg in eastern France. But he also said that France would have to do more to protect its citizens, especially those who are Muslim, from being forced to leave their homes in order to go to school. In addition, he said, \"France is a great country, but it's not the only country that can do that.\" In the French capital, Paris, the city's famous Cafe des Phares has become a symbol of French nationalism. It's a place where people can learn about French culture, language and politics, as well as the values of their country and its people. On the other hand, in Germany, there is the issue of whether or not French citizens should be allowed to vote for a candidate who doesn't share the same values as their French counterparts. And in France, that is exactly what is happening. For example, French voters are increasingly turning to the far right for their own political gain. Many of them are disillusioned with French politics. They want a change in government, and they want to change the way they think about the future of Europe. That is why they are calling for an EU-wide referendum on EU membership next year. This year, France is expected to decide whether to join the Euro-Atlantic bloc, or leave the bloc altogether. So far, so good. At the moment, though, it seems that the main opposition candidate, Jean-Luc Melenchon, has been in favor of leaving the euro. However, his party is also in opposition to Macron's plans to withdraw from the single currency, leaving France without a single euro to spend on a new currency. His party, Le Pen, is opposed to a euro-dollar currency and has called for the withdrawal of its currency from circulation. Macron, however, supports the idea of a eurozone-free euro, a move that would allow the eurozone to remain in place for at least a few years after the current financial crisis. Meanwhile, opposition parties have been pushing for Macron to step down from his post as prime minister, calling on him to stay in power until the next election in 2020. Some of these parties, including the Socialists, have already announced that they will not seek a third term in office. Others, like the Socialist Party of France (PSF) and the Greens, are also considering a second term, with Macron as its candidate for president. These are the two main parties vying to take over the presidency in May's presidential election. Both have pledged to work together to create a \"grand coalition\" in which France and Germany will be part of an \"Europe-first\" government. France has a long tradition of working closely with each other. If Macron is elected, this would be the first time that a French candidate has won a majority of seats in parliament since the 1990s, when it was first voted for by the people of Paris.

        "target": "Gang battle in Mexico as US' John Kelly visits A gunbattle between drug gangs in northern Mexico has left 14 people dead. It's the latest in a series of turf wars. Smuggling has prompted a visit to Mexico City by US Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly. Prosecutors said the remote town of Las Varas in Chihuahua state was the scene of Wednesday's battle between affiliates of the Ciudad Juarez cartel and a gang from the state of Sinaloa. Police said fighting escalated when patrols arrived. Fourteen people were found dead; 12 others were hospitalized. Grenades, launchers and rifles were found. The mountainous region is used as a corridor for smuggling into the US. El Chapo effect Chihuahua security commissioner Oscar Alberto Aparicio said a Black Hawk helicopter was called in as police chased surviving gang members through the area known for marijuana and opium poppy production. Two police officers had been killed in a \"cowardly\" way in the area a week ago, he said. In a similar incident last Friday, 17 gunmen were killed during a shootout with police on a highway in Sinaloa, Mexico's northwestern state. Sinaloa was the home base of Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, whose extradition to the US in January apparently left gangsters in a struggle for control of criminal syndicates. Homicides have surged in recent months, with the number of persons killed in May put at 2,186, the highest since the collection of such statistics began 20 years ago. Nieto and Kelly to talk In Mexico City Wednesday, President Enrique Pena Nieto's office said he and visiting US Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly had discussed how to rein in organized crime groups. \"Shared responsibility\" must become the focus of transnational efforts, Kelly said. Narcotics smuggling into the US has become a multibillion-dollar (multibillion-euro) business for Mexican drug cartels. Mexico in turn wants the US to throttle demand for narcotics and the supply of illegal weapons to Mexico cartels.

US President Donald Trump is expected to meet with Mexico's new president on Friday in Mexico City, where he is due to hold a meeting with the president of the United States. The two leaders will meet in the Mexican capital, Ciudad Juarez, for the first time since the US-Mexico summit in Hamburg, Germany, last Friday. \"We're going to have a good time,\" Trump said at a news conference with Mexican President Otto Perez-Napolitano, who was visiting from Germany. He said he was \"very pleased\" to see the new Mexican president. But he added that he would not be able to attend the meeting, which is scheduled to take place at the end of next week's G20 summit, in Germany's Sinaloa state. In the meantime, he said, \"I am very happy to be here with you,\" referring to his Mexican counterpart, former US Vice President Oscar Alberto Aparicio. Trump also said that Mexico would be \"a very good partner\" for him, adding that the two countries would work together to make Mexico a safer place to live and work. On Wednesday, Trump met with top Mexican security officials, including the head of state of Chihuahua and the interior minister of Mexico. Both men have been charged with crimes against humanity and drug trafficking. They are accused of having links to drug cartels and are being investigated by Mexican prosecutors in connection with a drug trade dispute between Mexico and US. Mexico has said it will cooperate with US authorities in their efforts to crack down on drug traffickers, but it is not clear whether that will be the case in this case. Mexican officials said they were not aware of any new charges against Guzman, a former drug trafficker who has been jailed for more than a year for his alleged involvement in a gang-related drug cartel. Officials said there was no indication that any charges had been filed against the former Mexican drug kingpin, Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n (pictured) or any of his accomplices.

        "target": "Italy's navy to patrol with Libyan ships to curb human trafficking Italy wants to work more closely with Libya to limit the number of sea crossings by migrants and potential asylum seekers. But what are the consequences? Italy's prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni, does not want to wait any longer for EU countries to show solidarity in distributing asylum seekers throughout the bloc. On Thursday he announced in Rome that the Italian navy would be patrolling with Libyan ships just off the Libyan coastline. The aim, Gentiloni says, is to curb human trafficking and bring migrants back from the smugglers' boats to Libya. According to the Italian government's figures, 93,000 migrants have arrived in Italy so far this year. At least 2,000 have drowned in the attempt to cross the Mediterranean - the true figure is unknown. Italy has already threatened to stop allowing boats carrying rescued migrants to dock in Italian ports, or that it may issue migrants with documents that would allow them to travel on to other European countries. Rome has not yet implemented either policy, but the government has made clear that Italy will soon run out of options. The EU Commissioner for Migration Dimitris Avramopoulos acknowledged, again, in Brussels on Thursday that \"Europe continues to face high migratory pressures. And Italy more than (almost) any others.\" The European Commission issued a letter offering more aid and personnel to help manage migration better. Accommodation will soon be full The office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, wrote at the beginning of July that \"Close to 200,000 accommodation places are available for refugees and migrants across [Italy], but are nearly all full.\" The High Commissioner referred particularly to the numbers of people dying when he warned, \"What is happening in front of our eyes in Italy is an unfolding tragedy.\" The United Nations anticipates that another 100,000 migrants will come to Italy via Libya before the end of this year. The number of arrivals is already 20 percent higher than last year; and the number of dead, those who could not be saved, would rise accordingly. According to UN estimates, the Mediterranean remains the \"deadliest\" refugee route in the world. Italian government statistics say that around 600,000 people have arrived in Italian ports since the start of the crisis in 2014. It is unclear how many have since traveled on to Austria, France or Switzerland. Once migrants are registered in Italy and accommodated in camps, they are not held there. If, however, they leave the accommodation without giving notice, they forfeit their claim to subsistence and social services. Most of the migrants are from African countries, and many try to travel on to France, for example. 300 people are currently sleeping on the beach in Ventimiglia, on the French border, hoping to take a bus or train to France. However, the border is being policed by French officials. Migrants who are caught are sent back to Italy. Austria has announced that it too will close its border with Italy if the number of migrants starts to rise. Repatriation and distribution are difficult Last year 120,000 new asylum applications were made in Italy. Around 50 percent of these are rejected. The asylum seekers are then supposed to leave the country. However, the process of people either returning voluntarily or being deported is very slow. The interior ministry has therefore announced that it will reinforce repatriation programs. The redistribution of asylum seekers from Italy, as agreed by the European Union, is well behind target. Two years ago the aim was to resettle 120,000 people. So far, only 24,676 people have been redistributed, the EU Commission said on Thursday: 7,873 from Italy, and 16,803 from Greece. The numbers are low not just because of the reluctance of other EU countries to take the refugees in, but also because of Italian delays in the registration of possible candidates. Asylum seekers from Eritrea are the most likely to fulfill the criteria for redistribution. Around 25,000 are currently living in Italy, but only 10,000 have been registered with the EU Commission and the European Asylum Support Office as possible candidates. Migration Commissioner Avramopoulos has announced that Italy will be given more help and logistical support in this area.",
        "generated_story": "Italy's High Commissioner for Migration Dimitris Avramopoulos says Italy is facing \"an unfolding tragedy\" in the Mediterranean region. \"We are facing an unfolding humanitarian crisis,\" he told reporters at the European Union's headquarters in Ventimiglia, Italy, on Thursday. The European Commission's migration commissioner, Paolo Gentiloni, said the situation in Italy was \"unprecedented\" and that the country was facing a \"serious humanitarian catastrophe.\" \"It is a tragedy that we have to deal with in order to protect the lives of our citizens,\" the EU commissioner said in a statement. He added that \"the situation is very serious and we are working very hard to prevent this from happening again.\" The EU's high commissioner for migration, Filippo Grandi, has warned that Italy faces an \"emerging humanitarian disaster\" as a result of the influx of migrants from Libya and Eritrea into Europe. According to the Commission, the number of people seeking asylum in Europe is \"increasing every day,\" according to a spokesman for the commission, who also said that more than 1.5 million people have fled to Europe since the migrant influx began in 2014. It is unclear how many people are still in Libya, but it is believed that at least one person has died in that country. In the case of Eritreans, it could be as many as 10,000 people, he said, adding that many of them have been deported from their home countries, including Italy and France, and some from countries in Africa, Africa and the Middle East. There is also the possibility that some of these migrants may be sent back to their countries of origin, such as Morocco, Sudan, Syria and Libya. At the same time, there is the risk that they could face a similar fate in other countries as in Greece, where thousands of asylum seekers are being held in detention centers. This is not an isolated case. Italy has received asylum requests from around the world for asylum-seekers, as well as from the United Nations and other EU member states. But it has not been able to reach out to any of those countries for help, because of a lack of information on how to get to Italy. On Thursday, Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi said he was not aware of any such request, saying that he had not yet received an official request for an interview with the Italian government. However, \"I have no doubt that there will be an investigation into this situation,\" Gatti said. Speaking at a news conference in Rome, Gentilianoni said Italy faced a crisis of its own when it came to migrants and refugees, which is why it was unable to provide information about the migrants who had arrived in its territory in recent years. His office said it had received a request from Italy's prime minister for a meeting on the issue. A meeting of EU migration ministers was scheduled for Thursday in Brussels to discuss how Italy could respond to this crisis and how it might be resolved. Gentilioni also called on Italy to cooperate with Europe's efforts to find a solution to its migration crisis. For the first time in his five years in office, his office is open to all EU countries to work with Italy on a plan to tackle the problem. That plan is being considered by EU officials to make it more difficult for migrants to leave the continent, especially those who are fleeing the conflict in neighboring countries like Libya or Syria, to seek asylum there. And it will not be easy for Italy either, since it does not have the resources to do so without the help of an EU-wide body of experts who can assess the humanitarian situation and assess its impact on its citizens."

        "target": "How to wrap a present without using paper or tape Next time you get invited to a birthday party, you could try wrapping the present using a piece of fabric and ribbon. It's very easy and the best bit is, it can be reused. Maybe it will come back to you on your birthday. 1. All you need is a piece of fabric big enough to wrap your gift, a ribbon long enough to go right around it, and if you want to make a gift tag, you will also need a piece of old cardboard, a hole punch and another small piece of ribbon. Ready? 2. No, wait, we forgot the present. Get that, and you have everything you need. Spread the fabric on the ground and put your gift on top 3. Fold the fabric around the gift you are wrapping 4. With the last little bit, you don't tuck it under, but create a little flap on top 5. Fold that flap over like this 6. Take one end of the parcel and tuck the fabric inside, BEHIND the gift inside 7. You can take your time to wiggle it all inside. Make it as flat as you can 8. Once it is all inside, turn to the other end and do the same thing again 9. When you have done both ends, it should look like this. Your present is all tucked up inside and you don't need any tape to keep it closed 10. Now for the ribbon. Place the gift on top of it 11. Tie the bow 12. So it looks like this. Finished? If you want a gift tag, that comes now. If you don't you're done! 13. Cut a piece out of an old cardboard box and make a hole in it using a hole punch. Watch your fingers though ;) 14. Put a piece of short ribbon through your hole 15. Tie the tag to your gift 16. And you are finished! P.S. You can either ask your friend to reuse the fabric, and show them how to wrap with it, or if they don't like that idea, you can take it home with you to use again the next time. And remember, you don't have to buy the fabric. You can use an old pillow case, an old t-shirt or skirt, or whatever you want. You can even make your ribbon from an old t-shirt if you don't have any. Happy wrapping.",
        "generated_story": "How to Wrap a Present Without Using Paper or Tape In order to wrap a present without using paper or tape, you have to use paper and tape. Read more about how to do that in the video below. \"Wrap your present around a paper towel, tape it up and wrap it around the wrapping paper,\" one of the tips says. It's a simple process, but it's also a method that can be used in many different ways. For example, wrapping presents with paper is a great way to make sure that the present is wrapped in a towel. But wrapping the presents is not the only method you can use. You can also wrap them in plastic wrap, which is the most common form of paper. Paper wrap is also used, as is tape and paper towels. Tape wraps wrap around presents, too. The paper wrap wraps around an object, making it easier for the recipient to see what they are doing. This method is called \"wrap wrapping,\" and it works well for a number of reasons. One of them is that it is easier than paper wraps. Another reason is because the material is more durable and easier to clean. Other factors include the amount of time it takes to get the paper wrapped, and the fact that there is no need for paper to be wrapped around it. That's why paper wrapping is so important, because it gives you the illusion that you are wrapping something in paper, rather than wrapping it in tape or plastic. In other words, it doesn't make you feel as if you're wrapping a gift around something you've never wrapped before. And that's because you don't want to mess around with it all the time. If you do wrap presents around your finger or hand, then you will have a very difficult time wrapping them properly. So, wrap up your presents and leave them on the table. Then wrap the gift wrap and put it on your lap. After all, this is how you wrap your gifts."

The record-breaking storm has battered the Bahamas and Cuba, while Hurricane Jose followed in its path. As one of the Atlantic Ocean's largest storms plowed through the Caribbean, leaving destruction in its wake, residents of the US state of Florida prepared for what could be the worst storm to make landfall in over a century. At least 17 people have been killed and dozens more injured across several island nations in the Caribbean. Irma is expected to be there second major hurricane to make landfall in the United States in less than two weeks. Hurricane Harvey struck Texas last week, killing more than 60 people and displacing roughly 1 million others. In the US territory of Puerto Rico, 1 million people \u2013 nearly one-third of the population \u2013 lost electricity during the storm, said Puerto Rican Governor Ricardo Rossello. \"It will be difficult to estimate how long the power outage will last,\" Rossello said. Later, officials confirmed that at least two people on the island had been killed by the storm's devastation. Two other major storms have developed in the Caribbean, namely Hurricane Jose and Hurricane Katia. Jose was east of the Lesser Antilles with maximum sustained winds of 120 miles per hour (195 kilometers per hour) as a hurricane watch was in effect for Antigua and Barbuda. Jose has followed the same path as Hurricane Irma, and was upgraded to a Category 4 on Friday by the US National Hurricane Center. Katia has remained relatively static, hovering off the coast of Mexico. Florida on edge Florida Governor Rick Scott said 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain were expected after Irma made landfall at the weekend as he urged evacuations during a press conference on Friday. Nearly 700,000 people have been asked to leave Miami and its surrounding areas. \"Today is the day to do the right thing for your family and get inland for safety... Do not ignore evacuation orders. All Floridians should be prepared to evacuate soon,\" Scott said. Read more: How to reduce risks from mega-storms? \"I know many of you are stuck in traffic, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s very frustrating. Evacuations are not convenient but they are absolutely meant to keep you safe,\" he added. On Friday, US President Donald Trump described Irma as a storm of \"absolutely historic destructive potential.\" Trump also on Friday signed a $15 billion (13.5 billion euro) hurricane relief package passed by Congress, which also raises the debt ceiling and postpones the possibility of a shutdown of government funding until December. Downgraded to an \"extremely dangerous\" Category 4 but still packing winds of 185 mph (300 kph), Irma moved between the north coast of Cuba and the Bahamas as it neared the Florida Keys and the southern Florida Peninsula.

Amid widening criticism from residents in British territories that not enough was done to safeguard people from the storm, British Foreign Office Minister Alana Duncan said London has sent tents, vehicles and other relief equipment. \"Anguilla received the hurricane's full blast. The initial assessment is that the damage has been severe and in places critical,\" Duncan told the British Parliament.

Hurricane Harvey is forecast to hit Puerto Rico on Friday. The storm has already caused damage to homes and businesses across the island, including in Florida and Texas. Officials have warned that the storm could cause widespread flooding and landslides in some parts of the islands. \"This is a very dangerous situation for the United States,\" the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) said in a statement, adding that it would be \"a very difficult situation to manage.\" The FEMA said it was working to assess the damage caused by Hurricane Jose, which hit the Caribbean island of Hispaniola on Wednesday. It also warned of possible damage from Hurricane Katia, the most powerful storm ever recorded by the U.S. government. President Donald Trump has called for a federal response to the hurricane, calling it a \"major disaster\" that will \"devastate the entire Caribbean.\" \"We are going to do everything we can to prepare for this storm,\" Trump said on Twitter. He also called on the US Congress to pass a bill to help the government deal with the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, a storm that has claimed at least 13.5 billion euros ($15 billion) in damages. Trump also said he would \"do everything I can\" in order to protect the American people from the devastating storm. But he did not specify what that would entail. On Wednesday, Trump tweeted that he was \"ready to respond\" to Irma, saying he had been briefed on \"the situation\" and that \"we are ready to act immediately.\" On Thursday, President Trump issued a series of travel advisories, urging the public to be aware of Irma's path and to take precautions to avoid it. In addition, he said, \"I will be watching the situation closely.\" He added that his administration would take steps to ensure the safety of those affected by Harvey and Irma. Meanwhile, US Secretary of Homeland Security Brock Long said the federal government would continue to monitor Irma in its efforts to prevent it from becoming a major threat to human life and property. (Reuters, AP, AFP, CNN, Reuters) The US government has also issued an emergency travel advisory for all of its territories and the British territory of Anguilla and Antigua and Barbuda, as well as British Prime Minister Edouard Philippe, who has been in contact with emergency management officials for several days to try and get them to evacuate the affected areas. According to The Associated Press, there were no immediate plans for evacuations, but officials said they were working on a number of measures to reduce the risk of further damage. However, it is not clear how long it could take for Harvey to become a threat. FEMA has said that Harvey could be a factor in determining the exact path of Harvey, and it has not ruled out the possibility of a direct hit on Florida or the Virgin Islands. Speaking to reporters in London, Long also told reporters that there was a strong chance that Irma could reach the French Caribbean as early as next week."

        "target": "Indian government tells Supreme Court Rohingya pose'serious threat' After an appeal from two Rohingya, India's top court is considering PM Narendra Modi's plan to deport some 40,000 Rohingya in India. The government said intelligence data showed links between some Rohingya and terrorism. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government told the Supreme Court of India on Monday that the Rohingya were \"illegal\" immigrants. The hearing is taking place as Rohingya face severe violence in their native Myanmar. More than 400,000 Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh in the past few weeks to escape military and civilian reprisals that the United Nations has described as \"ethnic cleansing.\" Later on Monday, Myanmar's national security advisor said that his government was willing to welcome the refugees who had fled to Bangladesh back to their native Rakhine state, but that the details of the process still had to be worked out. \"We will make sure that everybody who left their home can return to their home but this is a process we have to discuss,\" Thaung Tun told Reuters news agency after a meeting with British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. It was unclear how this would affect the estimated 40,000 Rohingya believed to have settled in India, including 16,000 of whom are registered with the UN's refugee agency. Read more: Myanmar's Rohingya - A history of forced exoduses The Indian government told the court that it had intelligence data that showed links between some Rohingya Muslims and Pakistan-based terror groups and other international terror organizations. It argued that such links made them a \"serious threat to national security.\" The government also said there was a \"serious possibility of eruption of violence against Buddhists in India by radicalized Rohingya.\" Lawyer Colin Gonsalves, who in a separate case is representing about 7,000 Rohingya living in the northern Indian city of Jammu, countered the government's assertions. \"We just want to know: 40,000 people have been here, many of them for the last five years. Have you [the government] filed a single charge sheet, is anyone being prosecuted in the criminal court for being a terrorist? The answer is: no,\" he told DW. The court has adjourned the hearing in the matter to October 3. Lack of evidence India says it is not bound by the UN convention on refugees as it is not a signatory to the accord, but human rights activists disagree. \"The principle of non return of a person to a place where he will be executed or tortured has become a principle of customary international law which India follows,\" Gonsalves told DW. \"And it has attained the status of 'jus cogens,' which is a principle of law that no country can say is not applicable to it, such as torture and genocide.\" In a communication sent to all states in August, the Home Ministry [interior ministry] said the illegal migrants were more susceptible to terrorist recruitment efforts. But an investigation by Indian broadcaster NDTV found \"little evidence of the government claim.\" The investigation that was carried out at major Rohingya settlements in the country showed little involvement in criminal wrongdoing by the refugees. Lack of any evidence to support the government claim has led to speculations that the Rohingya were being targeted for their religion by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu-nationalist government. \"It is really unfortunate that the government is going back on its commitment to refugees which it has reiterated several times in the past merely because these Rohingyas are Muslims,\" said lawyer Prashant Bhushan, who filed the plea on behalf of two Rohingya men. \"I mean this is clearly a case of religious discrimination and an attempt to arouse a sort of feeling of... an anti-Muslim feeling or try and communalise the situation,\" he told reporters outside the courthouse. The UN's human rights chief last week deplored Indian government's move to deport Rohingya refugees. \"India cannot carry out collective expulsions, or return people to a place where they risk torture or other serious violations,\" Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein said. The Rohingya are an Indo-Aryan people, the vast majority of whom are Muslims. They usually migrate to India through a rather porous border to escape persecution in their native Rakhine state in Myanmar, where they have been denied citizenship rights. They are viewed by the local authorities as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. Myanmar's Buddhist majority is often accused of subjecting them to discrimination and violence. Read more: Rohingya people in Myanmar \u2013 What you need to know The ongoing violence follows an insurgent attack on security forces on August 25 in Rakhine state that sparked off a brutal military counteroffensive. Hundreds of people, the majority of them Rohingya, have been killed in the violence that has seen many homes destroyed and several villages burned down. Myanmar's government maintains the crackdown is part of a counter-terrorism drive, while the UN's al-Hussein has said that it \"seems a textbook example of ethnic cleansing.\"",
        "generated_story": "India says Rohingyas pose 'Serious Threat' to India India's interior ministry has said that the Rohingya Muslims pose a serious threat to the country's security. The Indian government said on Monday that it was \"very concerned\" about the influx of refugees from Myanmar into India. \"We are very concerned,\" the ministry said in a statement. It added that \"we are also concerned that there is an increase in the number of people who are fleeing the violence in Myanmar.\" The statement came after the Indian Supreme Court ruled that Myanmar's army should be allowed to take over the state of Rakhine state, which is a predominantly Muslim state. India has also said it will not allow Myanmar to continue its military operations there. According to a report by NDTV, the Myanmar army has been accused of using excessive force against Rohingya in its crackdown on the Muslim minority. This is the first time the government has made such a claim, and it is not only against Myanmar, but also against Bangladesh, Bangladesh and Myanmar as well. Indian officials have also accused Myanmar of mistreating Rohingya, saying they were being mistreated by the army. They also accuse Bangladesh of failing to provide adequate security for the refugees, who have fled their homes and villages to escape persecution. Bangladesh has accused India of not doing enough to protect its citizens, accusing it of being a state sponsor of terrorism. Bangladeshi Prime Minister Narendra Modi has denied the allegations, adding that India was not involved in any of the cases. He also denied allegations of human rights violations by Myanmar. His comments came in response to criticism from the United Nations Security Council (UN), which has called for an end to violence between Myanmar and Bangladesh. On Monday, Indian Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said India should take steps to ensure the safety of its Rohingya minority, including the right to self-determination. But he did not rule out the possibility of India becoming part of a new Muslim-majority country, he said. Britain's foreign secretary, Prashant Bhushan, said the UK would continue to monitor the situation in Bangladesh as it had been doing for years. In the past, India had faced criticism for its handling of Rohingya refugees. However, in recent months, it has come under increasing pressure from India and China to do more to address the issue. Last month, a court in India ruled in favor of Bangladesh's Rohingya Muslim population, calling for a peaceful resolution of their plight. Earlier this year, an international court had ruled against India, setting up a transitional government to deal with the problem. Since then, there have been a series of court cases in which Myanmar has tried to force India to give up its role in resolving the conflict. One of those cases, however, was the case of Burma, where thousands of Myanmar nationals were killed in 2014. That case was brought before the UN's General Assembly on August 25, when the court rejected the application of an Indian-Banglarian peace treaty to settle a dispute between the two countries. There were also allegations that Bangladesh was trying to use the same law to try to prevent India from settling the dispute. These allegations were denied by India in court, according to an official statement released by Indian foreign ministry spokesman, Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein. Both the British and Indian governments have said they are not aware of any such case, though they have not yet ruled on whether it would be brought to their attention."

        "target": "NFL stars defy Donald Trump's call for boycott Baltimore Ravens and Jacksonsville Jaguars players \"took a knee\" during the national anthem after Trump urged fans to boycott football matches. The kneeling protest, to highlight social injustice, has stepped up a gear. Hundreds of National Football League (NFL) stars protested President Donald Trump's call for fans to boycott the league by refusing to stand for the US national anthem this weekend, starting Sunday's game between the Baltimore Ravens and Jacksonsville Jaguars. A number of other players locked arms in solidarity ahead of the game at Wembley Stadium in London. Jacksonville Jaguars' owner Shahid Khan, who last year donated one million dollars\u00a0(840,000 euros) to the Trump campaign, locked his arms with players - a rare scene, as owners almost never take to the field. US media reported that about 200 players on Sunday sat, knelt or raised their fists in defiance of Trump's comments. In one of the most memorable moments, singer Rico LaVelle took a knee and held up a fist at the last line of the Star Spangled Banner ahead of the game between the Detriot Lions and Atlanta Falcons. The protest came in response to Trump's tweets on Sunday morning urging fans to boycott NFL games to pressure the league into firing or suspending players to kneel in protest during the national anthem. In an early morning tweet, Trump posted: \"If NFL fans refuse to go to games until players stop disrespecting our Flag and Country, you will see change take place fast. Fire or suspend!\" \"NFL attendance and ratings are WAY DOWN. Boring games yes, but many stay away because they love our country. League should back US,\" he added. Later, the president said that his rant \"has nothing to do with race,\" despite the fact that the origins of the protest are to do with police brutality against minorities, especially African Americans. Trump said his comments were instead about \"respect for our country and respect for our flag.\" Trump's spat with US professional sports began at a Republican rally in Alabama on Friday, when the president attacked activist NFL players for kneeling or sitting during the national anthem, labelling them as \"sons of bitches.\" \"Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, 'Get that son of a bitch off the field right now... he is fired'?\" Trump told a crowd of cheering supporters. That day, basketball star Stephen Curry, the top player for California's Golden State Warriors, announced that he would not be attending a traditional White House reception honoring the National Basketball Association champions. The kneeling protest was started by former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick who refused to stand for the anthem back in 2016. Kaepernick's gesture came amid a spate of deadly police shootings of black men and was aimed at drawing more attention to treatment of minorities in the US. However, Kaepernick has since become a free agent, after failing to be signed by a new team for the new NFL season. NFL executives decry Trump's calls Trump also drew the ire of senior NFL executives and team owners. Responding to Trump's tweets, Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti, said he \"100 percent\" supported his players' decision to kneel during the anthem. Robert Kraft, the owner of the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots, who is also a close friend of Trump, said in a statement on Sunday that he was deeply disappointed by the president's comments in Alabama. Kraft defended players' rights to \"peacefully affect social change and raise awareness in a manner that they feel is most impactful,\" and said that sports were a unifying force in the US. \"Our political leaders could learn a lot from the lessons of teamwork and working together toward a common goal,\" he said. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, who has taken much of the heat for Kaepernick's failure to find a new team, was also quick to condemn Trump's comments. Read more: NFL player's refusal to stand for national anthem ignites online controversy \"The NFL and our players are at our best when we help create a sense of unity in our country and our culture,\" Goodell said. \"There is no better example than the amazing response from our clubs and players to the terrible natural disasters we've experienced over the last month.\" Denouncing Trump's remarks, Goodell said: \"Divisive comments like these demonstrate an unfortunate lack of respect for the NFL, our great game and all of our players, and a failure to understand the overwhelming force for good our clubs and players represent in our communities.\" But Trump hit back later on Sunday at a worsening furore, saying the row \"has nothing to do with race.\" Instead, he said: \"This has to do with respect for our country, and respect for our flag.\" At least seven NFL team owners donated at least $1 million each to Trump's presidential campaign last year. They include the owners of the New York Jets, New England Patriots, Dallas Cowboys, Washington Redskins, Jacksonville Jaguars, Houston Texans, Los Angeles Rams and Tampa Bay Buccaneers",
        "generated_story": "President Donald Trump's call for NFL players to kneel during the national anthem has sparked outrage in the United States. The president has called on NFL teams to stand for the anthem, saying it is disrespectful to the flag and the American flag. But the NFL is not the only league in which players are protesting. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has also called for a boycott of the Super Bowl, which is scheduled for Sunday at Wembley Stadium in London. \"We are not going to allow this to happen,\" Trump said in a statement on Twitter on Friday, adding that he would not allow the protests to take place at the White House. Trump, however, did not rule out the possibility of an NFL team boycotting the game. Instead, he said, \"I think it's a good idea to have the players stand,\" referring to NFL star Stephen Curry, who has knelt in solidarity with the National Football League's anthem protests in recent years. He also said that NFL owners Robert Kraft and Bill Kraft should not be allowed to make any money from the event, as they would have to pay a fine of up to $1 million (US$1.5 million) to a team that has not yet won a championship since the 2016 season, when the league was in its infancy. In addition, Trump has said he wants to see a \"great team\" in America, but he has yet to say what that team will be called. On Sunday, the president's first day in office was to meet with players from NFL franchises, including the San Francisco 49ers, New England Patriots, Dallas Cowboys, Houston Texans and New York Jets, among others. President Trump is expected to address the issue at a press conference on Sunday in Washington, D.C. (AP, Reuters, dm,es/kl) (Reuters, AP, AFP) The NFL's most popular sport is football, according to ESPN's Steve Bisciotti, a former NFL player who is now a free agent. It is also a sport that many NFL fans have been rooting for for years, such as LeBron James and Tom Brady. That's why he's been so vocal about his support for Trump during his presidential campaign, and has been a vocal critic of his administration's policies on social issues. His comments came as he was traveling to London, where he met with Trump and his wife, Ivanka, on the sidelines of a pre-game news conference. According to CNN's Jake Tapper, it was the first time that Trump had made such a public statement about the country's current political climate. Tapping into the controversy: \"The NFL has become a place where we have a lot of political power,\" he told reporters in an interview with The Associated Press. 'It's an opportunity for us to be able to show our country that we are a great country and that's what we want to do. We want the people of this country to come to America and be a part of that.\" The President's comments come as a surprise to many who have followed him around the world. Many of those who do not agree with him have criticized him for his comments. Some have called him a racist, while others have accused him of using the word \"racist\" to describe his actions. Others have praised him as \"a racist and a bigot.\" Others, though, have questioned his motives for speaking out against Trump. They have also criticized the President for not doing enough to protect the rights of African Americans and their rights to free speech. However, some have said Trump should have done more to ensure that the US government does not interfere with their right to freedom of speech and free expression. Meanwhile, others are calling for him to step down from his position as NFL commissioner."

        "target": "German FA calls off matches with China under-20 team after protests Germany's football association has called off several friendly matches between China's under-20 team and German lower league sides. The move follows a political protest at the first such match. In a statement released on Friday, the German football association (DFB) announced that the games would be rescheduled for 2018 and that talks would take place between them and their Chinese counterparts in order explore how to move forward. \"To the regret of all parties involved, the project has not received the broad approval that had been expected,\" the DFB said. \"In fact, the project was used by a handful of spectators to send messages that were considered hurtful by the Chinese team, officials, the Chinese Football Association's support staff and Chinese spectators.\" Protests in opening match The first of the arranged matches, against TSV Schott Mainz of the fourth-tier Regionalliga S\u00fcdwest was interrupted midway through the first half when the Chinese players left the field because a small group of activists had unfurled Tibetan flags. The team later returned to the field after the flags had been taken down, before succumbing to a 3-0 defeat. On Monday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry strongly criticized the protest. Initially, it had been thought that the Chinese side would play in the Regionalliga S\u00fcdwest - a regional division of Germany's fourth tier which has only 19 teams but the plan was revised so the matches would just be friendlies. This followed an agreement signed in 2016 between the German FA and the Chinese government to help boost the sport in the Asian country, where the Bundesliga is increasingly popular. Financial boost not enough to soothe concerns Despite the financial boost for the clubs \u2013 TSV Schott Mainz were reportedly paid a fee of \u20ac15,000 ($17.800) for last weekend's game \u2013 the move hasn't proved entirely popular with German fans, many of whom see it as just another example of commercial interests trumping sporting concerns. But the protests, and potential for further disruption, seem to be behind the cancellations - the DFB said both federations were aware of \"substantial evidence of further escalation,\" FSV Frankfurt, who were due to host the Chinese side on Saturday, said earlier this week that they would not ban protests despite an angry response to last week's incident from Beijing. \"We will not back a single centimeter off the basic rights our our democracy, including those relating to freedom of speech,\" FSV Frankfurt President Michael G\u00f6rner said in an interview with the Stuttgarter Nachrichten and Stuttgarter Zeitung newspapers. His words echoed those of DFB vice-president Ronny Zimmerman, who said that the games should be played \"within the framework of freedom of expression.\" The fixtures that have been abandoned include games against Wormatia Worms and Bundesliga club Hoffenheim's reserves. mp/pfd (dpa, SID)",
        "generated_story": "Germany's Under-20 team in China has been canceled due to protests in the country's capital. German football association, FSV Schott Mainz, has canceled its match against Chinese club CS Shenatia Worms. According to the German Football Association (FSV Frankfurt), the match was canceled because of the protests. The club, which is based in S\u00fcdwest, said on Friday that it would not be able to host the game. \"We are not going to allow the Chinese team to play in this competition,\" the club's vice-president, Ronny Zimmerman, told the newspaper Stuttgarter Zeitung (SID). \"It's not the first time that we have had to cancel a match,\" he said, adding that he was \"not happy with the way it was played out.\" The game was scheduled to take place on Saturday, but was rescheduled for Sunday, after a protest by Chinese fans who had gathered outside the stadium in a bid to protest against the tournament's cancellation. On Friday, a group of 20 Chinese players were also barred from attending the event, according to a statement from the Foreign Ministry. It was not immediately clear whether the players would be allowed to attend, however, and it is not clear if they will be permitted to do so. In addition, the team's coach, Michael G\u00f6rner, had said that the decision was made after \"a lot of people came out to express their displeasure at the cancellation.\" \"This is a very sad day for the sport of football in Germany. We are very disappointed that there are so many people out there who are unhappy with what we are doing. There is no reason to believe that this will happen again,\" said the statement, referring to an incident last year in which a Chinese player was arrested and charged with assault and attempted murder in an attempt to break up a football match between Germany and China. He was later released on bail pending the outcome of an investigation by the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs (F Ministry) into the incident. However, he did not appear to be in any danger of being arrested, as he had earlier said he would appeal to his Chinese counterpart, who is currently in jail for failing to provide him with a visa to travel to China for a medical check-up. Fears over the future of Chinese football have been growing in recent weeks, with some Chinese officials saying that they are concerned about the possibility of a ban on Chinese national football. But that is unlikely to happen, given that China is the world's most populous country and has a long history of authoritarian rule. For the past few years, China's football associations have tried to limit the number of games that can be played in their country. That has not been possible, in fact, for many years. Last year, there were protests across the entire country, including in Beijing, where a delegation of foreign ministers met with Chinese President Xi Jinping. This year's tournament was held in his hometown of Wiesbaden. Many of those protests were sparked by a dispute between the two sides over who should have the right to participate in it. At the same time, some of them were directed at a local newspaper, The Dpa news agency, citing a report from a foreign ministry official, that was published on the sidelines of Saturday's event. Some of these clashes took place during the World Cup qualifier between China and the United States, when a team from China was playing against Germany's Fenerbahce team. These clashes have led to clashes between Chinese and German fans, leading to more than a dozen people being injured and some being detained, while others were arrested by police. They have since been put on trial in absentia. As a result, many fans have taken to social media to vent their anger at what they see as a lack of respect for their Chinese counterparts. And some have even called for an end to their association's activities."

        "target": "Experts: Taliban have not changed strategy with Kabul restaurant attack The weekend attack on a Kabul restaurant frequented by foreigners came as no surprise to international organizations on the ground. Experts don't believe the Taliban have changed their strategy to target more civilians. Dramatic scenes must have played out in the restaurant: Guests sought cover under tables as a group of terrorists shot wildly into the dining rooms. News agencies report the restaurant owner tried in vain to fend off the attackers. He was among the more than 20 people who perished, most of whom were employees at international organizations. The attackers were also among the dead. During the evening dinner rush, at 7:00 p.m. Friday (17.01.2014), one of three Taliban members detonated his explosives-laden vest and blew a breach in the highly secured restaurant. Neither the man-high blast walls, nor the secured access points with armed guards could stop the attackers. The two remaining terrorists were killed later in a firefight with security forces at the scene. No change in Taliban strategy The suicide bombing on the popular Lebanese restaurant, Taverna Du Liban, in the high-end Kabul neighborhood of Wazir Akbar Khan was the worst attack so far in 2014. Afghanistan votes for a new president in April; and the international troops are scheduled to withdraw from the country by the end of the year. Although there are plans for a small contingent to remain in Afghanistan, President Hamid Karzai first has to sign a bilateral security agreement with the United States. But he continues to play for time. In this context, the Taliban may be targeting civilians more in order to drive out not just the military coalition, but the entire international community. Yet \"as horrible as this incident is, I don't see a change in strategy,\" said Thomas Ruttig, the co-director of the Afghan Analysts Network. Similar attacks have also been launched before, \"at least 12 to 15 times in the past eight years,\" Ruttig said. The worst attack was in 2012 at Qargha Lake, a popular weekend destination near Kabul. More than 20 people were killed, all of them Afghans. Extensive security precautions The Taliban, which normally doesn't miss an opportunity for fiery rhetoric, hasn't declared a change in strategy. A spokesman for the Islamist militant group said the attack was retaliation for a NATO airstrike in Parwan Province, a few kilometers north of Kabul. According to an assistant of the Afghan president, seven children and one woman died in the coalition strike. \"You have to carefully monitor the security situation,\" Nils W\u00f6rmer, head of the Konrad Adenauer Institute in Kabul, told DW. \"But I think it's a bit early to talk about a change in [Taliban] strategy.\" W\u00f6rmer's office lies just a few hundred meters from the site of Friday's attack. He could clearly hear the explosion, which shook the window panes in his office. \"It was immediately clear to me that something had happened,\" W\u00f6rmer recounted. But the Konrad Adenauer Institute was prepared. \"We had a relatively concrete warning in the last week related to our neighborhood, and we were very cautious,\" W\u00f6rmer said. He met with colleagues in his secured office. Like most of the international organizations, the Konrad Adenauer Institute is also integrated into the security networks. \"The security precautions are high,\" W\u00f6rmer said. \"But that doesn't exclude the possibility that something similar could happen again.\" But the Afghan security forces have succeeded in preventing many attacks in the past few months, he said. Kabul residents criticize Taliban An informal, impromptu poll by DW's Kabul correspondent, Hussein Sirat, suggested the Taliban are not winning Afghan hearts and minds with such attacks. \"Wherever the Taliban have killed civilians, they have not achieved their goal,\" said Mirwais, a pedestrian in the Kabul city center. Idris, another Kabul resident, seconded Mirwais' sentiment. \"The Taliban intimidate the people so that the security agreement won't be signed,\" he said. \"But the people won't bend to this intimidation.\" How the international organizations adapt to the tense security situation in Kabul will come after many conversations, analyses, and briefings in the following days. But W\u00f6rmer is not thinking about giving up. \"We have a clear agenda and long-term projects, which I considered to be very sensible,\" W\u00f6rmer said. \"I am of the opinion, as I was before, that what I'm doing here with the Konrad Adenauer Institute is worth the risks.\"",
        "generated_story": "The Taliban haven't changed their strategy with the Kabul restaurant attack, Afghan Analysts Network (AAN) says. The Taliban have not made any major changes in their approach to Afghanistan since the attack on the restaurant in the capital, Kabul, on April 17, 2014, which killed more than 100 people. \"They are not going to change their position,\" AAN's Nils W\u00f6rmer, a Kabul-based analyst, told DW in an interview on Friday. He said the Taliban \"are not changing their stance on Afghanistan,\" adding that they have \"no intention of changing the way they operate in Afghanistan.\" The attack took place at Taverna Du Liban in Parwan Province, near the border with Afghanistan. It was the second such attack in as many months in which the Afghan government has not changed its strategy. Last year, the government of Hamid Karzai, who was in power for five years, was elected as the country's first democratically elected president. Since then, however, he has been unable to make any significant change in his approach. In the past few months, Afghanistan has seen a resurgence in Taliban attacks, but in recent months it has also seen an increase in attacks on Afghan security forces. On Friday, it was reported that at least one of the attackers, Wazir Akbar Khan, had been killed by a Taliban suicide bomber. According to Afghan analysts, this is the first time that the insurgents have been able to take control of a major Afghan military base in a long time. At the same time, there have also been a number of attacks in other parts of Afghanistan, including in northern and southern provinces. One of those attacks occurred in Qargha Lake, an area of central and eastern Afghanistan that is home to the largest population of Afghan refugees, according to a report by the Konrad Adenauer Institute (KON) in Kabul. A Taliban spokesman said that \"the Taliban are no longer a threat to our country and we will not allow it to be used as a weapon against our people.\" Last month, at the end of April, Taliban militants attacked a hotel in central Kabul with a suicide bomb. That attack killed five people and wounded dozens more. Afghanistan's government is still trying to convince the international community that it is not responsible for the attacks. But it's not clear whether that will happen again, or whether it will continue to do so until the new government takes over the leadership of its own country. This is an important development for Afghanistan as it seeks to end the war on terror, and to prevent it from spreading to other countries. However, that doesn't mean it won't be the case for all Afghans. For the most part, they are still willing to give up the fight against the insurgency. They are ready to fight for their own interests, though, as long as they don't have the support of Western countries and the United States. So far, so good, in fact. And they've been doing so for many years. After all, many of them have come from Lebanon, Lebanon and Lebanon. Many of these countries have supported the US in its efforts to combat terrorism, particularly in countries like Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. These countries, for example, have helped to provide security for Afghan civilians who have fled to neighboring countries such as Syria and Iraq. There are also many countries that have given up hope for peace and stability in this country, like Lebanon or Jordan. Some have offered to help, while others have rejected the idea that Afghanistan is a safe country to live in. Others have called for a return to democracy."

        "target": "Inching towards direct talks on Syria They came to hold talks, but started negotiations with mutual affronts. But if there is one person who might be able to mediate between the intransigent Syrian conflict parties, it's Lakhdar Brahimi. Lakhdar Brahimi, the United Nations special envoy for Syria, seemed very tired on Friday (24.01.2014). He had had a long day, which was actually supposed to be the first real day of negotiations at the Syria Conference in Geneva. \"Good afternoon,\" Brahimi told the assembled international press, before adding, \"or good evening, I don't know.\" At the Palais des Nations in Geneva, he presented the most important result of his attempts to mediate between the Syrian government and the opposition to the more than 250 journalists who had managed to get a coveted place at the press conference: \"Tomorrow we expect and we have agreed that we will meet in the same room.\" What Brahimi is declaring an achievement doesn't sound like much, but considering how irreconcilable the conflict parties have been, even that can be seen as a small success. Separate talks with Brahimi The two delegations were actually due to meet on the first day of negotiations in Geneva in order to agree on a timetable and on the subject and agenda of the talks. But emotions are running too high on both sides. Instead both delegations held separate talks with Lahkkdar Brahimi, both lasting just about an hour each In the morning. The Syrian government delegation had apparently been threatening to leave the conference. At least that is what the deputy foreign minister Faisal Mekdad had implied. \"We are here to start the negotiations,\" he told waiting journalists, \"but we found that the other party did not want to come.\" Before the conference, the opposition had explained that for its delegation, the formation of a transition government would be a central tenet of the negotiations. They emphasized that this topic should be discussed right at the beginning of talks and that the establishment of such a body should be initiated without delay. Social media and good old propaganda The representatives of the Syrian National Coalition that were present in Geneva neatly used all imaginable channels to make their views public. At #Geneva2, they tweeted: \"Forming a transitional body is our major priority,\" leaving people in no doubt that the Syrian National Council would not want to include Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Assad's government, on the other hand, is relying on classic propaganda and loyal state media representatives in Geneva. An impressive entourage of dominant journalists from state-run media outlets is constantly at hand, accompanying the government delegation and making sure they get their point across at press conferences. Lakhdar Brahimi even had a small altercation with a journalist from a Syrian state news agency, who made a political statement under the pretense of asking the UN mediator a question. \"Are there any signs that Saudi Arabia, Turkey and other countries would stop the support of terrorism in Syria?,\" she asked in somewhat shaky English, before Brahimi interrupted her. \"Please, please, there is no point in asking such questions!\" Such exchanges hint at the type of negotiating style the experienced diplomat and mediator Brahimi must have behind the scenes. 'Wish us luck' Lakhdar Brahimi described the preliminary talks that took place in Geneva as encouraging and asked for patience. He said that because the peace conference had come about at the last minute and the delegations had therefore only been appointed very recently, there hadn't been enough time to hold preliminary discussions - a task that the delegations were now catching up on. \"We never expected it to be easy and I'm sure it's not going to be,\" he said. \"But I think the two parties understand what is at stake. Their country is in very, very bad shape.\" He added: \"The huge ambition of this process is to save Syria. Nothing less than that.\" After appealing to the willingness of both parties to negotiate, he simply added: \"So wish us luck!\" Fight for freedom As the official delegations held talks with UN mediator Brahimi in the Palais des Nations, the European headquarters of the United Nations, hundreds of Syrian expatriates who had come from all over Europe protested outside, forming a sea of red, white and black Syrian flags on the Place des Nations. With their presence outside the UN gates they wanted to show that despite all the government propaganda, the Syrian National coalition has a lot of support from the Syrian people. Thirty-two-year-old Ziad Malki came to Geneva from Zurich to show his solidarity. Ziad knows how it feels to be deprived of his freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. In 2005, he was arrested at a demonstration in Damascus and says he was tortured during his time in prison. Now he is fighting for a new Syria from outside the country's borders. Ziad is sure that with Bashar al-Assad and his family, there will be nothing new. \"We don't want this man to be in",

The Syrian government has denied any involvement in the conflict, saying it was not a political issue. \"We are not involved in any political or military conflict in Syria,\" he said, adding that he was \"not aware of the fact that we are dealing with a situation in which there is no political solution.\" \"It is not political, it is a humanitarian issue, and that is what we have to deal with.

We are working with them and we will continue to do so,\" said the deputy foreign minister of Syria, Faisal Mekdad. He added that \"we are trying to work out a solution that will allow for a peaceful resolution of this conflict between the two sides.\" He said he had been in contact with his Syrian counterpart, Ziad Malki, for several hours on Friday, but had not been able to reach out to him directly. In the past, he has been unable to speak with him because of a lack of access to his phone. On Friday he spoke to a delegation from Turkey, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) who were present for the talks, which were held in Switzerland, in an attempt to resolve the crisis between Assad's government and his opponents.

In July, he underwent surgery to remove a large amount of blood clots from his body. Doctors said the cause of death was a combination of chemotherapy and chemotherapy, but they did not rule out the possibility of further treatment. Vilavancia, who was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer in 2011, died at a Madrid hospital on Thursday, a day after being admitted to the hospital for treatment of a blood clot in his left lung. It was not immediately clear how long he would be able to live with the illness, which has since been curbed by chemotherapy. According to reports in Spanish media, the diagnosis came in July 2011 and was initially thought to be related to cancer. However, it was later discovered that his lung cancer was caused by a drug-related illness. On Friday, his doctors said he could not be operated on due to complications from chemotherapy or radiation. They also said they were not aware of any other treatment options available for him at this time of year, although they had not ruled out a possible return to normal operations. For the first time since he began his coaching career in 2006, Vilava was allowed to leave the team in mid-July after undergoing treatment for a lung infection. Since then he has remained on the sidelines of various medical operations, including an operation on his right lung, to treat a cancerous tumor. But he is not expected to return until at least the end of this month, and he will have to undergo chemotherapy in order to fully recover from this stage of treatment, said team doctor Pfd/lw (AP, dpa, AFP). \"We are very concerned for his health,\" said his wife, Toni Vilanca, in an interview with Spanish news agency Agence France-Presse (AFP) on Saturday.

The results are expected to be announced on Sunday (June 15) in Kyiv, the eastern Ukrainian capital. Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, who won a landslide victory in the June 15 vote, has been declared the winner of Sunday's parliamentary election. \"I am very happy with the results,\" said Kitty Logan, a DW reporter who covered the election for the newspaper. She said she was \"very happy\" with her victory, adding that she had been campaigning hard for months for her successor, Andrij Shevchenko (Reuters, dpa) and had campaigned hard on the issue of Ukraine, which she said was the most important issue in her election campaign. But she added that her campaign had failed to convince voters that it was a good idea to vote for a pro-Russian prime minister, and that the vote was not enough to win her a second term as the head of state. According to the exit poll published Sunday by the DW news agency, she would win the presidency if she were to take the oath of office in July. However, it is not clear whether she will be able to do so, as she has not yet announced her candidacy. On the other hand, her opponent, former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, said he would run again in June, but she did not give up hope of a third term in office. In the end, however, he said, \"We are going to have to work hard to get the job done.\" She also said that he hoped to make a strong showing in parliament, where he could win a majority of seats. He also promised to hold a referendum on whether Ukraine should be allowed to remain a member of NATO. Meanwhile, opposition parties have called for an election in which the West and Russia would be excluded from the list of countries that are not NATO-member states. Russia, Russia and China have all said they will not allow Ukraine to become a NATO member, while Ukraine has said it won't allow any other country to interfere in its internal affairs. That would mean that Ukraine would not have the right to elect a new president. It is unclear how many other countries would accept the result, or how long it would take for Russia to recognize Ukraine as an independent country. Ukraine is currently in a state of emergency, meaning it has to decide whether it wants to join NATO or join the EU. If it does not, then it will have a difficult time getting elected as a country of its own. For now, Ukraine will continue to rely on Russia as its main ally. DW has reported that a number of candidates have already announced their intentions to enter the presidential race, including a candidate for next year's general election and a potential candidate to run for president in 2014. Many of these candidates are already in opposition. Some of them have announced that they would seek to form a government of their own in Ukraine. Others have also announced plans to seek a post-Soviet state, such as Russia's annexation of Crimea and the creation of an autonomous region in Crimea. Other candidates, meanwhile, have not announced a date for their run-off. They have yet to officially announce their candidacy, though they have been given the option of running for another term.

Although the number of farms has declined over the decades, production has actually increased -- especially at dairy farms. Modern automation technology and robotics are helping to keep both cows and farmers happy, but at the cost of jobs.",
        "generated_story": "Automation in the Dairy Cow Industry Automation is a major driver of the dairy cow industry, according to a new report. The report, published by the German Dairy Industry Association (DIA), says that the industry has become increasingly reliant on the use of automated machinery to produce milk and other dairy products. \"The industry is becoming more and more dependent on automation,\" the report says, adding that it is also becoming increasingly difficult for farmers to get enough milk for their cows to be able to milk cows, which is why they are increasingly turning to automated processes to make milk. Dairy cows are the most popular dairy cows in Germany, but they also have the highest number of cows per capita. According to DIA, 80 percent of all cows have been milked by automated machines, making them more efficient and efficient. However, there are still a lot of problems with the process. For example, the production of milk is not as efficient as it should be. This is because of a lack of automation and the fact that milk production is so slow. In addition, it's not easy to manufacture milk that can be sold at the same price as milk or butter. That's why we have to look at how we can improve the quality of our milk, rather than just the quantity. We also need to think about the cost of production and how it will be used. There are many other factors that contribute to this. One of them is the need for automated milk machines. Another is that there is too much demand for milk from farmers. So, we're going to focus on producing milk at a lower cost than what is available in other countries. And that's where the problem lies. With the rise in milk prices, milk demand is expected to increase, as well as the amount of dairy milk produced. But that doesn't necessarily mean that cows will become more milk-producing cows. It's more likely that they will simply be fed milk in a milk carton, and then the milk will go to the cow. As for the other factor, I think we'll see how that plays out. I don't think there's any doubt that this will have a positive impact on cows' milk supply."

The ruling primarily affects Germany's Turkish minority. The European Union's highest court on Thursday ruled in favor of a Turkish citizen, who was denied a visa to live in Germany with her husband, because she was illiterate and therefore unable to demonstrate basic German-language skills. According to the court, a lack of language skills shouldn't automatically lead to the rejection of an entry visa application. Instead, Germany must consider the unique circumstances of each individual case. The court went on to say that quickly granting visas for spouses improves the quality of life and promotes the integration of foreign residents. Specifically addressing the case of the Turkish plaintiff, the court ruled that the rejection of her visa had violated a bilateral treaty between Turkey and the EU. In 1970, Brussels and Ankara agreed not to tighten their residency laws for each other's citizens. Law only applies to some In 2007, Germany introduced the requirement that spouses from certain non-EU countries must demonstrate a basic grasp of German before being granted a visa to live in Germany with their husbands or wives. Spouses affected by the law are required to obtain a basic language certificate from recognized centers, such as Germany's Goethe Institute, proving that they have an A1 level, or \"Beginning German\" language ability. The German government claims that the goal of the language requirement is to prevent forced marriages as well as marriages made simply for the sake of obtaining a visa. Citizens of European Free Trade Association (EFTA) member states are exempt from the language requirement. That includes Iceland, Lichtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. In addition, citizens of Australia, Canada, Israel, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea and the United States also don't have to demonstrate German-language skills. slk/xx (AFP, AP, dpa, KNA)",

The European court of justice on Thursday overturned the European Union's ban on the use of German as a second language in the EU, overturning a decision by the bloc's top court in Brussels that had upheld the law in 1970. In a landmark ruling, the court ruled that Germany's new law on German- and Turkish-speakers should be allowed to use the language of their spouses in their home countries. It also upheld an EU-wide law that requires spouses to speak German at least once a week in order to be able to communicate with one another. But the decision came at the end of a long legal battle between the two countries, which had argued that the German law was discriminatory and that it should not be used as an excuse for discrimination against spouses. \"It is not the right of the couple to have their own language,\" said the judge, who ruled in favor of Germany in a case brought by a group of European citizens who had been married for more than 70 years and whose spouses could not speak the same language, according to a statement from the Goethe Institute, a German think-tank based in Berlin. According to the statement, it was the first time Germany had faced such a legal challenge since the 1970s, when the country's constitution was passed in 1971. Since then, however, Germany has been unable to enforce its own law, and has had to rely on other EU member states to pass laws that would have made it easier for them to do so. This is the second time in less than a decade that a court has ruled against the government's attempt to impose a new legal code on spouses and their children. (AFP, AP, dpa, KNA)"

It was not immediately clear what the man was talking about, but it appeared to suggest that the prime minister had been recording the conversation. \"It was clearly recorded in a compromising manner,\" said Radoslaw Sikorski, a former finance minister from the ruling Law and Justice party (PiS). \"I think it's a very serious scandal,\" he added, adding that \"it's not the first time we've had a scandal like this in the country's history.\" The tape was leaked to the Polish People's Party (CPP) and was later released by the European Commission (ECB) as part of an investigation into allegations of corruption and abuse of power by former Prime Minister Marek Belka, who is now a minister of state for the Interior Ministry. Polish President-elect J\u00f3zsef Demirtas has also said he would step down from his post as president, saying it would be \"a disgrace\" for him to be allowed to continue in his position. He has denied any wrongdoing, however, and says he will continue to work to improve the situation in Poland. In a statement, he said: \"We are not going to allow this to happen again. We will not allow any further interference in our internal affairs.\" He added that his government would not be able to make any decisions on the future of Polish politics until a new government was in place. But he did say he was ready to take responsibility for what had happened. His resignation comes as the EU's foreign minister, David Cameron, has said his country is ready for an EU-wide summit on migration and the rule of law. However, it is not clear how that will happen, as he has not yet made any decision on how to deal with it. Poland is currently in talks with Britain over the issue of EU membership. A number of European countries, including the United Kingdom, have expressed concern about the lack of transparency in its foreign policy. Britain's Foreign Minister, Boris Johnson, said in an interview with Polish news agency WPA that Britain was \"not ready\" to accept the government's decision to withdraw its support for Poland and that it should not accept it as a result of a \"hostile situation.\" \"This is a country that does not want to give up its sovereignty,\" the Foreign Ministry's spokesman, Aleksandar Waitergate, told reporters in Warsaw, referring to a dispute between the two countries that has been going on in recent months over whether EU member states should allow Poland to join the bloc's single currency bloc. Russia, Britain, France, Germany and Britain have all expressed their concern that Poland could be left without a single member state, while the US has expressed its concern over a possible EU exit. Both countries have said they are willing to do whatever it takes to ensure Poland remains free from EU sanctions. EU leaders have also called on Poland not to become a member of any EU country without the support of its EU partners. They also say that EU countries should take steps to protect the interests of their citizens in order to prevent a similar situation from happening in their own countries."

Israel's army said several militants were killed after tunneling into Israel. Secretary of State John Kerry is due to arrive in Cairo on Monday where he is expected to urge Hamas to accept a cease-fire agreement offered by Egypt that would halt nearly two weeks of fighting with Israel. Meanwhile, the death toll in Gaza continues to rise. Medics on Monday said the number of Palestinian deaths in Gaza has risen to more than 501 since fighting intensified on Jul 8. Most of the dead are civilians. On the Israeli side, 13 soldiers were killed inside Gaza on Sunday, raising the number of soldiers killed since a ground operation began late on Thursday to 18. Two Israeli civilians also died in mortar and rocket attacks. The Israeli army said that more than 10 militants from Gaza were shot dead on Monday after infiltrating southern Israel. According to army spokespeople, two squads of militants were killed after tunneling into Israel. Israel's UN ambassador Ron Prosor, meanwhile, denied a claim by Hamas that an Israeli soldier had been kidnapped by the Islamist group, saying: \"Those rumurs are untrue.\" US President Barack Obama expressed concern about the rising death toll of civilians in a telephone call Sunday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, according to a White House statement. The US State Department confirmed late Sunday that two US citizens were killed in Gaza violence and released their names, but did not immediately disclose their occupations. US media reported, however, that the two were American members of the Israeli Defense Force, citing relatives and friends. \"We can confirm the deaths of US citizens Max Steinberg and Sean Carmeli in Gaza,\" spokesperson Jen Psaki said in a two-sentence statement. Late Sunday, the United Nations Security Council in New York held urgent talks on the conflict, and expressed \"serious concern about the growing numbers of casualties.\" \"The members of the Security Council call for an immediate cessation of hostilities,\" said Rwandan ambassador Eugene Richard Gasana, whose country currently chairs the 15-member council. hc/dr (Reuters, AFP, AP, dpa)",

The two sides are expected to discuss a possible ceasefire in the Gaza Strip. Israel's foreign minister, Ron Prosor, said on Sunday that it was \"very difficult\" to reach a deal with Hamas. \"It's very difficult,\" he said, referring to the Palestinian militant group, which has been battling for control of Gaza for more than a year. He added that the US would be willing to work with the Israeli military to broker a truce, but he did not rule out the possibility of an Israeli-Egyptian peace deal. According to a US official, the United Nations Security Council has agreed to hold talks with Israel on the issue of a cease-fire between Hamas and Israel, and that Israel would not allow it to take place until the end of the month. Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Rajiv Sinor said in a statement that \"we are very hopeful that this will be the last chance for peace between the two countries.\" \"We hope that we can reach an agreement in time for the beginning of this year's peace process,\" said Jen Psaki, a spokeswoman for US President Barack Obama. She also said Israel was committed to reaching a \"framework agreement\" with Egypt, Egypt and Jordan to end the conflict. Hamas has denied any involvement in any ceasefire talks, saying it has no plans to do so. US Foreign Secretary Kerry, who is traveling to Cairo on a business trip, will also travel to Egypt on Tuesday to attend a meeting with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and his wife, Sara, at the Egyptian presidential palace. Netanyahu has said that he will attend the meeting, according to US diplomatic sources. In the meantime, Israeli Defense Forces spokesman Ron Proor told reporters that Israeli forces would continue to monitor the situation in Gaza, where Israeli troops have been stationed for months, as well as in Egypt's southern border with Gaza since the start of last year, to try to find a way to resolve the ongoing conflict between Israeli and Palestinian forces. Speaking to reporters, Kerry said: \"I think we are going to have a very good chance of achieving a solution. We will have to see what the conditions are for that to happen. I think it will take a lot of time to get to that point.\" The Israeli defense ministry, meanwhile, has called for an end to hostilities between Israelis and Palestinians and said it would seek to ensure that Hamas does not use force against the Palestinians. It also called on Hamas to cease its attacks on Israel. On Monday, US foreign policy chief Kerry met with Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi and Egyptian Foreign Minister Riyad Mansour, both of whom are Hamas supporters. Kerry also spoke at a joint press conference with Netanyahu, in which he was asked to explain what he had planned to say to Netanyahu about the ceasefire. Both Netanyahu and Netanyahu have said they were ready to talk about it, while Netanyahu said he wanted to avoid any further escalation of violence. However, they have yet to agree on how to proceed, despite the fact that both sides have already agreed on an interim ceasefire for two years. Last week, Netanyahu's government announced that they would hold a two-day ceasefire on July 8, after a week-long pause in talks between Palestinian and Israeli armed groups, including Hamas, for which Netanyahu had promised to negotiate a new ceasefire, without any preconditions."

Its warning follows a WHO admission that the epidemic requires \"extraordinary measures.\" The head of Medicins Sans Frontieres (MSF), Joanne Liu -- fresh from a visit to western Africa -- said in Geneva on Friday that more experts were needed in the hard-hit region. \"It is deteriorating faster, and moving faster, than we can respond to,\" Liu told reporters. \"Like in a war time, we have a total collapse of infrastructure,\" she added. Lui said the world community needed to get the \"upper hand\" over the next six months. While the viral spread had been slowed in Guinea, concerns focused especially on Liberia. \"If we don't stabilize Liberia, we will never stabilize the region,\" Lui said. She was critical of the WHO for delaying its public health emergency warning until August 8. \"We need people with a hands-on operational mindset,\" to combat the outbreak, Liu told the Geneva news briefing. WHO - 'vastly underestimated' On Thursday, the World Health Organization (WHO) said the scale of the epidemic had been \"vastly underestimated\" and that \"extraordinary measures\" were needed to contain the contagious virus. The UN health agency said the death toll had climbed to 1,069 in four afflicted countries, spanning Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia and more recently Nigeria. Sierra Leone's chief medical officer Brima Kargbo disclosed on Thursday that at least 32 of the nation's nurses and doctors had died from the Ebola virus while performing their duties between May 24 and August 13. Local staff suffered stigma, despite saving lives, Kargbo said. \"We still have to break the chain of transmission to separate the infected from the uninfected.\" Youth Olympics also affected The mounting alarm coincided with an announcement Friday from the International Olympics Committee that three athletes from Ebola-hit countries had been barred from competing in pool events and combat sports at the Youth Olympics opening in China on Saturday. ipj/tj (AfP, Reuters)",
        "generated_story": "WHO warns Ebola crisis is'moving faster than it should be' The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that the Ebola epidemic in Sierra Leone is moving faster. The WHO said on Thursday that it was \"impeding\" the response to the epidemic, which has killed more than 1,000 people since the outbreak began in March. \"We are not moving fast enough,\" WHO chief medical officer Joanne Liu told reporters in Geneva, Switzerland, on Friday. She said the WHO had warned the country's medical charity, Medicins Sans Frontieres (MSF), that its efforts to contain the spread of the disease were \"tremendous\" and that \"we are working very hard to stop it from spreading to other countries in the world.\" \"It's not going to happen overnight,\" she said, adding that there was a \"significant increase in cases of Ebola and other infectious diseases.\" She added that more people were dying from the virus than from other diseases, such as malaria, tuberculosis and tuberculosis, as well as from diseases like HIV and hepatitis A. It's unclear how many people died from Ebola, but it seems to be increasing rapidly, according to Liu, who has been working with MSF for a number of years. In the past two years, the health organization has managed to reduce the death toll by up to 10 percent. But this time around, it's been much slower. On Thursday, a WHO spokesman said that a new Ebola outbreak had been reported in Guinea, Liberia and Nigeria, with the most recent being in Nigeria. According to a statement by the UN's health agency, WHO, in a report on Wednesday, \"The outbreak is not progressing at the rate that we would have expected. We are still working on this, and we will continue to do so until we are able to address the underlying causes of this outbreak,\" the statement said. Ebola is spreading rapidly across the West African nation of West Africa, where it is believed to have spread from Guinea to Nigeria and now Nigeria to Liberia. WHO is also warning that Ebola could spread as fast as it has spread to neighboring countries, particularly in Africa and the Middle East. UN spokesman Stephane Kargbo said: \"There is no doubt that this is a very serious outbreak. There is an ongoing outbreak and there are a lot of people who are suffering from this disease. That is why we need to take action immediately.\" The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said it would hold an emergency meeting on August 13 to discuss how to respond to this crisis. IOC is working closely with international health organizations to make sure the situation is being managed. They are also working to ensure that all the countries that have been affected do not have to pay for the treatment of those who have not been treated. At the same time, they are urging the international community to step up their efforts in order to help the affected countries. For example, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said in an interview with Reuters that they would be \"very careful\" about how they treat those affected by Ebola. He also said they should not be allowed to travel to countries where they have already contracted the deadly disease, like Nigeria or Nigeria which have contracted it, because they don't have access to medical care. This is the first time Ebola can be treated at a medical facility, he added. However, there is still a long way to go in terms of treatment and treatment for Ebola patients, especially those with serious health conditions. Doctors and nurses are being urged to stay on the road to avoid traveling to places like Guinea and Liberia, for fear of being infected with Ebola or contracting it. Meanwhile, medical charities have also urged the International Olympics Committee to hold a conference on Ebola to raise awareness about the issue, saying it will be an important step in reducing the risk of spreading the illness."

        "target": "Germany won't tolerate 'Sharia police' The German government has strongly criticized nightly patrols in the city of Wuppertal by men calling themselves \"Sharia police.\" The 33-year-old behind the patrols claimed that their goal was only to raise attention. Conservative members of Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition put forward a united front at the weekend against recent developments in the city of Wuppertal. Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said civilians wearing uniforms bearing the logo \"Shariah police\" could not simply start patrolling German streets. The groups reportedly hovered around sites like discotheques and gambling houses, telling passers-by to refrain from gambling and alcohol. Wuppertal's police have begun pressing charges. \"Sharia law is not tolerated on German soil,\" de Maiziere told mass-circulation daily Bild on Saturday. \"Nobody can take it upon themselves to abuse the good name of the German police.\" Justice Minister Heiko Maas, meanwhile, told Bild that \"the state alone\" was responsible for the administration of justice in Germany. It was obvious, Maas said, that any illegal parallel system of law enforcement would not be tolerated. Christian Democrat party whip Volker Kauder was similarly emphatic in an interview to be published in this week's Welt am Sonntag newspaper. \"Under absolutely no circumstances can we tolerate self-styled 'Sharia police officers' patrolling our streets and dictating what people should or should not do,\" Kauder said. Ringleader: goal was attention The 33-year-old behind the Wuppertal patrols, former fireman Sven Lau, published a video on his website on Saturday. Lau said that a \"Sharia police\" never existed, and that a group of men had simply worn the mock uniforms for a few hours. \"We knew that this would raise attention,\" Lau said, claiming that his goal was to spark a debate about Sharia law in Germany. Lau is a leading member of Germany's Salafist movement, advocates of a strict Sunni interpretation of political Islam. He works with a mosque in his native M\u00f6nchengladbach, not far west of Wuppertal, and used to head the fundamentalist group \"Invitation to Paradise.\" (Einladung zum Paradies, in German.) The central council of Muslims in Germany (ZMD) condemned the activities. \"These few teen yobs do not speak in our name,\" chairman Ayman A. Mazyek told the Tagesspiegel am Sonntag newspaper. \"These people are perverting the name of our religion. With this shrill and foolish action, they are really hurting Muslims.\" Sharia law is the Arabic term for a legal system based on the Koran. Saudi Arabia and Iran are examples of countries where such a system officially applies. Wearing a veil is obligatory for women and corporal punishment such as stoning is legally tolerated.

        "generated_story": "German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said on Saturday that his government would not tolerate \"sharia law\" in Germany. \"We are not going to tolerate Sharia law,\" he told a news conference in the southern city of M\u00f6nchengladbach. He added that the police would \"not tolerate any form of law and order.\" The Interior Ministry said it would take measures to ensure the safety of all German Muslims, including those who are members of the Islamic State (IS) terror group, which is based in Wuppertal. The IS is a group of radical Sunni Muslims who have been persecuted by the German government for their faith. They have called on the government to take action against the group. In a statement, he said that \"we will not allow this to happen in our country.\" He said the IS was not a terrorist organization, but a \"terrorist organization.\" \"I think it is an extremist organization that is trying to spread the ideology of Islam and spread it through the Muslim community. I think they are doing a very good job of spreading that ideology,\" the minister said. According to German news agency Welt am Sonntag (AFP, dpa, Reuters) \"This is not the first time that we have seen this kind of behavior,\" said Heiko Maas, minister of justice for the state of Bavaria (CDU) and the Christian Democrat (CSU). \"It's not just about Islam, it's about the Koran, too. It's also about people who don't believe in it.\" In an interview with German daily Bild, the interior minister, Sven Lau, said he was \"very disappointed\" that police had not been able to find a way to stop the extremist group from spreading the spread of its ideology. But he also said they would continue to do their utmost to protect the interests of Muslims and other minorities, and that they should not be allowed to be involved in extremist activities, such as the use of violence against women and children, as well as other forms of discrimination and discrimination against minorities. His comments came in response to criticism from human rights groups, who had criticized him for his comments on social media, saying he should be held accountable for what he had said to the media. On Saturday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she would do everything in her power to make sure that Muslims were not targeted. She also called for an end to \"discrimination against all Muslims,\" according to a German newspaper, Bild. Germany's state broadcaster, DW, reported, adding that she was also calling for a ban on \"radical Islam\" and \"Islamization of Germany.\" She added: \"There will be no tolerance for radicalism in this country. We will stand up for our people and we will do what we can to prevent it from happening.\" Germany has been accused of tolerating extremism in its society for years. However, in recent years, that has not always been the case. Last year, a number of people were killed in clashes between police and radical Islamists. Some of them were shot and wounded by police in a Berlin suburb. Others were injured during clashes with police. One of those was a policeman who was shot by a police officer. Another was injured in an attack on a car. Police officers were also injured when they tried to enter the vehicle of a man suspected of being a member of an IS-affiliated group that had been driving a van into a crowd of worshippers. This was the second such incident in three months in which the car was hit by an anti-Islamic vehicle. A police spokesman, Volker Kauder, told Bild that it was an act of revenge against a Muslim driver who drove the van."

Moscow-based news agency RIA quoted Siluanov as saying that the emergency fund would be set up next year with money originally earmarked for the State Pension Fund and leftover funds from this year's budget. According to RIA, Moscow was planning to devote \"at least 100 billion roubles\" (2 billion euros) to the fund, which will mainly be aimed at helping cash-starved Russian banks and key oil companies. \"These 100 billion roubles will be added to the reserve next year, which will allow us to help companies,\" RIA quoted Siluanov as saying. \"We are planning to create a reserve of significant size.\" Just last week, the European Union and the United States imposed a third round of sanctions on Moscow for Russia's involvement in the Ukraine conflict. The latest sanctions target the Russian banking sector as well as key energy firms and arms manufacturers. As one of several companies that have asked for government help, Russia's oil giant Rosneft said it would need 1.5 trillion roubles ($39.70 billion) in aid to keep exploring for oil. Siluanov also told RIA news agency that the decision to stop transferring money to the Pension Fund would hand the budget an extra 309 billion roubles.

US General Philip Breedlove said Russian forces were still operating inside Ukraine. Speaking to reporters after a meeting with NATO military chiefs in Lithuania's capital Vilnius on Saturday, US General Philip Breedlove expressed \"sincere hope\" about a renewed peace plan, agreed to earlier in the day in the Belarusian capital Minsk, by separatists and representatives from Ukraine's and Russia's governments. The new pact, including an artillery buffer zone, was a move to strengthen a peace plan signed earlier this month, also in Minsk. However, Breedlove said violence levels in Ukraine in recent days were as high as prior to the earlier ceasefire. \"The ceasefire is still there in name, but what is happening on the ground is quite a different story,\" Breedlove said, adding that Russian forces were still operating in Ukraine, although he could not pinpoint how many. \"The fluidity of movement of Russian forces and Russian-backed forces back and forth across that border makes it almost impossible to understand the numbers,\" he said. A convoy from Russia consisting of about 170 trucks arrived in Ukraine on Saturday, with a reported cargo of humanitarian aid. Previous aid convoys sent from Russia were met with outrage in Kyiv, as it was suspected they may have been used to provide support to the pro-Moscow separatists in eastern Ukraine. Russia has repeatedly denied such accusations. The separatists have said they want to break from Kyiv and have already declared \"people's republics'\" in Donetsk and Luhansk. This week Ukraine's parliament passed a bill which paves the way for more autonomy for those areas.

The ceasefire, which began in Minsk, Belarus, on Friday, was agreed to by all sides, including Russia, Ukraine and Ukraine, but it was not agreed on the terms of the ceasefire. \"It is only agreed that there will be a cessation of hostilities,\" said the general, who was in Vilnius, Lithuania, for the first time since the end of a six-day ceasefire last month. He added that it had been agreed in principle that a cease-fire would be agreed between the two countries, and that the Ukrainian army would not be allowed to take part in any sort of offensive against the Russian-backed separatists in Luhansk province. NATO's General in charge of Ukraine's armed forces, General John Kirby, said in a statement Saturday that \"the ceasefire is not in fact agreed upon at all.\" \"There is no ceasefire,\" Kirby said, adding that he was \"not aware of any such ceasefire agreement.\" NATO has called for an end to the fighting between pro- and anti-Russian separatists and Russia's military, as well as a ceasefire between Kiev and Moscow. Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Japan, Russia and Turkey have all called on Russia to cease its military operations. Russia has said it will not allow any military action against Ukraine. Moscow, however, has refused to give up its weapons of mass destruction, saying it has no intention of doing so. Russian President Vladimir Putin has also said that Russia will continue to use its nuclear weapons against Ukrainian forces in retaliation for Moscow's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. In addition, Moscow has threatened to impose sanctions on Ukraine if it does not agree to a new round of talks with the separatists, according to Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Sergei Shoigu (AP, AFP) and Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov (AFP, AP, Reuters) said Moscow was ready to negotiate a truce with Kiev, while Moscow had promised to keep its troops out of its eastern Ukrainian stronghold of Donetsk, where the rebels are fighting to regain control of territory they seized from Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko's forces on March 24. Putin is also expected to meet with Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev to discuss the situation, he said at a news conference in Lithuania. A ceasefire talks between Moscow and Kiev have been going on since last week's ceasefire broke down, with Moscow saying that Moscow would give Ukraine a chance to reach an agreement on how to resolve the crisis. However, it is unclear how long the truce will last, given the fact that Kiev has not yet reached a deal with Russia on a number of issues, such as the question of who will pay the salaries of Ukrainian soldiers and how many of them will have to be paid for their salaries and pensions. It could take months for Kiev to come up with a plan to pay salaries for its soldiers, or even years for them to leave the country altogether. But it could be years before Russia can start paying salaries to those who have already been paid. According to Britain's Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, a former US ambassador to NATO, \"We are not going to do anything to stop the escalation of violence.\" The US General, in his first visit to Lithuania since leaving the post-Soviet era, had said he had not seen any signs of an escalation in fighting in Kyiv since he left the city in February, when he returned from a trip to Moscow to visit his family in Belarus. His visit came a day after Moscow announced it would suspend its planned ceasefire with Ukraine for a week and a half, calling it a \"day of mourning\" for all Ukrainians who had lost their livelihoods."

It's as revolutionary as the Cuban revolution, and as peaceful as the biblical Sermon on the Mount, says DW's Astrid Prange. US President Barack Obama has lost his old communist \"enemy,\" and Cuban President Raul Castro has lost his hatred of capitalism. In the first phone call from president to president since 1961 the two heads of state came to a surprisingly swift agreement. They want to renew diplomatic relations, which have been on ice for more than 50 years, and exchange ambassadors. It's only a matter of time before the US lifts its trade embargo against Cuba. All the word \"embargo\" is really good for - at this stage - is as an ideological soapbox for political hardliners, especially Republicans in Congress who believe lifting sanctions would constitute defeat for the US. Yet the lifting of the embargo has already begun. In addition to medication, it has been possible since 2000 to export agricultural produce such as maize, cereal crops, and poultry to Cuba. Flirting with the rogue state Furthermore, 100,000 US citizens have travelled to Cuba since 2011 for cultural and scientific exchanges. Travel restrictions on Cubans living in exile in the US who wanted to visit their relatives on the island were also lifted. According to press reports, the two countries' military forces are even said to be cooperating, as are their coastguards, and military on the border of the US marine base in Guantanamo. Now Obama wants to officially open a \"new chapter\" in relations with the communist Caribbean island and remove Cuba from the US list of so-called \"rogue states\" that support terrorism. The travel ban on American tourists visiting the island will also largely be lifted. That's as far as things will go for the time being, as Obama would require a majority in Congress in Washington to lift the embargo entirely. But even if these are only small steps, the fall of the American-Cuban wall has begun. The easing of the sanctions and the resumption of diplomatic relations are setting the scene for an end to the embargo. Embargo as scapegoat The tearing down of this \"wall in the mind\" is long overdue. The blockade is obsolete, and has proved to be entirely ineffective. More than this, its advocates have achieved the opposite of what they actually wanted. The blockade has provided the leaders in Havana with an easy excuse for their economic failure. Raul Castro realized long ago that Cuba's economic problems can no longer be justified simply by citing the US embargo. It looks as though he was counting on the blockade being lifted: There is no other explanation for the completion of the Mariel container port in January this year. Cuba's biggest infrastructure project was, incidentally, financed by Brazil. The Brazilians also sent a declaration of love to Cuba. Raul Castro opened the door to them. He loves anyone who helps him - his friends even more than his enemies.",
        "generated_story": "The Fall of the Wall in the Mind of Cuban President Barack Obama Obama has been criticized for his decision to close the US-run Guantanamo Bay detention facility in Cuba. The US president, Raul Castro, has criticized the decision, saying it was a \"disgrace\" to the Cuban people. \"It's a disgrace,\" Obama said in a statement, adding that he was \"deeply disappointed\" by the move. He also said that the United States should not be allowed to use Guantanamo as a military prison. But he added that it would be \"a shame\" for the Cubans to have to go through such a situation again. Obama, who was elected in 2010, said he would \"never allow this to happen again.\" \"I'm not going to allow it,\" he said, referring to Cuba's military detention facilities, which have been closed since the end of World War II. In 2011, President Obama announced that Cuba would open its military facilities to US troops, but he did not specify when or how that would take place. That's not to say that Obama's decision was not a political one. It was an economic one, after all. And it is not the first time that this has happened. During his first year in office, Obama made a series of controversial statements on the subject, including a speech he gave to a group of students at the University of Rio de Janeiro in which he called for an end to Guantanamo's use of torture, torture and other forms of violence. His speech was also criticized by some of his fellow Republicans in Congress for being too soft on Cuba, and for not doing enough to protect the country's people from the horrors of war and oppression. Many of these comments were made in response to criticism from some members of Congress. Some of them, however, were in support of Obama. Others, such as former US Secretary of State John Kerry, criticized Obama for failing to take action against the Castro regime. They also called on him to step down from his post as US President in 2011. However, many of those who criticize the president's policies, like Obama himself, are also critical of him. For example, they say he should be able to do more to improve relations with Cuba than he has done in recent years. On the other hand, the Obama administration has made it clear that there is no need for a US military base in Guantanamo, where the U.S. military is based. There are no plans to build a base there. Instead, there will be a number of military bases in Havana, as well as facilities in other parts of Cuba and the Caribbean. At the same time, though, Cuba is still a very poor country in terms of economic and social development. This is a country with a long history of poverty, unemployment and unemployment. What's more, it has a lot of people who are poor and poor in their own country. These poor people are the ones who suffer the most from poverty and poverty. As a result, this country is suffering from a lack of opportunities for economic growth and a shortage of jobs. Last year, more than 1.5 million people were forced to leave their homes in order to escape the harsh economic conditions that have plagued the island nation for decades. Since then, that number has risen to 2.4 million. Most of that is due to economic stagnation and rising unemployment, according to some estimates. Unemployment is at a record low of 4.7 percent. A number are expected to rise to 5.6 percent in 2012, a figure that could reach 6.3 percent by 2020. Meanwhile, in Brazil, about a quarter of all the population is unemployed, with unemployment at 7.8 percent, compared to 4 percent for all other countries in Latin America. Despite the fact that unemployment is high in many countries, poverty is the main cause of unemployment in some areas, especially in rural areas like Brazil and Brazil. So, while the economy is struggling to recover from its worst economic crisis in decades, people in those countries are still struggling with the prospect of a recession."

The case has highlighted the army's problems with equipment and morale. The men sentenced to death on Wednesday were part of the special forces division ordered in August to retake three towns in Borno state, which had been taken over by the Islamist Boko Haram insurgents. Their lawyer, Femi Falana, said the 54 men were sentenced to death by firing squad and five had been acquitted. They were accused of conspiring to commit mutiny against the authorities of the 7th Division of the Nigerian army, which is on the frontline. The trial began on October 15 and was conducted behind closed doors. It is subject to approval by top military officials, but there has so far been no indication that senior officers oppose the court martial. They were not available for comment afterwards. There was a similar case in Nigeria in September, when 12 soldiers were sentenced to death for mutiny after firing on their commanding officer in the northeast city of Maiduguri. The 7th Division, based in Maiduguri, leads the offensive but there are numerous reports of troops refusing to deploy. Soldiers have regularly complained that they lack weapons, food, and other basic supplies to fight the Islamists, who are reported to have tanks, rocket-propelled-grenade launchers, and other heavy weaponry. Boko Haram has taken a number of towns and declared an Islamic caliphate in the region near the border with Cameroon. The Nigerian military has in recent weeks claimed to have made progress in recapturing lost territory. Thousands of people have been killed since the Islamist uprising began five years ago. An estimated 1.3 million have been displaced, with tens of thousands seeking refuge in neighboring Cameroon, Chad, and Niger. rg/bk (AFP, AP, dpa)",
        "generated_story": "A court martial against Boko Haram Islamists in Borno state has been declared in the northeastern state. The military has declared a military operation against the Islamist group, which has claimed responsibility for the deadly attacks that have killed at least 10 people and displaced hundreds of thousands of people. On Wednesday, the military said it had declared the operation illegal, adding that it would continue until the end of the month. \"We will continue to fight the terrorists,\" said military spokesman Femi Falana, who was in Maiduguri on Wednesday. He added that the army had launched an investigation into the attacks, saying it was conducting an \"urgent investigation.\" The army has also launched a counter-insurgency operation to try and arrest the group's members. It is not clear how many people have been arrested so far, but it is believed to be close to 10,000, according to a statement from the 7th Division. Police have said they are still searching for suspects in connection with the attack. They have also said that some of those arrested are suspected of being members of a terrorist group. According to the statement, they were arrested on August 15 and charged with carrying out attacks on police and soldiers. Authorities said the suspects were being held without bail and that they would face charges of kidnapping, torture and other crimes. There were also allegations of human rights violations, including rape and attempted rape, and the use of force against civilians, as well as attempted murder and kidnapping of civilians. At the same time, a court-martial was scheduled for October 15 for a number of cases in which the defendants were accused of failing to comply with court orders. In one case, one of them was a lawyer who argued that he was not entitled to immunity from prosecution because he had not been convicted of any crime. Another case was filed in August, when a judge ordered the prosecution of two men who had been detained by the Nigerian army. Both men were convicted on charges related to their alleged involvement in attacks against soldiers and civilians in a Cameroon-based military base. One of these men was charged on September 15 with murder, while the other accused him of attempting to rape a soldier. A second case is being heard on October 16, against a man who is also a Nigerian citizen. All three defendants, however, have pleaded not guilty to all charges and are being tried in absentia. If convicted, both men will be sentenced to life in prison, with a maximum sentence of 10 years in jail. Meanwhile, two other defendants have already been released on bail for their involvement. Prosecutors have asked for an extension of their jail term of one year, in order to prevent them from being extradited to Nigeria. But they have yet to reach an agreement on whether they should be allowed to leave the country. For now, there is no word on what charges they will face, other than the possibility of extradition to Cameroon, Chad, Cameroon and Chad. However, if they decide to go to court, it will not be a long time before they can do so. This is the first time that a criminal court has heard the case. Last month, an army court in Cameroon convicted two people of murder in an attempt to quell the violence that has taken place between the two sides. These two cases were brought by a group of Islamists who claimed to have staged an armed attack on a police convoy and were later convicted by military court. That case has now been referred to as a \"trial of war\" and is expected to proceed to trial in October."

        "target": "All Eyes on Kimi and Ferdy on Schumi's Turf All eyes will be on a Finn and a Spaniard at the German Grand Prix at Hockenheim on Sunday as the title battle between Kimi Raikkonen and Fernando Alonso looks to put local hero Michael Schumacher in the shade. It is a reflection of his current inauspicious Formula One campaign that World Champion Michael Schumacher is only featuring in reports on this weekend's German Grand Prix at Hockenheim dues to his nationality. The home grown champion equaled his own record of 11 wins in a season at last year's race but this year he will be hoping to just get on the podium at the end. Schumi lies in third place some 34 points off the top spot and has a lot to do if he is to record his 85th career win. Ferrari's poor season to date is unlikely to get better with hopes dwindling that the 36-year-old will add to his sole victory of the season although the seven-time world champion characteristically refuses to rule it out. Schumi and Ferrari still in the fight \"Contrary to many other people's opinions, we have in no means written ourselves off, even though we have to admit that the situation has worsened recently, rather than improved,\" said the German, referring to the problems with this season's car. \"But that doesn't mean that it can't be improved again, and that's exactly what we're working on.\" The limelight is falling on two young pretenders to Schumacher's throne as Sunday's race approaches. The battle between McLaren's flying Finn Kimi Raikkonen and championship leader Renault's speedy Spaniard Fernando Alonso is diverting eyes from the world record holding German on his own turf. Kimi aims to keep heat on leader Alonso Raikkonen must finish the German Grand Prix for the first time in five attempts to close the gap on Alonso if he is to keep his own championship hopes alive. The Finn retired from last year's race because of a rear wing failure and this season has been plagued by technical problems which most recently cost him 10 places on the starting grid in each of the last two rounds. Despite those penalties for engine failure, the 25-year-old managed to finish second and third but he will have to increase his total of three race wins if he is to make a significant impression on the 26-point chasm that separates him from Alonso. \"The battle for the championship is still on and I am determined to get a good result and work on closing the gap,\" said the Finn. \"The (car) has good speed and we need to make the most of it this weekend.\" Montoya doing McLaren team mate no favors Raikkonen's car is obviously a fast one this season but he's not the only driver in a McLaren hot seat. Colombia's Juan Pablo Montoya is not to going to make way for his team mate while his own hopes of the title, however small, remain alive. \"I am really looking forward to racing again this weekend in Germany,\" said Montoya, who won at Hockenheim for Williams two years ago and got his first victory for McLaren in Britain two weeks ago. \"I enjoy racing at Hockenheim, I have performed well here and won in the past and I am aiming for a strong result like at Silverstone.\" Consistent Ferdy the man to beat at Hockenheim Championship leader Alonso, meanwhile, has been impressively consistent for Renault so far this season, winning five times and failing to score points only at the Canadian Grand Prix, where he crashed, and in Indianapolis. The Spaniard is setting the pace and the standard this season so, problems aside, Alonso will again be the man to beat at Hockenheim.",
        "generated_story": "Ferrari's Fernando Alonso and Kimi Raikkonen battle for the German Grand Prix title in Hockenheim F1's biggest race of the year has been won by Ferrari's Juan Pablo Montoya. The two-time world champion has won the last three races of his career, but the Spaniard is the only one who has not finished in the top ten. \"I am so happy to be in this position,\" he said after Sunday's race, adding that he is \"very happy with the way I am feeling right now.\" \"It's a great feeling to have the opportunity to win the title,\" said Alonso, who finished fourth in his first race in Formula One last year. He is also the reigning World Champion, having won three consecutive races in a row, including the 2015 and 2016 constructors' championships. But he has yet to make it to the final round of qualifying, which will be held at Silverstone on Sunday, and he will have to wait until the end of next year's season for his chance to challenge for a place at the world championship. Ferrari driver Sergio Perez, meanwhile, is in pole position, while his team-mate, Nico Hulkenberg, was fourth. Both drivers have been battling for supremacy in their respective disciplines, with both having been world champions for more than a decade. In the past, the two drivers had been rivals for most of their careers, although they have never won a race since the 1990s, when they were both drivers of Ferrari and McLaren. They have also been champions in both Formula 1 and Formula 3, respectively, since then. Fernando has also won two races, in 2012 and 2013, as well as in 2014 and in 2015. Last year, he won both the World Championship and the Drivers' Championship, finishing fourth and fifth in each of those categories. This season, though, they are now in second place in terms of points with Ferrari, Mercedes, McLaren and Williams. Alonso is currently third in points, ahead of Hamilton, Williams and Ferrari respectively. Hamilton is fourth with a total of seven points. His teammate, Sergio P\u00e9rez, has a further three points in third and fourth place with two rounds to go. McLaren's Sebastian Vettel is third with four points and is fifth with three rounds remaining in 2017. Teammate Fernando Alvaro is second with one point, after finishing second in 2013 and 2014. However, his best finish was a lap off the grid in Germany, where he finished seventh in qualifying. That's not good enough for him to claim the overall title but it is a good start to a season in which he should be able to do so again in 2018. It's the first time he's been in front of a crowd of fans for almost a year and a half. And it's only the second time this year that the Japanese driver has managed to get a podium finish, despite the fact that his car is not quite as fast as the other drivers' cars. For McLaren, that means he'll have a lot of time to settle down and get used to his new surroundings. Meanwhile, Alonso's McLaren team is still struggling to find a way to keep up with their pace, especially after the recent struggles of Nico Rosberg and Kvyat, both of whom have struggled to stay on the podium in recent years. Raikonen has struggled with his pace and power, however, so he can't complain too much about his lack of pace. Despite his struggles at times, Hamilton and Valtteri Bottas are the clear favorites for second and third places in Saturday's second-place finisher's standings."

        "target": "German Publishers Warm to Google Library Google is heading for a legal battle with American publishers over its plan to digitize books from five major libraries. But German publishers seem warm to the idea. Five major US publishers filed suit in San Francisco on Wednesday to block Google from scanning books without the permission of copyright holders. The project, already underway but stopped by Google in August, is the Silicon Valley company's bid to make the world's books searchable online. Five major libraries are already participating in the project and Google sent executive Jennifer Grant to the Frankfurt Book Fair on Wednesday to present the idea to European and German book publishers. This week Google introduced print.google.de, the German version of the search engine Google posted online this time last year. Google lets users type in a search term then scans its digitized library for the word or expression and produces a list of books where the term is mentioned. Users can then click on the results and a few pages of the text appear allowing users to read up online. The idea is to supplement Internet users with another source of material. In contrast to their American colleagues, German publishing houses have reacted well to the database. Some German publishers on board Google said that is discussing terms with all major German publishers. Langenscheidt, which publishes a large selection of dictionaries, said they had got on board. \"We are starting with 160 books,\" Hubert Haarmann, head of the electronic publishing division and the publisher, told the Financial Times Deutschland. \"We see it as an additional distribution possibility.\" An increased and more direct reach to the consumer is just one way Google is promoting its new project to skeptical publishers. The company also says that publishers will be able to monitor interest in titles through the search engine, and use the information in deciding whether to reprint certain books. Google has also promised publishers a cut of the advertising that will appear on the site. Not all German publishers are on board. In fact, the German association representing publishers has announced it will begin its own project where publishers can scan their own books, rather than let someone else do it. The project is not a competitor to Google, but will allow publishers to create their own database, rather than turn it over to the search engine. If Google can, anyone can But American publishers don't want to even take that step. They fear a slippery slope if Google is allowed to digitize copyrighted material. \"If Google can make \u2026 copies, then anyone can,\" Patricia Schroeder, president of the Association of American Publishers, said in a phone interview with Reuters. \"Anybody could go into a library and start making digital copies of anything.\" At issue is the right of authors and their publishers to their own work versus the \"fair use\" of their work by the public. Google argues that their search engine will only offer users a \"card catalog\" function, with a few pages of text. No one will be able to read the entire book online.",
        "generated_story": "German-language search engine Google has launched a new German language search tool for books. It is called Langenscheidt, which is based in Frankfurt, Germany's largest city. The company has announced plans to launch the service in August, with the aim of making it easier for German-speakers to find books on the Internet, the Financial Times Deutschland reported on Wednesday, adding that it would be free to use in the future. \"We are very excited about this,\" said Jennifer Grant, head of Google's Frankfurt Book Fair in Germany, referring to the German edition of \"The New York Times\" and \"the German version of the New Yorker.\" \"It's a great tool to search for new books,\" she said in an interview with Deutsche Welle.

German is also available on Google Play. In the US, it's available for free in English, French and Spanish. Germany is the only country in Europe where Google is allowed to publish German books, according to its website.

        "target": "The Sun Sets Slowly Over Brandenburg's Tropical Dream Having suffered many disappointments concerning publically funded projects, the state of Brandenburg hoped a tropical leisure center would offer a ray of hope. Instead the ailing concern is just bringing more gloom. The economically depressed eastern German state of Brandenburg has seen its fair share of bitter experiences when it comes to huge public investment projects since German unification in 1990. Against this background, state authorities were pleased when Malaysian businessman Colin Au built a huge tropical-feeling leisure center in Brandenburg without any subsidies. The center, which opened about a year ago, was to become a symbol of economic success in a region where unemployment still hovers around the 20 percent mark. But the leisure time park, which has already swallowed a little under 100 million euros ($120 million) in private investment, is now going to have to depend on public funding to avoid another economic fiasco in Brandenburg. State authorities in Brandenburg haven't been too successful in their public investment policy in the past 10 years, to put it mildly. A grand plan to build one of the world's most modern chip-producing factories there burst like a bubble in 2003. The much-talked about Brandenburg-Berlin International airport still seems light years away from being built. Line of failures looked to be ended by Au's vision Another beacon of economic hope disappeared in 2002 when a company planning to build gas-filled transport airships went bust despite considerable subsidies. But Au's vision for the abandoned dome which the airship company needed as a hangar offered Brandenburg another chance. In the middle of nowhere, he created what he named his \"Tropical Islands\" wonderland, sporting everything from sandy beaches, lakes and a Laguna to a Caribbean-style village. The economics ministry in Brandenburg was over the moon to see Au originally agreeing to build the facility without any state subsidies. And Au himself had no doubt at the time that he could well do without them. Overestimated visitor numbers tell sorry story But the center's first year in operation tells a different story. Colin Au, who has meanwhile left Brandenburg and transferred matters to a German management company, had expected some 1.5 million visitors to come to Tropical Islands within the first year, but only some 950,000 will have turned up by the end of 2005. It seems highly unlikely that visitor numbers will increase considerably in future, placing a question mark on the viability of the whole centre. But Brandenburg's economics ministry is certain that the park will be in the black as of 2008. To make the place more attractive, it has agreed to shell out 15 million euros in subsidies for yet another reconstruction and marketing effort. After all, the leisure time center has a workforce of about 500 and is thus the biggest employer in an otherwise depressed region marked by a high jobless rate. Tropical center down but not out...not yet \"We hope the money will help make the Tropical Islands resort better known throughout Europe according to the new marketing concept hammered out the management,\" ministry spokesman Steffen Kammrath said. \"This leisure time center is unique and has to be marketed as such. What you have there is a tropical and water world 12 months a year with a lot of attractive offers to spend a whale of a time there.\" Some commentators believe that state subsidies may prolong the center's life span, but will not be able to avoid its demise in the long run. But the idea of also making it more attractive for tourists from all over Europe seems unrealistic to them if the resort's management can't even get enough visitors from home to ensure a profitable operation.",
        "generated_story": "The Sun Sets Slowly Over Brandenburg's Tropical Islands Resort The sun sets slowly over the tropical islands resort in the southern German state of the Baltic Sea on Sunday. The setting sun is setting over a tropical island off the German coast. It's the first day of a three-day vacation for the business tycoon Colin Au, who owns the resort, which opened in 2002. In the early hours of Sunday morning, the sun set slowly on the island of Laguna, setting off a cloud of clouds and mist that is expected to last for at least a few hours. At the same time, it's starting to look like the temperature is going to rise again. \"The sun has set,\" said Steffen Kammrath, Branden-Berlin International Airport's director of airport operations, referring to the stormy weather that has swept through the region in recent years. He added: \"It's a beautiful day, and I can't wait to get out of bed and go to bed.\" The rising sun, however, is not the only reason why the forecast is so optimistic. For the past three years, temperatures have risen to 100 degrees Celsius (120 degrees Fahrenheit) and the wind has picked up. This is the second year in a row that the high-altitude storm has hit the area. Last year, a storm caused the airport to be closed for three days due to high winds and heavy rain. Since then, there have been no major storms, but the weather has been unusually warm and sunny, with temperatures reaching the mid-80s. That's because the winds are so strong that it is difficult to keep up with the rising temperatures. On the other hand, this is a very good day for business. There's no reason to think that there won't be a lot of rain this year. So, let's hope that this will not be the last time that we see the light of day. If so, we'll have to wait until the end of next year to see if we can make it to Christmas, when we will be able to go back to our hotel and have a good night's sleep. I'm not sure how long it will take for this storm to come to an end. But I do know that when it comes to business, business and tourism, I think we're in for a long, long time. We'll see what the future holds in store for us, because we've been in business for so long. And that's what we want to do. Let's not forget about the fact that our business is very important to us. Business has always been a part of our lives and we have always wanted to make the most of it. What's more important is to have the best of both worlds in mind when you're working together with a business partner and a businessman. You don't need to spend a fortune on a vacation, you just need the right kind of money, right? And then you can spend the money on your own, too. Just ask the entrepreneur, or the businessman who is in charge of your vacation. Or the businessmen who are the owners of this resort to invest in your business? The business model is quite different from the one you've had in other countries, for example, where you spend your money in hotels and restaurants. When the company was founded in 1990, they had a reputation for being very successful. Now, that reputation is being eroded by the success of their business models. They are no longer in doubt, though, as they are becoming more and more successful in their own right. As a result, their success has become more apparent every year since the beginning of 2003. These days, businesses and investors are looking for ways to expand their businesses, not only in Germany but also in Europe as well. One such example is at the top of Europe's list of destinations to visit, such as the European Union's largest economy, Germany, Spain, Italy, France, Japan, China and Spain. A number of companies have opened up business in this area, including the Tropical Island Resort in Berlin. Many of these companies are based in and around the country. Some of them have already made millions of euros in profits, while others have made billions of dollars in investments. Others have invested in projects in Africa, Europe, Asia and Africa. However, many of those companies do not have enough money to cover the costs of developing their facilities, so they have little to show for it, according to a spokesman for one company."

Clubs officials say talks are ongoing in the hope Max Meyer will extend his contract. Schalke might struggle to retain 22-year-old midfielder Max Meyer when his contract runs out at the end of the season, at least according to recent media interviews from the club's sporting director, Christian Heidel. Speaking to German news agency dpa, Heidel confirmed that Meyer turned down an offer of a contract extension earlier in February. \"Max Meyer's agent received an extension offer on January 12 with a deadline of February 15, and informed us on February 15 via email that Max would not be accepting the offer because of the deadline imposed,\" Heidel told dpa. \"We have acknowledged this. For now, we no longer feel beholden to the terms of that offer, but that doesn't mean an extension is impossible either.\" Meyer was reportedly offered an annual salary in the region of \u20ac5.5 million ($6.7 million); it was the second contract he refused, following a less lucrative offer at the end of last season.

Speaking to Sport Bild magazine, meanwhile, Heidel sought to focus on Meyer's more important role at Schalke, his regular game time, arguing it might be in the youngster's best interests to stay at a club that needs him every week. \"[Coach] Domenico Tedesco has formed the team around him in such a way that there is now an ideal spot for Max. That was not always the case,\" Heidel said. \"He needs to ask himself, putting the financial aspect to one side: 'Will I get such a position at a different club?'

The Capella case has hampered the Catholic Church's attempts to move on from its myriad of pedophile priest scandals.

The Vatican said on Saturday that the priest, who was arrested in the US in 1980, had been convicted of child sex trafficking. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison on June 22 for the crime, which he pleaded not guilty to in September. In a statement, the pope said he was \"deeply troubled\" by the allegations against him. \"I am deeply troubled,\" he said, adding that he had \"no idea what was going on in his life.\" The charges against the cardinal came as a result of the Vatican's decision to extradite him to the United States, where he faces charges of sexual abuse and child molestation, according to Vatican spokesman George Pell. Pell has denied the charges, saying he did not have any knowledge of what had taken place and that it was not a case of a child being molested by a pedophile. Francis, however, has called for a thorough investigation of all allegations, including allegations of abuse, rape and sexual exploitation of minors, and said the church would cooperate fully with the investigation. Vatican prosecutors are also looking into the case, Pell said in a letter to Francis. They are seeking to determine whether or not he has violated the Rome code of conduct and whether he should be extradited to a US court. A Vatican spokeswoman said Francis had no comment on the matter. 'We have no further comment at this time,' she said."

And the news was good -- most of the numbers were down compared to the preceding year. Germany's streets were never particularly dangerous, but according to the Interior Ministry, they are now safer than at any time since statistics have been collected. Reported criminal offenses on the whole dropped by 1.4 percent over 2005 -- to a total of just over 6.3 million. \"The statistics show reductions in crime among children, adolescents and teenagers, as well as adults,\" said Sch\u00e4uble. He added that criminality among foreigners living in Germany also fell, saying that this development reflected Germany's efforts to integrate non-Germans. Drugs offenses were down 7.8 percent, followed by theft and street crime, which both declined by four percent or more. Youth violence Vandalism, on the other hand, was up 5.9 percent. Fraud rose slightly, as did violent crime -- among young people by an alarming 4.5 percent. Berlin Interior Minister Erhart K\u00f6rting said that was part of a decade-long trend in Germany. \"As many experts have pointed out,\" K\u00f6rting said, \"the potential for violence in society is increasing.\" The head of the German Police Officers' Union Konrad Freiberg also said those figures showed that German society was not truly getting safer. Frankfurt tops most-dangerous list Crime was down in Frankfurt am Main, but it's still the German city with the greatest number of criminal offenses per 100,000 people. Hanover was a close second, followed by D\u00fcsseldorf, Bremen and Berlin. The total percentage of criminal cases solved by German police also improved slightly from 55 to 55.4 percent. According to the study, Germany's safest place was Bergisch Gladbach, a city of 100,000 inhabitants in the west of the country -- coincidentally, model Heidi Klum's home town.",

The government of Chancellor Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble has promised to crack down on crimes committed by police officers, prosecutors and the public. On Tuesday, Germany's Interior Ministry said it would take steps to tackle the problem. \"We will not tolerate any form of state-sponsored crime,\" the ministry said in a statement. It did not specify which crimes were committed, but it did say that it was \"a very serious crime\" and that the police were not involved in any criminal activity. Police officers in Frankfurt am Main, Bremen, Bergisch Gladbach and Hamburg were among the first to report a case of drug-related crimes in 2006. German police said they were investigating a number of cases, including one in which a police officer was found to have been carrying a knife, which was later used to stab a policeman. A police spokesman said the investigation was ongoing, adding that \"there was no evidence of any kind of criminal act.\" The police union, the Berlin Police Officers' Union, and other police unions were also present at the news conference. They were, however, not charged with any crime, according to the Ministry of Interior spokesman Konrad Freiberg, who was not present for the event. He also said that police had not been charged in connection with the murder of a German policeman in 2005, when he was still in police uniform. In 2006, police forces were accused of carrying out a series of attacks on officers who had been on duty for more than a year. Since then, they have had to take action to stop the attacks, as well as the use of excessive force and excessive speed. Last year, a total of 10,000 officers were killed in an anti-terror operation in southern Germany. At the same time, some of them were shot and wounded by a stray bullet. Some of those who were injured were taken to hospital, while others were treated for minor injuries. Many of these cases were later transferred to police stations, where they are still being treated as a crime-fighting unit. This is the second time in less than two years that a member of parliament has been arrested for a criminal offense. (Reuters, dpa)"

The Social Democrats (SPD) and Christian Democrats (CDU) have ruled the small northern city-state of Bremen in a coalition for the past 12 years. But after winning state elections on Sunday with 36.8 percent, the SPD is now flirting with the idea of ditching their previous coalition partners to rule together with the Greens, who made their best-ever showing in a German state poll with 16.4 percent. Bremen's state SPD leadership is to hold talks later on Wednesday with the CDU, which polled 25.7 percent. After an SPD meeting in Bremen, Mayor Jens B\u00f6hrnsen made the first signal he could be favoring the Greens. He said that during the campaign he had deliberately abstained from mentioning the possibility of a renewed CDU coalition because \"after 12 years it shouldn't automatically be continued.\" Bremen's acting head of government and CDU member Thomas R\u00f6wekamp, however, warned against an SPD-Green coalition. \"The majority of people don't want a red-green experiment, but a continuation of the grand coalition,\" he said. Both the SPD and CDU conceded heavy losses in the election, which showed a swing towards the Greens and the Left Party, which scored an unexpected 8.4 percent to win representation in a western German state legislature for the first time in its brief history. Block reforms? If Bremen's SPD decide in favor of the Greens, this would affect the ability of Chancellor Angela Merkel's grand coalition of CDU and SPD to push ahead with reforms requiring constitutional changes, such as stage two of Germany's urgently needed federalism reform. The federal Bundesrat, which is made up of state cabinet members, has to approve the majority of legislative bills passed by the lower chamber, the Bundestag, before they become law. Also, any proposed constitutional changes require two-thirds of all votes in order to be passed by the Bundesrat. The CDU and SPD currently hold 47 of the Bundesrat's 69 seats, which is one seat more than the necessary two-thirds majority. But without Bremen, the number held by the grand coalition would fall to 44 seats, meaning they would need the cooperation of one of the small opposition parties for any constitutional changes. Internal strife Earlier in the week, Chancellor Merkel called for unity within her ruling left-right coalition after the losses in Bremen set the stage for more infighting between the two parties. Merkel also warned the SPD against moving to the left after it lost some five percent points. The chancellor said the outcome showed the SPD had made a mistake by attacking the coalition and campaigning on promises of a minimum wage, which she believes will hamper efforts to fight unemployment of just under 10 percent. \"The result showed that this strategy did not pay off,\" Merkel told a press conference.",

The SPD, the ruling party, is expected to form a coalition government with the Greens and Greens, which have been in opposition for years. Merkel has said she will not allow the SPD to take part in any reforms, but she has also said that she would not rule out the possibility of a \"grand coalition\" of the two parties. \"We are not going to allow a grand coalition,\" she said in a statement on Wednesday, adding that her party would \"not be able to do anything about it.\" The Social Democrat mayor, Thomas R\u00f6wekamp, said he was \"very concerned\" about the party's chances of winning the Bundestag elections on Sunday. He added that his party was not ready to give up on the reforms and that it would have to work with other parties to implement them. But he said it was too early to say whether the coalition would succeed in its goal of enacting reforms that would reduce the number of people living in Germany's most populous state. B\u00e4rten's mayor is also worried about a possible backlash from the left-wing Social Democratic party (SPD), which has been pushing for reforms for several years, and which is opposed by the opposition Left party.

Here's a recipe for it: Ingredients: 1 packet yeast, active dry 1 teaspoon sugar 1 1/2 teaspoon salt 3 cups unbleached flour 1 tablespoon shortening 1 cup water (49 to 54 C / 120 to 130 F) 6 slices bacon -- diced 2 medium onions -- sliced 1/4 teaspoon cumin 1/2 teaspoon salt Pepper 1 egg yolk 1 cup sour cream Mix the yeast with the sugar, a teaspoon of salt and half a cup of flour. Blend in the shortening and warm water, then beat for two minutes. Add enough flour to make a soft dough, and then knead the dough until smooth and elastic, about five minutes. Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, then cover it and let it rise in a warm place for 30 minutes. Pat the dough into a lightly greased 12-inch pizza pan or onto a lightly greased baking sheet. Press up the edges to make a slight rim. Fry the bacon until crisp and drain it on absorbent paper. Add onions to the bacon grease, and cook slowly until tender, but not brown. Sprinkle the onions, bacon, cumin, half a teaspoon of salt and pepper over the dough. Bake the cake at 204 C (400 F) for 20 minutes. Blend the egg yolk and sour cream and pour the mixture over the Zwiebelkuchen. Bake it for another 10 to 15 minutes, until the cake is golden brown and the sour cream has set. Serve warm or at room temperature with white wine.",
        "generated_story": "German Onion Cake: A German Wine Companion to the Fall Wine Season German onion cake is one of the most sought-after dishes in the world. It's a German wine that has become synonymous with the fall wine season. But it's not just about the wine itself. There's also the fact that there are so many different types of onion cakes in Germany. You can find them on the internet, in wine stores, at the supermarket, or at a wine shop. And you can buy them in German supermarkets. The best part is that you don't have to spend a lot of money to get the best of it. For example, you won't be able to buy a bottle of wine from a store in Zwiebelkuchen. That's because the price is so high, and the quality is too high. So you're not going to find any of them at all. \"You'll just find the ones you want,\" says Federweisser, who has been making the cake for the past three years. In fact, he says, \"It's the only wine I've ever made.\" And that's exactly what he's doing. He's making it for his family and friends, but he also wants to make sure they have enough wine to last them through the winter and into the new year. This year's crop is expected to be particularly good, as well as the harvest season, which begins on October 1 and ends on November 1. We're looking forward to seeing what's in store for us this fall. I can't wait to try it, because I know it will be so good for my family. After all, we've all had our fair share of good wine, right? And we all know what we'll be drinking in autumn, when the weather is supposed to warm up a bit and we can start to enjoy the freshness of autumn. Just ask the German grape growers. They've had a good harvest so far and they've been very pleased with their harvest. Now, they're hoping for a harvest that will last until the end of October. What do you think? \"I think we're all ready for autumn,\" he asks, adding that he'd like to see more of this season's wine in his own garden, where he hopes to plant his garden. His garden is a perfect example of what can be grown and harvested in a variety of different varieties of vegetables and herbs, including strawberries, strawberries and parsley."

Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said the first inmate from the US prison at Guantanamo Bay had arrived in his country. Madrid has agreed to host five prisoners, the largest commitment yet from a European country. Citing privacy concerns, Rubalcaba refused to give the prisoner's name or any identifying information, except to say he was a Palestinian.

Spain urges others to 'do the utmost' Spain's decision to take five Guantanamo detainees is part of an effort to help US President Barack Obama with his plans to shut down the jail. The prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, was set up at a US navy base by former President George W. Bush in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos has urged other European countries \"to do their utmost\" to take in former Guantanamo detainees as well. Third countries are being asked to take in detainees who are cleared of any charges, but who can't be sent back to their homelands for fear of persecution. Obama had said he would close the prison by January 22, 2010, yet the deadline passed unmet. Some 200 detainees remain there, but finding places to take in the prisoners - even the dozens already cleared for release - has proved controversial. jen/AFP/AP Editor: Andreas Illmer",

Most of them are currently in solitary confinement, with the exception of one prisoner who has been sent to prison for a year and a half. Many of these prisoners are Palestinian, and some are from a Palestinian family. Some have lived in exile for more than a decade.

        "target": "Threat of the Punjabi Taliban is growing Deutsche Welle talks to Pakistani political expert Hasan Askari Rizvi about the growing ties between militants in northwest Pakistan and Punjab province. At least four gunmen disguised in police uniforms raided a hospital in Pakistan's eastern city of Lahore on Monday night, claiming at least five lives. Local officials said the gunmen were trying to free a militant, who was being treated there after being captured during attacks on two mosques last Friday. The police said the gunfight at Jinnah Hospital had lasted around 45 minutes but the gunmen had managed to flee. Friday's twin attacks on the minority Ahmadi community left more than 90 people dead. They were claimed by a group, which identified itself as the Punjabi wing of the Taliban. Deutsche Welle spoke to political expert Hasan Askari Rizvi in Lahore, where there has been a wave of violence in recent days. DW: Who are the \"Punjabi Taliban\"? It is a kind of a pejorative term, which includes a host of groups. Initially in Punjab, you had two types of militancy: One, the groups that focussed mainly on Indian-administered Kashmir and there were other types of groups that focussed on Pakistan. Those were the sectarian groups targeting mainly the Shias, and there were some Shia groups targeting the Sunni leadership. Over the years a lot of factions have broken away from these groups and these small entities are functioning more or less autonomously. They have trainings in the tribal areas because these are secured for them and certain parts are not under Pakistani control so these groups go there. They operate with the Pakistani Taliban based in tribal areas against the Pakistani troops in the region. They also have an autonomous agenda, which they pursue in Punjab, as they have been doing in the past days. These groups also play host or are a kind of a local link to Taliban suicide bombers who come into the main part of Pakistan from the tribal areas (let's say to Punjab). If they have to target some place, they park themselves with these Punjab groups, and then do it. All these factions and groups that have broken away from traditional militant groups and are functioning in close collaboration with tribal area Taliban are often described as the \"Punjabi Taliban\". Why do you think these militants are resurfacing now? They have always existed here and there and generally the trend is that they undertake a couple of operations, one after the other. Then the government comes in and takes action against them. Then they just disappear or become sleeping groups and suddenly after a couple of months they resurface. That's the standard pattern. The last major incident in Lahore was in the first week of March. Then there was nothing in April and now towards the end of May you have this kind of incident. Do you think the government should have taken stronger action against them? They should have but the problem is that the Punjab government has a kind of ambiguous approach and I think there is some element of denial within the leadership also. These groups also have some sympathy if not support at the societal level and that makes it difficult for the government to go against them openly. They need to work together and to emphasise to the people that they are terrorists. They use different names and Islam but actually their agenda is terrorism. Somehow the government of Punjab has been rather confused and ambiguous regarding these groups. Interview: Disha Uppal Editor: Anne Thomas",

The threat from the Pakistani Taliban is increasing, according to German news agency Deutsche Welle (DW) and a Pakistani journalist, Disha Uppal, who has been reporting on the situation in Pakistan for the past two weeks. \"The Taliban are growing,\" she told DW, adding that the country's security situation is becoming increasingly tense. She said the Taliban were \"increasingly active in the north of Pakistan.\" She added that \"the Taliban have been increasing their attacks on hospitals, schools, hospitals and other places of worship.\" \"They are increasing the number of people who come to the hospital every day, and they are becoming more and more radical. They are also spreading their ideology, which is to say that they want to take control of all hospitals in Lahore, Karachi and the entire country.\" The Taliban, however, are not the only threat to Pakistan's health and security. Last week, the government of Punjab, Punjab and Sindh issued a joint statement saying that it would not allow the militants to enter the hospitals. It also said that if they were allowed access, they would be able to carry out their own attacks without fear of reprisal. According to a new report by the German newspaper \"Deutsche Zeitung\" (Welle) in a report published on Monday, April 24, 2017, it warned that Pakistani security forces were preparing for an attack on Jinnah Hospital in Ahmadi.

        "target": "Party leaders call for increased wages in growing German economy Chancellor Angela Merkel and other top officials have called for upticks in Germany's economy to trickle down to workers in the form of higher pay. But a leading think tank has warned against giving raises too soon. Germany's foreign minister and deputy chancellor, Guido Westerwelle, has added his support to comments made by Economics Minster Rainer Bruederle about increased wages for German workers. \"When the economy grows and this growth is substantial and sustainable, then the benefits of this upswing should be felt by the people who worked so hard for it,\" Westerwelle told the Hamburger Abendblatt newspaper in an interview. Westerwelle heads the free-market liberal FDP, which shares power with Chancellor Merkel's Christian coalition. Earlier this week, Bruederle, also an FDP member, said in light of Germany's currently growing economy, those economic gains should trickle down to employees in the form of higher wages. Merkel, who is also the head of the Christian Democratic Union, supported Bruederle's idea. \"That is something the chancellor sees the same way, letter for letter,\" said Merkel's spokesman, Steffen Seibert. Not so fast Earlier this week, analysts predicted growth of 3.5 percent this year and 2 percent in 2011. Germany's five leading economic think tanks also predicted that the number of unemployed would fall below 3 million next year, the lowest level since 1992. Despite the current rosy outlook for the German economy, not everyone is convinced that a growing economy should inevitably lead to higher wages. The president of the German Institute for Economic Research, Klaus Zimmermann, warned against reacting too quickly. \"I can't support the idea of a general wage increase, I think it is too dangerous,\" Zimmermann said in an interview with the Handelsblatt newspaper. Zimmermann wasn't opposed to the idea of raising wages, but said he was against across-the-board increases for all sectors and pointed out that not every industry is benefitting the same from the growing economy. \"We can't forget that the German economy did not resort to mass lay-offs when it wasn't going so well last year,\" Zimmermann said. Raising wages in some branches could be a good idea, Zimmermann said, as that would make those branches more attractive option to potential workers from outside of Germany.

        "generated_story": "Chancellor Angela Merkel's Deputy Chancellor, Klaus Zimmermann, is against a general wage increase in Germany. The FDP's deputy chancellor, Rainer Bruederle, has called for a \"general increase\" in the minimum wage. \"We are not in a position to raise wages,\" he told the Handelsblatt newspaper in an interview published on Wednesday, adding that he was \"not in favor of it at all.\" \"I am not against the general increase, but I am against it because it is not necessary for the economy to be able to compete with other countries,\" she said. But she added that she was not opposed to raising wages, and that it would be a good thing for Germany's economy, which has been suffering from a lack of economic growth in recent years. For example, in 2011, the German economy grew by 1.5 percent, compared to the previous year's growth rate of 2.7 percent. This was the first time Germany had seen a rise in wage growth since the 1990s, when the country was a free-market economy. Since then, however, it has struggled to find a way to keep up with the growth of the middle class. In the last few years, unemployment has fallen to a record low of 3.6 percent and the unemployment rate has risen to 4.4 percent in some parts of Germany, according to an analysis by the International Institute for Economic Research (IER) in Hamburger Abendblatten. That's a significant increase from the current level of 6.3 percent that was achieved in 1992. It is the second consecutive year that the average German wage has declined by more than 1 percent over the same period of time. On the other hand, there have been a number of wage increases, including a 2 percent increase for women, a 3 percent rise for men and a 5 percent hike for those with a family income of less than 10 euros ($4.8 million) and an increase of 10 percent for families with two or more children. There have also been increases in wages for young people, as well as for people who are working part-time jobs. And there is also the issue of how to pay for education, health care and social welfare, among other things. According to IER, this is a very important issue for all Germans, who want to have their children educated and have the opportunity to earn a decent living. I think it's important that we have a fair wage for our children, too, because that's what we want them to do. If we are going to make a living, we will have to give them a better education. We will not be giving them the chance to learn the value of their education or the skills they need to work in order to get a job. They will be taught the importance of education in their own country. So, if they want a career, they must learn to live with it. You can't be too hard on yourself. Just ask the chancellor's spokesman, Steffen Seibert, for example. He said he would not give up on the idea that education should be an important part of any future course of action. However, he did not rule out the possibility of starting a new course in which education is an option for future generations of German students, especially those who have not yet graduated from high school. Instead, his spokesman said, \"The chancellor will continue to push for higher education and vocational education.\" He also said the government was committed to making education more accessible to all German citizens, not just the young and working-class."

Bayern Munich cruised to a 3-0 victory at home against Bavarian rival FC Nuremberg on Sunday, closing the German soccer tables for the weekend. Striker Mario Gomez got things going in the 10th minute for Bayern and also scored the final goal in the 75th minute off a corner kick from Franck Ribery. Ribery came on as a substitute five minutes earlier, making his first appearance for the team since injuring his ankle in September. Near the end of the match, Gomez had an opportunity for his third goal on a penalty kicked but missed. Thirty points at break Phillipp Lahm successfully converted a penalty kick in the 57th minute to round out the scoring for Bayern. The victory for Bayern moved them into sixth place in the table with 19 points and has continued a slow shift in momentum following a rough start to the season. Bayern coach Louis van Gaal said after the game he hoped his team would have 30 points by the end of the first half of the season in five more matches. Cisse saves win for Freiburg In Sunday's other Bundesliga match, Senegal striker Papiss Demba Cisse broke a scoreless deadlock with a goal in the 91st minute to give Freiburg a 1-0 win over Hoffenheim. Cisse has now scored 10 goals in 12 games and is currently the Bundesliga's second highest scorer. The win moves Freiburg into fourth place in the table with 21 points, one ahead of Frankfurt in fourth and three behind Bayer Leverkusen and Mainz, in second and third place, respectively. Nuremberg drop to 10th place with 18 points at the end of a very tight middle group. Just three points separate Nuremburg from Freiburg. Hoffenheim also have 18 points but are two places ahead of Nuremberg in eighth place on goal difference. Author: Matt Zuvela (dpa, sid) Editor: Sean Sinico",
        "generated_story": "Bayern Munich's Papiss Demba Cisse seals 3-0 win over Hoffenheim Bayern Munich has won its third consecutive Bundesliga title. The German champions have won their first three Bundesliga matches in a row, and they are on course for their third in as many years. On Sunday, the Bavarian club beat the Bundesliga's top-flight side, Freiburg, 2-1, in the first Bundesliga match of the season. German coach Josep Lahm said: \"We are very happy with the result. We have a lot of confidence in our players and the way they play. It's a great feeling to be able to play in front of so many fans and to have the opportunity to see the best of them,\" he told reporters after the match. \"It's been a long time coming, but we are so happy to get this win.\" The win came after a three-match winless streak for Bayern, which has seen the German side win three of their last four league matches. In the last three matches, they have lost just once, to Hoffenerheim and Cologne. But on Sunday they beat Bayern 4-2 in their opening Bundesliga game. After a difficult first half, Bayern managed to come back from a goal down to level the score at 1-all. At the other end, their coach, Franz Beckenbauer, was forced to concede a late penalty. He was replaced by Franck Ribery, who was sent off for a second yellow card in his first game in charge of Bayern's last two Bundesliga games. Following the game, he was given a red card for the second time in three games, giving Bayern the only goal they could muster in that period of time. However, it wasn't enough to stop the visitors from scoring. Bayern had to settle for just one more goal, as they were unable to make it through to the third round. They were also without their best player, Mario Gomez, for most of Sunday's match, after he had been suspended for an incident in which he made contact with a teammate during the buildup to a corner kick. Germany's second-tier club, Mainz, has been struggling to find a way to win its first league game since the end of last season's campaign. That's when the Germans came to their senses and made a change of course. Instead of focusing on the positives of a draw against a team that has struggled in recent weeks, Germany has decided to focus on what they can do to improve their chances of reaching the Champions League quarter-finals. And that's the most important thing right now: the fact that they will have to do that in order to reach the next round of competition. For the past three years Bayern have struggled to keep up with their opponents. Last season, though, that was the case. This year, however, there was no such thing as an easy win for either side. There were only three points in all competitions, with only one goal conceded by the hosts and only two from the substitutes' bench. Both teams have been on a losing streak since August, when they lost to Bayer Leverkusen, a side that had won three consecutive matches at home to Bayern in September and October. What's more, this was a result that will be remembered as a turning point for German football, not just in Germany. How Bayern can improve on their recent form and be more successful in Europe is a matter of how well they prepare themselves for next year's Bundesliga season and how they adapt to it. With the exception of this weekend's clash with Bayern and Dortmund, all three teams are expected to perform well at the top of Group E."

        "target": "Teabag filter cleans water with nanotechnology A new water filter developed in South Africa could provide millions of people with clean drinking water. The filter, about the size and shape of a teabag, would be inexpensive, easy to distribute and simple to use. Marelize Botes is conducting a final set of tests on a new type of diminutive water filter before industrial production can begin. The microbiologist pours water from a plastic bottle though a high-tech, teabag-sized filter before analyzing it in her in her laboratory at the University of Stellenbosch in South Africa. \"The filter is much cheaper than bottled water as well as any other filter on the market,\" she told Deutsche Welle. Instead of being filled with black or green tea, the bag contains active carbon granules and is made from nanofibers treated with biocide, which kills bacteria rather than simply filtering them from the water. Nanotech for pennies \"This project takes nanotechnology to the poorest of the poor people who live in this world, and it will make a difference in their lives,\" said Eugen Cloete, who in addition to inventing the filter is dean of the faculty of science at Stellenbosch University and chair of Stellenbosch University's Water Institute. With some 300 million people in Africa - and over a billion worldwide - living without access to clean drinking water, the need for such a filter is huge. When in mass production, the developers said they expect the teabag to cost just a few South African cents (under half a US cent and under a third of a euro cent). In addition to being inexpensive, Botes said, the filter is also easy to distribute to rural area and simple to use as it can be place in an adapter that fits on nearly any regular-sized plastic bottle. Each filter can clean one liter (one quart) of the most polluted water to the point where it is completely safe to drink. Once used, the filter can be disposed of and is biodegradable. African countries, led by Somalia, Mauritania and Sudan, were ranked to have the most vulnerable water supplies, according to a June report by UK-based risk consultancy firm Maplecroft. Decentralized use The filter's small size and light weight make it ideal for rural areas where other means of filtration do not exist, Cloete said. \"It is simply impossible to build purification infrastructure at every polluted stream,\" Cloete said. \"So we have to take the solution to the people. The water is cleaned right then and there when you drink from the bottle.\" The filter is now undergoing testing by the South African Bureau of Standards, after which Cloete and his team hope it can be rolled out to the United Nations and non-governmental organizations that have expressed interest in it by the end of the year. The project grew out of research into larger filters, according to Cloete. \"We were busy developing filters for larger applications, but when you do the tests in the labatory you do the tests on a much smaller scale,\" he said. \"The results we were getting on a smaller amount of water promoted me to think about a smaller application.\" Author: Joerg Poppendieck, Sean Sinico Editor: Anke Rasper",
        "generated_story": "A Teabag-sized water filter for decentralized drinking in Africa is being tested in South Africa. The device is designed to be used to filter water from the water supply of the country's rivers and streams. It is intended to reduce the number of people who drink water in the region. According to the Water Institute of Stellenbosch, the device has a capacity of 1.5 million gallons per day, equivalent to about 10,000 liters of water a day. This is the first step in a project to test the technology, which is currently being developed by Maplecroft, a risk consultancy firm based in Johannesburg, in partnership with the South African Bureau of Standards (BBS) and the United Nations (UN). The project is expected to cost around $1 million (around $2,500) a year, according to a report published by Deutsche Welle. \"The project will be funded by the U.N.'s Sustainable Development Fund (SDF), which has been working on the project for several years,\" the report said, adding that it would be a \"significant step forward\" in terms of reducing the amount of waste that can be discharged into the environment. In addition, it will also be able to monitor water quality and ensure it is safe for people to drink, as well as for those who do not have access to clean drinking water, such as the US, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Japan, Australia, and other countries. Marelize Botes, who heads the research center at the university, said that the system was designed specifically for the purpose of decentralizing water supplies. She said it was \"a very important step for us to take to ensure that we have a clean, safe and clean water system.\" \"It's a very good way to make sure that people are aware of what is going on in their lives,\" she said. A water-filter is also being used in some countries, including Somalia, Mauritania, Sudan, Somalia and Mali, where water is used for drinking and irrigation. But it's not the only water source that needs water. There are also a lot of countries that have been using water for a long time, like the UK, that are using it as a source of energy for their own people,\" said the study's co-author, Joerg Poppendieck. He added that there is a need for more efficient and efficient water treatment systems in countries like Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda. At the moment, there are only a few countries with water purification systems, he added, but that is not enough for all of them. For example, Ethiopia and Somalia are the two most populous countries in southern Africa, with a total population of 2.4 million people. That is, if you are not already drinking from a tap, you have to have water filters. And that means that you can't use the tap in your house. You can only use it in one place. So, for now, we're going to try to get water out of your home. I'm not sure how much water you'll need to use in order to do that. However, I think that's the most important thing right now.

        "target": "For drivers in Germany, 2010 was the most expensive year ever Owning and operating a car in Germany has never been cheap, but it's never been more expensive than in 2010. German auto club ADAC says costs associated with owning a car have risen more than 40 percent since 1995. In 2010, German car owners had to pay a high price for their mobility, according to ADAC, which cited record-high fuel prices as the major cost factor. \"For drivers, 2010 will go down in history as the most costly year ever,\" ADAC said in a statement. High taxes The cost of acquiring and operating a car has risen 42 percent since 1995, compared to a 24 percent increase in the general cost of living. Due to tax increases and higher production costs, fuel prices soared 86 percent over the 15-year period. In 2010 alone, the average price for a liter of super gasoline was more than 1.40 euros ($1.84) - the highest the average price ever. According to ADAC, urban singles spent an average of 3,340 euros on their cars in 2000. Five years later, that figure had jumped to 3,900 euros. By the end of 2010, their expenses reached 4,380 euros, or 1,000 euros more than a decade earlier. Driving is also pricey for four-person families with two cars. According to the automobile club, their annual costs have risen 30 percent over the past 10 years from 5,940 euros to 7,740 euros. Taxes account for the lion's share of gasoline and diesel prices. The German government's mineral oil and value added taxes account for nearly 88 cents of the 1.35-euro price of a liter of fuel. Low toll revenue While the German government reaps more revenue year for year from vehicle-related taxes, income generated by its highway toll for trucks is expected to fall this year for the first time since the haulage charges were introduced in 2005. The government predicts this year's toll revenues will amount to 4.2 billion euros, down from 4.3 billion euros in 2009. Author: John Blau Editor: Sam Edmonds",
        "generated_story": "The Most Costly Year in History For German Auto Clubs In 2010, the most costly year for German auto clubs was 2010. The most expensive year in the history of German car clubs (ADAC) was 2009. In 2009, ADAC's annual budget was $4.3 billion, according to a study by the University of Applied Sciences (UAMS) in Germany. This is the first year that the average German club has spent more than 1.5 billion euros ($1.85 billion) on its membership since the beginning of the year, in 1995. That's a record for an auto club, but it's only the second time in history that it has been this costliest year. It's not even close to the record set in 2000, when the club was founded by a German businessman, John Blau. But it is more expensive than it was in 2005, which was also the last year of its existence. Since then, however, German clubs have been able to keep up with the cost of their membership, and the costs of membership have gone down significantly. For example, from the start of 2009 to 2008, there was an increase of 3,740 euros in membership fees, compared to 2005. And then there's the fact that in 2009 there were a total of 4.2 billion Euros spent on membership. \"That's quite a lot of money for a car club,\" said Edmonds, who is also a member of UAMS. He added that \"the average age of a club is about 40 years old.\" \"It's an incredible number,\" he said, adding that he had never seen such a large number of club members in his life. However, he added, \"There's no reason to think that this is going to be the case in 2010.\" He said he was surprised by how much money was spent, saying he didn't know how many clubs had to pay for membership in order to have a good membership rate. According to his own research, only one club had an average membership of 2.4 million people, a figure that is only slightly higher than the previous year's average of 1,920,000. Other clubs, such as the BMW and Mercedes-Benz, had a higher membership fee in 2008 than in 2007. They also had more memberships than any other club in Europe in that time period, with a membership that was around 3.7 percent higher. These were the only clubs that did not have an active membership at the time of his death. There were also some smaller clubs in other parts of Germany, like the Bavarian state of Bavaria, that were not as well-known for their low membership rates. Some of these clubs were even more successful than others, though, because they had fewer members than other clubs. Many of them had smaller membership levels, so they were more likely to stay in their own homes. Others had lower membership numbers, too. Even the largest clubs with large numbers of members were still struggling to find members. Most of those who did attend the annual meeting were smaller, smaller ones with smaller budgets. Those who attended the event were less successful. Only a handful of clubs managed to get a seat on the assembly line, for example. More than a quarter of all the participants were women. A few were younger than men, of course. One was a young woman who had just graduated from high school. Another was from a small school in Munich."
