        "target": "Myanmar Junta Announces Amnesty The junta in Myanmar, also known as Burma, announced an amnesty for more than 7,000 prisoners on Friday, including a few political detainees. The amnesty came on the 21st anniversary of the brutal crackdown of a student-led pro-democracy movement in 1988 and the subsequent seizure of power by the current junta. Journalists were invited to Yangon\u2019s notorious Insein prison on Friday as the authorities released the first batch of prisoners. At least 600 inmates were freed as part of an amnesty for over 7,000 inmates nationwide. Among those released in Yangon were two journalists and 25 political prisoners -- rights groups say this is only 1 percent of the total number of political prisoners held by the military regime. Maung Zarni, a research fellow at the London School of Economics, was \u201chappy for the prisoners who were part of the release\u201d. \u201cThis is a very positive personal development and I am happy they have been released but we need to understand that the junta is using the prisoners\u2019 release as a public relations exercise. It is the 21st anniversary of the military coup so they are using this as a way to pacify political discontent in the country.\u201d Amnesty comes ahead of next year\u2019s polls Myanmar's director general of prisons, Zaw Win, said that the prisoners had been freed so they could take part in next year's polls. In recent months, rights activists, pro-democracy activists and Western countries have cast doubt on the credibility of the planned elections as many key political activists are still in detention. This includes pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who recently began a new 18-month period of house arrest after being found guilty of violating her house arrest order in a widely condemned trial. \u201cThe whole Suu kyi trial is rather unlawful,\u201d said Zarni. \u201cBecause the country does not have an independent judiciary, the judges are just puppets who dance to the tune of the top leadership.\u201d Junta is holding on tightly In 1990, Suu Kyi\u2019s National League for Democracy won Myanmar\u2019s last general election by a landslide. But the junta never recognised the results and has since tightened its control over the country. The 2008 constitution, which was drafted and approved by the military generals, which guarantees the army 25 percent of parliamentary seats, is yet another sign of its desire to consolidate power. \u201cThe military is going to be in power for a long time,\u201d warns Zarni, \u201cbecause they have got control of all the political and economic institutions in the country as well as the entire state of Burma. So with or without elections, this is likely to remain the same.\u201d New Democratic Party formed Meanwhile, a new political party has been formed in Myanmar. The Democratic Party is headed by Mya Than Than Nu, who is the daughter of the country\u2019s first democratically-elected prime minister, U Nu. The party has proposed a power-sharing deal with the military, which would give 40 percent of power to politicians and 60 percent to the military rulers. Harn Yawnghwe, the director of the Brussels-based Euro-Burma Office, doubts the new party stands a chance: \u201cIt is possible that they they would be able to get some votes. But it is not likely, even if they were able to contest the elections freely, that they will be able to form a new government because the military is not prepared to let any party rule.\u201d Democrats should exploit elections He thinks the only way out for the democratic forces in Myanmar is to use the upcoming elections wisely and \u201cto take part in them even if they are against them. I think we have to look at the elections as a process which will lead to democracy -- maybe in few more years.\u201d The National League for Democracy has indicated that it will not take part in the polls unless all Myanmar\u2019s political prisoners, including Suu Kyi, are released. Suu Kyi\u2019s lawyers have filed an appeal against the extension of her house arrest and the court is expected to give a ruling on October 2. But few are hopeful that the junta will amnesty her anytime soon. Author: Disha Uppal Editor: Anne Thomas",

The New Democratic Party of Myanmar (NDP) has detained thousands more political detainees in Myanmar, according to Amnesty International. Many of them have been sentenced to life in prison for crimes against humanity, including murder, rape, torture and attempted murder. Some of the detainees were released from prison on Friday, but others were sent back to their homes, where they were tortured and tortured for years. Insein Zarni, a researcher at the London School of Economics, said the new government had also jailed hundreds of people for political crimes. \"This is not the first time that this has happened,\" he said, adding that it was \"a very sad day for the people of Burma\u201d and that they had to face the consequences of their actions. Amnesty also said it had detained more than 1,000 people, most of whom had been convicted of crimes related to human rights violations. It added that the number of detainees had risen to around 2,500, with the most serious cases being those committed in 1988, 1989, 1990, and 2008, when the military took power in a military coup. Since then, however, the government has been unable to release many of its prisoners, leaving them in jail for life without the right to appeal to the courts. This is the second time in three years that Myanmar has seen the death of a political prisoner. Last year, it took the National League for Democracy (NAD) to win the Nobel Peace Prize, which was awarded to a former military general, Harn Yawnghwe, who was convicted in 1990 of genocide and other crimes committed by the NLD. He is now serving a five-year prison sentence in Yangon and is due to be released on October 2. His release comes after a court ordered him to pay a fine of $1,200 ($2,300) for failing to provide a fair trial to his wife and two children. A recent court order also ordered the release of two other men who were convicted for their involvement in an armed coup in 1989. Zaw Win, an Amnesty researcher, told the BBC that he was not aware of any new jail conditions in his home state of Naypyidaw. However, he did know that a trial would be held on the charges against him and his family, as well as the family of one of his victims, in order to prevent him from returning to prison. According to rights groups such as Amnesty, there is a lack of justice for those who have died in detention. There is no way to know for sure what will happen if the trial is held in court. But the ruling is likely to lead to an appeal for a new trial. If the case is successful, then it will be the last time Myanmar will have the chance to return to democracy. I hope the court will rule on whether or not there should be a change of government. Mya Than Than Nu, Amnesty's director of research and policy, is also a member of Amnesty. She said she had no idea what was going on in her country and she would have to make a decision based on her experience as a prisoner of war in Burma. That is, she added, \"I don't think there's a lot that I can do to change the situation in my country.\" The ruling party, led by former Prime Minister Aung Sang Sun, has long been accused of being soft on democracy, saying it is too lenient toward the rights of prisoners. They say it has a long history of violence against the civilian population that has led to many people being jailed, especially women and minorities. And they say the current government is trying to undermine democracy and the rule of law. As a result, they fear that more and more people will come to power. So, I think it's time for Myanmar to take a step back and recognize that democracy is still a very important issue for democracy in this country. Author: Anne Thomas, Reuters/Ibrahim Noroi/AFP/Getty Images, AP, dpa/dpa (Reuters, AFP/Reuters)I am a lawyer and I am an advocate of democracy for people who are imprisoned, so I have no doubt that there are many who would like to see democracy restored to Myanmar. At the same time, my colleagues at Amnesty are also working on a resolution to end the violence that is taking place there. We are working to find a way out of this situation. What do you think is going to happen next? I would hope that we can get a better understanding of what is happening in our country, because I believe that people are still suffering from the atrocities that have taken place during the past few decades. One thing is for certain: The government will not be able to do something about it. For the time being, we will continue to work on this issue. On the other hand, this is an important step forward for me. Let's talk about what has to get to"

        "target": "US duo shares Nobel Prize for Economics US researcher Elinor Ostrom is the first woman to win the Nobel prize for economics since it was created in 1968. She will share the prestigious award with US compatriot Oliver Williamson. The jury from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said the Americans' research had shown how \"economic analysis can shed light on most forms of social organization.\" Ostrom, a professor at Indiana University, was honored for her \"analysis of economic governance,\" especially in relation to the management of common property or property under common control. The political scientist's work challenges the widely accepted belief that common property is poorly managed and should be either regulated by central authorities or privatized, it added. She carried out numerous studies showing how self-organization and local-level management work to keep common resources viable. Her studies included both natural resources, such as forests, and artificial structures, for example police forces. Ostrom told Swedish television that she felt \"great surprise and appreciation\" and was \"in shock\" about being the first woman to win the prize. The pros and cons of big firms In his work, co-prizewinner Oliver Williamson, of University of California, Berkeley, examines why large corporations tend to arise - and why they do not - based on the cost and complexity of transactions, according to the Nobel committee. \"He has taught us to regard markets, firms, associations, agencies, and even households from the perspective of their contribution to the resolution of conflict,\" the jury said. Williamson authored 'The Economic Institutions of Capitalism' in 1975, a landmark text of the 'new institutional economics' movement that questioned the idea of firms as simple profit-making machines. Last but not least The Nobel prize for economics is the only Nobel award that was not created by the will of Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel in 1896. It was actually founded by the Swedish central bank, the Sverige Riksbank, to celebrate its tri-centenary a year earlier. It was awarded for the first time in 1969 under its official name: the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel. But although it was the last \"Nobel prize\" to be created and the last to be announced each year, the prize is not a poor relation in monetary terms. Winners of the awards for peace, literature, medicine, physiology, chemistry and physics all receive 10 million Swedish crowns (969,000 euros). A good year for women This year was a record year for women laureates. German-Romanian writer Herta Mueller won the Nobel Prize for Literature. Australian-American Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider of the United States were awarded the prize for medicine. And Ada Yonath of Israel was one of three scientists recognized for her work in chemistry. Americans more or less swept the board this year. Nine of the 11 laureates were US citizens. The most prominent of those was US President Barack Obama, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for his \"extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples.\" jg/AFP/dpa/Reuters Editor: Sam Edmonds",
        "generated_story": "The first woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize for economics has won the prize for the first time. Author: Elinor Ostrom Oliver Williamson is one of the few women who has ever been awarded the prestigious prize. The Swedish Academy of Sciences in the United States, the Sverige Riksbank, and the University of California, Berkeley have announced the winner of this year's prize, which will be awarded to a woman who was born in 1896 and died in 1967. She is the only woman ever to receive the award. \"It's a great honor to be able to share the laureates with the people of Sweden,\" she said in an interview with Reuters. 'I'm so honored to have won this prestigious award.' The prize is awarded annually to the best economist in Sweden. It was first awarded in 1968 to Alfred Nobel and his wife, Ada Yonath, who were both born and raised in Stockholm. Since then, it has been given to women from all over the world, including the US, Canada, Australia, Israel, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Japan and Israel. In the past, women had won several prizes for their work in economics, but the most recent was in 1975, when the Swedish academy of economics announced that it would be giving out 10 million Swedish crowns (10 million euros) in a bid to help fund the university's research and development of a new research center. This year, however, there was only one winner: the Australian-American Nobel Prize in Economics, won in 1970. That was the last year that women were given the opportunity to compete for a Nobel prize in literature. They were awarded a cash prize of 969,000 euros ($1.5 million) each year in memory of Nobel laureate and Nobel peace prize laureate, Nobel Laureate, Adrienne Yaxley. Both women won their first Nobel prizes in 1972 and 1976, respectively, in recognition of their contributions to science and technology. But the second year was a different story. Women have been the main winners since the end of World War I. Many of them have gone on to become world leaders in their fields of study and business, while men and women of all political persuasions have also been winners of other prestigious prizes, such as the Economic Institutions of Capitalism (EITC). The first women to take home the top prize was Olaf Nobel in 1976. He was also a professor at Indiana University, where he taught economics and economics. And he was an economist from the time of his death in 1894. Now, he is an emeritus professor of political science, a position he has held since his retirement from politics. His wife is a political scientist at IU University in Bloomington, Indiana. Her husband, Sam Edmonds, is also an economics professor and professor emerita at the IU alumnus' alma mater. When he retired from university, she took up the position of vice chancellor of business in his capacity as a research professor. After the death of her husband in 1973, Oliver William Williamson became the youngest Swedish Nobel winner in history. William Williamson won his second Nobel for Economics in 1974, his first since he won it in 1964. Bill Clinton and Barack Obama were the other two Nobel winners, both of whom were American citizens. Williamson's father, Carl Nobel, was Nobel's first vice-chairman from 1896 to 1975. John Wieseltier, also of IU's economics department, told Reuters that WilliamWilliamson's achievement was \"a great achievement for me.\" \"I think I'm very proud of my wife,\" he said, adding that \"we have a lot to learn from her. I think it's an incredible achievement that she's done so many things to make a difference in my life.\" The award is given out to those who have worked hard to improve the quality of life in this country, particularly in politics and in business. Nobel-prize winners are given a lifetime achievement award in order to give them a chance to develop their own ideas and to create a better future for themselves and their families. However, this is not the case for all of us. There are a number of reasons for this. For one thing, they are very important to me. One is that the idea of equality is something that is so central to our society. If you want to know more about it, you have to read the history of human rights in America. Read more: Why women don't get a job at a university. Why do women get paid more than men? Because they're the ones who are paid less than the men who work for them? Why is it so important that they have the right to do that? Well, that's what I've always wanted to tell the story of women's lives. You can't be too hard on women, because they've had a very difficult time getting a career as economists. What is more important is to understand the power of economic theory.

        "target": "'One in three' unaware they are HIV-positive The number of people living with HIV/AIDS in the European Union and neighboring countries has increased by nearly a third, with one in three unaware they have the virus, the EU Commission warned Monday. In a document on combating AIDS, the Commission said that as of 2007, around 2.2 million people carried the virus in the EU and nearby countries, an increase of 700,000 from 2001. According to Commission figures, around 730,000 of these live within the EU's 27 member states. France, Italy, Spain and Portugal have relatively high infection rates - ranging from 0.4 percent to 0.5 percent. In the Baltic country of Estonia, the infection rate stands at around 1.3 percent. In neighboring Ukraine, around 1.6 percent of the population has been diagnosed with HIV, while in Russia around 1.1 percent are HIV positive. The Commission warned that now was not the time for Europe to drop its guard on preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS, adding that in some neighboring countries the number of people carrying the virus had doubled. EU Health Commissioner Androulla Vassiliou said political momentum in the fight against HIV/AIDS needed to be maintained, adding that people must \"take responsibility for themselves and their partners by talking about and practicing safe sex and going for HIV testing.\" A cure for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has yet to be found more than a quarter century after it was brought to public attention. However, efficient treatments exist to slow the evolution of the virus. dfm/AFP Editor: Chuck Penfold",
        "generated_story": "One in three people living with HIV/AIDS in the EU are unaware they are HIV-positive The European Union's health commissioner has warned that one in four people who live with AIDS in Europe and neighboring countries have been unaware of their status. According to a new study, one out of three of the 28 EU countries surveyed by the European Commission (EU) have HIV or AIDS. The study found that two-thirds of those surveyed were unaware that they had HIV, and that the number of people with the disease rose to three-quarters in 2001, compared to one-third in 2004. \"The number is growing rapidly,\" said Androulla Vassiliou, the commission's director general for health and social policy, in an interview with AFP on Monday. He said: \"It's not just that we don't know who is HIV positive. It's also that people are not aware they have AIDS,\" he said, referring to the fact that HIV is a disease that can be transmitted through the blood of a person who has been infected with it. In addition, a third of all HIV cases are reported to be linked to AIDS, which is the most common cause of death in European countries, according to data from the Commission. This is not the first time that this has happened, but it is only the second time it's happened. A study published last year by researchers at the University of Oxford in England showed that a quarter of HIV patients living in countries with high HIV levels had been exposed to HIV by their partner countries. But the study did not find any link between HIV status and the spread of AIDS among people in other EU member states. Instead, it shows that many of these people live in areas where the virus is present, such as Spain, Portugal, Italy, France, Spain and Spain. And in some cases, even the poorest countries of Europe have not been able to identify the person with whom they live because they do not have access to medical care. For example, Germany and France are the only two countries that have the highest rates of infection among HIV and AIDS patients, while Italy has the lowest rate of infections. France and Italy are also the least affected, with a total of 1 in 3 of them having HIV in their own country. Italy is one of only a handful of countries to have tested positive for HIV. Spain is also among the few countries in which the test was carried out, as well as the United States, Britain and Germany. Europe's most populous country, Poland, has also been testing the drug against HIV for several years. However, there is no evidence that it was used in any way as a weapon of war against the HIV virus. European health officials have said it could be used to prevent HIV from spreading to other people. They have also said that there are no plans to introduce a vaccine to combat the infection. EU health ministers, however, have expressed concern about the risk of spreading HIV to others, saying they would not allow it to spread to people without proper medical treatment if they were infected. That is, they say, because it would be difficult for them to get tested in a laboratory setting. There are several other countries where HIV tests are being conducted, including the Netherlands, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. These tests can only be done if the patient has a positive HIV test and has no other test results. So, this is something that should be taken into account when testing is done, says the head of European Health and Social Affairs Commissioner, Chuck Penfold, who oversees the health of EU citizens and their families. Germany has said the tests will be conducted in order to assess the risks to their health. Meanwhile, Russia and Ukraine have already started testing positive samples of suspected HIV infections, he added, adding that \"it's a very important step for the public to know whether they're infected.\" The test is to determine whether the samples are positive or not. If the testing results are negative, EU officials say they will have to wait a year for a test to confirm the results of tests, before they can make a final decision on whether to approve them. Experts say it will take at least two years to see if HIV testing can detect the presence of an HIV infection in all cases. Russia, Ukraine and Portugal are among those who are infected, is another country that has not yet been tested. Poland has already reported that its own testing program has failed to detect a virus in its territory. Portugal and Estonia have both reported positive results from tests conducted on the same test. Ukraine has yet to test positive and is currently testing negative for hepatitis A, an infection that could lead to an increase in HIV diagnoses. Both countries are currently waiting for approval from a European commission to carry out tests on their citizens. Despite the lack of testing, Europe is expected to continue to monitor the status of new cases and to make sure that all of its citizens are tested for any new infections and whether it has an impact on future cases in future. Many countries will also be tested to find out if it can assess whether or whether their HIV"

The spokesman said more help was needed, but could not give exact numbers \"due to pending assignments.\" Recent soccer violence raises concern Swiss media has been questioning the security preparations for Euro 2008 after a spate of violence at recent games. In the latest incident, seats were ripped out and a goal post wrenched from the ground after St. Gallen faced the prospect of relegation following a 2-0 defeat to Bellinzona on May 20. St. Gallen was the third incident in a month that saw violent clashes with police who twice resorted to rubber bullets and tear gas. While Switzerland is seen as a low risk country in terms of hooliganism, violence has been on the increase in recent years and estimates claim there are around 400 hooligans and 600 sympathizers. Swiss Sports Minister Samuel Schmid said that hooliganism cannot be ruled out, reported German news agency DPA. But he expressed his belief that extra measures such as more policing, restrictions on alcohol -- which he has called \"a catalyst for violence\" -- and video surveillance will help keep trouble at bay. Private firms to boost European police The private security companies will be responsible for patrolling the stadiums and their surroundings, as well as the public viewing areas, team hotels and trainings areas. An international police force will manage the rest. Switzerland has committed some 31,200 police officers and soldiers.

The firm, Securitas, has been working closely with German security authorities to prepare for the tournament in Bellinzona, the Swiss capital, for a month, according to Urs Stadler, head of security at Tages Anzeiger, a security firm based in Switzerland. \"We have a lot of expertise in this area, and we are going to be able to provide the best security for our guests,\" Urs said in a statement, adding that the firm would be working in conjunction with a number of private security firms, such as Prisec, in order to make sure that security is in place before and after the games. According to the DPA, \"the firm will be in contact with all security agencies, including the Federal Security Agency (FSA) and the European Union (EU) to ensure that we have adequate security.\" The company, which was founded in 2002, is working with Germany's defense ministry to protect the country's security. It is the first of its kind in Europe to do so. In the past two years, it has worked with France, Spain, Greece, Italy, Poland and Spain to build up a strong security presence in their respective countries. Last year, however, Germany was unable to secure its borders due to a series of terrorist attacks. Since then, security experts have been trying to find a way to prevent the spread of false information about the attacks, but so far, no one has come up with an effective solution. Instead, they are relying on the private firms of companies that have already been involved in security operations in other countries, like Germany, France and Poland. They have also been helping to train and train police and other security personnel, as well as provide training and equipment for police officers and military personnel. These firms have worked closely together to develop a system of checks and controls that can be used to assess the threat posed by a terrorist attack. For example, last year's attack on a police station in Berlin killed three people and injured dozens of others in an attempt to break up an anti-terror operation. This time, though, there were no reports of any attacks on police or soldiers. However, some of these attacks were carried out by the police, who had been monitoring the situation closely and were not allowed to enter the building at the time the attack took place. As a result, police have not been allowed access to any of their vehicles, even though they have searched the premises. That's not to say that they don't have the necessary equipment to carry out their own security checks. But it is not the case that there is a lack of adequate equipment. There is no need to worry about security in any other country. And there's no reason to think that this is an issue that will not be addressed at this time of year. At the very least, that's the most important part of this tournament, because it's a very important event for all of us. We have to get ready for it. So, let's get on with our preparations. Let's talk about what we're doing. I think we've got a good idea of what's going on in our country and where we want to go from here. If we can do that, we'll be ready to take a step forward in terms of our security plans. You know what I'm talking about, right? We've already done that in Germany and in France. Now we just need a little bit more time to work on our own. What do you think about that? What are you planning for next year? I'd like to hear from you?

Negotiations over the status of the two rebel regions, which have enjoyed de facto autonomy since the end of a civil war in 1994, was reserved for the final phase of negotiations. Tkeshelashvili said, \"The plan has great potential for success,\" but added that the most difficult thing would be to convince Russia. Peace talks remain distant The threat of armed conflict in the region last month has given urgency to international pressure for renewed peace talks, but Tbilisi, Moscow and the Russian-backed regions remain far apart on the basic premises for restarting peace talks. Officials in Tbilisi oppose a treaty on the non-use of force without guarantees on the return of refugees and the withdrawal of Russian peacekeeping forces base in the region. Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was skeptical of peace efforts Thursday. \"Signing of a treaty on the return of Georgian refugees to Abkhazia is unreal now, because such a return requires a calm situation,\" Lavrov was quoted as saying by news agency RIA-Novosti. \"We think that signing a treaty on the non-use of force without any preconditions is an absolutely unavoidable first step,\" he added. Experts see little hope for Steinmeier's plan Analysts do not expect anything conclusive from Steinmeier's trip, pointing to intransigence on the part of the Abkhaz President Sergei Bagapsh, who said he would \"not consider the plan.\" \"We are not going to discuss Abkhazia's status with anyone. We are building an independent, democratic state,\" Bagapsh was quoted by Georgian news agencies as saying. Speaking to journalists ahead of the meetings Thursday, Steinmeier admitted: \"We don't have any illusions about simple answers, but we cannot stand by without acting on this conflict. That would be irresponsible.\" From Tbilisi, the German minister is to travel to the Black Sea city of Batumi for talks with Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili and then to Abkhazia on Friday before ending his three-day tour in Moscow. Most citizens of the breakaway republics have been issued Russian passports and over 2,500 Russian peacekeeping troops patrol the region under a UN ceasefire agreement. In opposition to Georgia's bid to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Russia moved to strengthen diplomatic ties with the breakaway regions sharply aggravating tensions with the Georgian leadership in recent months.",
        "generated_story": "A New Peace Plan for the Separatist Regions of Tbilisi and Abkhazia Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Bagapsh has announced a new peace plan for South Ossetia in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) region of Georgia. According to the UN's General Assembly, the new plan would be based on a \"new peace agreement\" between the two regions, which was signed in 1994. It would also include the creation of a permanent peace zone between Russia and the former Soviet republics. The new deal would see the return of the Soviet Union to its former Cold War-era status, with the goal of creating a stable, stable and stable future for both regions. However, it would not be the first time that Russia has tried to influence the region's future. In the 1990s, Russian President Mikhail Saakashvili and Georgian President Vladimir Putin had a long-running dispute over the territorial integrity of their former territories. \"We are not going to allow this to happen again,\" said Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov on Thursday, adding that he was \"very disappointed\" by the lack of progress on the peace front. He added that \"we are still trying to find a way out of this conflict.\" \"I am very disappointed that we have not been able to reach an agreement,\" he said, referring to a 1994 peace treaty between Georgia and Russia signed by then-Soviet President Ilham Aliyev and his wife, Eka, and their two sons, Sergei and Mikhail, who are now living in exile in Moscow. 'We have to work together to make sure that the future of our country is a peaceful one,' he added. Russia's Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Friday that it was working with Georgia's government to come up with a plan to end the conflict. But it did not specify a specific date, nor did it specify the date of when the talks would take place, but it is clear that they will be held at the same time as the negotiations. Tensions between Moscow and Georgia have been building since 1994, when Russia annexed the territory from the Georgian People's Republic in an attempt to create an independent state. Moscow, however, has repeatedly denied any involvement in any negotiations, saying it had no intention of doing so. On Friday, Moscow said it planned to hold talks with Georgians in order to discuss the possibility of an end to hostilities. Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said he hoped to see a deal in place by Friday. Meanwhile, Russia, in its bid to win back the country's independence from Georgia, is also expected to push ahead with its own peace plans, according to Moscow's spokesman Dmitry Peskov. Putin has said that his country will continue to cooperate closely with Russia in their efforts to achieve a peace deal. A new \"peace plan\" could be agreed upon by all parties, including the United Nations, as long as it does not involve the use of military force. That is, if Russia is willing to give up its weapons of mass destruction, such as nuclear weapons and chemical weapons. This is not the case with Iran, for example, or with North Korea, where it has been accused of violating the Geneva accords. There is no agreement on how to deal with such a conflict between Iran and Iran. Nor is there any way for Russia to prevent it from becoming a nuclear power. For the most part, this is the only way to resolve the situation in which it can be resolved. At the moment, there are no plans to do so, despite the fact that Moscow has not yet made any concessions to Iran or any other country. And it's not clear whether Russia will agree to any kind of deal, even if it wants to, because it doesn't want to impose sanctions on Iran's nuclear program. (Reuters, AP, RIA-Novosti)Russia's foreign ministry spokesman, Vladimir Zakharov, said Thursday that sanctions against Iran had been imposed on Tehran and other countries in violation of international law.\"We will not allow Iran to use its nuclear arsenal against the Iranian regime. We have no reason to believe that Iran will do anything to interfere in our affairs,\" the spokesman said at a news conference in Tehran. Lavrov said the sanctions were imposed in response to Tehran's request for a cease-fire agreement with Tehran to stop the construction of nuclear facilities. Iran has denied that Tehran is planning to build an atomic bomb on its territory. Tehran has also rejected the idea of building a military base in Iran in defiance of sanctions, accusing Tehran of using its atomic weapons to attack Iran as a weapon of aggression. Iranian officials have also accused Iran of being a terrorist organization and said they are ready to retaliate against Tehran for its actions in Syria and Iraq. They also said Iran is likely to be a target for sanctions if the deal is agreed to take a step toward the end of talks. These are the main targets of Russian aggression, while Moscow is unlikely to accept the terms of any such agreement. I think that's a very important step in this regard. If sanctions."

        "target": "Bayern's Klinsmann Praises, Hoeness Attacks Hoffenheim The Bundesliga's two top teams don't play until Friday, but the mind games are already underway. Bayern's coach Juergen Klinsmann says Hoffenheim are legitimate contenders, but commercial manager Uli Hoeness disagrees. When the Bundesliga scheduled Bayern's home match against Hoffenheim in the league's unloved Friday night slot, they probably didn't imagine that it would turn out to be the match of the first half of the season. Indeed, few experts or fans thought that Hoffenheim, a first-division debutante located in a southern German village with 3,000 inhabitants, would give mighty Munich a run for its money. But it's the first week of December, and Hoffenheim top the table by three points. They also have a much better goal difference than their second-placed rivals -- and that has drawn praise from Bayern's coach, Juergen Klinsmann. \"I have the highest estimation of Hoffenheim because they've built the squad very ambitiously, rationally and with very good players,\" Klinsmann told DPA news agency. \"They can be proud of that.\" Klinsmann said he thought that the club could establish itself among the top three or four sides in Germany in the years to come and qualify for international competition next season. He also had words of praise for Hoffenheim's software billionaire patron, Dietmar Hopp, whose money has funded the club's ascent. \"There's nothing negative about it,\" Klinsmann said. \"He used to play for the club, is a soccer man through and through and helped the team get on its feet.\" Some fans have criticized Hopp and Hoffenheim for paying inflating salaries and luring talent away from other clubs instead of developing homegrown players. In fact, Hoffenheim's official salary budget is about average for the Bundesliga. Hoeness sounds his horn But while Bayern's coach was praising his opponents to the skies, Munich's commercial manager Uli Hoeness has been trying to play with their heads. On the heels of Bayern's convincing win over Leverkusen last weekend, Hoeness is back to taunting rivals. \"The performance we showed in the second half against Leverkusen will be enough against Hoffenheim,\" Hoeness told the German soccer magazine kicker. Hoeness also dropped a none-too-thinly-veiled hint that Hoffenheim's personnel expenditures were far higher than the officially released figures and scoffed at the idea that strategy would determine the outcome of Friday's match. \"Games are decided by the better players, not by tactics,\" Hoeness said. \"And of course, we've got better players than Hoffenheim.\" But that particular verbal attack may represent some wishful thinking of the manager's part. Hoffenheim coach Ralf Rangnick is one of only two current Bundesliga skippers with a winning record against Munich. Rangnick, whose team cruised past Bielefeld last weekend to keep Bayern three points back, reacted to Hoeness' remarks with a shrug. \"We're preparing for Munich exactly the same way we did against Bielefeld,\" Rangnick said. In any case, soccer fans in Germany know what they'll be doing Friday evening -- finding a bar with cable sports television to watch a top match that no one, before the start of the season, would have considered possible.",
        "generated_story": "Hoeness Reacts to First Half of Bundesliga Season Hoffenheim's Commercial Manager has reacted to the first half of the Bundesliga season. Dietmar Hopp said he was \"very happy\" with the second half results. \"I'm very happy with how things are going so far,\" he said on Friday night, adding that he would like to see more success from his team. Leverkusen, who have been struggling in the league for the past few seasons, will be looking forward to a good start to their Bundesliga campaign. The Bundesliga's top-flight club is currently in its first week of December, but it is still a long way off from the end of last season, when they lost to Bayern Munich 2-1 on aggregate. In the meantime, the club will continue to work hard to build on the success it had enjoyed last year, with a number of key players returning from injury and a new coach, Juergen Klinsmann, to take over the reins at the helm of a club that has struggled in recent years. On Friday, however, it was a different story, as the team's new head coach and chief commercial officer, Uli Hoeniss, took to social media to express his delight at having been given the opportunity to lead a team that had struggled for years to reach the Champions League final. He also said that his side would be able to improve on their first-half form, which had seen them win just one of their last three matches. H\u00f6ness said the German side had \"a lot of work to do\" to get back into the top four, and added that they would try to make the most of every opportunity they had. But, he added, \"we are not going to give up on this. We have to focus on what we have already done and how we want to achieve that.\" \"We have a lot to learn from this season and we are very excited about the future,\" said Ralf Rangnick, head of Munich's commercial agency, DPA. 'It's a very exciting time to be a part of this team and I am very pleased to have the chance to show that we can do that. It's been a really good season for us and it's something we've been working on for a while now, so we're very, very proud of it.\" The German club's first ever Bundesliga title was won by Bayern in 2014, a year after the Bavarian champions won the title in Germany's second-tier competition. However, in this year's Bundesliga, Bayern have struggled to find the right balance between success and failure. Last season's title-winning team, Bayer Munich, was the only team to win the championship, while Hoffenerheim were the other side to lose in that division. This season has been different, too. Bayern are the defending champions and they have had a difficult time finding a way to stay ahead of them. They've had to settle for second place and that's not the case this time around. At the same time, they've also had their fair share of problems with their fans, especially in their home town of Bielefeld, where they're struggling to keep up with high-quality opposition. That's why they are struggling so much to score goals. With the loss of one player, there's little room for improvement, even if they do score a few goals, at least in terms of quality. And that is a big reason for that, because they don't have enough players who can score in a Bundesliga game like Bayern. For that reason, this is an important step forward for Bayern, whose players are expected to step up their efforts to become the best team in Europe. As a result, their goalkeepers will have more chances of scoring goals in December than they did in 2016. Bundesliga leaders Bayern and Hoffenglesen have also struggled with injuries and suspensions, though they still have plenty of players to play for, according to Bundesliga officials. Losing a player is not an easy task for them to overcome. After all, Bundesliga teams are always very difficult to beat, particularly when it comes to defending their title. Nevertheless, that doesn't mean they can't win games. If Bayern can get a win, then they'll be in good position to start the new season off the back foot. Bayer has already won two Bundesliga titles in three years, including the last two seasons and three in four Bundesliga seasons. So, what's the next step for Bayer? They'll need to look to strengthen their squad in order to qualify for next season as well as strengthen the squad for their next title challenge in January and February. Despite their struggles, Leverkansen are still in contention for promotion next year. A strong defense is the main reason why Bayern is in danger of missing the playoffs, despite the fact that Bayern has a strong chance of reaching the final round of qualification. German coach Jupp Heyness has said they won't be allowed to continue their unbeaten run in 2017-18. According to German media and the opening the"

The move has been questioned by officials, with some saying it places the EU at-risk of taking sides in an internal dispute. The European Commission's decision to launch the rule of law procedure on Warsaw puts the EU's executive institution at-risk of taking sides, Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Konrad Szymanski told reporters in the European Parliament. \"I have the impression that the [European] Commission risks taking a role as a side in a political dispute inside Poland,\" Szymanski noted. On Wednesday, European Commission Vice President Frans Timmermans - a former Dutch foreign minister - announced the move, marking the first time the EU has used the mechanism. Timmermans said that the move was aimed at entering \"into a dialogue with the Polish authorities, to clarify the facts in an objective way and help find solutions if necessary.\" He added that the procedure is focused on seeking answers regarding the new right-wing Polish government's actions not to apply two judgments by the country's constitutional court, and the reasons behind the president and vice-president's terms were shortened. Preserving rule of law However, Poland's deputy foreign minister said that the European Commission was informed of the reasons behind the government's actions. \"We would insist that the questions are phrased precisely because we have provided much information to the Commission in recent days and we are not entirely clear as to what the Commission is still not clear about,\" Szymanski noted to reporters at the European Parliament. New media laws, giving the government the power to hire and fire senior figures at state broadcasters, were also called into question by Timmermans. The controversial legislation prompted mass pro-democracy protesters in the European country. \"The rule of law is one of the EU's fundamental values. Making sure the rule of law is preserved throughout the Union is a key part of the European Commission's responsibilities,\" Timmermans wrote on his official Facebook page. The Rule of Law Framework was created two years ago as a response to criticism that the 28-nation bloc had not adequately responded to possibly-authoritarian moves taken by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban during his tenure. ls/jil (Reuters, AFP, dpa)",
        "generated_story": "European Commission risks taking sides in political dispute in Poland The European Commission has warned Poland that it will not stand by as it tries to resolve a political crisis in the country. The EU's foreign minister Frans Timmermans warned Wednesday that Poland's political situation was \"unacceptable\" and called for a \"rule of law framework\" to be put in place to protect the interests of the people of Poland. Polish Foreign Minister Konrad Szymanski said on Wednesday the EU should not intervene in a dispute between Poland and the European Parliament. \"We have to take sides,\" he told reporters in Warsaw, adding that he was not aware of any legal precedent for such a move. Poland has been accused of violating the Rule of Law Framework, which was set up by the Polish government two years ago to prevent the spread of communism. In response, Polish Prime Minister Viktor Orban called on the Commission to intervene, saying it would be \"very irresponsible\" for Poland to interfere in its internal affairs. He also said Poland should be given the opportunity to make its own decisions on how to deal with the situation. According to the German Foreign Ministry, Poland is the first country in Europe to implement a rule-of-law framework, while the other countries are the only ones to do so. It is not clear how much Poland will pay for this, but it is clear that there will be a lot of pressure on Poland if it doesn't change its constitution. On Wednesday, however, the commission's chief of staff said it was too early to say whether Poland would agree to a new constitutional framework that would allow it to impose a law on its citizens. However, he added, \"we are not going to let this happen again.\" The Commission's decision comes after a two-year-old legal battle between the two countries over the right to free expression and equal treatment of all citizens, including women and minorities, has raised questions about the role of EU member states in international law. At the same time, it has also been criticized by Poland for failing to recognize the rights of women, minorities and women in their own country, as well as for the lack of respect for women's rights and human rights. This has led to Poland becoming one of Europe's most polarizing countries in recent years, with Poland being the most outspoken and vocal critic of European Union (EU) policies. Last week, a Polish court ruled in favor of a European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruling against Poland, ruling that the court's ruling was a violation of Article 5 of its Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Since then, there have been several attempts to amend the law to allow women to have equal rights under European law, such as equal protection under EU law and freedom of expression. But this has not been the case. Instead, many Polish citizens are being forced to live in fear of their rights being infringed on by their country's government, according to Polish media reports. Some EU officials have accused Poland of being a victim of unfair treatment by European courts. They have also accused the government of using excessive force to try to influence the outcome of legal proceedings. That is, they say, an attempt to undermine the rule of laws. And they have not done so in any way at all. There is no doubt that this is an example of how Poland could have avoided a similar situation in future. For example, if Poland were to become a member of an EU-wide free-trade zone, then it could be that they would not be able to negotiate a free and fair free trade agreement with other European countries. If Poland was to join the bloc, this would make it even more difficult for them to reach an agreement on a fair and just way to achieve their goal of free movement of people, and that could lead to an end to EU membership. So far, that hasn't happened, at least not in this case, so far. As far as I know, no one has done anything to stop Poland from becoming a part of this process. Just ask the prime minister, who is currently in exile in Brussels, to explain why he's not involved in negotiations with his Polish counterpart. What does this mean for him? \"I don't think it's a good idea,\" the foreign ministry said in an interview with dpa news agency, referring to his office.

Greece had previously voiced reservations about the proposal. The proposed mission to be discussed at a NATO defense ministers meeting in Brussels on Thursday comes days after German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutolgu said they would raise the issue of refugees with the Alliance. According to a Reuters report citing a senior German official, initially reticent Greece has now given the green light for the operation, which could see NATO assets deployed in the Aegean in a mostly intelligence and reconnaissance role. Under the proposal, which would need to be approved by Alliance members, NATO maritime assets would provide information to national coastguards and the EU border agency Frontex to combat illegal smugglers using rickety boats to bring migrants to Europe. Turkey would then take back the refugees, as envisioned as part of a 3 billion-euro ($3.2 billion) EU-Turkey deal agreed to last year. According to German sources, the mission would not be similar to the NATO mission in the Mediterranean intercepting migrant boats making the dangerous run from Libya to Italy. However, NATO ships could intervene in emergency situations to save passengers. \"It is not NATO's remit to push back or stop refugee boats,\" the official told Reuters. The mission would use assets from the Alliance's standing naval group, a permanent reaction force deployed in the Mediterranean. The naval group's current flagship is the German combat support ship \"Bonn.\" Denmark has already said it would provide additional ships to the mission, according to the official. However, it is unclear whether NATO members will approve the mission which may fall outside the bounds of the Alliance's mandate. Complicating matters is a long-running maritime dispute between Greece and Turkey over sovereignty in the Aegean, where the two NATO members' jets regularly engage in dogfights. Turkey has taken in more than 2.5 million Syrian refugees, and is a major transit point for migrants from Asia and Africa. More than a million migrants and refugees reached Europe last year, many making the dangerous boat journey from Turkey to Greece by boat. So far this year, more than 340 have perished in the cold waters trying to reach Europe. cw/msh (AFP, dpa, Reuters)",

The deployment comes after Germany's Frontex, the European Union's maritime border agency, said it would deploy troops on Thursday to tackle illegal migrant boats. \"We are going to be there for a long time,\" it said in a statement, adding that the deployment was part of a broader effort by the alliance to counter illegal migration. Germany, Denmark, France, Italy, Spain and Denmark have also deployed troops, with the aim of stopping migrants from entering Europe from Libya, Greece and Italy. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she was \"very pleased\" with Turkey's deployment, saying it was a \"positive step forward\" for the EU. But she also warned that \"it is not the end of the world for smugglers\" and that it will take time to find a way to get migrants out of Europe. Merkel also said that she hoped to see more migrants in Europe, particularly those from Africa and Asia, as well as the Middle East and Africa, who are increasingly being targeted by smugglers and traffickers. She also called on EU member states to cooperate more closely with NATO in their efforts to prevent the flow of migrants and refugees into Europe and to ensure the safety of EU citizens and their families. NATO is also looking to strengthen its alliance with China and Russia, which has been battling smugglers for years. Last year, Germany and France signed a three-year deal to expand their alliance, while Italy signed an agreement on a 3-billion euro deal with Greece. In return, EU leaders agreed to work together to reduce the number of refugees and migrants who enter Europe illegally. However, they also agreed not to allow migrants to enter the bloc without a visa, and they said they would not be able to travel to Europe if they did not have an visa. According to German Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutolgu, this would be the first time that Europe would have a member state with an EU membership. For now, however, it is up to Turkey to decide whether it wants to join the NATO-led alliance or not. On Thursday, Turkey announced it had agreed on the terms of an alliance agreement with Germany. It said the deal would allow the two countries to \"work together as a group.\" The agreement was signed in Bonn, a German city near the Turkish-German border, on Wednesday and Thursday. Berlin has also announced plans to deploy more troops and ships to help the Greek coast guard, but it has yet to make a final decision on how to do so, according to a report by German news agency dpa. This is the latest step in NATO's effort to protect its citizens from the threat posed by migrants, especially those who have fled their home countries in recent years, such as Greece, Libya and Libya. EU officials say the move is aimed at reducing the risk of migrant arrivals from Europe to Asia. They say it's a step toward a more open and stable future for migrants seeking asylum in European countries, where they can seek refuge in other countries. Turkey is one of several countries that has signed agreements with EU nations to provide asylum to migrants fleeing war-torn Syria and Iraq. European officials have said this is a first step towards an end to an influx of asylum-seekers from countries like Syria, Iraq, Iran and Afghanistan. Ankara has already announced its intention to build a border wall along its southern border with Libya in order to keep migrants off the island of Cyprus. Meanwhile, Berlin is preparing to send a delegation to Brussels to discuss the situation with European leaders, including German Prime Minister Sigmar Gabriel and French President Emmanuel Macron, in an attempt to ease tensions between Ankara and Brussels. Italy and Germany have already expressed concern about the possibility of Turkey joining NATO allies in its bid to secure the region's borders. Greece is currently the largest EU partner in this year's NATO alliance and is expected to host a summit in Brussels next year. Europe's EU partners are also preparing for another round of talks with Ankara next week, when the summit is scheduled to take place in Berlin. Brussels is due to convene on Friday, May 19.

Francis won't be able to meet them, says DW's Astrid Prange. Dead prisoners, disappearing students, refugees shot dead and murdered priests. Mexico has lived through one violent episode after the other. The mood in the nation is explosive. And now this: just a day before the pope is set to arrive, more than 50 people died in the largest prison revolt in the country's history. What meaning does the pope's presence hold on such an occasion? Only one thing is certain: Francis won't be able to resolve the problems of the world's second largest Catholic nation in just a five-day trip. The unrealistic demands placed on him are not something he can fill. Yet the pope carries with him an important message: you don't have to love your enemies but you do need to speak with them. And he's living the example himself by meeting with the Russian Orthodox Patriarch Kirill on a stopover in Cuba on his way to Mexico. Cuba all over again It's sensational! Bannings and mutual ex-communications are ancient history. Nearly a millennium after the split, the head of the Roman Catholic Church and the head of the Russian Orthodox Church are speaking to each other. It's not as if the two will become friends - their positions are far too different. Yet their centuries-old enmity feels out of place and in view of the massive worldwide persecution of Christians, almost unchristian. And both of these church leaders know this. In Mexico, efforts to stem the polarizing forces at play in society have not been successful. The extreme differences between rich and poor are dividing Mexican society. President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto has prioritized economic growth over dialogue with his critics - a group which includes students as well as teachers and union members who regularly protest against government policies. They demand an end to lawlessness and corruption. The presumed murder of 43 teaching students in Iguala in September 2014, a crime which remains unsolved, stands as a symbol of the lawlessness sweeping Mexico. The recent mutiny in a Monterrey jail serves as further proof of the country's shortcomings in regard to human rights and the rule of law. With a visit to Ciudad Juarez and the largest prison in Mexico, Francis will only make that deficiency more transparent. Even the pope of peace has enemies. The route he's chosen to take on his travels through the country has displeased the staunchly Catholic president. A meeting with the relatives of the Iguala victims is therefore hush-hush and participation in a holy mass remains secret. Considering the tense situation in the country, it's still possible that the pope's route will change once again. The church in the pillory Even within his own church, Francis has met with opposition. A meeting he requested with victims from the church's abuse scandal will not take place - a bitter disappointment for many former seminarians who were abused by Marcial Maciel, the founder of the Legion of Christ, and members of his order. It's just one example of how impunity continues even within the church itself. None of the perpetrators have yet to answer for their crimes in court. It appears as though the pope has accomplished more on the world stage than he has brought on reforms to the Vatican. Despite the revolutionary coming together of Cuba and the US and the revolutionary meeting with Patriarch Kirill, the revolution in Rome has yet to materialize. Do you have something to say?

The Vatican has accused the pope of failing to follow the teachings of the Russian Orthodox Church, which has long been a source of friction between the church and the state of Mexico. In September 2014, the Vatican said it was \"impossible\" for the pontiff to visit the country's capital, Ciudad Juarez, in a five-day visit to the Latin American country of Iguala. \"It is impossible for a pope to travel to a country where he doesn't believe in God,\" said Marcial Maciel, who heads the Legion of Christ, a non-governmental organization that works to promote the faith of Christians in Latin America. He also criticized the government of President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, saying it had failed to recognize the Christian faith as a fundamental human right, and that it should not be allowed to be used as an instrument of political power. It is also unclear whether the Pope's trip to Mexico will be a success or a failure, as he has not been able to meet the demands of his papacy. His visit came just a day after his predecessor, former Mexican President Kirill, died of a heart attack in his hometown of Monterrey on September 14, 2014. Astrid Prange, director of public affairs at the Mexican government's Ministry of Culture, said the visit was an \"unprecedented event.\" The pope's visit coincided with a visit by Pope Benedict XVI to Cuba, where the two countries have been at loggerheads for nearly a millennium. On September 15, 2015, Francis visited the Cuban island of Tamaulipas in an attempt to heal the wounds left by his father's death. At the same time, he met with the president of Cuba and his wife, Maria Cristina, to discuss their relationship. Francis said he hoped to see her again, but that he was unable to do so because he had \"no idea what was going on.\" \"I don't know what to expect,\" he said, adding, \"but I think it's very important that we have a strong relationship with our country and we will continue to work together to make it a better place for all of us to live and work,\" the cardinal said. But he did not say whether he would return to his home country, Mexico, for another five days, or if he planned to go back to Rome. 'We are not going to let this happen again,' he added, referring to himself as \"the pope who is not a Catholic.\" He added: \"We will not allow this to happen in any other country. We will do everything we can to help the people of this country.\" In the past, Pope John Paul II has visited Mexico twice, once in September and again in October, when he visited his birthplace of Chiapas. During that visit, his first stop was the capital city of Cihuahua. Last year he traveled to Havana, Cuba. Since then he's been visiting the city for two years, visiting a number of churches, including the Catholic Archdioceses. Most of these churches are Catholic, although some of them are Protestant and some are Roman Catholics. However, there are some Catholics who are more conservative than others, such as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (LCDS), who believe that Catholicism is a religion of God. They say that Catholics are the only people who have the power to change the world. That's because they are also the ones who can change it. And that's exactly what the current pope is trying to accomplish. For many, this is what he is doing. This is the first time that I've seen a papal visit from a different pope. I'm not sure how to explain it, because I have never seen one before in my life. When I was a child, I didn't even know that my father was Catholic. Then I heard about the new pope, then I had to ask him to come back and tell me about his visit. Now I can't understand why he came back. So I'll have to wait until I see him again. What do you think about this visit? I hope he'll be back in Rome in about a week. There's a lot to learn from this trip. (AFP, Reuters, AP, dpa, AFP)Pope Francis is visiting Mexico on his way back from the US, Rome and Rome, according to an official visit in November. After all, it is only a matter of time before he visits the Holy See. If he comes back, we'll know more about what is happening there. According to one Vatican official, though, that will only be possible. Vatican spokesman, Jorge Ramos, told DW that the trip will take about 24 hours. Reuters/AFP/dpa/jm (Reuters)The Vatican declined to comment to DW's request for comment, citing a Vatican spokesperson. Pope, however, insisted that his trip was not possible because of course"

        "target": "US Supreme Court Justice Scalia dies at 79, setting off succession showdown Justice Antonin Scalia, an outspoken conservative and the longest-serving member of the US' top court, has passed away in Texas. President Obama vowed to nominate a successor 'in due time,' despite political opposition. The 79-year old justice died in his sleep, presumably of natural causes, local media reported on Saturday. Scalia was visiting Texas for a hunting trip, and his body was discovered after he failed to appear for breakfast in the resort where he was staying. US President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama extended \"their deepest condolences to Justice Scalia's family,\" White House deputy spokesman Eric Schultz said. Texas Governor Greg Abbott described the conservative justice as a \"man of God, a patriot and an unwavering defender of the written Constitution and the rule of law.\" \"He was the solid rock who turned away so many attempts to depart from and distort the Constitution. His fierce loyalty to the Constitution set an unmatched example, not just for judges and lawyers, but for all Americans,\" Abbot said. Battle for the empty seat His passing is likely to open a new political front between President Barack Obama and the Republican Party, as Scalia's replacement could shift the composition of the court towards a more liberal persuasion. Several Republican lawmakers have already urged Obama to leave the decision to the next president who will be voted in later this year. \"The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court justice,\" Senate Republican majority leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement, referring to the upcoming November general election. \"Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president,\" McConnell concluded. President Obama, however, said he would fulfill his constitutional duty and nominate Scalia's successor \"in due time.\" \"These are responsibilities I take seriously, and so should everyone. They are bigger than any one party,\" he said. Decades of controversy Scalia joined the Supreme Court in 1986, becoming the first Italian-American to serve in the top judicial body. He was nominated by US President Ronald Reagan. Throughout his long carrier, Scalia voted in favor of privacy and protecting defendants' rights, but also against legalizing abortion, same-sex marriage and gun control. He also drew public attention for his theatrical flair and sharpness of tongue, as well as his alleged unwillingness to compromise. In June last year, the nine-person Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage with a five-to-four vote. Scalia, who was in the minority, commented he would \"hide my head in a bag\" if his own name were associated with the decision. He also said that the majority opinion was \"couched in a style that is as pretentious as its content is egotistic.\" dj/jm (AP, Reuters, AFP, dpa)",
        "generated_story": "Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia dies in sleep in Texas The US Supreme Court has been rocked by the death of a 79-year-old justice who died in his sleep on Saturday. Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he was \"deeply saddened\" to hear the news. \"I am deeply saddened by this tragic event,\" McConnell told reporters in a statement. McConnell, a Republican from Texas, was referring to Scalia's death as a \"death of the American people.\" \"It is a sad day for all of us,\" he said, adding that he hoped to see a new justice on the court in the next few years. He was 79 when he died on June last year. His death was the first in US history to be confirmed by a US Senate vote. The Senate confirmed McConnell's nomination to replace Scalia, who had been serving as the justice's chief of staff from 1986 to 1986. Obama is expected to announce his candidacy for the US presidency later this year, according to the Associated Press (AFP, AP, dpa, Reuters). The Republican Party has said it will nominate a replacement for Scalia in November, but has yet to make a final decision on whether to confirm him or not. Democrats have been calling for his death for months, saying it would be a tragedy if he were to die. Republicans, however, have said they will not allow it. On Saturday, they called on Obama to step down from his role as Senate majority leader. They said Obama would not be able to do so because of his lack of experience in politics and his inability to understand the complexities of American life. But they also said that they would continue to work with the president to find ways to ensure that the country's constitution is upheld. In a rare move, Obama has called for a constitutional amendment that would make it easier for Americans to live in their own homes, rather than having to travel to a foreign country. President Barack Obama's first term as US president is set to begin in January, when the Senate will reconvene in Washington, D.C. Democratic Senator Greg Abbott (R-Texas) and Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney (D-TX) will be sworn in to fill the vacancy left by Scalia. Both are Italian-American, and they have a long history of voting for President Ronald Reagan's successor, the Republican-controlled US House of Representatives. Scalia was a staunch defender of democracy and the rule of law, with a reputation for being a hard-nosed, tough-minded conservative who believes in freedom of speech and free speech. When Scalia died, he left behind his wife, Michelle Obama, as well as his two children and three grandchildren. It is unclear whether Obama will seek a second term in office, or whether he would seek another term, since he is not a member of either party. If he does not seek re-election, his successor will have to take the oath of office on January 1, which is scheduled for mid-term elections in December. That would give Obama a chance to win the White House's endorsement of Obama. After all, it is Obama who will inherit the presidency from the outgoing Republican majority, not the Democratic-led Obama administration. Just as he did in 1986, President Obama campaigned on a pledge to uphold the Constitution and to protect the rights of all Americans who voted for him. Since then, Republicans have tried to keep him out of politics, even though he has never been elected to Congress. However, in recent years, many of those who have voted against him have become disillusioned with his legacy. Many of them believe he should be replaced by someone who is more moderate and more conservative. This is especially true in light of what has happened in America's political landscape, such as in Germany, where he served as president of Germany and Italy. Most of these people are Italians-Americans who don't speak Italian. And they want to know what the future holds for their country and their families. So, if Obama wins the election, that's a good thing, because he's going to get a lot of support from them. For now, though, there's no doubt that his party is hoping to have the support of many voters in this election. (Reuters/Eric Schultz)President Obama also has vowed to continue his efforts to repeal the constitution and replace it with an amendment to strengthen the United States' constitution. What's more important is that it's not just the law that is being rewritten to reflect the values of Italians and Italians. There's also the question of whether the new US Constitution is the right one to interpret the text of our Constitution. How can a Constitution be rewritten so that we can live with it? That's something that has not been done before. I'm not sure how long before we get to this point. We're not ready to give up our constitutional rights to our country, so I think we need to focus on this issue of life in our own home state of Texas. At the very least, we'll be looking forward to seeing what happens next year's future."

        "target": "Commerzbank appoints Martin Zielke as new CEO Commerzbank has named Martin Zielke as its next chief executive officer, taking over from current CEO Martin Blessing on May 1. The 53-year-old will be leading Germany's second biggest lender. After successfully weathering the Great Recession, Commerzbank's board of directors appears to want to signal a continuation in its growth trend with Martin Zielke's appointment as the new CEO as of May 1. Outgoing head Martin Blessing announced last year he would not renew his contract. Zielke had previously been put in charge of implementing reforms in the company's private banking sector following the recession. His restructuring measures attracted 800,000 new customers to the bank and changed the image of the 146-year-old financial institution. The 53-year-old has an illustrious career across several German financial institutions to look back on, having started at the teller of a local branch in 1983. Zielke's crowning achievement The beleaguered German financial institution recorded a profit of more than a billion euros (more than $1.1 billion) last year. It was the first time in five years that Commerzbank had made such profitable gains, which it said would translate into paid dividends for shareholders. A good portion of the yields were achieved by a restructuring and expansion drive of Commerzbank's private banking arm under Zielke's leadership. However, some of that money will go to the German government, as it had to step in and rescue the bank in 2009 to the tune of 18 billion euros ($25 billion at the time) by chiefly acquiring more than 15 percent of the shares, effectively nationalizing part of Commerzbank's operations. ss/jlw (dpa, Reuters)",
        "generated_story": "Martin Zielke to be Commerzbank's next CEO The new CEO of Germany's largest bank is due to take over in May, according to a Reuters report. The German bank's chief executive has been named as the country's first CEO in five years. He will be replaced by Martin Blessing, who will take the helm in the coming months. \"We are going to have a very difficult time with the current management team and the board, but we are confident that we can make the right decision,\" Martin B Blessing told a news conference on May 1 in Berlin, adding that he would be \"very happy to step down from his position as CEO.\" \"I am very happy that Martin will have the opportunity to lead the company for five and a half years,\" he said. Martin, 53, was appointed to the post in 1983 after the collapse of the German banking system. In 1983, he took over the reins of a bank that had lost 25 billion euros ($30 billion) a year. Since then, the bank has lost more than $1 billion in market value, and has struggled to make up for that loss with a steady stream of losses. It is the first time in a long time that a German company has gone through the worst financial crisis since the Great Recession of 1983-84, when it was bailed out by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and then the European Central Bank (ECB). The bank, which had been the world's second-largest lender after Deutsche Bank, has seen its share price fall by 25 percent since then. Zilke, a former chief financial officer at Deutsche Boerse from 1983 to 2009, said in an interview with dpa that his successor would have to do \"a lot of work\" to get the job done. But he also said he was not ready to give up on his dream of becoming the next German CEO. According to Reuters news agency, \"Martin will do everything in his power to ensure the success of his company.\" The company's board of directors is expected to approve the appointment of new chief executives in April, after a five-year period in which it has held the top job for the past four years, including the role of chairman, CEO and chairman of its board. If the CEO is chosen, it will not be a surprise to many that the former head of German state-owned lender has already taken over as chief operating officer. However, there is still a lot to learn about the new job, as well as what the future holds for him and what he will bring to it. His appointment comes as he prepares to embark on a new era of rapid economic growth in Germany, where the economy is already suffering from a severe downturn. At the same time he has also been criticized for failing to deliver on the promises he made during his tenure as president of Deutsche Bundesbank (DFB), which he set up in 1982. That's not to say he is a bad person, though, because he's a well-known businessman. On the other hand, his predecessor was a successful businessman who had a reputation for being a hard-working, tough-minded man. When he retired from the banking industry in 1985, that was the last time the business was profitable. Now, in 2009 he had the chance to return to his former role as chairman and CEO, before he stepped down as finance minister in 2010. This time around, however, things are looking up and he won't be able to keep up with his new role. For example, at the end of last year he told Reuters he wanted to start a company that could grow into a major player in Europe's financial services industry, rather than just a small player. After all, this was his first stint as a top executive at a large bank. And he did not want to leave his current position, even if it meant taking on new management positions. So he decided to stick around until he could get a bigger role in overseeing the financial sector. What's more important is that this is not a job he can do for himself and his family. There is no doubt he'll be looking to expand his business, especially in finance, banking and finance. As a businessman, Zelke is well known for his ability to manage his own company. A former banker with an impressive track record of success in banking, business and investment banking career has made a career out of banking. With his experience as an investment banker and entrepreneur, I'm sure he knows how to turn things around. I've worked with him for a number of years and I think that's something he'd be very proud of. (Reuters, AFP, Reuters) \"He's an experienced banker who has a wealth of experience and knowledge of financial markets and management skills, so I don't know what to expect from him,\" said a source close to him. 'I'm very pleased with what I have done for myself and my family.' He added: \"It's very important to me that I can get my hands on this company, too. You can"

        "target": "A quarter of deaths caused by environmental degradation, says UN A new United Nations report warns that pollution and global warming are causing millions more deaths than conflicts. The UN's environment agency has called for an urgent roll-back on harmful substances and fossil fuels. In its report \"Healthy Environment, Health People,\" the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), the World Health Organization and several other environment organizations said that, in 2012, an estimated 12.6 million deaths were attributable to deteriorating environment conditions. The largest numbers of deaths took place in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific regions, followed by sub-Saharan Africa, where around a quarter of deaths were likely caused byair pollution, chemicals, climate change and a lack of access to sanitation. \"By depleting the ecological infrastructure of our planet and increasing our pollution footprint, we incur an ever-growing cost in terms of human health and well-being,\" said UNEP Executive Director Achim Steiner. He added that humanity's life support systems had been compromised by globalization and powerful economic interests. The report was released during UN climate talks in the German city of Bonn which are drawing up rules pertaining to the Paris agreement, which seeks to lower carbon emissions. The document suggested that several drivers were responsible for the threat to human health, including ecosystem disruption, climate change, inequality, unhealthy and wasteful lifestyles, along with unsustainable consumption and production. Worsening effects UNEP estimated that an extra 250,000 deaths could occur each year between 2030 and 2050 as a result of climate change, leading to malnutrition, malaria, diarrhea and heat stress. Between them air pollution and a lack of access to clean water and sanitation cause almost 8 million premature deaths each year. Environmental impacts are responsible for the deaths of more than one quarter of all children under the age of five, the report states. UNEP called for governments to act to remove harmful substances from working environments, reduce the use of carbon fuels and rely instead on renewable energy, and change lifestyles to allow a more sustainable use of the world's resources. The report also called for a bigger investment to protect the planet's natural ecosystem. UNEP predicted a further increase in emerging zoonotic diseases (spread between animals and humans), and called on developing countries, in particular, to prioritize prevention methods. \"Never before have so many animals been kept by so many people - and never before have so many opportunities existed for pathogens to pass through the biophysical environment and wild animals to livestock and people,\" the report warned.",
        "generated_story": "A quarter of deaths due to environmental degradation, says UNEP The United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) has warned that the world's most vulnerable people are at risk of dying from the effects of climate change. The World Health Organization (WHO) said in a report published in the journal Lancet on Thursday that more than one-quarter of people die from environmental pollution every year because of poor health. According to the report, about one in five people in Southeast Asia will die by the age of five, compared to just 1.5 percent for the Western Pacific region. \"This is an alarming statistic,\" said Achim Steiner, the UN's chief environment officer in Bonn, Germany, adding that it was \"unacceptable\" for people to live in an environment where the environment is so polluted that they can't even see the light of day,\" he said. He added: \"We need to change the way we think about our environment and how we live our lives. We have to make sure that we have a healthy, healthy and healthy environment.\" The report was published on the sidelines of a UN conference on environment, health, and human rights, which was organized by a group of experts from around the globe. It was the first time that a major environmental disaster had been averted since the Paris agreement was signed in 2012. Since then, however, it has become increasingly difficult for countries to meet the targets set out for them. For example, in South Asia, a third of the deaths have been attributed to pollution, according to a new UN report. This is in stark contrast to what has been reported in other countries, such as Japan, China, India, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam and the Philippines, where pollution is the main cause of death. In the West Pacific, over 80 percent of all deaths are caused by pollution and over 90 percent by human-caused greenhouse gases (HFCs) that are released into the atmosphere by humans. That is, until 2030, when it will be possible to reduce the amount of greenhouse gas emissions that can be absorbed into our food supply. And it is not just the poor who are affected, but also the people who suffer from chronic diseases like cancer, diabetes and heart disease. These diseases are linked to high levels of smoking, obesity and cardiovascular diseases. They are also associated with a lack of access to clean drinking water and a high level of exposure to toxic chemicals. So, what can we do to prevent these diseases? The UN said it would work with the WHO and other international organizations to find a way to tackle the problem. But it also said that there should be a concerted effort to improve the health and well-being of our people, rather than focusing on just one problem: the environmental impact of pollution. What is it that is causing these deaths? What are the causes of them? How do we know? Well, there are a number of factors that contribute to it. One of these is that our children are not as well educated as their parents. There is a lot of misinformation out there about what is going on in our society. You can read more about that here. Read more: How to protect your child's health from harm from pollution in China and elsewhere in Asia and why we are so worried about the consequences of global warming. How can you protect yourself from a toxic environment? Read More: What's the solution to this problem? Why do you want to help your children to be healthy? There are many ways to do that. First, you need a good education. Learn how to get the most out of your environment. Then you can help them to understand what's happening in their own homes. Second, get a basic knowledge of what you're doing in your own home. Do you have an education? Tell us about your family, friends and neighbors. Tell them about how you've been living your life. If you don't have one, tell them that you'd like to learn more. Let's talk to your parents and ask them if they have any tips for you. I'd love to hear from you, too, because I think they would be very interested in learning more, especially if you know what they're going through. (Reuters, AP, AFP, Reuters) \"I think it's very important for us to educate them on how important they are to have the right to know about their environment,\" says a senior UN official, who is working on a plan to address the issue of health issues. Is there a solution? I'm not sure I can tell you what I would do if I had a child who doesn't know the answer to that question? Let me know if there is something you think is really important to them, so I'll be able to give you some advice. Don't be afraid to tell me what to expect from me. Just ask your friends.

        "target": "Opinion: Yet another crisis for Merkel A summery turquoise blazer and fresh makeup could not hide the fact that Angela Merkel was \"not amused.\" Now she is needed as a champion in the fight against populist forces, DW's Kay-Alexander Scholz writes. Britain-EU divorce proceedings will probably last about two years. Until then, the status quo must be maintained, German Chancellor Angela Merkel emphasized in her press statement. If she is no longer chancellor after the upcoming parliamentary elections in 2017, then others will have to live with the consequences of Brexit. But that is not what she is actually thinking. It is not coincidental that foreign ministers and government leaders are visiting Berlin in the coming days. They want to discuss how things will continue. Berlin, under Merkel's chancellorship, has become a center of power outside of Brussels. Difficult international politics The Brexit decision has disrupted Europe's equilibrium. Germany has lost an important ally on European issues related to economic growth and budgetary discipline. Now, France presumably will be the next to raise its voice against Maastricht Treaty criteria. If the Netherlands and Denmark also decide to leave the EU, Germany will become isolated, as Eastern Europe is not as tight with Germany as it once was. Poland now plays a key role for the Balkan nations and the Visegrad Group (Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic and Slovakia). And Poland is still annoyed about Merkel's refugee policy. What about Germany's populists? They're giddy with glee as they feel that their anti-establishment policies have been validated. They are teaching potential AfD (Alternative for Germany) voters a lesson: \"Here, have a look: it's possible. There is always an alternative. Vote for us!\" Those are exactly the words that protest voters want to hear. Germany's AfD has forged ties with other right-wing parties in Vienna, Paris, The Hague and London. They are all pursuing a \"European\" plan to gain power. The recent Austrian presidential election was significant, as the populist candidate lost by a very narrow margin; in fact, the final election results are still undecided as they are being contested. The Brexit vote was also triggered by populist powers. Domestically difficult Many populists believe that the stronger populism becomes - no matter where - the more advantages there would be for individual parties of their persuasion. Many would also like to see Donald Trump as US president. That is how AfD may become even stronger in Germany, which also means that political majorities would fluctuate even more. Will there be enough seats after the next election for a Christian Democrat and Green coalition, or will yet another grand coalition made up of Christian Democrats and Social Democrats be formed? Can Angela Merkel change course? Can she counter the trend with a new political model in Europe and Germany? Or do we stand on the edge of a new era, a \"political revolution,\" as the AfD calls it? Until now, Europe has survived attacks on its currency (euro crisis), the principle of peaceful coexistence (Crimea crisis) and its open borders policy (refugee crisis). Merkel deserves credit for defending these values, despite mistakes that have been made along the way. The outcome of the Brexit crisis is, however, still open. Have something to say? Add your comments below.",
        "generated_story": "AfD and the Brexit Crisis in Europe German Chancellor Angela Merkel and her Christian Democrats are at loggerheads over the future of the European Union. The AfD, a Christian Democrat party, is a far cry from the anti-EU Alternative for Germany, which was founded in the Netherlands in 2017. It is an extreme left-wing political party that is opposed to the EU's single market, the Single Market, and is seen as a threat to Europe's stability. Its leader, Kay-Alexander Scholz, has called for a \"hard Brexit\" for Europe. \"We need a hard Brexit,\" she told DW in an interview published on Monday. She also called on the government of Germany to take a tough stance on Brexit, saying that it would be \"very difficult for the German people to accept that we are going to have to deal with the consequences of Brexit.\" Germany's Social Democrats (SPD) have been in opposition to Brexit since the beginning of 2017, when the country's president, Donald Trump, was elected to a two-year term in office. Since then, however, they have not been able to form a coalition government with other European countries, such as Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and Poland. In the coming days, Merkel is expected to announce that she will not seek a third term as Chancellor, but rather a fourth term. Merkel has also said she would not accept a second term if she were to be re-elected. But she has not ruled out the possibility of a change of government, she said, adding that her party would continue to work to ensure that the new government would have a clear vision of what Europe should look like in terms of its future. For now, though, it will be up to Merkel to decide what she wants to do about Brexit and what it means for her own party. Germany has been at war with Britain for two years over Brexit. And it's not just Brexit that Germany is fighting. There is also the issue of refugees, migrants, refugees and asylum seekers, as well as refugees from Eastern Europe, including Poland and Hungary. Many of these refugees have fled their home countries in order to seek asylum in Germany. Some of them, like the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia, have also fled to Germany in recent years. They are now living in a refugee camp in eastern Europe and have no idea what they will do with their own country. At the same time, many of their relatives are fleeing their country to escape the chaos of war in Syria and Iraq, while others are seeking refuge in other countries. This is not to say that they don't wish to return to their homeland. However, there are a number of reasons for this. One is the fact that many people are worried about the prospect of an influx of migrants and refugees. Another is that Europe is becoming increasingly isolated, with many refugees fleeing the Middle East and other parts of Europe suffering from economic and political instability. These are the reasons why many migrants are leaving the continent. That is why some of those refugees are coming to Berlin in droves, leaving their families behind. Others are hoping to find a new home in Berlin, where they want to live and raise their children. A third reason is because they fear for their safety in their new country: they are afraid of losing their jobs and their livelihoods. If they do not have the money to buy a house, that would mean they would lose their freedom to travel to another country, or even their homes, if they were forced to leave Europe altogether. So far, this fear has only been expressed by the right wing of Merkel's Christian Democratic Party (CDU), which is part of her coalition. After the election of President Emmanuel Macron in May, Chancellor Merkel will now face a difficult task: she must decide whether to stay or leave the bloc. With the support of other parties, her government will need to make a decision on how to address the refugee crisis. Her party has already made a series of tough decisions on immigration, migration and migration policies. On the other hand, some are already calling for an end to EU membership talks that have already begun in Brussels and Berlin. Meanwhile, others have expressed concern about a lack of cooperation between the US and EU on migration issues, especially in areas where the United States and Europe are not so close to each other's borders. (Reuters, AP, dpa, AFP, Reuters)The German government is currently in talks with European leaders about an EU-wide referendum on whether or not it is possible to get a deal to end the migrant crisis, according to German media. EU leaders have said that a referendum is unlikely to happen before the end of this year. What's the next step in this process? The EU is likely to come up with a plan to create a more open and inclusive EU, rather than an open, more flexible approach to immigration and immigration policy. How will she respond to this? \"I think we will see what happens,\" said Merkel, who has said repeatedly that there is no clear path to an exit from Brussels."

President Barack Obama has lifted a lockdown at the US military base at Camp Springs in Maryland. The lockdown was lifted at 9 am Thursday after an active-shooter incident on the base. US Vice President Joe Biden said in a statement that the lockdown had been lifted. \"This is a precautionary measure,\" he said, adding that he was not aware of any imminent threat to the military personnel stationed there. Obama also said he had not seen any active shooters on base, but that there was no indication that any of them were in the area at that time. However, he did not rule out the possibility of an attack, saying that \"there is no danger at this time.\" The military said it would not comment on whether or not the incident was an isolated incident. Officials said they had no further information on what was going on. They added that no one was injured, and that they were not planning to make any further announcements until the situation was under control. A spokesman for the White House, however, said the president was \"not going to comment further on this incident.\" US President Obama spoke to reporters at Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland, where he is stationed. He said there were no reports of anyone being injured. In addition, the Pentagon said that it was working with the FBI to determine the cause of the shooting, which was reported to be an \"isolated incident,\" according to a Pentagon statement. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said US officials were working closely with local law enforcement agencies to find out if the shooter was a US citizen or an American citizen. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Thursday that US troops were responding to an incident involving a suspected suicide bomber on a base near the southern US city of Baltimore. According to Pentagon officials, no injuries have been reported and no suspects have yet been identified. On Thursday morning, US media reported that a man had opened fire at a military air base outside the capital, killing at least one person and injuring several others, including a woman and a child. At the time, Obama was traveling to Maryland for a visit with his wife and two children, who were wounded in an apparent suicide attempt on Wednesday. Military spokesman Brigadier General Joseph Biden told reporters that Obama had spoken to President Donald Trump about the threat posed by the suspected bomber. Biden also called on him to stay away from the scene, calling it a \"dangerous situation.\" \"We are very concerned for our country,\" Obama said. It is not clear how many people were injured and whether the attack was caused by a single person, or whether it is the result of a lone gunman. But it appears that some of those who are believed to have acted alone are still being held accountable for their actions. There has been no word yet on who the attacker was or how long it will be before they are caught. We are hopeful that this will not be the case, as we have seen so many times in recent days, that we will have a clear picture of what is happening here.

        "generated_story": "Klaus Staeck Artist and Publisher of \"No Detox Water\" has published a book on the subject. The book is a collection of short stories, essays, and photographs. It was published in the German magazine \"The New York Times\" and was the first book to be published by the artist and publisher of the magazine. \" No detox water\" is based on a short story about a water purification process that has been used to clean up the water in an attempt to reduce the amount of water that is released into the atmosphere. In the book, the author describes the process of purifying water into a liquid that can be used as a substitute for water. He describes it as \"a method of cleansing water from the body,\" which he says is the most effective way to combat the effects of excessive water use. According to him, it is \"the only method we can use to get water out of our bodies.\" He says it's the only way that water is safe for people to drink and that's why he has chosen to publish his work in this way. This is his first work for the company, which was founded in 2006. His first project was to create a product that would be able to help people clean their bodies after they've had enough of it for a while. Since then, he's been working on other projects, such as creating an app that allows you to take pictures of your body and put it in a bottle and take a picture of yourself in it. After all, this is what he did when he was a young man in his early 20s. Now he works as an artist, publisher and editor of a magazine that focuses on environmental issues, including water scarcity and climate change. When he first started his career he said he had no idea what was going on, so he decided to write a novel about it and then he began to work on it himself. At the time of his death, his wife and two children were still living in Germany, but now they are living with him and his family. They have a house in Berlin, where he lives with his mother and step-grandmother and their two younger children. But he doesn't have the money to buy his own house. Instead he spends his money on art and works with artists and publishers who have worked on his book. And he also has a lot of experience with the art world, as well as the people who make up his art. For his latest work, Klaus has created a series of books on water, water and water conservation. One of them is called \"Water and Water,\" and the other is about water preservation. Another is Water conservation, a project he started at the age of 16. Water is used for drinking and bathing. There is no mistaking the fact that it can cause water to become mold, mold and mold. That is why it has become so important for him to use water for his paintings, especially when it comes to water treatment. You can see the results of this project at his website, \"water conservation\" (Water conservation), which is available on Amazon.com and on Facebook. Other artists have also written about their experiences with water-related issues. Some of these include the use of bottled water as part of their art collection. Others, however, have used it to make a living by selling water bottles and other products. However, there is also the issue of how to keep water safe from mold or mold in their homes. These are the things that are most important to people's health. I think the biggest problem is that people don't know what to do with it, because they're not aware of what is happening to them. So, I'm not going to tell you what's happening in your home. If you want to know, you have to ask yourself, do you know that you need to go to the store and get some water? I'd like to talk to someone who knows what you're doing. Just ask your friends and family and ask them if you can help you with that. Otherwise, they'll be happy to give you the information you've been looking for. Then you'll have an easy answer to your questions.

We've already had a very difficult time getting water stored up in our house, right? And then there's a big problem with this water supply, too. Why is it so hard to put water on your house?

        "target": "Rethinking the term 'honor killing' The murder of 28-year-old Samia Shahid comes less than two weeks after Qandeel Baloch was killed by her brother. The media was quick to report them as \"honor killings.\" We have to rethink that term, writes Gouri Sharma. When news broke that Samia Shahid, a British-Pakistani woman, had been found dead while visiting relatives in Pakistan at the end of July, mainstream media outlets were quick to report it as an honor killing. It was the second time in two weeks that the media had reported a killing of a woman this way - the first being the murder of Pakistani social media star Qandeel Baloch. There are strong similarities between the cases. Both were murdered in places where they would have felt they were at their safest - in their family homes. It's likely they knew their killers - in Baloch's case, her brother has admitted to strangling her, and Shahid's father and cousin have already been questioned. And as more reports emerge about Shahid's death, it's clear that both were killed because they didn't behave in a way deemed acceptable in a conservative, patriarchal society. 'Deeply offensive' term The debate around terminology in \"honor killings\" isn't new, and after Baloch's murder there were members of the media - such as ABC Australia journalist Juanita Phillips - who decided against using the term, calling it \"deeply offensive\" and referring to it as a \"family killing\" instead. And there are outlets, like the Guardian, that already use inverted commas with the word honor. But some commentators argue that more needs to happen if media consumers are to gain a better understanding of the problem. \"I think an important step for the media would be to refuse to give weight to the term 'honor crimes,'\" said UK-based freelance journalist Shehnaz Khan. \"While it is imperative to highlight that these crimes and murders stem from the roots of misogyny and therefore a false sense of 'honor,' there is absolutely nothing but'shame' within them, as murder is nothing but dishonorable.\" \"The word 'honor' can sometimes carry an almost positive connotation that we are inclined to automatically accept just because it's not happening to us, when the reality is, this a huge problem affecting thousands of girls and women across the world,\" she added. Naming the issue But this isn't a view shared by all journalists. Ruby Hamad, a writer at Australia's Daily Life newspaper, said that the first step in dealing with the issue is naming it. \"There are some deeply patriarchal societies that still limit women's freedom according to old tribal concepts of honor, where, unfairly, the behavior of women reflect on their entire family,\" Hamad said. \"By naming these 'honor killings,' we are acknowledging the role that this misogynistic concept of honor plays, not only in the murders themselves but in these entire societies, and how it entraps both men and women.\" Through the eyes of the perpetrator? There are other issues with the term though. Some have argued that by framing it as such, media outlets are showing the crime through the eyes of the perpetrator - and not through the victim - as they should. And with such cases regularly hitting the headlines, framing is important. The United Nations estimates that around 5,000 women - predominantly from Asia and the Middle East - are killed annually in honor-related crimes, a figure that women's advocacy groups say is closer to 20,000 worldwide. This raises an important cultural element for the media to consider - how far does the term play into cultural stereotypes? \"When honor is considered the most important thing in life, then all family members become expendable,\" Hamad said. \"The collective outweighs the rights of the individual. Does this feed into cultural stereotypes? Perhaps. But that doesn't mean we should pretend that this cultural context isn't there.\" Looking for answers - and alternatives There have been many alternatives put forward by women's advocacy groups, including hate crime, misogynistic murder, femicide and shame killings. But which one should we pick? Al Jazeera for one has decided which one they won't use. \"We are always updating our style guidelines to convey a deeper and more authentic understanding of world affairs. Recent events in Pakistan ignited a healthy debate in Al Jazeera on the term 'honor killings' in particular. Our editors are currently studying alternatives to the term, but'misogynistic murder' is not one of them,\" said an Al Jazeera spokesperson. Terminology in the media matters, and for murders as complex as these, it's the media's responsibility to find a name that better fits the crime. Only then will it become easier to work towards a solution.",
        "generated_story": "Rethinking Honor Killings: A Cultural Perspective The United Nations has released a report calling for a review of the death penalty in Pakistan. The report, published in the Australian newspaper Daily Life, calls for an independent inquiry into the killing of Pakistani students. It is the first report to be published by the independent news agency Al Jazeera, which is based in Sydney, Australia. According to the report's author, Qandeel Baloch, the murder was carried out by a group of students from the Middle East and North Africa. \"It was a case of mistaken identity,\" said Samia Shahid, who has been studying the case for two weeks. Shehnaz Khan, a student at the University of Western Australia, told the Guardian that she was shocked to learn that the students had been killed by Pakistani soldiers. But she also pointed out that it was not just the soldiers who were killed, but also the people who had committed the murders, and that they had also committed crimes against humanity, such as murder, rape, torture, robbery and attempted murder. In addition, she said, \"the perpetrators of these murders were the same people as those who committed these crimes,\" adding: \"They were all innocent, they were innocent. They did not deserve to die.\" The Guardian also published a piece on the issue, titled \"The Death Penalty in Asia,\" in which she argues that Pakistan should be held responsible for the deaths of so many of its students, including the children of those killed during the war in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Iran and Iraq. Read more: Pakistan's death toll rises to 2,000, according to new report The New York Times reports that a number of people have died in Pakistani jails over the past two years, with some of them having been sentenced to life in prison for their crimes. However, it is not clear whether the killings were politically motivated, or if the perpetrators were motivated by their own personal vendetta against the country's people. As a journalist, he has written a series of articles on Pakistan and Afghanistan. He has also written about his experiences as a Pakistani student and how he was treated by his family, friends and fellow students during his time in school. His latest piece is an account of his experience at a school in Karachi, Pakistan, where he met his wife and two young children. When he returned to Pakistan in July, his father was killed in a car accident. After his return to his home country of Pakistan after a two-week stay in exile in Australia he said he had no idea what was going on in his country. 'I don't know what to do with my life anymore,' he told me, adding that he hoped he would be able to find out more about what happened to him and his daughter. This is a very important question for him, as he is now a professor of history at Western Australian University and a former journalist at The Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC Australia). \"I think I'm going to have to look into what I can do to change the way I think about my own life,\" he wrote in an article published on ABC Australia's website, in response to a request for comment from journalist Ruby Hamad. On the other hand, there is also a question of whether he will be allowed to visit Pakistan as well as other countries that have been involved in similar cases in recent years. If so, what will he do next? \"We will see if we can find a way to make sure that we have a better understanding of what is happening in our own country,\" she wrote, referring to an incident that took place last year in India, when a young man was shot to death by an unknown assailant in Lahore, India. Pakistan is one of several countries where the perpetrator was convicted of a murder that killed four people in 2008. A Pakistani-American couple, Gouri Sharma and her husband were also convicted in that case. Both men were acquitted of murder in 2006, while their families were later acquitted in absentia. Since then, Pakistani officials have said they have not been charged with any crime, though they are not aware of any charges against them. That's not the only thing that has come to light in this case, however. There are several other cases where Pakistani authorities have accused the family of being involved. One case in particular is that of an attack on a woman who was raped by her boyfriend. Another case involves a man who killed a child. These cases have sparked outrage across the world, particularly in parts of Asia and the United States. Many people believe that this was an act of revenge against Pakistani society. And this is something that should not have happened, because the Pakistani government has not done anything to prevent it from happening again. At the end of July the government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said it would not be possible for Pakistan to extradite the accused to Australia for his alleged role in setting up a terrorist attack.

        "target": "A Brief History of the Seaside Holiday These days, millions take seaside holidays for granted as one of life's pleasures. But 200 years ago, a dip in the sea was more a test of courage. Hardly anyone could swim. As late as the 18th century, many Europeans still thought of the sea as the realm of Satan: storm-tossed and inhabited by terrifying monsters. \"Unlike the mountains, the coasts were terra incognita as a holiday spot,\" says Manfred B\u00e4tje, director of the Bade-Museum on the North Sea island of Norderney. Anyone who set foot in the water was \"stepping into the unknown\". Brighton showed the way That only began to change after the British aristocracy discovered the healing power of salt water. As early as 1780, Brighton, England's biggest and oldest seaside resort, was a bustling spa. Philosopher and physicist Georg Christoph Lichtenberg (1742-1799) of G\u00f6ttingen gave Germans the starting signal with his 1793 essay \"Why doesn't Germany have any large public seaside resorts?\" In it, he called for the creation of a resort in Cuxhaven on the North Sea. He received support from the most notable German physician of the time, the Prussian king's court physician, Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland. But things turned out somewhat differently. Germany's first seaside resort was indeed built in September, 1793, but in Heiligendamm on the Baltic Sea. Four years later, permission was granted for construction of Germany's first resort on the North Sea, on Norderney. \"For the first bathing season on July and August of 1800, only around 250 guests turned up. Now, the nearly 6000 residents host a good 530,000 bathers annually, plus around 230,000 day-trippers,\" B\u00e4tje reels off the figures. Romanticist inspiration In the 19th century, the landscapes of Caspar David Friedrich, such as his famous Chalk Cliffs on R\u00fcgen (1818), gave seaside holidays added impetus. From then on, the sea was no longer a voracious beast. From the shore, the cultivated, modern European contemplated the vast melancholy of the deep. \"The calm sea became an embodiment of unspecified yearning, the waves an expression of vitality and dynamism,\" soliloquizes museum director B\u00e4tje. But the journey to the sea long remained an arduous, time-consuming one. It took the mail coach a good thirty hours to cover the distance from Hamburg to the North Frisian town of Aurich over bumpy, muddy roads. The express cab from Bremen only took about 16 hours to reach the East Frisian town of Norden - including six changes of horses along the way. \"It wasn't comfortable,\" explains B\u00e4tje. Not until the introduction of seaside tourist steamers out of Hamburg and Bremen to the islands and the expansion of the railways did the journey become easier. Strict bathing rules At first, it was primarily the well-to-do bourgeois and nobility who were able to afford a seaside holiday. Victorian-era society is known for its extreme prudishness, and the beach was not exempt. Bathing machines were essentially changing cabins on wheels that could be rolled into the surf. The sexes were kept strictly separated. Wet swimsuits could not be allowed to cling, thus revealing the body's contours. Women sported baggy flannel garments with bloomers underneath that swiftly became waterlogged to where the bather was risking her life. Hardly anyone really knew how to swim anyway. \"Most bathers wouldn't stay in the water any more than two minutes, often just seconds at a time. The English had a rule: 'Three dips and out',\" quips archivist Manfred B\u00e4tje, whose Bade-Museum is housed in a building for a former wave pool, just a few steps from Norderney's Weststrand, where, during the summer months, vacationers sunbathe in wicker beach chairs and on blankets, cooled by a salty sea breeze. Sunbathing first came in style early in the 20th century, and the first true swimsuits were produced in the United States. \"Starting in 1919, today's bathing culture gradually began to take shape,\" B\u00e4tje looks back. At the same time, ideals of beauty were in flux - such as the attitude towards tan skin, which had long been regarded as a mark of farmers and manual laborers. B\u00e4tje: \"People were still cultivating their genteel pallors.\" Water, Waves, Wellness Today, the sun worshipers are the devout masses, and seaside holidays are their pilgrimages. The North Sea resorts alone count some 12.9 million overnight stays annually. Health is once again a primary concern: sea air, sea water, sea salts and the algaes and mud used in",
        "generated_story": "A Brief History of the Seaside Holiday in Germany The Bade-Museum in Bremen, Germany, is a museum dedicated to the Baltic Sea holiday. It is located in the town of Heiligendamm, near the North Sea, and is the site of one of Germany's most famous seaside holidays. In the 19th century, it was known as the \"Seaside holiday\" and was celebrated by thousands of people from all over the world. Today, there are more than 2,000 visitors annually who come to Germany to enjoy the sea. The most recent visitors are those from England and the United States, who visit Germany every year for the summer months. They come for a good thirty-six hours a year, which is about two minutes longer than the average summer vacation in England. This is not to say that they don't enjoy it, but it is to be expected that there will be a fair amount of tourists. For example, in 1818, a German tourist from the Netherlands, Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland, visited the city of Norderney, where he was born, to visit his father and mother-in-law. His father, Caspar David Friedrich, died in 1793 and his mother was buried in a nearby cemetery. He was the first German to travel to England in 1692, when he visited his family in R\u00fcgen. Since then, he has traveled to several other European countries, including Britain, France, the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Germany. During his visit, B\u00e4tje said, \"I was very impressed by the beauty of this place. I think it's a very beautiful place to spend time with my family and my friends.\" He added that he had never seen a sea as beautiful as he did in his childhood. \"It's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen,\" he said. But he didn't think he would be able to make it back to his home country, so he decided to stay in Berlin until the end of his life. After all, this is where I grew up. When I was a little boy, I used to go to school there and spend a lot of time on the beach. Then I went to college and became a teacher. Now I'm a professor of history at the University of Cologne, studying the history of German culture and literature. And I have always wanted to learn more about the country's history and culture. As a young man, my father taught me to read the Bible and to write a book on it. So I spent a long time reading the Koran in my spare time. At the beginning of my life I read a few books on German history. One of them was \"The Book of John,\" which was written by a man named Dieter Sell, then translated into English as \"A book of poetry.\" The book was published in 1830 by German author and historian Casper David Fierz, with the title \"On the Sea of England.\" It was an important book for German children, as it gave them an insight into the time and place of their childhood and how they spent their summers in Europe. From the 1780s to 1820s, many of these books were written in English and were translated to German. These days, they are available in German, English, French, German and English.

Reported to have a heart condition, Hickey was arrested three months ago during the Rio de Janeiro Olympics on ticket scalping charges. He is awaiting trial, though has not been imprisoned. Hickey has denied any wrongdoing. He is one of 10 people facing charges of ticket scalping, conspiracy and ambush marketing related to the Olympics. Hickey said he would fight \"each and every one\u201d of the Rio Games ticket-touting charges he faces. Hickey, who was also the head of the Olympic Council of Ireland, was released from custody last month, but must remain in Brazil until the case is heard. \"For clarity, I am not under house arrest as, like with so many things with this case, has been misreported by the media,\u201d Hickey said in a statement on Monday. Hickey was arrested on 10 August at a luxury beachfront hotel during the games. The authorities told Reuters last week that they believe the ring had operated for around eight years and was preparing for other Olympic events such as the 2020 Tokyo Games. jbh/bw (AP, AFP)",
        "generated_story": "Ex-Euro Olympic athlete Patrick Hickey freed on bail in Rio Olympics Former Euro Olympic champion and Olympic Committee member Patrick \"Patrick\" He has been freed from jail after being charged with fraud. The 71-year-old Dubliner, who won a gold medal at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics in 2014, is due to appear in court on 10 August in Dublin. He is expected to face charges of fraud and money laundering related to his involvement in the 2014 Olympic Games in Brazil, which he won in his bid to become the first Irish athlete to win gold in a major international sporting event. \"I am very happy that I have been released from prison,\" he told reporters on Monday, adding that he hoped to return to Ireland by the end of the year. His lawyer, Juliana Leal de Melo, said he would appeal against the conviction. In a statement, the Olympic Council of Ireland (OCI) said it was \"not possible for Patrick to be extradited to the country of his birth\" and that it would be \"very difficult\" to extradite him to a European court in Ireland, where he will be tried for fraud, corruption and tax evasion. Ireland is the only European country with an Olympic-level athlete who has not been convicted of a crime, and it is not clear whether he has a criminal record. It is also not known if he is a member of any other European Olympic committee, but he was convicted in absentia on a charge of bribery and fraud involving the awarding of Olympic medals. According to Reuters, he had pleaded guilty to bribery charges and was sentenced to four years in prison for the crime. However, his conviction was later overturned on appeal after a judge ruled that the charges against him were politically motivated and he could not face a trial. Olympic officials have said they are still investigating the case and are looking into the possibility of an appeal. They have also said that they will appeal the decision to release him, saying he should be allowed to travel to Rio without being convicted by a court. A spokesman for Rio Olympic authorities said the court would not rule on whether the prosecution had any basis in fact to charge him with bribery, fraud or money-laundering. Pensions have risen since the 2016 Rio Games, when the world's top athletes were barred from attending the games. But they have not yet ruled out a bid for a second Olympics, with the IOC saying they would like to see him back in action. Patrick, 71, of Dublin, was arrested on suspicion of financial crimes in connection with his alleged involvement with a drug trafficking ring, according to an AFP news agency report. Prosecutors have asked for his release, citing a plea agreement with prosecutors. Dublin's Olympic council has also asked that a case be opened in relation to that case. Irish Olympic chief Patrick Healy has denied any wrongdoing and said his innocence was not being used as a basis for any prosecution. Reuters/AFP/jm (AP, AFP, dpa, Reuters)Irish Olympic Chief Patrick (pictured) was detained by Rio police on Sunday after he refused to cooperate with investigators in their investigation into allegations of corruption at his home country's sports office. Officials said a probe was ongoing into possible links between him and the drug ring and his arrest. Authorities have yet to comment on the allegations, however, they said there had been no evidence of wrongdoing. 'I have no reason to believe that there is any link between me and any criminal activity,' said Dublin police spokesman Brigadier-General Michael O'Neill. Hickey was released after the investigation was completed, following a three-month period of investigation, after which the police were unable to provide any further information on his whereabouts. O\u00b4Neill added: \"The investigation is still ongoing and we will continue to look into this matter. I am not aware of anything that could be connected to this case.\" Ireland's former vice-president of sports and sports, Jolyon Lopes, told Reuters that \"it is very difficult for me to make a decision on my future as an athlete.\" He also denied that his wife was involved in any illegal activity and insisted that she had no knowledge of what was going on with her husband's family. She said she did not know the whereabouts of her son, a businessman who was a convicted drug trafficker who had fled to Brazil three months ago from Ireland. (Reuters, AP)Hickey's arrest was the latest development in an ongoing corruption scandal that has shaken up the sport's governing body. Last year, Ireland was accused of trying to influence the outcome of last year's World Cup, in which a man was found to have committed crimes against his family and others, including the murder of two people. There was no indication that Ireland had tried to interfere with any investigation. This is one of several cases in recent months, though, it's unclear if there was any connection between the two cases. That's not something that is currently being investigated by police. We have a long-term plan to try to find out more about what happened to him. At the matter"

        "target": "Reports: Merkel to run for fourth term as German chancellor German Chancellor Angela Merkel has confirmed that she will stand for the chancellery in the 2017 election, German media reports. The Christian Democrat Leader (CDU) first took office in 2005. After months of speculation, German Chancellor Angela Merkel reportedly told her fellow Christian Democrats (CDU) in Berlin on Sunday that she is prepared to lead the party into next year's election. An official statement is expected from Merkel at 7 p.m. local time (1800 UTC) on Sunday. The 62-year-old has faced a number of difficulties in recent months, from criticism over her handling of the migration crisis to falling support amid a rise in right-wing populist sentiment. Since taking office in 2005, however, Merkel has also been praised for navigating Europe's largest economy through the financial and eurozone crises. According to an Emnid survey published in the German newspaper \"Bild am Sonntag\" 55 percent of Germans are in favor of Merkel remaining head of the German government for another four years. Thirty-nine percent said they were against her re-election. Sign of stability Should she be elected next September, another full four-year term would put Merkel on a par with her mentor Helmut Kohl who set the post-war record and presided over the Fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. In light of the UK's shock vote to leave the European Union in June and Donald Trump's election last week as US president, Merkel's re-election is likely to be welcomed in many capitals as a sign of stability. During his final visit to Berlin this week, US President Barack Obama said that if he were able to, he would vote for his longtime partner and friend. In an interview with German magazine \"Spiegel\" and broadcaster \"ARD,\" Obama said: \"She has great credibility, and she is willing to fight for those values in a way that is very, very important.\" \"I'm glad that she's there and I think the German people should appreciate her. Certainly, I've appreciated her as a partner.\" Winning back votes With the less that a year until Germany heads to the polls, Merkel's CDU is now turning its efforts to wooing back disenchanted voters who have left the conservative camp to support the right-wing populists, Alternative for Germany (AfD). Formed as a Euro-sceptic party in 2013, the AfD won 4.7 percent of the popular vote in the last federal elections in 2013, just falling short of the 5 percent threshold required to enter the Bundestag - Germany's lower house of parliament. After benefiting from the rise in europsceptic, anti-immigration sentiment, seemingly sweeping across western Europe, the party now holds seats in nine of Germany's 16 states.",
        "generated_story": "Merkel's re-election bid comes amid growing populist sentiment in Germany Chancellor Angela Merkel is set to seek a fourth four-year term in the Bundestag, the German parliament, on Sunday. Merkel's CDU party is expected to form a coalition government with the right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. The AfD party, which has been in power for four years, is seen as the most likely front-runner to win a second term. It is the first time that Merkel has won a term as chancellor since her predecessor, Helmut Kohl, took office in 2005. In the past, she has faced criticism for her handling of the Berlin Wall and for not doing enough to prevent it from falling into the hands of Donald Trump's Republican Party (R-US). Merkel, who was first elected to parliament in 2013, has said she will not seek another term, saying she wants to focus on the economy. \"I want to be able to make Germany a better place for the future,\" she said in an interview with German daily Bild am Sonntag published Sunday, adding that she would be willing to work with other parties to ensure that the country's economy is not damaged by the fall of communism and the rise of populism in Europe. But she also faces a tough task in her bid for a third term: the election of her conservative Christian Democrat party (CDU), which she won in a landslide election last year, in which it lost to the far-right Social Democrats (SPD). The SPD, however, said it would not accept the result because it was too close to a referendum on whether or not to give up its right to govern, and that it had no intention of doing so at the ballot box. Instead, it will be up to voters to decide whether they want Merkel to stay in office or whether she should step down, according to Spiegel magazine, a German newspaper that has published a series of interviews with Merkel and her party's leaders. Read more: Merkel seeks fourth term In Germany, voters are increasingly turning to Merkel for support, even if she is unable to secure a majority in next year's federal parliament. She has also been criticized for failing to deliver on her promises to reduce the number of migrants and refugees who enter the European Union. Germany's largest economy, exports more than a fifth of its total population, employs 1.5 million people. That's a huge number, but it's still far short of what many would like to see, given that many of them are from the center-left, left-leaning Christian Democrats. And it is also not clear whether Merkel will have the support of voters who want her to remain chancellor for another four more years. German media reported Sunday that voters were turning out in droves to vote for Merkel in Sunday's parliamentary election, with many saying that they were disappointed with her lack of commitment to her policies on immigration, migration and other social issues. They also said they would vote against her plans to expand the EU's refugee quota to include refugees and asylum seekers from other EU member states, such as Poland and Hungary, as well as for allowing migrants to leave the bloc without a visa. This is a clear indication of how far she may have to go in order to reach her goal of becoming chancellor, Merkel told the weekly newspaper Der Spiegel, citing a poll published in June that showed a strong majority of Germans in favor of a new EU membership. However, many Germans are still skeptical about the idea of an EU-wide migrant quota, despite the fact that Germany has a long-term plan for migrants. Many believe that this is unlikely to happen, especially if migrants are allowed to come to Germany. For example, they say that there is no chance of Germany becoming a free-trade zone, so they are not going to sign a deal with Europe's biggest trading partner, Britain, until the end of this year. On the other hand, there are a lot of people who think Germany is too far behind the United States in terms of immigration policy, including the US and Britain. There are also a number who are worried about immigration and migration policies that could make it difficult for them to get a fair deal on their own terms. These are the people of Europe who have been left out of European integration. What's more, most Germans don't have a choice in this election: They have no idea what to expect from Merkel. Most voters, though, are likely to support her, because they know she's not the only one who wants a more open-minded approach to immigration. So far, that hasn't been the case. According to German news agency Spiegel's editorial board, this week's election could be the last chance Merkel could win an election in September, when she faces the prospect of being elected as Chancellor, or at least for that matter, Germany could become a member of NATO. After all, if Merkel wins the presidency, her chances of getting elected will depend on what happens next. If she wins in 2017. (Reuters, AFP/AFP/Reuters"

        "target": "France's conservatives: Combating the National Front with a swing to the right A staunch conservative is joining the race for the French presidency. Republican candidate Francois Fillon could turn into a big problem for right-wing extremist Marine Le Pen's National Front. France's Republicans are moving to the right: by choosing Francois Fillon, voters nominated a presidential candidate who has a reputation as a staunch conservative. The former prime minister has already announced that he intends to refocus politics with the traditional family in mind. Fillon takes a dim view of homosexual couples adopting children. He wants to introduce a cap on the number of refugees allowed into France, he intends to make it harder for foreign nationals to access the social welfare system, and he wants to put Muslim communities and mosques under government control. In addition, Fillon advocates a renationalization of school curricula. Fillon makes gains in FN territory Fillon's agenda could turn out to be a problem for the \"National Front\" (FN). The 62-year-old appeals to similar sentiments as the right-wing party's base: concern about foreign domination and loss of identity, fear of terrorism and crime. \"For a long time, FN was the only political force that addressed those fears,\" said Henrik Uterwedde of the German-French Institute (dfi) in Ludwigsburg. \"Now a politician has arrived on the scene who addresses those fears using a different language and makes them a political offer.\" In rural, Catholic France especially, where traditions still matter a great deal, the avowed Catholic Fillon strikes a chord with his proposals pertaining to family and society policies. He receives support from traditional Catholic groups who, for years, have been able to mobilize crowds for demonstrations against gay marriage. During the intraparty election campaign, Fillon predominantly traveled to France's villages and small towns - regions which FN leader Marine Le Pen had labeled the \"forgotten France,\" regarding herself as their foremost lobbyist. \"Fillon has made gains in an environment that is also canvassed by Le Pen,\" Andreas Jung, Chairman of the Bundestag's German-French parliamentary group, told German broadcaster rbb-Inforadio. \"He does not represent the lofty levels of Parisian politics, but rather provincial entrenchment. Fillon is committed to traditional values, like the family. Therefore, he may not only be capable of defeating Le Pen, but also of taking the lead during the first ballot.\" 'Most dangerous candidate for FN' Consequently, the FN camp is less than enthusiastic about the conservative's candidacy. \"Because of Fillon, we now have a strategy problem,\" Marion Marechal Le Pen, the FN leader's niece, recently told journalists. \"He is the most dangerous candidate for the National Front.\" Pollsters' findings appear to support that statement. Recent surveys establish Fillon as the current favorite in the French presidential election scheduled for next May. However, Fillon's election is not a foregone conclusion. By denouncing the conservative candidate as a member of the establishment, FN tries to win over those who are frustrated with politics and politicians in general. There is persistent opposition against his economic-liberal plans in particular. Fillon wants to abolish the 35-hour working week and raise the retirement age to 65 years. In addition, he wants to cut 500,000 jobs in the public sector and reform industrial law. Fillon is known as an admirer of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. \"Issues pertaining to liberal economic policy have always been heavily contested in France,\" said Uterwedde. \"Fillon's adversaries have already taken up their positions, criticizing what, in France, is called 'ultra-liberalism.'\" That was one of the nastiest words in French politics, he added. An offer for the left Fillon wants to raise VAT by 2 percent. This would predominantly hurt low-income households. Exactly that clientele, however, is wooed by FN with a program that is regarded as rather left-wing. The right-wing extremists are on a clear anti-globalization course, intending to seal off the French economy against foreign countries and exit from the European Union. The party is already trying to present Fillon as a symbol of anarchic, ultra-liberal capitalism. \"Francois Fillon will even go beyond EU demands for austerity and liberalism,\" David Rachline, Marine Le Pen's election campaign manager, wrote on Twitter. According to current polls, it is very likely that Fillon will have to face Marine Le Pen in a runoff election in May. The main hazard for the Republican candidate: his economic-liberal course could deter left-wing voters from choosing the conservative in order to avert Le Pen. \"Francois Fillon will have to start making offers, also to those voters who are closer to the center and more moderate,\" said France expert Uterwedde. \"And he will, prior to the runoff election at the latest, have to make offers to left-wing voters - without changing his original course.\"",
        "generated_story": "French presidential candidate Francois Fillon is the most dangerous candidate for the French presidential election, according to the German-French Institute of Politics (dfi). The \"National Front\" candidate is Marine Le Pen, the \"French National Front (FN) candidate. The party's leader, who has been in power for 65 years, is far more dangerous than the right-wing candidate in the polls. He is also far less likely to win a second term in office than he was in 2015, when he won the first round of the European elections. \"I think he is a very dangerous person,\" said Henrik Uterwedde, a professor of political science at the University of Ludwigsburg in Germany. In the long-term, he said, \"He is not going to be able to beat the opposition, but he will have to do a lot more than just be a strong candidate.\" He also said that he would be willing to give up his seat in parliament if he could get the support of his own party, which he described as a \"strong opposition party.\" \"It is very difficult for me to think of a candidate who is so dangerous,\" he told rbb-Inforadio, an online magazine that focuses on political issues, such as abortion, contraception and abortion. But he added that it was \"very difficult\" for him to get elected to parliament, given that his father was a Catholic and his mother was from the Roman Catholic Church. And he has no experience in politics. His father, Andreas Jung, was also a priest, and he had a long history of being involved in political activism in his youth. Now he's a member of parliament and a former minister of state for education, health and the environment. If he wins the presidency, it will be his first time in a European parliament. It will also be the last time he'll have the chance to run for president in France. For the time being, there is no way he can win the election. That's because he doesn't have any experience of politics, so it's not his job to make decisions on the basis of religion, politics or religion. This is why he should not be allowed to have a say in what happens next. After all, this is France's most important democracy. There are so many things that can be done to change the way we think about the future of our country. You can't just say that you don't want to vote for a man who's so far ahead of you. What you can do is make a decision based on what you think is best for your country, not on who you're voting for. I think that's the best thing for you, because you are the only person who can make that decision. So, let's see if you have anything to say about this. Let's start with the candidates themselves. They are all very well-known and well known in their own right, right? But they are also very different from each other. Many of them are not even close to being the same person as they once were, in fact they have been for many years. At the very least, they all have different political views. Some of their views are quite different than others. One is that they differ from those of other candidates. Others are more radical, like the far-right candidate Marion Marechal (pictured above). Others, however, are much more moderate and more pragmatic. Both are very much in line with what they believe in, as well as the views of those who believe that the current president of France should be elected by the people. (Reuters, AFP, dfi) And that is exactly what is happening in Europe right now. On the other hand, some of these candidates are a bit more extreme, too. Like the left-leaning candidate, Marine le Pen is an extreme example of that. She's an outspoken, hard-line conservative who believes that she has the potential to become the next French president. However, she's also an extremist. Her views on abortion and contraception are far from ideal. When it comes to women, abortion is one of her top priorities. Abortion is another area of concern for women in her life, for example. Women, especially women and minorities, have also been a big part of what makes her so appealing to people who are in opposition to abortion rights. Why is it so important to her? Because she believes abortion should never be an option? That is precisely the reason why she wants to take a stand against abortion in order to protect the rights of women who have access to contraception. How do you feel about abortion? Is abortion a good idea? What does it mean to you? Do you agree with me? If you disagree with her on this point, then you've got to ask yourself: Why should abortion be illegal? Why would you want abortion to happen? And why is abortion not an issue in your life? The answer is clear: She has to stand up for what she thinks it is wrong to allow abortion access? She says that abortion"

He wants new names for plant-based dishes. Germans shouldn't be biting into a \"vegan sausage\" or cutting a slice of \"vegetarian schnitzel,\" German Minister for Food and Agriculture Christian Schmidt told the daily \"Bild\" newspaper on Wednesday, adding that names traditionally used for meat-based dishes should not be applied to plant-based foods. \"I don't want anyone to pretend that these pseudo-meat dishes are actual meat dishes,\" Schmidt said. The minister said manufacturers should come up with distinct names for plant-based meat-substitutes. Schmidt also said meat was part of a healthy and balanced diet and belonged on the menu in schools and kindergartens. Soy? Steak? Soy-steak? Schmidt's statements echo demands from the German Farmers Association and German Butchers Association. Both lobbying groups have asked for a ban on terms such as \"vegetarian ham\" or \"soy steak.\" Schmidt's call for plant-based foods to have their own name was also made in October in the state of Lower Saxony, a state with many large livestock farms. The German Vegetarian Association, however, argued against the proposal. A spokesperson for the organization said that \"names that are used for animal-based products should without a doubt also be legal to use for vegetarian substitute products.\" More meatless 'whatever-you-want-to-call-thems' The market for vegetarian and vegan dishes has grown steadily in the past few years in Germany, partly at the expense of the meat industry. According to a research paper by the Institute for the Study of Trade (IfH), revenue for vegetarian and vegan products in Germany was 454 million euros ($474 million) in 2015 and grew by more than 100 percent between 2010 and 2015. In the same time period, the demand for meat products fell by almost 10 percent. mb/sms (dpa, epd)",
        "generated_story": "No more \"vegetarian schnitzel\" - No more'veggie sausages' and no more' veggie sausage' - The German Vegetarian Association (IfH) has announced that it will no longer sell veg products. The move comes after a series of scandals over the past few years, including a scandal involving the German Butchers Association. According to a report by the Institute for the Study of Trade (IAS) in October 2015, the number of vegans in Germany rose by 454 million euros between 2010 and 2015. It was the first time in the history of the association's history that farmers had been allowed to sell their vegetables without having to pay for them. This was followed by a rise in prices for meat, meat and dairy products, according to IfH. In addition, farmers were able to raise more than 1.5 billion euros ($1.4 billion) from the sale of meat products in 2015 alone, compared with the same period in 2010, when the industry was still relatively small. \"We are not going to allow this to happen again,\" said Christian Schmidt, who heads the IFH, a trade association for farmers in Lower Saxony, in a statement. He added that \"we will not tolerate this kind of behavior,\" adding that he was \"not prepared for this type of situation.\" \"I am not prepared to accept this,\" he said. If H was, he added, it would be \"a very sad day for all of us who have worked so hard for so long to get to this point in our lives.\" He also said he would not be willing to give up his job as a farmer if he were to be forced to take on the responsibility of taking care of his own family. 'We have to make sure that we don't lose the opportunity to grow our own vegetables,\" Schmidt said in an interview with German newspaper Bild, which was published on Wednesday. But he did not rule out the possibility of an increase in meat sales, as he had said before, and said that there was no need for such a drastic change. However, if H had to do it again, there would have been a lot more meat to eat, so he decided to cut back on meat production and sell it to the farmers' association. Since the end of last year, Germany's meat industry has seen a sharp decline in production, but it's not just the meat sector that has been affected by this. For example, German meat exporters have cut down on their meat exports, leaving only meat that is not available to them, such as meat from meat-packing plants, rather than from beef, poultry, fish and fish. They have also cut off meat imports from other countries in order to focus on beef and poultry. That's a big change from previous years when meat was sold to meat processors and meat producers. Now meat is being sold in supermarkets and supermarkets, where meat can be sold for a much higher price than meat. There is no meat at all. Meat is still available for sale in many countries, even in small markets like Germany, with meat being the most expensive meat in Europe. And meat has become a staple of German restaurants, especially in rural areas. With the exception of Bavaria, this is the only country with a meat market that's still open to foreign buyers. German farmers have traditionally been the largest exporter of beef products to Germany in recent years. A recent study found that meat prices have fallen by 30 percent since the beginning of 2015 and that the average meat price has risen by 40 percent, while meat costs are up by 20 percent. Food prices are also rising by 10 percent over that time, making meat more expensive to produce, says the IHS, an agricultural research institute. What's more, they say, is that beef is a very expensive commodity to buy and the price is too high for consumers to live on. So, what's the best way to reduce the cost? \"Meat is an important commodity for people who want to have meat for their own consumption,\" says Dieter Schmidt of Ifh in his weekly magazine, \"The German Farmers Association\" (IFH). \"It's very difficult to find meat substitutes, because meat isn't available at the supermarket. You can't buy meat without meat.\" But if you're a vegetarian, you can still get meat by cutting meat off and eating it in large quantities, Schmidt told the magazine's editorial board in November, 2016, that this was a good time to talk to people about meat shortages and how to improve meat quality and reduce meat consumption, said Schmidt. Germany has a reputation for being a food-intensive country, despite the fact that most meat companies have a high percentage of their sales in this country. Many of these companies are already producing meat as well as in other parts of Europe and abroad. As a result, many of them are now selling meat on a low-cost basis. These are the products that are sold at a lower price. I think the market is very important to farmers and I believe that"

Bernd Westphal, the German ambassador to Libya, said bilateral relations had been through difficult times. \"The German Embassy in Tripoli today is working for a quick return to the liveliness of close relations between Germany and Libya,\" Westphal said. \"We want to build on our traditional friendship with Libya and we want to strengthen the political, economic and cultural cooperation between our two countries and peoples.\" Business interests booming in Libya In the past few years, Libya has moved from being the supporter of international terrorism to an attractive economic partner for the West. European business representatives have been increasingly knocking on Libya's door. Even the United States is showing increased interest in the northern African nation. Washington is pleased that Libya announced at the end of 2003 that it would discontinue its efforts to develop and produce weapons of mass destruction. Libya's ambassador to Germany, Said Abdulaati, said political and economic relations between Libya and Germany were \"excellent.\" Libya is one of Germany's strongest trading partners in northern Africa. Last year, Germany exported goods to Libya worth 657.7 million euros ($805.7 million), according to the German Federal Statistics Office. \"The economy is the driving power in German-Libyan relations,\" said Abdulaati in an interview with the Arab-German association for trade and industry. But Germany isn't the only European country making deals in Libya. France last month signed an accord with Libya on peaceful nuclear research. \"This accord represents a qualitative leap in relations between the two countries and proves that Libya has transformed its weapons of mass destruction into constructive weapons,\" Public Works Minister Maatuk Maatuk said at the signing ceremony in March. \"We are telling the world that we are moving towards the development of Libyan nuclear technology for peaceful purposes.\" This week, the Netherlands' Economics Minister Laurens Jan Brinkhorst will visit Libya to negotiate gas and oil agreements. It will be the first high-level visit by a Dutch official since Gadhafi took power in 1969.",
        "generated_story": "Libyan President Moammar Gadhafi has been in power for 15 years, but the country's relations with Europe have changed dramatically in the past few years. In April 2004, the German Embassy in Tripoli announced that it had spent 657.7 million euros on public works projects in Libya. \"La Belle\" is a symbol of the change in Libyan relations. It is the first time that the government of Libya has spent as much as $35 million on the construction of roads, bridges and other infrastructure. The project is part of a wider effort to improve relations between the West and the Middle East. According to the Federal Statistics Office (FSO), the project will be funded by Germany, France, Britain, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Germany and France. Since the beginning of 2003, there have been a number of projects that have taken place in and around the Libyan capital, Tripoli, which has a population of about 805,000. Many of these projects are based on a project that was started by the French government in 2001. They are being funded through the European Union's Public Works Fund (EPF), which was set up by former German Prime Minister Gerhard Schr\u00f6der in 2003. This fund is meant to help fund the reconstruction of Tripoli's roads and pave the way for new roads. But it is also intended to be used as a means to build bridges between Libya and Europe, as well as to create a bridge between Europe and North Africa. For example, it would be possible to connect the two countries by road and by train. However, this is not the case with Libya, where the current government is in charge of building roads that connect Tripoli to other cities and towns. There are also plans for a new airport in eastern Libya that will serve as the capital for the new Libyan government. That is expected to take place on April 5, 2004. At the same time, Libya's government will have to deal with an influx of refugees from neighboring countries, including the United States and Britain. And it will need to make sure that all of its citizens are able to live in a safe and secure environment in their own country, and that they have the right to travel to and from their home country of their choice. A few months earlier, a German official told DW that he had received a letter from the US President, Tony Blair, saying he was \"very pleased\" with the response to his visit to Tripoli. He also said that, \"I am very happy that we have had the opportunity to visit Libya again.\" The German embassy said it was pleased to receive the letter, adding that \"we are very pleased with what we've seen so far.\" \"We have seen a lot of progress,\" said Bernd Westphal, head of Germany's German Foreign Office, who was visiting Libya in March 2004 at the end of his term as German foreign minister in Berlin. 'It's a great opportunity for us to get to know each other better,\" he said, referring to Libya as \"the most beautiful country in Europe.\" But he added that there was still a long way to go in terms of how much money was being spent on reconstruction and reconstruction, especially in areas such as Tripoli and Benghazi. As a result, he says, many of those projects will not be completed until at least 20 years later, when the EU is ready to give up its current budget for reconstruction. After all, they will still need the money to pay for them, according to a report by German public statistics office, in order to provide the necessary infrastructure and infrastructure needed to meet the needs of people living in those areas. Speaking to DW's Laurens Jan Brinkhorst, director of public affairs, said: \"This is an important step forward for our country. We will continue to work closely with our European partners on this issue. I think it's important to have a clear vision of what the future will look like for Libya.\" He said he hopes that Libya will become a model for other countries to follow, with a focus on developing a better future for its people, not just the people of Europe. On the other hand, his country is facing a difficult time in its own right. His country has also faced an economic crisis. Libya is one of many countries that are struggling to find a way out of poverty and poverty. Its economy is suffering from a lack of economic growth, unemployment and unemployment. Unemployment is high in many parts of Africa and in particular, poverty is rising in some countries like the UK and Germany. With the rise of oil prices and rising unemployment, more people are likely to leave the continent. So, we are going to need a solution. You can see why the situation is so difficult to achieve that. If you want to see the results of this, you can look at how we can make a positive impact on your country and how you will make it better for you and your people.

        "target": "EU Mulls Warning Labels to Curb Alcohol Abuse While still targeting smoking, European Union's public health commissioner is considering adding alcohol to the list of vices the bloc should clamp down on. In a report commissioned by the European Commission, the London Institute for Alcohol Studies recommended raising the legal age to buy alcohol to 18 (in some countries, such as Germany, 16-year-olds can buy beer), lowering the permitted blood alcohol level while driving to 0.5, banning alcohol advertising on TV and in movies as well as adding warning labels to bottles as ways of preventing alcohol abuse across the bloc. Which of the methods EU Health Commissioner Markos Kyprianou actually introduces will be announced \"sometime in the autumn,\" according to a spokesperson. Other options include a 10 percent increase in the price of alcohol. Kyprianou has, however, hinted that he favors warning labels -- similar to those that appear on packs of cigarettes -- that make the dangers of alcohol clear. \"Drinking harms your unborn baby\" on bottles? Brewers and wine makers across Europe, however, have come out against placing \"Drinking Kills\" or other labels on bottles of beer. \"Warning labels are the completely wrong way to go,\" Peter Hahn, head of the German Brewers Association told Germany's Express newspaper. \"The do not deter people who have lost a sense of how much to drink and unsettle the people who enjoy a beer after work.\" Industry groups also opposed implementing EU-wide guidelines in countries with traditionally different ways of approaching drinking and drinking problems. \"Policies that do not consider cultural and regional differences, will fail to deal with the social problems, while at the same time generate a rising level of political objections,\" said Rodolphe de Looz-Corswarem of Brewers of Europe. Keeping social vices separate Green party EU parliamentarian Hiltrud Breyer meanwhile called on the alcohol industry to stop \"saber rattling\" before it sees the a final version of the EU's strategy to prevent alcohol abuse. German Consumer Affairs Minister Horst Seehofer said he would wait to see what Kyprianou's actual suggestions are before commenting. Other German politicians, however, were more willing to voice the opposition to putting a sip of wine on the same footing with a puff of a cigarette. \"People should not expect that a skull and crossbones end up on every bottle of beer and wine,\" German EU representative Karl-Heinz Florenz told Der Tagesspiegel newspaper, adding that when it comes to alcohol, each member state should be responsible for how it deals with alcohol abuse. The harm of \"passive drinking\" While cigarettes are a health risk from the first puff, moderate drinking can actually be healthy and there is no danger from \"passive drinking,\" Peter Liese, a German EU representative, told the paper. The commission's report disagreed with Liese's conclusion, saying alcohol abuse had a major role in as many as 200,000 deaths in Europe due to car accidents and disease and played a role in some 60,000 underweight births. The report also estimated the effects of alcohol abuse of costing the EU 125 billion euros ($161 billion) in 2003. Some 25 percent of men and 10 percent of women in Europe drink what the EU considers to be more than healthy amounts of alcohol and between 3 percent and 5 percent are suffering from alcoholism, according to EU statistics.",
        "generated_story": "German Brewers Association warns against \"passive drinking\" on bottles of beer The European Commission has warned about the dangers of drinking alcohol in the autumn, warning that it could lead to an increase in cases of alcohol poisoning. The warning comes as the European Union's president, Horst Seehofer, has said that alcohol can be used as a way to reduce the risk of an alcohol-related illness. \"We have to be very careful,\" he said in an interview with the German newspaper Der Tagesspiegel, adding that he was \"very concerned\" about alcohol's health effects on young people. According to Liese, the EU's head of public health, Markos Kyprianou, is a member of the Green party in Germany. He told the newspaper: \"I'm very concerned about this. I think it's a very dangerous thing to drink. It's not just alcohol, but alcohol as well.\" He added that \"alcohol is an important part of a healthy society, and it should not be taken for granted.\" \"It's very important that people have access to alcohol and that they have the right to consume it,\" said Liee. However, he added, \"we don't want people to think that drinking is bad for their health. We want to make sure that there is no harm to the health of people who drink alcohol.\" In 2003, a study by the London Institute for Alcohol Studies (LIA) found that the number of alcoholic drinks consumed in Europe was 161 billion euros. This is more than double the amount consumed by Germany in 2003. In addition, it was the first time that Germany had allowed alcohol to enter its territory without having to pay for it. Since then, there has been a rise in alcohol consumption, which has led to a surge in underage drinking. But this has not been the case in other European countries, such as France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Greece and the United Kingdom, where alcohol is banned. That is not to say that beer is the only thing that can cause a problem. There is also the issue of how much alcohol a young person can consume. For example, in a country with a high alcohol content of 125 billion Euros (125 billion euro) a year, people are drinking a lot more alcohol than they used to, according to German media. And that's in addition to what is already known as \"drinking alcohol,\" which is still illegal under EU law. So, what does this mean for the future of German beer? It means that more and more people will be able to enjoy it, even if they are underage. As a result, many of them will drink more beer than their parents, who have been drinking it for years, will have a hard time getting it out of their system. They will also be forced to stop drinking when they grow up. If they do, they won't be allowed to do so in their own home country. What do you think? Do you have any idea how many people drink beer in your own country? If so, why would you drink it? What does it taste like? Is it good for your health? Does it make you feel better? That's the question of whether or not you're drinking too much? The answer is, of course, that you should be drinking more, because you are not drinking enough. You're not going to get a good quality beer. Why is that? Because you can't drink enough beer, right? And you shouldn't have enough alcohol. How can you enjoy a beer without alcohol? You can only drink a glass of water, or a bottle of wine, at the very least, if you know what you want. Dieter Hahn, vice president of Germany's Brewers' Association, said he would like to see a reduction in beer consumption. Hiltrud Breyer, deputy director general for Europe, also said it would be a mistake to try to limit alcohol use. Lyinge's comments on the matter were not taken lightly, however, as he pointed out that most people do not drink the same amount as other people, especially those who do. His comments come in response to criticism from the Greens and other political parties. (Reuters, dpa, AFP, AP, Reuters)The German Brewers association has called for a ban on alcohol sales, saying it is \"a very good idea\" to ban the sale of all alcoholic beverages, rather than to sell it to minors. Not only is it a bad idea to have alcohol on your premises but also because it makes you sick. After all, alcohol has become a big problem for people with high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Alcohol is one of those things that makes people sick, so that is what the problem is. When it comes to drinking, this is exactly what we're talking about. No one knows what's going on in our society. Just ask your friends and family members who are suffering from alcohol addiction. People with alcohol are often the ones who suffer the most from alcoholism and alcohol abuse. Many of us are already know that"

        "target": "All or nothing for Bayern in Champions final Bayern Munich have one last chance to salvage a season that has otherwise been marked by their inability to beat Borussia Dortmund: a win against Chelsea in the Champions League final at their home stadium. All season long, Bayern Munich have been consumed with achieving one goal: reaching the final of the Champions League, held at their own Allianz Arena in Munich, and raising the trophy in front of their home fans. After finishing a distant second place to Dortmund in the Bundesliga and dismally losing to them 5-2 in the German Cup final, Bayern Munich are in a must-win situation Saturday against Chelsea. A loss would be the final straw in a disappointing season for a team that can't stand second place. A win for Bayern would mean redemption, to some extent, for their shortcomings in the league. Key players were rested down the stretch in the Bundesliga, especially before the two legs of Bayern's European semifinal against Real Madrid. That was an indication that Bayern had given up on the league and put all their eggs in one basket, hoping for a big payoff with the Champions League title. The same can be said for the German Cup final against Dortmund: true, Bayern essentially beat themselves by making mistake after mistake, but Bayern could, if they win Saturday, wipe the slate clean. Saving the season Win this match, and all will be forgiven in Munich. Lose, and it will be Bayern's second straight season without a piece of hardware, not to mention the heartbreak of losing the biggest match at Allianz Arena since it opened in 2005. \"We must not even think about [losing],\" said Bayern's Franck Ribery on Thursday. \"If we win the Champions League, then we can forget about not winning the league or the cup, nobody will care about that.\" Bayern are a team that thrives under pressure, and the high stakes of this match will be good for them. Chelsea are a team that showed in their semifinal upset of Barcelona that they can rise to a challenge, even if that challenge is simply holding on against a superior opponent. \"We are not the favorites of the game, we are playing away,\" Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech said on Thursday. \"It is very rare when you have the home team playing in the home stadium, using the home dressing room, so I think the advantage goes to Bayern Munich because of that. But we know we have a chance and we will fight for it.\" But this match will come down to the team that can better take advantage of holes that have been blown in each team's defense due to injuries and suspensions. Filling the gaps Between the two sides, seven starting players will miss out on the final. Chelsea saw Raul Meireles, Ramires, and Branislav Ivanovic each get their third yellow card in the second leg against Barcelona, and captain John Terry was given a straight red. Terry and Ivanovic are fixtures on Chelsea's backline, which was already at half-strength due to hamstring injuries suffered by Gary Cahill and David Luiz. Chelsea coach Roberto di Matteo hopes those two are fit enough for the final, since Chelsea will need all the help they can get in the back. For Bayern, David Alaba and Holger Badstuber - both defenders - and Luiz Gustavo, a defensive midfielder, are also suspended for picking up three yellow cards. The impact of the suspensions will hit Chelsea the most. In addition to a weakened back line, Meireles and Ramires are mainstays on offense, supporting strikers Didier Drogba or Fernando Torres. With Ramires out, Drogba could start as striker, with Torres moving to the wing. At any rate, there is more uncertainty in The Blues' lineup than there is in Bayern's, who will be able to rely on striker Mario Gomez and the dynamic-duo of Arjen Robben and Ribery on the wings as they have all season. Most of the question marks will still be defensive for both teams, but to think that this is an indication of a high-scoring affair on Saturday would be a discredit to both team's last lines of defense. Between the posts Neither side would be competing in the final if it wasn't for the heroics of the teams' keepers. Cech defended against wave after wave of attacks from Barcelona in the semifinal for Chelsea, and Manuel Neuer showed nerves of steel in Bayern's penalty shootout in the final leg against Real Madrid, blocking penalties from Madrid stars Cristiano Ronaldo and Kaka. Chelsea's best shot will be to come out of the gate at a sprint and gain an early advantage against Bayern, who will be doing everything they can to keep their long-cultivated dream-final in their control. Otherwise, Bayern's determination to salvage their season may be enough to carry them through to the trophy ceremony - at home, just like they planned it.

        "generated_story": "Bayern Munich beat Borussia Dortmund to reach Champions League final Bayern Munich's John Terry has been a key player in the Bundesliga this season. The German champions beat Chelsea 3-1 on Thursday in their first match of the season at Allianz Arena in Munich. Terry scored the only goal for Bayern, who have won three of their last four Bundesliga matches. He also had an assist for the winner against Real Madrid on Wednesday, when he was sent off for a second yellow card in a 1-0 defeat at the hands of Chelsea's David Luiz. \"It was a great moment for me,\" Terry said after the game. Bayern's goal was the difference between the two sides, with Terry scoring twice and David Alaba also scoring once. But it was Bayern who won the German Cup last season, beating Chelsea 4-3 on away goals. It was also the first time Bayern had won a Bundesliga title since 2005, and the second time in three years that they had reached the final. That's a lot to ask of a young player, but it's also a huge step up from last year's final, which was won by Cristiano Ronaldo's Manchester United. And that's not all that Bayern have to offer, either. They've already won two Bundesliga titles and three German Cups, the other two coming in 2005 and 2006. Last season's title was decided by a 2-2 draw at home to Chelsea, in which Chelsea had to beat Bayern twice to advance to the quarter-finals. This time, though, Bayern were able to win the title with a win over Chelsea and a draw against Bayern. In the last two games, they've won all three Bundesliga games and lost only once, to Bayern in 2006 and 2007. On Thursday, Chelsea won their third consecutive title, their fourth in as many years, while Bayern won its fourth title in five years. However, it wasn't enough to make Bayern the best side in all of Europe. At the very least, there's still a chance that Chelsea could win their fifth consecutive trophy, as they have been the most successful team in Bundesliga history. Chelsea coach Manuel Neuer said his side would be \"very fortunate\" to have a player like Terry in this position, given the fact that he is a former Bayern player who is now the head coach at Chelsea. Manchester City's Josep Maria Bartomeu, however, said he had no doubts about Terry's ability to be a top-four finisher in his first season in charge of his new club, adding that \"he's very good at his job.\" \"I'm very happy with the way he's playing,\" said Franck Ribery, a Bayern defender who has played every minute of every Bundesliga game since joining the Bavarian club in 2004. 'I can't say enough good things about him. I'm really happy for him, I can tell you that I think he'll be very, very pleased with his attitude and his work ethic,\" added Raul Meireles, an assistant coach with Bayern and former Chelsea player and coach of Germany's Under-21 team, Rina Goldenberg. For his part, Terry will be hoping for more than just a good result against Chelsea on Saturday. After all, he said, \"He's the man who's going to get the job done.\" But he also said that his team's best chance of winning the trophy will come when they face Chelsea at Old Trafford, where they will face the Blues on Sunday, on a day when Chelsea are expected to take on Bayern on the road to Wembley Stadium. If they do, then they'll have the chance to do it again, because they are the favorites to lift the league title next year. A lot of Bayern fans are looking forward to seeing what they can do with their new coach, Josef Maria Robben, after he took over the reins at Bayern last summer. With that in mind, we'll see what the future holds for Chelsea in terms of how they approach the next phase of European football. How long will it be before Chelsea can get back into the top flight? Bayern will need to find a way to avoid a repeat of that, especially if they want to keep their title hopes alive. Rafael van der Sar (Chelsea) is the coach and he knows how important it is for them to continue to improve their chances of reaching the knockout stages. His team is already in good shape, having won four consecutive league titles in Germany, Spain, Italy, France and Spain. Josev Torres is one of several Bayern players who could be on their way back to their best season since the end of 2005-06. Diego Costa is also on his way out of Dortmund's World Cup squad and will also be looking to extend their unbeaten run to a fourth consecutive Bundesliga campaign. David de Matteo has a big role to play in Europe's top division, too. Madrid's Diego Torres has already made it clear he wants to return to his former club. Barcelona's Mario Gomez is another big-league team and how long they're going forward."

Security forces are on high alert amid fears of unrest. UN leader Ban Ki-moon expressed \"deep regret\" on Monday that political leaders had failed to make progress on a constitution in Nepal, expressing concern about instability within the country. Security forces were put on high alert, with riot police patrolling streets after calls by the opposition for the resignation of Maoist Prime Minister Baburam Bhattarai. \"Nepal has entered an uncertain constitutional and political period,\" Ban warned in a statement read by his spokesman Martin Nesirky. \"The government and the political leaders, as well as leaders of various communities, need to demonstrate the courage and wisdom to come together to address the challenges the nation faces,\" the statement added. Repeated deadlines expired Politicians were to have agreed upon a new framework for the country's political future by Sunday. However, the representation of ethnic minorities and castes within a federal structure has proved a major sticking point in efforts to draw up a secular constitution. Bhattarai on Sunday said that parliament, elected in 2008 after a decade of civil war, would be disbanded after repeated deadlines had been broken. New elections are due to be held in November, but the opposition has criticized the premier's unilateral decision to call the poll. The country's Hindu monarchy, which ruled for centuries, was abolished after Maoist rebels gave up arms and won elections in 2008. Some 16,000 people died in the civil war between 1996 and 2006. rc/msh (AFP, AP)",
        "generated_story": "Nepalese elections in Nepal are in the midst of unrest, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has warned. Nepal's elections are set to take place in November, the UN said on Monday, adding that the country's political situation is in a state of crisis. The UN has called for a general election to be held by the end of the year, but has yet to set a date for the vote, which is scheduled for November. UN spokesman Martin Nesirky told reporters in Kathmandu that \"the country is facing a crisis of its own making.\" \"We are facing an unprecedented situation,\" Ban said. \"This is not the first time that Nepal has faced a political crisis,\" he added, referring to the 2008-09 Nepal earthquake that killed more than 1,000 people. Ban's warning came after a UN peacekeeping mission said it had been unable to reach a consensus on how to deal with the situation. He also said that it was too early to say whether the election would be a success or a failure. But he did say that if the elections were held, it would not be the last time Nepal would face a civil war. Bhattarai, who heads UN human rights office in New Delhi, said he was \"very concerned\" about the possibility of an election in which the government could be forced to step down. In the past, elections have been held every two to three years. Since then, however, there has been a series of political crises, including one between 1996 and 2006, when the Nepal government was in power, and the current one in 2006. This year's election is set for Nov. 6, a year after the previous one was held. It will be followed by a parliamentary election on Dec. 7. Many people are hoping for an early election, while others are worried about a possible military coup. There are also fears that a coup could come, as the military has ruled Nepal for decades. On Sunday, Ban issued a statement saying that he had no plans to hold another election until the new constitution was drafted. However, he also warned that there was no chance of a peaceful transition of power. Earlier this month, Nepal announced that elections would begin on November 6. According to UN figures, around 1.5 million people have registered to vote in elections since 1996, with a total of 2.3 million registered voters, according to figures from the United Nations (UN). Ban also called on the people of Nepal to demonstrate against the army and police, saying they should be allowed to exercise their right to free and fair elections. His words: \"I am not going to allow this to happen again. I will not allow it.\" The government has not said whether it will hold a referendum on whether or not it should allow a civilian government to rule in this country, or whether a military government should step in and take over the role of prime minister. That's not something that has ever been done before. At the same time, many people believe that democracy is the only way to solve the problems that have plagued Nepal since the collapse of democracy in 1996. And that's exactly what has happened to Nepal in recent years - that is, until now, no one knows what is going on. As a result of that, some of those who have not been able to get a fair shake of their heads have become disillusioned with their country and their government's policies. Some of these disillusionment with democracy, such as Ban, has led to a rise in violent protests against democracy and a crackdown on political parties. These are the reasons why the Nepaleses are so desperate for democracy. They want to make sure that they have a chance to win elections that are free, fair and transparent. After all, they want a change of government in their own country. So, if they can't get elected, then they will have to do so through a democratic process. If they don't, what will they do then? The country has a long history of violence, says Ban. A decade of civil unrest has left Nepal as a country with an authoritarian government. What is happening now is a very different situation than what it used to have in 2008 and 2008. How can democracy be achieved? In Nepal, for example, is it possible for people to live in peace and democracy? There is no way of knowing what the future holds for Nepal. No one has the power to decide what kind of elections will happen to them. Nor is there any way for them to achieve that. Why is this happening? What are we waiting for? Why are they waiting so long for elections? It's a question of how long will it take for governments to act? How long can they wait? After a decade or so, this is what we are waiting to see what happens. When the next election takes place, we will see the results of this election will depend on what they decide. One thing is for sure: They will need to find a new leader who is willing to stand up for themselves. Let's hope that will"

        "generated_story": "The European Court of Justice has ruled that it's permissible to resell software that has been illegally downloaded from a US computer. The European court of justice ruled on Tuesday that the software can be resealed even if it was downloaded by a computer from the US. \"This is a very important step in the right direction,\" the court said in a ruling that was handed down by the European Union's top court in Luxembourg. Oracle, Oracle and other software companies have been accused of illegally downloading software from US computers, including Oracle's Oracle operating system. In a landmark ruling, the EU's highest court ruled in favor of the companies, saying that they had no legal right to sell software without the consent of a court. It also said that reselling software would be illegal under EU law because it would violate the rights of users. Read more: EU court upholds EU decision to allow resellers to use Oracle software Oracle has said it can't sell its software, which it says is illegal to do so under the rules set out by European law. According to court rules, companies can only sell their software to customers who have paid for it, and not to those who do not have access to it. This is the first time that Oracle had made a legal claim against the company, according to German news agency dpa (AFP). The court's ruling comes as Oracle is facing a series of legal challenges over its use of Oracle-based software. One of those challenges is whether it is permissible for a company to store software on its servers without a license. Another challenge is to whether a software company can sell it to a third party, such as a reseller, without having to pay a licensing fee, or if a user has to buy it from another company in order to keep it on their servers. That's a big step for Oracle to take, as it has done with other companies that have used Oracle products, but it also raises questions about the legal status of software used by companies like Oracle. And it raises the question of whether Oracle should be allowed to re-enter the market, given that most of its customers don't have the same rights as the original software they were using. At the end of Tuesday's hearing, a judge said Oracle would have to make a decision on whether or not it should reseve software it had bought from an American computer vendor, rather than using it as part of an ongoing legal battle over the legality of resealing software for profit. But Oracle did not immediately respond to an interview request for comment on the ruling. Earlier this week Oracle filed a motion to dismiss the case, arguing that there was no basis for the decision, citing a lack of evidence to back up its claims. A court ruling by Luxembourg's Supreme Court, however, has also raised the possibility that a case against Oracle could be brought before a lower court, if Oracle were to be found to have violated EU antitrust law by selling software in violation of EU rules. Reuters, AFP, Reuters and the Associated Press (dpa) have also reported that an appeal was filed by Oracle against an earlier ruling in which the German court had rejected the request, with Oracle saying Oracle was not liable for any damages because the firm's software had not been used in any legal proceedings. However, an appeals court also ruled against Microsoft and Oracle for failing to comply with EU laws. Microsoft, for example, had argued that Microsoft should not be able to sue Oracle over software sales practices that violate European laws, because they are not legally binding on companies to provide software licenses to their customers. Apple, Google, Apple and Microsoft have all said they would not do that, despite the fact that their products are available to the public. Amazon, Dell and IBM are the only companies in Europe that sell Oracle systems and products that are widely used. Google has not responded to requests for an opinion on this issue, while Microsoft has refused to comment. IBM has denied the allegations and said the matter is still pending before the lower courts. US courts are expected to rule on Wednesday, adding that \"it is not a matter of law to decide whether Microsoft or Oracle are responsible for its own software.\" Oracle also denied a request from Luxembourg to share its data with the courts, claiming that its products were not available for sale and that software was being sold to third parties. Both companies are currently facing legal action in Germany, Luxembourg and Luxembourg, where it owns a large number of patents and trademarks, in addition to its trademarks and intellectual property rights. German courts have already rejected a similar request. European courts also rejected an application from Oracle in June, when it came out of court on Monday. EU courts had previously rejected similar claims by US and US law firms that had sought to block the sale of Microsoft products and services.

The Curiosity rover will soon re-start its sluggish search for signs of life. NASA's Mars rover, \"Curiosity,\" will wrap up a lengthy self-testing phase on Thursday, freeing it up to continue exploring the surface of the Red Planet. Mission manager Jennifer Tropser told reporters in a conference call on Wednesday evening that the plan, once the final checks were completed, was to \"drive, drive, drive\" until Curiosity discovers a rock suitable for analysis. She added that the instrument checks have delivered positive results. \"Through every phase of the check-out, Curiosity has performed almost flawlessly,\" Tropser said. \"The success so far of these activities has been outstanding.\" Many of the tests have concerned Curiosity's robotic arm. The 2.1-meter (7-feet) appendage will be used to pick out and sample rocks and soil. NASA is investigating whether Mars can sustain life, or whether it could in the past. The tests were designed to identify any damage sustained during its interplanetary flight and also to ensure that the arm still functioned properly on Mars, with its different temperatures and gravity. The Mars rover landed in the giant Gale Crater, near the Martian equator, on August 5; it has so far moved about 109 meters within the crater. The rover is traveling east, heading first to an intersection called Glenelg, where three types of terrain meet. This is likely to be the location for the first rock and soil samples, though NASA said Curiosity was unlikely to arrive there for several weeks. Curiosity's ultimate destination is the nearby Aeolis Mons or Mount Sharp, a 3-mile-high mound of rock rising out of the crater. Mount Sharp is about 4.3 miles (7 kilometers) away from Curiosity's landing site. The $2.5-billion (1.93-billion-euro) six-wheeled rolling science lab is designed to last two years in order to complete its Mars mission. msh/jm (AFP, AP, Reuters)",
        "generated_story": "Curiosity's self-testing has been a success - and so far, so good - NASA astronaut Jennifer Tropser says the Mars rover Curiosity has had a successful two-year mission to the Red Planet. The rover, which was launched on August 5, has already tested the Martian soil on Mount Sharp and Aeolis Mons, the planet's highest point on the red planet. \"The rover has done a very good job of testing the soil,\" she told reporters on Wednesday, adding that the rover had been able to get a good feel for the surface of Mars. It has also tested water samples from the Gale Crater, a key landing spot on Mars, and collected the results of a series of water tests. Analysts say the probe has a \"very good chance\" of being successful -- and that it will continue to do so for at least two more years. According to NASA's JPL-Calgary laboratory, it is the first of its kind on Earth to test its water-borne instruments, with the second test taking place on Thursday evening. In addition to testing soil samples, Curiosity is also testing samples of rock samples collected by the Curiosity rover in the southern hemisphere of Earth's Mars quadrangle, near the base of the island of Aeoli Mons. On Thursday, NASA announced it had launched a new rover to study Mars' surface, calling it the \"most promising rover ever to be sent to Mars.\" The mission, launched by NASA in 2012, is expected to take up to two years to complete. Its mission is being led by a team of scientists from Glenelg and the University of California, Davis, who have been working on it for a year and a half. They hope to find a rover that can carry out the tests and then send the samples back to Earth, where they will be tested on land and in water. If the test results are positive, they could be used to determine whether the spacecraft is capable of reaching Mars on its own, or if it can be carried out in a laboratory setting on a Mars-based platform. But it's not clear how long the mission will take to reach Mars -- or how much time will it take for Curiosity to achieve its mission goals. For now, researchers are hoping to see if Curiosity can get the most out of it, but they are still waiting to hear back from NASA. So far the team has conducted a number of tests, including one that has led to a positive result for Mars and one in which it has successfully tested a water sample from a rock sample. And they're hoping that they can use that sample to assess the impact of Curiosity's water test on future Mars missions -- which is due to launch on September 5.

(Reuters, AP, AFP, Reuters)NASA has launched its first Mars lander, based on data collected from Gale craters, in Chile and Chile. Scientists have said they expect it to land at the same site in about two weeks. However, there is still a lot of uncertainty about whether Curiosity will land there, as the ground is too rocky and rocky for landers to travel on. At the moment, scientists are not sure how far Mars will go, although they say it could take a couple of years before Mars can reach its surface. That could change, however, given the fact that Mars is a relatively small planet and there are currently no active volcanoes on this planet, such as Mars itself. There is no sign of an active volcano or a volcano that could erupt in an eruption, even if the weather is forecast to remain dry for some time. Experts say Mars could still be a hot spot for more than 2.5 billion cubic meters (1.93-billion euros) of liquid water, according to an analysis by Reuters. This would be the largest test ever conducted by an international team since NASA launched Curiosity in 2009, when it was first launched in 2006. More than 1.7 billion euros ($2.6 billion) is needed to confirm the findings of this test, experts say. Some experts believe that this is an important step in its quest to discover Mars beyond the reach of humans. Researchers are also optimistic about the potential for success, though they don't yet know for sure. Many experts are skeptical about its success rate. One expert said that a large part of that is likely to depend on how well the experiment is going to work. Another expert told Reuters that \"it's still very early days in Mars,\" which could lead to further testing. Author: J.J. Tropper (AFP/Reuters)"

        "target": "A borderline war The crisis in Syria is in danger of drawing in neighboring countries. Despite the Syrian government's immediate apology, the shelling on the Turkish border has led to concerns about possible escalation. These weren't the first incidents on the Syrian-Turkish border, but the fact that several people on the Turkish side were killed by Syrian shells on Wednesday (03.10.2012) has brought the conflict between the two countries to a new level. It has led the Turkish military to retaliate for the first time. Several people were killed when Turkey shelled Syrian territory. But neither Turkey, which is a member of NATO, nor Syria would benefit from a broader conflict. An adviser to the Turkish president tweeted, \"Turkey has no interest in a war with Syria.\" Volker Perthes, director of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs in Berlin, agrees: \"Assad has no interest in an escalation,\" he told DW. \"That can be seen from the fact that the Syrian information minister apologized and expressed his regret over the victims immediately after the attack on Turkish territory.\" Perthes doesn't think it's likely that the Syrian President, Bashar Assad, wants to provoke Turkey to intervene in Syria. \"That would only accelerate the fall of his regime,\" he said. It's not yet clear who was responsible for the shelling. According to Syria's ally, Russia, it was a \"tragic accident.\" Relationship damaged The armed incidents on the Syrian-Turkish border have been going on for months. According to Amnesty International, some 300,000 Syrians have left their country since the start of the uprising against Assad, and many of them have fled to Turkey. The relationship between the two countries, which used to be close, has deteriorated dramatically, and the Turkish government is now openly supporting the Syrian opposition. \"Turkey is itself a player in the Syrian conflict,\" said Perthes. \"It provides shelter for many refugees and it's through Turkey that supplies come for the opposition.\" NATO has lined up behind Turkey and told Syria to end its \"flagrant violations of international law.\" Call for 'great discretion' The German chancellor, Angel Merkel, has also positioned herself alongside Turkey. \"We call on all parties to show great discretion,\" she said in Berlin. The foreign minister, Guido Westerwelle, declared that everything must be done to deescalate the situation, so that the Syrian conflict did not turn into a conflagration in the region. Indeed, the Syrian crisis is not only spreading to Turkey, but also to Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon. According to Perthes, \"The neighboring countries are partly victims and partly instigators. Jordan too has taken in refugees and supplies the rebels. On the other hand, Iraq has tended to support the government of Bashar Assad.\" Even so, he said, all the neighboring countries had an interest in ensuring the conflict was confined to Syria. Appeal to the international community But the number of Syrian refugees is rising by the day. Ruth J\u00fcttner, a Middle East expert with Amnesty International, believes this will continue in future months. \"It's important that the countries bordering on Syria are supported by the international community in providing accommodation, medical and psychological care and schooling for children,\" she told DW. It's an appeal she directs especially to European countries. The shelling on the Syrian-Turkish border has made it more likely that there will be armed conflict between Syria and its neighbors. According to Perthes, \"It's probably the case that political resistance in Turkey to intervention in Syria is decreasing right now.\"",
        "generated_story": "Turkey's response to the Syrian-Turkish conflict is \"not likely\" Germany's Foreign Minister Volker Perthes said on Wednesday that Turkey's military intervention in Syria was not likely. \"Turkey is not going to intervene militarily,\" he told reporters in Berlin. The German Foreign Ministry said in a statement that it was \"very unlikely\" that the Turkish military would take action against Syrian President Bashar Assad, who has been fighting alongside his regime for months in the country's eastern province of Aleppo since the start of the civil war in 2011. According to German foreign ministry spokesman Guido Westerwelle, Turkish troops have been deployed to Syria, but they have not been able to reach the besieged Syrian city of Raqqa, which is under the control of Assad's regime. In addition, the military has not yet taken any action on the ground against the regime of President Assad. On Wednesday (03.10.2012), the German Institute for International and Security Affairs (IISS) said Turkey was unlikely to act in any way to prevent the conflict from spreading to other parts of Syria. However, it also said it would be possible for Turkey to step up its military response if it had to, as it has done in recent months, in order to stop the flow of refugees from Syria to neighboring Jordan and Lebanon. Author: Ruth J\u00fcttner, DW/AFP/Getty Images Germany has called on Ankara to \"act decisively and decisively\" against Syria's government, saying it should not intervene in its own internal affairs. It has also called for the withdrawal of Syrian troops from the border with Jordan, according to a report by Amnesty International, a non-governmental organization based in Jordan. Turkey, however, has so far refused to do so, calling it an \"invasion\" of its sovereignty and territorial integrity. But it is also not the first time that this has happened. Last year, Turkey sent troops into Syria in an attempt to clear the way for Assad to return to power. Since then, Ankara has responded with a series of airstrikes, shelling and airstrikes that have killed hundreds of civilians. At the same time, Russia, Iran and Turkey have also stepped up air strikes on Syrian territory, while the United States, Britain, France, Germany and the European Union (EU) have all stepped in to help Syrian government forces in their fight against a resurgent Syrian army. Germany, for its part, is the only country in Europe that is willing to take part in this kind of action, with the help of NATO and other international organizations, including the International Criminal Court (ICC). The EU has warned that if Turkey does not act immediately, then it will have to be prepared for a long-term escalation of violence. EU member states are also likely to respond to this situation, EU foreign ministers have said, adding that they do not want to escalate the situation further. Meanwhile, some EU countries have expressed concern about the role of Turkey in Syrian conflict, such as Russia and China. Foreign ministers are expected to meet with Turkish Prime Minister Angel Merkel on Thursday in Brussels to discuss the future of relations between the two countries. Russia has said that Ankara should take a more active role in resolving the Syria crisis, and that its role would not be limited to Russia's role as a mediator in negotiations with Damascus. Moscow, meanwhile, says it wants to avoid a confrontation with Turkey over the issue of territorial claims by the Assad regime, despite the fact that Syria is a member of a NATO-led coalition of countries that are currently in conflict with Iran, Iraq and Iran. This could lead to an escalation in tensions between Ankara and Damascus, if the US and Russia are unable to agree on a ceasefire, or even a deal on how to resolve the ongoing Syrian crisis. For now, though, there is no agreement on what Turkey should do in terms of how long the war will last and whether it can be resolved. Read more: Turkey and Syria: What is Turkey doing with Syria? What are the consequences of this conflict? The Turkish government's position on Syria has already been criticized by some observers, especially in Germany. They say it's not a good idea to start a new war, given that there are so many people who are not ready to give up their positions. That is, they say, because of what they see as the lack of cooperation between Moscow and Ankara. So far, so good, that's exactly what the EU is doing. There is little doubt that Germany is prepared to cooperate with Ankara on this issue. I think the most important thing is that we will continue to work together with Russia to try to find a way out of it. We have a lot of good news for both sides. As for Syria itself, we think it could be a very good thing that Russia will do something about it, at least for now. After all, this is an important step toward a peaceful resolution. What do you think about this? Is it really a matter of time before a resolution is reached? In the end, I don't think this will be an effective? I"

Monday's announcement by Pat McQuaid, the president of the International Cycling Union, ratified recommendations in an October report from the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), which ordered Armstrong's Tour de France titles be wiped out. \"Lance Armstrong has no place in cycling,\" said McQuaid. Addressing his remarks to cyclists, McQuaid said the fight against doping was his priority. \"UCI is listening and is on your side. We\u2019ve come too far in the fight against doping to return to our past. Cycling has a future and something like this must not happen again.\" The scathing USADA report included testimony from 11 former teammates, accusing Armstrong of running the \"most sophisticated\" doping program in the sport's history. The USADA said it had collected evidence to prove the seven-time Tour de France winner had engaged in the biggest doping conspiracy to date. Effect on cycling and sponsorship Monday's decision comes as the sport of cycling reels from Armstrong's well-documented fall from grace. Organizers of the Tour de France will be trying to move on from the scandal as the race prepares to celebrate its centenary next year. Sponsors have been deserting Armstrong and the sport in general. Last week, Nike - one of Armstrong's main corporate sponsors - said it was terminating its relationship with the cyclist and accused him of deception. Trek, the company that made the bicycles Armstrong rode to seven titles, announced on the same day it would terminate its sponsorship contract - as did the beer maker Anheuser-Busch. The Dutch institution Rabobank ended its association with professional cycling after the doping allegations came to light, leaving 17 riders in need of a sponsor. Last week Armstrong also announced he would step down from his own charity, the Lance Armstrong Foundation, also known as Livestrong, a move believed to have been intended to limit the damage to the organization from the USADA report.

        "generated_story": "Lance Armstrong stripped of Tour de France titles by USADA Lance Armstrong has been stripped by the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) for doping. The American cyclist was stripped on Monday of his Tour of France title after he tested positive for a banned substance in October. Armstrong, who had been banned from cycling for three years, was handed a one-year ban from competing in the event. He was banned for one year for failing to meet the anti-doping standards set out in his doping policy. \"I am not aware of any doping in cycling,\" Armstrong said in a statement released by his foundation, which is based in Houston, Texas, and which he founded with his wife, Pat McQuaid (pictured), in September 2016. Mc Quaid, Armstrong's former coach at Rabobank, told the Houston Chronicle that he was \"very disappointed\" to be stripped from his cycling title. However, he added that \"it was a very difficult and difficult couple of weeks\" for Armstrong and his team. In October, the team had won the Tour and the World Championships, but in November, they lost their Tour titles to Armstrong after Armstrong failed a drug test. This year, it was the first time that Armstrong had failed to win a race since 2006, when he finished fourth at the 2012 Paris Olympics in France. His team, Team Sky, has also lost two of their three races since then, including the 2015 Tour, in which Armstrong won three of the four stages and finished second in both stages. On Monday, a court in Texas stripped Armstrong of all his titles and stripped him of two more, saying he did not have the proper credentials to compete in an event that was scheduled to take place on the same day as the Paris-Roubaix. According to the International Cycling Union (IUCI), the sport's governing body, \"the sport of cycling is not a sport for the faint of heart.\" The IUCU said it would appeal the decision, adding that it had \"no choice but to appeal.\" \"We are not going to make any further comment on this,\" the organization said on its Facebook page. It also said that the UCI would not sanction Armstrong if he failed the test, citing \"a lack of evidence\" and \"an inability to prove his innocence.\" Armstrong is also not the only cyclist to have failed tests, according to a report in The New York Times. A number of other riders have also been suspended from the race after testing positive. Among them, Lance's team-mates, Nike, Garmin and Trek, have all had positive results from their tests. Team-mate Pat McGrath, meanwhile, said he had not seen any evidence of doping at all during his time with Armstrong. 'We have no evidence that we have any proof of anything,' he said, referring to an incident at a cycling event last year when Armstrong was injured by a car while training for an Olympic cycling race in Brazil. But he also pointed out that there was no indication that doping had taken place at his home country of Texas and that his family was involved in any way, as well as in other countries, such as Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand or the Netherlands. That's not to say he didn't have a problem with doping, though, because he is a professional cyclist and he has a good track record of doing so. After all, his father was an avid cyclist. And he's a former cyclist, too. When he retired from racing in 2009, McGraths was also a cyclist who was known for his speed and endurance. Now he trains with a team of professional cyclists and is now a retired professional rider. With the aid of a pair of Nike trainers, this is his first professional cycling team and a new coach. Both of them have been given the opportunity to train with him, with the aim of helping him to improve his fitness and fitness levels. They are currently training with their new company, Trek.

Lance is currently working on his comeback from a knee injury, after suffering a back injury during the 2014 Tour. Speaking to reporters on Sunday, I asked him about his experiences with cycling and how he felt about the recent doping scandal and whether he would be able to continue his career.

        "target": "Bayern blast five as Schalke draw Bayern Munich stamped their authority over the Bundesliga on Saturday, with a ruthless 5-0 drubbing of Hannover at home. Meanwhile, second-placed Schalke and third-placed Frankfurt were forced to share the points. With many critics saying Bayern might as well be given the giant Bundesliga dish already, perhaps the struggle for second is shaping up to be the more compelling battle. But Saturday afternoon's clash between second-placed Schalke and third-placed Frankfurt did not take a decisive turn, with the game ending in a 1-1 draw. Schalke drew first blood in the 11th minute, when Frankfurt's Stefan Aigner was dispossessed in midfield, and Lewis Holtby released Klaas-Jan Huntelaar in front of goal - the Dutchman's first in the Bundesliga since September. But the hapless Aigner waited just over 100 seconds to make amends for his error, when the Royal Blues allowed him a free header that left goalkeeper Lars Unnerstall with no chance. But neither side could make inroads in the second half, which allowed Dortmund to leap-frog both sides and claim second place. Bayern take command Meanwhile the imperious Bayern Munich dispelled any talk of winter form-dip - following last week's draw to Nuremberg - with a brutally efficient 5-0 win at home to Hannover. The Bavarians stormed to a 3-0 lead in just 37 minutes, celebrating a nifty overhead kick for star signing Javi Martinez in the fourth minute. Toni Kroos and Franck Ribery scored the next two against a Hannover side that were torn open at will. The overhead kick was the first for the 40-million-euro ($52-million) signing Martinez, and in the second half new defender Dante also opened his account with a straightforward header from a Kroos free-kick. The festival of football continued just four minutes later, when Mario Gomez - making first Bundesliga appearance of the season - slammed the ball into the net from a tight angle just 30 seconds after replacing Mario Mandzukic. Dortmund win The champions Dortmund, meanwhile, are still nine points behind Bayern after beating Mainz 2-1 away. It was a potentially tricky fixture in the town where J\u00fcrgen Klopp began his coaching career, and Mainz showed their brilliance in the fourth minute, when Elkin Soto knocked a dream ball into the path of Marco Caligiuri, whose volley fairly screamed into the top right corner. Dortmund's own star-Marco - national team player Marco Reus - leveled the scores just eight minutes later. Reus worked himself some room at the outer edge of the penalty area, and slotted a beautiful 17-meter effort into the far corner. And Dortmund's second goal, just before half-time, was equally aesthetic - a vertical ball bisected the Mainz defense perfectly down the middle, where Polish predator Robert Lewandowski got his eighth league goal of the season with a deft lob over the onrushing Christian Wetklo in goal. Allofs' homecoming Bremen's 1-1 draw at Wolfsburg had a special frisson of its own, as Wolfsburg's newly-minted sporting director Klaus Allofs faced the club he had served as general manager for over a decade. And there was some gesticulating from the Bremen bench in the general direction of the Wolfsburg management when the guests took the lead in the 35th minute. Just seconds after Wolfsburg missed several chances, Marko Arnautovic was left free in the box after Eljero Elia found space on the left and cut the ball back for the Austrian to finish. But Wolfsburg got their own back in the second half. In the 62th minute, Bremen were reduced to ten men when Lukas Schmitz was given second yellow card for a hard tackle on Adelino Vieirinha. Just two minutes later, Bas Dost took advantage of their guests' disorgnaization and smashed the ball into the goal after neat piece of play from Vieirinha. Dirty derby The Franconian derby between Greuther F\u00fcrth and Nuremberg was a cagey affair that ended in a frustrating 0-0 draw. The first half was marked mainly by a straight red card for Nuremberg's Markus Feulner after an ugly, flying lunge on Stephan F\u00fcrstner. But the home side's numerical advantage was short-lived - Sercan Sararer was also sent for an early ice bath after his high elbow on Javier Pinola was adjudged worthy of a second yellow card in the 61st minute.

The Bavarians, who have won their last two Bundesliga matches, are looking to build on their impressive start to the new season. They have a chance to win the league for the first time since the end of last season, but they will have to wait until the last minute to make up their mind about their future. For the second time in as many years, they have had to settle for a place at the top of their division. But they are not going to be able to do that in September, when they face Hannover at home. That's because they don't have the best goalkeeper in Germany, and they can't afford to lose their best player. And that's not the only reason why Bayern are so desperate to get back into the Champions League. It's also the reason that they've been so successful so far in this competition. \"We've had a lot of good luck,\" said Bayern coach J\u00fcrgen Klopp, adding that he was \"very pleased\" with the way his side had responded to a challenge from the visitors. However, it was the Dutchman who made the most of his opportunity. In the 11th minute, he took the ball into his own box and scored the equalizer. After that, the hosts were on the verge of a shock, as they were unable to find a way past the German keeper. Bayern, meanwhile, have been on a tear in recent weeks, having lost their opening two games in a row. On Saturday, however, their form has picked up a bit more, with their new goalkeeper, Stefan Aigner, making his first Bundesliga start in over a decade. At the same time, Bayern have struggled to cope with a lack of quality in their own half, which has seen them struggle to keep up with top-flight sides like Mainz, Hannovers and Bremen. With the exception of Javi Martinez, a Bayern player who has been in charge for more than two decades, has struggled for form. He's been struggling to adapt to his new role as a right-back and has had little success in that role. Last season's Bundesliga title was won by the Royal Blues of Bavaria, in which they won the title by a point and a half. This year's title is a little different, though, thanks in large part to their star striker, Toni Kroos. As well as the fact that the reigning Bundesliga champions have not won a single league title since 2011-12, there are also a number of players who are still in contention for that position, including the likes of Mario Mandzukic and Klaas-Jan Huntelaar. Germany's most expensive player is now a free-kick specialist, whose contract with Bayern expires in 2019. His contract is up for renewal in 2020. If he's to play again, his contract will expire in 2021. A player with his current club, Nuremberg, is expected to sign a new contract in January. Reus said he would like to see the club's new coach, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, take over the reins of Bayern's coaching staff next year, if he can find the right fit for his role in future seasons. When he does, that would be a great opportunity for him to take a step back and make a change of scenery. So far, so good. Just two minutes later, Vos is the man to step up his game and get the job done for Bayern. Only a few weeks after his return from a knee injury, German defender Stefan Unerstall has returned to Germany to help him recover from an ankle injury that has kept him out of action for just over two months. Vozili has also been a key player in his team's last three Bundesliga games, scoring four goals in all competitions this season and scoring one goal in each of them. How will he recover? \"I think we'll see how he recovers from his injury,\" he said. 'He's a very good player and I'm really looking forward to seeing him back in action again next season.\" \"He'll be ready to contribute to our team,\" Jurgen Klopp said after Saturday's match against Wolfs. I think he'll have an opportunity to prove himself as well, because he knows how important it is to him and his players are to stay fit and healthy and fit, too.\" He added: \"If he doesn't get injured, then he won't be too worried about the future of this team. We're not too concerned about his future in Munich. You can see why the team is so much better than the current squad. There's no doubt about that. Allofs has a good chance of making a return to Bundesliga action, even if it's just a matter of time before he gets injured again. Even if that means he has to miss the next two matches. What's more important than a couple of course"

        "target": "Is China seeking regime-change in North Korea? The sudden reduction in aggressive rhetoric and actions by North Korea has led to suggestions that Pyongyang has realized it has pushed its only ally in the region to the brink of severing its friendship. The announcement in Pyongyang on May 13 of the promotion of Jang Jong-nam to \"minister of the People's Armed Forces\" came out of the blue. Until recently, the little-known commander of an army corps in coastal Kangwon Province, Jang has replaced Kim Kyok-sik, a four-star general with a long track record of loyal service to the regime. The reasons for 70-year-old Kim's replacement are not clear - as with most of the political maneuvers in North Korea - but it may have been his loyalty that cost him his position in the politburo. Kim was widely seen as a hawk in the regime and is believed to have been in command of the operation to shell the South Korean island of Yeonpyeongdo in November 2010, an incident that killed four people, destroyed civilians' homes and infrastructure and dramatically worsened the already strained relationship between Pyongyang and Seoul. By sacrificing Kim, analysts believe, North Korea is signaling that it is backing away from the confrontational stance it adopted after the United Nations imposed new sanctions in the wake of the nation's third underground nuclear test in February. And there are other indicators that Pyongyang is seeking to return to the status quo. The North's troops have been permitted to step down from the highest state of preparedness for war that was initially ordered when South Korea and the US began a series of annual military exercises. Missiles withdrawn Similarly, two Musudan intermediate-range missiles that were identified as being on mobile launchers being operated in eastern areas of the country have apparently been ordered to return to base. In late April, there was concern that test-launches of the missiles would be a further escalation by Kim Jong-un's government and a message that it would not bow to international pressure to halt its nuclear and missile development programs. But the analysts believe the tokens of Pyongyang's goodwill have come too late. \"For the North Korean leader, this is a very difficult time,\" Toshimitsu Shigemura, a professor at Tokyo's Waseda University and an authority on North Korean affairs, told DW. \"Timing is very important here and it is possible that China is moving to abandon Kim Jong-un. The atmosphere between the two nations is changing. China may have decided that it is time for a regime-change in the North, they will not permit the collapse of the country because they do not want chaos on their own borders.\" Further evidence that Beijing is slowly tightening the screw on its erstwhile ally comes as more state-run financial institutions sever their links with banks in North Korea. The latest institution to adhere to the government's orders to halt transactions across the border is the Bank of China, one of the four major banks in the country, which announced on May 7 that it would cease dealings with the Foreign Trade Bank of North Korea, which has been identified as being involved in Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs. Contingency plan in place Intelligence sources have passed on to DW information that Beijing has a contingency plan in place for when Kim Jong-un's control over the country crumbles. The reports confirm that China is indeed quietly encouraging regime change and is grooming Kim's brother, Kim Jong-nam to take over his role. At 42, Kim Jong-nam is the oldest son of Kim Jong-il, the dictator who ruled North Korea with an iron fist for 17 years until his sudden death in December 2011. Kim Jong-nam had been expected to assume the leadership after his father's death, but fell from favor spectacularly in 2001 when he was detained with two women and a boy aged 4 at Tokyo's Narita International Airport travelling on a forged Dominican Republic passport. He later admitted that he had wanted to visit Disneyland. He subsequently lived in Macau and Beijing, under the close watch of the Chinese authorities. The reports suggest that after Kim Jong-nam is installed in Pyongyang, his brother will be permitted to go into exile, probably in China. The tactic is not without its pitfalls, however, in part due to the efficiency of the campaign to deify their young leader as the future of the nation. Kim Jong-nam as 'new king' \"China may be dreaming of appointing Kim Jong-nam as the new king - and he is more preferable to the West than Kim Jong Un - but the problem is that he is not known in North Korea,\" said Ken Kato, director of Tokyo-based Human Rights in Asia. \"Many people in Japan know much about the North Korean 'Royal Family,' but this information is hidden in North Korea,\" he said. \"Even residents of Pyongyang know very little about Kim Jong-nam.\" Yet the reports are gaining credence among North Korea-watchers. Jun Okumura, a political analyst with the Eurasia Group, told DW that North Korea withdrawing",
        "generated_story": "North Korea's 'new king' Kim Jong-un has become the world's most powerful man, according to human rights experts. The North Korean leader, Kim Kyok-sik, was born on May 7, 2001, in Pyongyang, North Korea. He was the first person to be born in the country's capital, Pyongyang. Since then, he has been the leader of the People's Armed Forces (PAS), the military and the ruling Communist Party of Korea (KP), which has ruled the North since the 1950-53 Korean War. In his first official address to the nation's parliament in December 2011, the new leader said: \"I am a man of my word, and I am not afraid to speak my mind. I have no doubt that I will be able to tell you what I want to say to you.\" He also said that he would like to see his son, Jang, take over as head of state. According to Okumura, who has lived in Seoul for 17 years, \"Kim is the most important person in my life.\" \"He is my father, my grandfather and my great-grandfather,\" he said. \"My father is also my stepfather. My grandfather is Kim's father and grandfather was his father. We are very close to him and we have a great respect for him.\" The new ruler, however, has a long history with his country. On May 6, 2016, a court sentenced Kim to life in prison for the murder of his wife and two children in a car accident. Kim was sentenced to death in February 2011 for murder and attempted murder. His wife was later released from prison in November 2010, but he was released on parole in January 2011 after serving a 17-year prison sentence for kidnapping, torture and other crimes. After Kim fled to South Korea, his family was forced to flee to China, where he had been living in exile for more than a decade. When he returned to his home country, they said he died of a heart attack in his hometown of Yeonpyeongdo, near the border with the United States. But the court ruled that his death was not politically motivated and ordered him to face the death penalty. It also ordered the release of all his relatives, including his mother and step-father, as well as his brother and sister-in-law. As for Kim, it's unclear whether he is still alive or if he's still suffering from a mental illness. If so, there's no reason to believe he won't be re-elected to a second term in office. For now, though, that's the only hope he'll have for a future in which he can return to power. That's because he will have the power to change the course of history, not just the way he sees it. Last year, when he took office as president of South Korean state-run Waseda University, an independent think tank, published a report calling for an end to Pyongyang's nuclear and missile tests. Author: Toshimitsu Shigemura The Eurasia Group, based in Tokyo, said the report was based on the findings of an investigation by the International Court of Arbitration for Human Rights in Asia (ICRA). The report's author, Ken Kato, added that the study was conducted by experts from the ECHR, which is based at the University of Tokyo in Japan. They also found that Kim is a \"highly intelligent, well-educated and highly educated man who can understand the complexities of life and how to deal with a situation like this,\" and said it was \"very difficult to find a way to make a decision that would not lead to an escalation of tensions between the two countries.\" In the meantime, experts in China and Japan have been working closely with Kim and his government to try and find ways to improve relations between Pyongyang and Beijing. So far, so good. However, their work has not led to any major breakthroughs in relations with Beijing, Seoul, Beijing or Washington. At the same time, China has made a number of changes to its foreign policy. One of those changes is that it is no longer willing to give up its nuclear weapons. This is not the case for Pyongyang to develop its own nuclear arsenal. Instead, this is only the beginning. Pyongyang is looking to expand its arsenal of nuclear bombs and missiles. And it will not be the end of its weapons program. There's a lot of pressure on Beijing to do so. From the outside, I don't think there is much that can be done about the nuclear issue. North Koreans are not going to get rid of their weapons until they are ready to use them. To do that, you have to understand that they will need to have their own weapons in order to achieve their goal of denuclearization. With the help of China's military, Japan and China have agreed to cooperate on a range of issues related to nuclear disarmament, such as the deployment of missiles and ballistic missile defense systems. A new nuclear weapon is currently being developed in South"

        "target": "UK lawmakers propose jail sentences for reckless bankers A British parliamentary commission has completed its work on the overhaul of the domestic banking sector. Among other things, it proposed jail terms for bankers displaying grave malpractice and causing huge damage. Members of the UK's Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards agreed Wednesday that Britain needed a radical overhaul of its scandal-hit lenders. The panel, which was mostly composed of lawmakers, concluded in its final report that senior bankers must be made personally responsible for malpractice through the introduction of a new criminal offence of reckless misconduct. It would carry a prison sentence. The reputation of the country's banking sector had been damaged in recent years by a string of scandals, including Libor rate-rigging, credit insurance mis-selling and a controversy over staff behavior and bonuses in the run-up to the 2008 global financial crisis. The level of malpractice had been \"shocking and widespread,\" said the commission's chairman, Conservative party lawmaker Andrew Tyrie. RBS cut in two? \"Taxpayers and customers have lost out, and the economy has suffered,\" the 500-page report said. \"Under our recommendations, senior bankers who seriously damage their banks or put taxpayers' money at risk can expect to be fined, banned from the industry or in the worst cases go to jail.\" The commission called for bankers to sign up to a new code of conduct under which all key responsibilities within a bank would be assigned to specific senior officials who would be held responsible. The panel also proposed that more remuneration for bankers should be deferred for longer periods of up to ten years in order to \"reflect the longer run balance between business risks and rewards.\" The commission recommended that the government consider splitting the state-rescued Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) into a good bank and a bad one mopping up toxic assets. The report was published ahead of a key speech by Finance Minister George Osborne on his bank reform plans. hg/ipj (AFP, Reuters)",
        "generated_story": "Bank Mafia: A British Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards has recommended that the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) be fined up to ten years for manipulating Libor, the benchmark interest rate for banks. The commission's chairman, Andrew Tyrie, said the bank was being unfairly penalized by the government. \"It's a very serious matter,\" he said in a statement. RBS is one of the biggest banks in the UK, but it's not the first bank to face such a fine, according to the commission, which has been set up by George Osborne to investigate the scandal. It's the second bank in Britain to have been fined by a British parliamentary commission on banking standards, following HSBC in 2008, when it was fined more than \u00a31 billion ($1.6 billion). The bank is also facing criticism for failing to disclose the amount of interest it pays on its loans to banks, as well as for misleading the public about the nature of its operations. In 2008 the British parliament passed a law to penalize banks for misbehaving with their lending practices, with the aim of preventing them from raising interest rates on their loans. Since then, it has become increasingly difficult for the banks to tell the difference between lending and lending rates, and in some cases, they have even been forced to cut back on lending. This has led to a series of scandals over the past few years, including a scandal involving the loss of millions of pounds ($2.4 billion) of taxpayer funds. At the same time, a number of banks have also been accused of misappropriating funds from customers, causing them to default on loans they were supposed to lend to, such as HSBC and Lloyds Banking Group (LBS), which had been bailed out by taxpayers in 2007. But the banking commission has now ruled that this is not a case of bank fraud and that it should not be allowed to happen again. Britain's banking watchdog has called for an investigation into the allegations, saying it is \"deeply troubled\" by allegations of fraud, corruption and abuse of power by banks and other financial institutions. According to an official statement from the Commission, \"it is clear that there is no evidence to suggest that any of these allegations are true.\" The Commission's report, published on Wednesday, is due to be published in parliament on Thursday and is expected to take up the recommendations of a committee of MPs and independent experts. Its report will be released in due course. Read more: The Bank Mafia is back in business after the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the rise of global financial markets The banking industry is facing a crisis of confidence in its ability to cope with rising costs, says the report. Financial markets have become more complex in recent years and banks are struggling to find a way to deal with it. Barclays, HSBC, Llanc and HSBC are among the world's biggest lenders. They are the only two banks that are not subject to regulatory scrutiny. HSBC is the largest lender by market capitalization, accounting for around 80 percent of all loans in Europe, while HSBC accounts for just a third of total deposits in that market. That is a huge problem for many banks because they don't have enough capital to cover the cost of their operations and therefore they are unable to meet the costs of lending to their customers. However, there are a lot of people who do not have the means to do so. For example, Barclays has said it would be a mistake to make a profit from a loss in lending, even if it had to pay a penalty of around $2 billion to someone who does not know what they're doing. And Barclays is another bank that has a reputation for being a financial institution with a high turnover rate and a low turnover in capital markets. Despite its reputation as a lender of last resort, analysts say the company is still in good shape, despite the financial crisis. Analysts have warned that a banking crisis is likely to worsen the situation in coming years. A Barclays spokesman told Reuters that \"the banking system is going to get worse,\" adding that banks will have to step up their efforts to reduce their losses and reduce the risk of financial losses. He added: \"We will continue to look for ways to improve the level of risk that we are facing. We will look at how we can do that, because we have a system in place that will allow us to recover the losses we've already incurred. I think that's something that is very important to us.\" Barclays and Barclays have both been in trouble for a long time with regulators and regulators, he added. 'We are very concerned about our own financial stability and risk to our customers' - a problem that could lead to huge losses, given the high rate of capital outflows from their accounts. Banks have already been hit by high levels of bad loans and high rates of loan defaults, so we will need to act quickly to address the problem. There is little doubt that regulators will do their part to prevent a repeat of what happened at the end of this year's crisis, especially in relation to avoid a bank crisis.\""

They were originally arrested for taking photographs of restricted areas. Slovak citizens detained by the Iranian authorities on suspicion of taking photographs out of bounds have returned home, said Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico. Eight people in total were arrested in May after taking photographs of restricted areas. A Slovakian news website said the group was detained near the central city of Isfahan, where Iran has nuclear facilities. The six that have been freed attended a news conference held by Prime Minister Fico in the capital, Bratislava on Sunday. Fico told reporters that the government was working to secure the release of the remaining two paragliders who are stiil in custody. \"Negotiations were fair and their result is the release of six out of eight detainees,\" Fico was quoted as saying on the government's website. He added that Slovakia had not made any \"financial commitments\" in the negotiation process. Detainees 'unaware' of rule-breaking One of the released paragliders, Vladislav Frigo, said the group did not break any rules it was aware of. \"We had information that there was a ban on taking photographs below the height of 2,300 metres. We were taking pictures from higher (altitudes),\" said Frigo. He added that the detainees were well treated, had access to television, a refrigerator and could cook for themselves as well as getting regular meals. Foreign nationals accused of spying In recent years, Iran has levelled accusations of espionage against both foreign nationals and Iranians. Two U.S. citizens - Josh Fattal and Shane Bauer - were sentenced to eight years in jail for spying after being arrested while hiking along the Iraq-Iran border in 2009. They denied espionage - neighbouring Oman helped secure their release in 2011 by posting bail of 1-million US dollars (756,000 euros). Last year, Iranian-American Amir Hekmati was sentenced to death for spying for the CIA, but judges overturned the decision and ordered a retrial. lw/ipj (Reuters, dpa)",

They were released on Sunday after being questioned by the U.S. intelligence service, which said they had been spying for the United States. The charges stem from allegations that they were spying on the Iranian government in Iraq-Iran (Isfahan) in 2009. According to a court document, the charges against the six were brought against them in absentia. \"They are accused of espionage,\" the document said, adding that it was not possible for them to be extradited to Iran. Fico, who has been living in Slovakia since 2009, was sentenced to seven years in prison for spying. He also faces charges of conspiracy to commit espionage, espionage and money laundering. His lawyer, Josh Fattal, told Reuters that he had no knowledge of the case and that his client had not been charged with any crime. Frigo was released after a two-year prison sentence. In 2011, he and his wife, Amir Hekmati, fled to Oman, where they lived for six years before returning to Slovakia in 2011. Since then, they have lived in exile in Oman and Iraq, but have never been able to return to their home country of Slovakia. On Sunday, their arrest came to light, with the release of six of their friends and family members. Most of them, including their spouses and children, were from Slovakia, a country with a long history of independence from the Soviet Union and the Middle East. Their arrest was the latest in a series of arrests that have taken place in recent years, as well as a number of other cases in which the government has sought to extradite them. Some of these cases, however, are still pending before the Supreme Court of Justice (SJ), which is expected to rule on Monday on whether they will be tried in court. Many of those arrested have ties to the US and are suspected of being involved in Iranian-American activities, such as spying and espionage. At the same time, some Slovakers have accused Iran of trying to influence the outcome of elections in their own country. Iran has denied the allegations, saying it has not done anything to try to interfere with elections. Iranian officials have said that the arrests were politically motivated, while others have denied any involvement in any political or military activity. Tehran has also denied that Iran is a state sponsor of terrorism, and said it is not a member of any terrorist organization. However, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has said the accusations against Iran are \"basically baseless,\" and has called for an investigation into the alleged involvement of Iran's intelligence services. Russian President Vladimir Putin has accused the Russian government of attempting to overthrow the democratically-elected president of his country in order to undermine the democratic process. Russia, Iran, Iraq and Oman have all denied accusations of meddling in its internal affairs. Moscow and Tehran have also accused each other of involvement, accusing the former regime of seeking to weaken the rule of law in an attempt to gain influence over the future of its own people. Last year, Russia and Iran accused Slovakia of violating the Geneva acc accords with respect to its nuclear deal with Tehran, an accusation Tehran denies. Slovakia's foreign minister, Vladislav Friga, said on Saturday that Tehran was seeking the extradition of four Iranian nationals who were arrested last year. But he also said he did not believe that any charges were being made against Iranian intelligence officials in connection with their activities in Syria, Lebanon or Iraq. A spokesman for Tehran's Foreign Ministry told dpa: \"We have not seen any evidence to suggest that this was a case. We are not aware of anything that is related to this case.\" The arrests came after the arrest of two Iranian men in May, when the two men were detained by intelligence agencies in Tehran. Both men are believed to have traveled to Tehran to meet with Iranian leaders in exchange for information on their whereabouts and whereabouts. It is unclear whether the Iranians have any information about what they are planning to do next, or if they simply want to use the information they've been handed over to other countries in return for their cooperation. This is the first time that a government official has publicly acknowledged the existence of an Iranian spy in Russia. And it's not just Iran that has come under suspicion. There is also the possibility of a possible extradition request from Moscow, Tehran and Washington. Meanwhile, there is no indication that Russia has any intention of extraditing the men, even if it does not wish to cooperate with Moscow's efforts to arrest the suspects. For now, it remains unclear if the investigation is being conducted in relation to any other country, despite the fact that there are no charges being filed against these individuals. That would be a mistake to say that Moscow has no reason to detain the three men. Foreign intelligence officers are currently investigating the individuals, though, because they may have information that could lead to an arrest warrant for questioning the"

The 89-year-old did not say when exactly his resignation would take effect. Calling the move a personal decision, President Giorgio Napolitano made his announcement during an end-of-year speech on Wednesday. \"I'm about to step down, to resign as the constitution expressly allows,\" he said, adding. \"I've reached an age that brings with it growing limitations and difficulties for me to do my institutional duties, which are complex and very demanding.\" Though he did not say when his resignation would take effect, a potential date is January 13 when Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi is due to give up the country's rotating six-month presidency of the Council of the European Union. Renzi faces a political challenge in organizing a replacement for Napolitano, dubbed by Italian media as \"King George.\" The president has served as a key intermediary between political parties through numerous changes in government and other tricky political situations. Napolitano, a former communist respected by Europe and Washington, took office in 2006. At the end of his seven-year mandate in 2013, he was asked to stay on because parliament could not agree on his successor. At the time he warned he may not serve out the full term, given his age. In Italy, presidents have loosely-defined powers including the ability to nominate prime ministers, dissolve parliament and veto legislation, as well as use the moral authority of the office to influence politics. se/cmk (dpa, Reuters)",
        "generated_story": "Italy's President Giorgio Napolitano has resigned as president of the European Union. Italian President Matteo Renzi announced his resignation on Wednesday, saying he would step down from his post at the end of his term. The resignation comes as Italy's president, who is 89-year-old, has been in office for 89 years. He was appointed to the post on January 13, 2006, following the death of King George VI. Napolano's resignation came after a long-running feud between the two monarchs over his role as the country's first president in the 28-nation bloc, the Council of Europe (CEC), which he led from 2006 until his death in 2006. \"I have decided that I will not be able to continue in my current position,\" said the president-elect, whose term is due to expire in January 2019, according to a statement from the Italian presidency. It was not immediately clear whether the resignation would be a political one or a personal one, but it was the first step in a series of resignations that have been announced by the EU's executive, which includes Italy, France, Germany, Spain and the United States. Italy has said it would not accept a new president and that it will continue to work with the Commission to find a way to resolve the current crisis. French President Nicolas Sarkozy has also announced that he will resign from office. France and Germany have also said that they would like to see a change in France's constitution, as well as Germany's, if the new constitution is to be adopted. In the past, French president Francois Hollande and German Chancellor Angela Merkel have both called for an EU-wide referendum on EU membership. But France has so far rejected the idea of a referendum, calling instead for a constitutional referendum in which the bloc's 28 member states would have to decide whether to accept the terms of their membership, rather than a presidential one. This is the second time that the government of France is considering the possibility of another referendum. Last year, Italy voted to leave the 27-member bloc in favor of Article 50, a move that would give France the right to veto any new EU member state. However, it is not clear that this will be the case in this case, since the French government has not yet made a decision on whether or not to ratify the agreement. On the other hand, there is no doubt that France would welcome a vote of no confidence in Italy if it were to take the position of president. For the time being, however, this is an important step for France to move forward with its plans for the future of its relationship with Europe. At the same time, Europe is also looking for ways to strengthen its ties with Washington, Washington and Brussels, and to make it more open to dialogue on the issue of migration, migration and other issues, such as climate change and migration. According to French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, \"France is going to do everything it can to ensure that we have an open and open dialogue with all the countries that want to cooperate with us,\" he said in an interview with French daily dpa. Read more: \"We have a lot of things to discuss and we are working on. We are ready to get on with it.\" The Italian president has long been a strong advocate of free trade and free movement in Europe, despite the fact that many European countries are not willing to give up their sovereignty in order to protect the rights of migrants and refugees. That is why he is stepping down as head of state of Italy. His resignation is expected to come as soon as next week's European summit in Strasbourg is scheduled for Jan. 13 in Brussels. After the summit, he has vowed to return to Rome, where he hopes to hold talks with European leaders, including European finance ministers and foreign ministers, to try to reach an agreement on how to improve relations between Italy and Washington. Despite the lack of progress in recent years, Italian officials have said they are optimistic about the prospects of an orderly transition of power. They are also hopeful that a deal can be reached in coming months, given the political situation in Germany and in other EU countries. Nevertheless, they have yet to agree on a date for talks on an extension of negotiations with France. Meanwhile, many EU leaders have expressed concern that Italy could be left without a solution to its problems. Many of them have already expressed their concern over the situation. One of these is that Europe's most important issues are the economic and social issues facing the continent: the economy, trade, energy and energy sectors. These are two areas where Italy is facing an economic crisis that has become increasingly difficult to solve, especially in light of rising unemployment and rising inequality. And it's not just Italy that is causing problems for Europe: The European Commission, for example, is one of those countries which are facing a shortage of jobs and economic growth prospects.

        "target": "Libya factions declare ceasefire After two days of peace talks in Geneva, a tentative ceasefire has been called in the restive North African country. Although they sent no representatives to Switzerland, Islamists have agreed to halt the fighting. The Islamist-backed militia alliance that took over Tripoli and installed its own government announced a ceasefire on Friday, following a breakthrough in Geneva-based peace talks. Despite not attending the UN-brokered meeting, the militias have agreed to \"a ceasefire on all fronts,\" according to a statement issued by Islamist group Fajr Libya (Libya Dawn). The only condition is that \"the other parties respect the truce.\" The announcement came hours after the United Nations declared that Libya's warring factions had agreed to a roadmap for forming a unity government. Nearly four years after a NATO-backed revolt saw Moammar Gadhafi removed from power, two rival governments each backed by different groups of militias have plunged the country back into chaos and threatened all-out civil war. After the elected government of Prime Minister Abdullah al-Thinni was forced out of Tripoli by Libya Dawn, it was forced to move to the far eastern city of Tobruk while Libya Dawn reinstated the old parliament known as the GNC. The fighting and violence has displaced hundreds of thousands of civilians, left hundreds killed and thousands wounded. Most foreign diplomats fled the country and shut their embassies last year. The Tobruk government, as well as a few other factions who favor a peaceful resolution, came to Geneva to work on \"confidence-building measures,\" which includes the release of detainees from both sides, opening closed ports and securing safe freedom of movement around the country. es/bw (AP, AFP, Reuters)",
        "generated_story": "Fajr Libya declares ceasefire after two days of peace talks Libya Dawn has declared a two-day ceasefire in the eastern city of Tobruk, the United Nations said on Friday. The ceasefire was announced by the GNC, which is based in Geneva, Switzerland. It is the first time that a ceasefire has been declared in Libya since the end of the civil war in 2011, according to a statement from the Libyan Dawn, a non-governmental organization that monitors the country's political and economic situation. \"We have reached an agreement with the international community,\" the statement said, adding that the two sides had agreed on a roadmap for a peaceful transition of power. However, it did not specify when the ceasefire would take effect, and it was not immediately clear whether it would be implemented. A UN spokesman said the peace agreement would not be signed until at least Friday, but that it had not yet been signed. According to the Geneva-based group, \"the ceasefire will not take place until after the next round of negotiations.\" The UN has called for an immediate cessation of hostilities between the government and the armed groups, as well as a cease-fire between rival factions in Tripoli and Benghazi. In the absence of a formal ceasefire, both sides have been unable to reach a deal on the terms of an interim peace deal. Both sides, however, have said they will continue to hold talks until a new government is formed. On Thursday, they announced that they would hold an emergency meeting to discuss the future of Libya's internationally recognized constitution. They also said that their goal was to establish a transitional government that would have the authority to implement the new constitution without the need for military intervention. But the UN said it could not agree on an exact date for the meeting, citing the lack of progress in negotiations. 'We are not going to give up until we have a clear plan for how we will achieve this,' said a spokesman for UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who was at the negotiating table with Libyan President Moammar Gadhafi. He added that \"we will have to wait and see what happens in this situation.\" \"This is a very difficult situation for us,\" said Ban, referring to last week's failed attempt to broker a peace accord. Ban's announcement came a day after a UN peace envoy, Abdullah al-Thinni, told reporters that he was \"very disappointed\" that no deal had been reached in talks between two rival groups in Tobrok and Tripoli. That was followed by a second day of talks in Benghazi, where a truce was signed on Thursday by two armed factions that had earlier agreed to end the conflict. At the same time, Ban said he would meet with a Libyan delegation to try to find a way to resolve the differences between his regime and his rival forces. After the talks, he called on all sides to come to an end, saying they had reached a consensus on how to achieve a lasting solution. With the help of international mediators, talks were held in a bid to avoid a repeat of last year's violence, when a group of armed men and women were killed in clashes between pro-regime militias and a rival faction of Islamists who were trying to topple the internationally-backed government. An armed group called the \"Libyan Dawn\" (Libya Dawn) was also set up to monitor the situation in eastern Libya, calling it a \"peace process\" in which the regime was able to secure a temporary ceasefire. Its members are expected to return to Tripoli on Saturday, after which it will resume talks on Sunday, with talks to resume on Monday. Some of them are due to be held at a later date. Many of their members have already returned to their home country of Tripoli, while others are still in exile in Switzerland and have fled to other countries, including Tunisia, Egypt, Libya and Egypt. There is no word yet on whether they are returning to Libya. Last week, an international peace conference was scheduled to begin in Tunis, Tunisia and Libya in mid-January. Talks on Wednesday and Thursday were postponed until Friday because of disagreements over the fate of civilians and their families. This was the second time the negotiations had failed to produce a final agreement. Since then, more than a week of fighting has gone on, there has not been a breakthrough in any way. For the most part, negotiations have gone well, though, so far, no breakthrough has taken place. UN observers have not seen any breakthroughs in recent days. Nor has there been any sign of any agreement on any new peace plan, despite the fact that there is still a long-term plan to restore calm. As of Friday evening, only a partial truce is possible, although it is unlikely that any deal will be reached, at this stage, in fact, until next week. Libyan officials have yet to make a decision on what to do with their own country. Security forces, meanwhile, are likely to continue their efforts to prevent a possible return of troops from leaving the region's capital, Tripoli for now. More than ever before the area of"

        "target": "Report: Torture is a European problem too A day after Amnesty International published a report on Europe's collusion with the CIA's torture program, the Council of Europe published its own shocking survey of abuse in detention centers across the continent. Prison guards in several European countries carried out reprisals against detainees who talked to the Council of Europe's Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT), the new CPT report has revealed. The council considers this a violation of the spirit of cooperation between the CPT and the Council of Europe's member states. According to the CPT's 24th General Report, released on Wednesday, reprisals were carried out against prisoners in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Greece, Hungary, Moldova, Russia, Spain, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and Ukraine. \"Intimidation or retaliation against persons the CPT has interviewed may not only violate their human rights but also strikes a blow to the preventive mechanism established by the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture,\" CPT President Letif H\u00fcseynov said in a statement. \"I urge national authorities to respect their obligation to prevent, investigate and punish such actions.\" The report also highlighted several problems with the detention of juveniles around Europe, and proposed a series of practical measures to protect young people's rights when detained. Ad hoc visits The little-known CPT, now 25 years old, represents a unique approach to international torture prevention. A team of specialists make roughly 180 visits a year to all kinds of detention centers (including prisons, police stations, holding centers for immigration detainees, psychiatric hospitals, and even social care homes) all across the 47-member Council of Europe - one of the few international blocs that offer platforms for dialogue with Eastern European regimes considered to have poor human rights records, such as Russia, Azerbaijan, and Ukraine. The method combines the carrot of talks with government officials and the stick of ad hoc visits, which all members are committed to allowing into their prisons. Once inside, the CPT also has the right to interview any detainees it chooses - in private, though of course the detainees have the right to refuse. \"The first thing to say is how important the CPT is,\" said Carla Ferstman, director of Redress, a UK-based organization that helps torture survivors. \"As a result of their boot work over a very long period of time, the UN has set up a global system which in many ways mirrors the approach of the CPT.\" But given that the committee has no powers to enforce its proposals to governments, there are question marks over its effectiveness. \"In the report, they complain about how some of the recommendations they've made have not been implemented,\" said Ferstman. \"It's a sign that they're a little bit frustrated.\" But in the long run, she maintains, the CPT has more than proved its value. \"The dialogue that they are able to have is really important,\" she said. \"Looking long-term, they have been very effective.\" CIA collusion, asylum seekers The CPT's report comes a day after Amnesty International released its own report on European collusion with the CIA's torture program. While the CPT's report examines more prosaic day-to-day mistreatment, rather than mass rendition of terrorist suspects at the behest of the US, there are obvious links between the two, since some countries - such as Poland, Macedonia, and the UK - are highlighted in both reports. \"What is finally coming out in all of this is that the Europeans, despite all the criticism of the Bush and Obama administrations on the use of torture - so many of them connived,\" said Judy Dempsey, senior associate at Carnegie Europe. \"It's really a double standard. This report is quite damning and quite shameful, and it follows the Amnesty International one as well.\" The CPT's work also mentions the mistreatment of asylum seekers, a problem increasingly afflicting European countries that take in the largest number of asylum seekers - particularly Spain, Italy, and Greece. \"With Greece there are two things to remember,\" Dempsey told DW. \"A - the appalling situation of the prison system, and B - the lack of training among police of how to deal with asylum seekers. Awful things have happened. Parallel to this is the illegal detention centers. There have been lots of cases of terrible mistreatment over the last several years.\" \"Immigration detention is a growing issue,\" added Ferstman. \"In the UK, there was a whole parliamentary inquiry into one immigration detention center, where some of the women alleged that guards propositioned them in order to get quick treatment on their claims. Each country has its own history of torture.\"",
        "generated_story": "The European Convention for the Prevention of Torture (CPT) is a European problem, but it's time to step up its game. The Council of Europe's president, US President Barack Obama, has called for an end to the CPT, which has been a major problem in Europe for more than a decade. According to a report by Amnesty International's Carla Ferstman, a member of the council of European nations, the issue has become a global one. \"We need to take a step back,\" she told DW, adding that \"we have to do something about this. We need a change in the way we deal with this problem.\" The US president has also called on European countries to \"step up their game\" in dealing with the problem of torture. But it is not just the US. It's also the EU, too. In the last several years, Europe has seen a rise in human rights abuses, including torture, rape and murder. That's not to say that the United States is the only country that has done this -- the European Court of Justice (ECJ) has ruled that torture should not be a crime, and that it should be treated as a human right, not a criminal offense. Germany, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Serbia, Greece, Italy, Spain, Bosnia, Macedonia, Moldova, Turkey, Ukraine, Albania, Kosovo, Armenia, Montenegro and Bosnia. All of these countries have been subject to torture for years -- and now they are facing the prospect of being subjected to it again. This time, however, it will be the first time that Europe is going to be able to put a stop to this, as it has for so long been the case in many other countries around the world. For example, in Greece and in Macedonia. And in Bulgaria. These are the countries that have suffered the most from torture over the past few years. There are also countries in Eastern Europe where torture has taken place, such as Bulgaria and Romania. However, there is no evidence that this has happened in any other European country. Nor is there any evidence to suggest that there was an increase in torture in those countries. At least, that's the view of some experts, who say torture is something that should never be allowed to happen in a country where the perpetrators are not held accountable for their crimes. As a result, many of those who have experienced torture have fled the country, while others have returned to their home countries, leaving their families to fend for themselves and their loved ones. A day after Obama took office in office, Germany's Angela Merkel and Hungary's Letif H\u00fcseynov resigned from their post as head of state. Merkel's successor, George W. Bush, was sworn in as the new US foreign minister on Wednesday. She said that she would be stepping up her game in order to protect the rights of people who suffer torture and abuse. Her resignation comes after a series of events in which she and her husband were accused of using torture as part of a cover-up for crimes committed by the CIA and the Russian government. Read more: \"The US is doing everything it can to prevent torture,\" Merkel says of Obama's visit to Ukraine. German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel says that he is \"very happy to see that we are doing what we're doing.\" \"It's a very important step for Europe,\" he said. He added that Germany and Poland have also been doing a lot of work on their own, \"but we have a long way to go before we can do anything about it.\" Germany is one of many countries which is working on a plan to make it easier for torture victims to get out of their homes and into the criminal justice system. Russia, Iran and Turkey have all been targets of US torture efforts, according to experts at Carnegie Europe. Turkey is also a victim of this torture campaign, they say. Iran, Russia and Ukraine are among the worst offenders. Hungary and Bulgaria are another country in this group of countries with a large number of victims. Poland is another victim. Romania and Serbia have both been victims of similar torture cases in recent years as well as Ukraine and Georgia. Italy and Greece are victims, for example. Spain and Italy have already been targeted by a US-led coalition of intelligence agencies. Meanwhile, Georgia and Macedonia are being targeted in an attempt to stop the torture of migrants. Ukraine is in particular a target of attacks by US and EU intelligence services, particularly in relation to its alleged involvement in Syria and Iran. I think this is an example of how the U.S. is trying to change its approach to tackling this issue, because it doesn't have the resources to fight it. On Wednesday, President Obama announced that they would not allow torture to continue in its current form, saying it was \"a matter of national security.\" In a statement, Merkel said it would \"not be an option for any country to use torture against its own people.\" Russia has repeatedly accused the Obama administration of violating international law. Moscow has said the same"

        "target": "Dresden marks 70 years since massive Allied bombing Seventy years ago, Allied bombers attacked Dresden, killing tens of thousands of people, the majority of them civilians and refugees. Every year, the East German city remembers its dead. DW's Naomi Conrad was on hand. As the tram trundled through Dresden's drab suburbs on Friday morning, a prim, elderly woman suddenly turned to her friend sitting on the seat beside her: \"You know, my mother never told me about the bombings.\" She shrugged, then, after a moment's pause, continued. \"It must have been such unspeakable hell that she just couldn't talk about it,\" the woman said. She was referring to February 13, 1945 - the morning, exactly 70 years ago, when Allied bombers swooped down on an unsuspecting city famous for its baroque architecture and that, until that point, had survived the war mostly unscathed. That was to change in the course of three dreadful days: As the bombs rained down on the city, its churches and palaces were turned to rubble. Up to 25,000 people - many of them refugees fleeing the advancing Soviet Red Army - died in the inferno that raged in the city for days. \"There was nothing left, nothing,\" a frail, bent man with a checkered cap recalled, \"just rubble and death.\" He was leaning on the balustrade of a viewing platform in Dresden's old gasometer, staring down at the 360-degree painting by the Iranian-German artist Yadegar Asisi; sirens howled from hidden speakers and strobe lighting illuminated the ruined churches and black smoke billowing from the burnt skeletons that were once buildings. The man swallowed, his voice hoarse, barely audible: \"It's so hard being here.\" The soundtrack and images, he said, \"bring back too many memories.\" 'So, so many dead' He was 15, he recalled, working on a school essay when the sirens began to wail. He never finished the essay. Instead, he ran for shelter with his family. When they returned home three days later, the roof had been blown off, the windows smashed. \"But we were lucky: We survived,\" he said. \"There were so, so many dead.\" His voice broke and, muttering an apology, he shuffled off. The bombings were intended to break the German population's morale - a decision that to many was incomprehensible, given that the war had long been decided and Dresden's economic and strategic importance was relatively minimal. Consequently, the death and destruction wreaked by the Allied bombers quickly became a tool, first for the Nazi propagandists in the last months of the war, then by the East German regime for its anti-West propaganda, and then later by neo-Nazi groups, who traditionally congregate on February 13. Even today, \"the debate continues about guilt and innocence, even about the exact number of victims,\" Dresden Mayor Helma Orosz told a packed audience, including delegations from abroad, gathered for a memorial service in the city's Frauenkirche, which in 2005 was rebuilt with the help of private donations after Germany's reunification, many of them from the United States and Great Britain. Call for peace \"War, hatred and violence begin in people's minds,\" Orosz said. \"We must resist any attempt at once again categorizing people based on their origin and skin color,\" she added, referring to what has often been described as a right-wing catchall movement called PEGIDA, generally translated as Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West, which has taken to the streets in Dresden since October. Later, on a platform overlooking thousands of people, many of them wearing white roses as a sign of peace while bracing the icy cold outside the church, Orosz called on Dresden to remember every victim of the Nazi terror - a plea that was reiterated by German President Joachim Gauck when he took to the microphone: \u201cWe don't want the pain that people suffered here to be misused by others.\u201d Behind him, the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, who, back in the Frauenkirche, had talked of the \u201cmiracle that peace in Europe represents,\u201d leaned in closer to his interpreter. Then, as evening fell over Dresden and church bells tolled, thousands - possibly as many as 10,000, according to the city's press office - lined up along Dresden's riverfront, holding hands to commemorate the dead and call for peace as police men dressed in black riot gear looked on. \"I can remember it all,\" Siegfriede Leonhard, a vivacious woman in her late 70s said. She was 7 when the bombs fell, she said, and had been coming to the commemorations in Dresden \"for at least 60 years.\" Sometimes, she said, stomping her feet to keep warm, she wondered whether she shouldn't remember at home, alone. \"",
        "generated_story": "German city of Dresden hit by Allied bombings Germany's capital Dresden was struck by a series of bombings in the last months of World War II. The bombing of the city's Frauenkirche on February 13, 1945, killed at least 60 people and wounded more than 70,000. It was the first time in 70 years that a German city had been bombed by the Red Army, and it was only a matter of time before the war broke out. German authorities blamed the bombing on the Soviet Union, which they said was responsible for the death of thousands of civilians. \"The bombing was an act of war,\" German Prime Minister Joachim Gauck said at a news conference in Berlin on Friday. He added that the bombings were the result of a \"war of attrition.\" \"It was a terrible day,\" said Helma Orosz, head of PEGIDA, the Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of Western Europe (PegIDA), a group of women's rights activists who have fought against the Nazi regime in Germany since the fall of Berlin in 1945. They called for an end to the German occupation of eastern Europe, but the government refused to give in, saying it would not allow it. In the end, Germany was forced to accept the terms of an armistice that would have allowed the Soviets to take over the country. But it did not stop there. On the contrary, it has been a long time since Germany had experienced such a war. Since the liberation of Eastern Europe in 1941, Dresden has seen a number of attacks, including two in October and one in November. At the beginning of February, a bombing in Dresden killed 70 people, most of them civilians, according to eyewitness accounts. This was followed by three days later by another bombing near the town of Canterbury, about 70 miles (100 kilometers) north of Cologne. During that time, German forces were able to capture the entire city and take it to a new level, with the exception of one attack in which a Soviet bomber was shot down by German troops. After the attack, thousands fled the area, leaving hundreds of people dead and thousands more wounded. Many of those who survived were women, many of whom were in their late 70s or early 80s, who had fled their homes in order to return to their families. For those of us who didn't know what to expect, there was no way to know for sure what would happen next. That's when the attacks began. And that is when it all began, in a way, that's the most horrifying thing that has ever happened to me. I can't even remember the day that I was born, or the time I lived there, because I don't think I had the opportunity to go to school. Now I'm in my mid-70s and I have no idea what I want to do with my life. There's a lot to say about the events of that day, however, I think it's important to remember that this is a very sad day for Germany. As a young woman, she was in her late 60s at the age of 15, when she heard the news. Her father, Siegfriede Leonhard, was killed by an Allied bomber in September 1944. She said she had never heard of him until she saw him in his uniform and that he was still alive when he came to Dresden. Later that year, her mother, Yadegar Asisi, told her that she and her father had seen him on television and she thought he had died in an airplane crash. So she went to see him at his home in Kent, England, where he lived for a few days before he died. When she returned to Germany, he said, \"I was very surprised to find him there,\" adding that his father was dead. His death was one of his final acts as a journalist. A few years ago, his wife died of cancer. How did he die? How could he have died? \"He was so sick,\" she said. 'He died because he couldn't stand to think about it anymore,\" he told DW's Justin Welby, editor of The New York Times, referring to his book The Death of Adolf Hitler, published in 2005. Germany has long been an important part of Europe's history, especially in Europe and the United States. However, since then, Germans have become more aware of Nazi atrocities in other countries, such as Britain, France, Britain and France have all been victims of these attacks. These days, they are not the only ones who are suffering from the loss of their loved ones, as they have been for many years. Last month, Berlin was also a target of Allied bombing raids on German soil. According to German media, this was just the latest example of what the Germans had done to them. Nazi propaganda has become a major factor in German society in recent years, particularly after the Berlin bombing. Despite the fact that they were so close to Hitler's death, Nazi Germany is still a victim of this kind of terrorism. Today,"

Reuters cited a witness who reported seeing the head of a singer from the hip-hop band Barikad Crew make contact with the power line. Some of the victims were electrocuted instantly, while others jumped off the float, causing panic among the revelers who lined the street. Many of the at least 18 deaths came as a result of the ensuing panic, while at more than 40 others were injured, according to local authorities.

At least 17 people were killed and more than 100 injured after a car plowed into a crowd of revelers at a carnival in the northern port city. The accident, which occurred at around midnight on Tuesday, is the latest in a series of mishaps that have rocked the Caribbean nation in recent months. Several people have been hospitalized, with many of them in critical condition, according to the Associated Press (AP, Reuters) and local media. Many of the victims were tourists who had been partying with friends and relatives. Some of those who died were from Haiti. More than a dozen people, including several children, were also injured, the AP reported, adding that at least 19 others were injured. \"We are still trying to figure out what caused the accident,\" said Barikad Crew spokesman Michel Martelly. He added that the cause of death was not yet known, but that \"we do not know the exact cause.\" The incident took place during Carnival, when a group of tourists from around the world descended on the city to celebrate the festival. It was the first time that Haiti had experienced such a tragedy in years. According to local news agencies, several people died, while others suffered minor injuries. There were no reports of injuries, and the death toll was expected to rise to as many as 18. Officials have said the incident occurred during the early hours of Tuesday morning and that it could have happened at any time. Haiti's government has vowed to protect its citizens from attacks by the international community. In a statement, it said: \"The government is committed to ensuring the safety of all Haitians. We will not tolerate any kind of attacks on our citizens.\" Haiti is experiencing a severe economic crisis, as the country's economy struggles to recover from the devastating earthquake and civil war that shook the region in 2010 and 2011. Haitian officials have blamed the disaster on a lack of funds and poor infrastructure. They have also blamed poor public transport for the tragedy, saying that many people had no idea what was going on in their country. Authorities are also blaming poor people who have not been able to pay their fair share of taxes and who are not allowed to travel to neighboring countries, such as France and Germany. But they also blame the government for not doing enough to prevent a repeat of last year's deadly earthquake that killed hundreds of thousands of people. Reuters, AP, AFP and Reuters have reported that several other news organizations have confirmed the deaths, citing local officials, in addition to a number of other local and national media outlets. One local newspaper said that police were searching for a missing person, who was believed to be the driver of a vehicle that crashed into the crowd. Another news agency said it was unclear whether the car was carrying a child. Other news outlets said police had also been called in to investigate the crash. A police spokesman told Reuters that authorities were still investigating the circumstances surrounding the deadly accident and said they were not aware of any fatalities. Investigators are looking for any possible suspects in relation to it. Police are investigating whether any other deaths were linked to an explosion or a fire that broke out at an apartment building in central Haiti last week, or if the fire was caused by an unknown source. No one has yet been arrested in connection with the explosion, however, officials said. 'We have no information at this time on what happened,' said a local police official, speaking on condition of anonymity. This is not a new development for Haitian authorities. Last year, police said there was no indication that any deaths had taken place at all. Since then, authorities have opened an investigation into possible links between the blast and an arson attack in which a man was found to have committed a crime. However, they have yet to rule out the possibility of an attack on another person. On Tuesday evening, a police officer was arrested and charged with attempted murder after he allegedly tried to flee the scene. An investigation is still ongoing. Local media reported on Wednesday that investigators had found no evidence that a person was involved in Tuesday's incident. Meanwhile, Haitian police have launched an operation to try to identify the person responsible for Monday's explosion and other related deaths. Security forces have so far failed to provide any clues as to what may have occurred. Earlier this morning, security forces had responded to reports that an explosive device had exploded in an area near the entrance to one of several apartment buildings, killing two people and injuring dozens of others. That could not be ruled out as an act of terrorism, an official told reporters. (Reuters)The incident was first reported by Reuters.

Meanwhile, US Secretary of State John Kerry has urged all parties to find a political solution to the conflict. \"We have made a decision that the cease-fire will begin this Tuesday, May 12, at 11.00 pm and will last for five days subject to renewal if it works out,\" Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir told a meeting of Gulf ministers in Paris on Friday alongside US Secretary of State John Kerry. The minister added that the cease-fire could be extended depending on the response from Yemen's Shiite Houthi rebels. Al-Jubeir said he hoped the Iran-backed rebels would \"come to their senses\" and agree to the truce. He urged them to stop fighting. \"We hope the Houthis will come to their senses and realize the interests of Yemen and the Yemeni people should be the top priority for everyone,\" he said. It is unclear whether the Houthis would reciprocate the Saudi gesture. \"The cease-fire will end should Houthis or their allies not live up to the agreement - this is a chance for the Houthis to show that they care about their people and they care about the Yemen people,\" the Saudi foreign minister emphasized. At this point, US Secretary of State John Kerry said anyone who cared about Yemeni people \"should take clear notice of the fact that a human catastrophe is building,\" adding that a cease-fire was \"not peace\" and that all parties must find a political solution to end the conflict. Kerry urged all sides to hold talks immediately. Saudi ultimatum Hours before the cease-fire announcement, Saudi Arabia declared a Houthi stronghold along its southern border a \"military target,\" giving an ultimatum to the residents to leave the area, Saudi state-run TV reported. Lately, the northern Yemeni province of Saada has become a battleground for the Shiite rebels and the Saud-led coalition forces as the Houthis carried out border attacks on nearby Saudi cities. More than 50 airstrikes hit Saada overnight and in the early hours of Friday morning, Yemeni officials said. A Saudi-led coalition of Arab states launched an air campaign against the Houthis on March 26. Riyadh accuses Tehran of backing the rebels, who have made significant territorial gains in the impoverished Middle Eastern country, capturing the capital Sanaa and ousting internationally recognized President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, who fled Yemen back in March. The Sunni Gulf states are wary of Iran's increasing influence in the region, and they see the Houthis' advance in Yemen as a move that threatens their regional and geopolitical interests. Over 1,200 people have been killed in Yemen since the start of the Saudi campaign, according to the United Nations. shs/bw (AFP, dpa, Reuters, AP)",

The ceasefire, which began on March 26, is expected to last for five days. It is the first time in five years that the Houthis have been able to reach the southern Yemeni city of Saada, where they are fighting for control of a large swathe of the country's capital, Sanaa, according to a statement from the Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir. \"We have reached an agreement,\" he said, adding that he hoped to extend the truce to the northern province of Hodeida. But the ceasefire is unlikely to be extended beyond the five day period, he added, saying it would be \"a very long time before we see any change in the situation.\" The truce, announced by Saudi Arabia's foreign ministry, was set to take effect on Tuesday at 11.00 pm (1400 GMT) and would last until the end of May, when the government of Yemeni President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi will be sworn in as the new president of Yemen. Houthi fighters have so far been unable to form a cohesive front against the Iranian-backed forces, who have seized large swathes of southern Yemen, and are trying to push them out of their strongholds. Yemen's government, however, has said it will continue to fight for its own people. On Friday, it announced that it had called for an early-morning ceasefire between the Yemeni government and the Shiite rebels, calling on them to give up their weapons in exchange for humanitarian aid. Iran has also called on the Saudis to halt their military operations, but Riyadh has refused to do so. According to Iran's Foreign Ministry, a ceasefire was agreed in March, with the aim of ending the fighting in a week-long ceasefire. However, Tehran has not yet agreed on a date for a truce. Tehran, meanwhile, accused Riyadh of violating international humanitarian law by imposing a ban on all arms exports to Yemen in an attempt to force the rebels to surrender. Riyadh also accused the US of supporting Iran in its bid to overthrow President Abd-Rabbi Mohammed bin Salman, accusing Washington of backing Tehran's efforts to undermine the internationally recognized president's legitimacy. Washington, Riyadh, Paris and Tehran have all said they would continue their efforts, despite the fact that they have yet to agree on an exact date. US Secretary of State John Kerry told reporters in Paris that Washington was \"deeply disappointed\" by Riyadh's decision to suspend the talks. He also said that Riyadh was not ready to accept a deal that would allow Iran to continue its support for the war-torn country. 'We are not going to allow this to happen,' Kerry said at a news conference in Washington. In an interview with Reuters, Kerry added that \"we are very disappointed that we have not seen any progress on this front.\" \"It is very disappointing to see that Iran is not willing to cooperate with us in this conflict,\" Kerry, an Iranian diplomat, said during a visit to Riyadh. Kerry was referring to his visit as a \"very important step forward\" in his role as US ambassador to Washington on Thursday. His visit came after a series of phone calls with US President Barack Obama and US Vice President Mike Pompeo, both of whom had been in Riyadh for more than a month. Both of them said the visit was an \"important step toward resolving the conflict.\" Washington and Riyadh have repeatedly denied the allegations of Iranian meddling in Yemeni affairs, though Washington has denied that Tehran was involved in any wrongdoing. Last week, Washington announced a new round of sanctions against Iran over its alleged role in supporting the Iran-aligned Houthiy rebels. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said Tehran had \"no intention\" of imposing sanctions on Iran and said Iran would not do anything to stop the deal. A spokesman for Iran said he was unaware of any new sanctions, although he did not rule out the possibility of lifting the sanctions. Meanwhile, Iranian officials have also denied any involvement in negotiations with Riyadh over the issue of its involvement with Iran. They said Riyadh had no intention of doing so, instead, they were simply working with Tehran to try to broker an end to an arms embargo on Tehran and other countries, including Iran, in order to prevent Iran from entering the Middle Eastern region.

        "target": "Aging health: WHO call to action as world population over 60 set to double by 2050 In a new report on aging and health, the World Health Organization is calling for action on \"population aging,\" as figures suggest the number of people over 60 will reach two billion by 2050. People worldwide are living longer, says the World Health Organization in its World Report on Aging and Health. This is both good and bad. It gives us the chance to \"pursue new activities\" as we get older, such as in education and family life. But it all depends on our health. And for that the WHO says world governments need to act now to make sure our societies worldwide are ready. What are the take home facts from the World Health Organization's 2015 report on Aging and Health? The WHO says that in the next 35 years, the global number of people aged 60 years and over will almost double from 12 percent to 22 percent. By 2020, there will be more people over the age of 60 than 5 year olds. And a majority of older people (80 percent) will live in \"low and middle income\" countries. It's estimated that the world's population aged 60 years and older will total about 2 billion in 2050, which is more than twice as much as now. Furthermore, worldwide, about 125 million people are aged 80 years or older. But by 2050, it is expected that this number of people - aged 80 and over - will live in China alone. But I'm not old, so why should I care? Well, all this is happening at a faster rate than ever before. And the WHO says \"all countries face major challenges to ensure that their health and social systems are ready\" for this major demographic shift. It will cost a lot of money to improve health and social infrastructures, especially in more developed countries where traditional families structures have changed dramatically. Surely, there's \"no typical older person,\" though. How does the WHO define aging? We tend to think of older people as physically and mentally frail. But that's not necessarily the case, not everywhere in the world. Old is a relative concept - especially in middle income to rich countries. For instance, some 70 year olds are as fit as some 20 year olds. Just think how many older folk are at your gym, and ask yourself whether you can keep up with all of them. But that still doesn't explain aging. What is it exactly? The WHO says that at a biological level, \"aging results from the impact of the accumulation of a wide variety of molecular and cellular damage over time.\" Basically, this puts people at a higher risk of disease and, of course, death. But aging can also be associated with \"life transitions,\" such as retirement or witnessing other people, such as friends and family, die around you. This can affect you psychologically and sometimes, as a result, physically. What sort of diseases come with old age? Some of the most common non-fatal conditions include hearing loss, cataracts, back and neck pain and osteoarthritis. Other conditions include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - which affects the lungs - diabetes, depression, and dementia. What needs to be done? The WHO is proposing a five-step plan of action, which includes: Committing to healthy aging and \"evidence-based policies to strengthen the abilities of older persons.\" Aligning health systems with the needs of older populations Developing systems for providing long-term care Creating \"age-friendly cities and communities Improving measurement, monitoring and understanding of \"aging issues\" worldwide. But don't forget: \"a longer life brings with it opportunities, not only for older people and their families, but also for societies as a whole.\"",
        "generated_story": "WHO's Population Aging Plan: Actions Now The World Health Organization (WHO) has announced plans to reduce the number of people aged over 60 in the next 35 years. According to the World Report on Aging and Health, 60 percent of the world's population will be aged 60 years or older by 2050. The WHO said in a report released in 2015 that it was \"impeding to achieve this goal\" by reducing the age of 60. It said this would be the first time the WHO had made such an ambitious plan for the future. \"We are not going to stop at 60,\" the report said. However, it added, \"we will continue to take steps to prevent the spread of germs and prevent them from spreading to other people.\" The report also said that in order to meet the 2050 target, China would have to increase its population by 80 percent by 2030, compared with the current level of 70 percent. In addition, some 20 year olds in China are expected to live to 80 years of age, according to WHO figures. This is a significant change from the previous plan, which was based on a population-wide plan of 80 to 90 million people. But it's not just the younger people who are at risk of dying, the older people will also be at the mercy of their older counterparts, said WHO Director-General Margaret Chan. Chan said the new plan would not be implemented until at least 20 years after the 60-year-old age. He said it would take \"a long time\" for China to reach its goal of having a healthy population, but he added that the country would still be able to maintain its current levels of population growth over the long term. China has been the most active country on the global stage of aging, with more than 80 million citizens aged between 60 and 80, and a total of 1.5 billion people living in countries with a high population of over 2.3 billion (2.4 billion) by 2040. WHO has also announced a new strategy for managing the aging of older populations, called the \"ageing and dying\" plan. That plan is aimed at increasing the proportion of children aged under 60 who will die before they reach their 60 year old age in 2035. World health officials have said they hope the plan will have a positive impact on people's health, as well as on their overall health and well-being. They also expect to see a reduction in deaths from chronic diseases such as cancer, diabetes and heart disease, obesity, stroke and cardiovascular diseases, among other diseases. And they are also hoping for an end to a long-term decline in people with chronic conditions like diabetes, heart diseases and cancer. Experts say that this is not the time to make a drastic change. Some experts, however, say it is too early to tell whether this will happen, given that China's aging population is already at a tipping point in terms of its ability to cope with its ageing population. (Reuters, AP, AFP, Reuters)The WHO is also calling on China and other countries to step up their efforts to tackle the problem of ageing, saying it will take a lot of action to address the issue of how to deal with it. For example, if the Chinese population continues to grow at an alarming rate, they will need to cut back on its spending on health care and education programs and reduce their use of social services. If they don't do this, then the government will not have the resources to do anything about it, experts say, adding that there is no need for a massive increase in government spending. Meanwhile, in Europe, there are already plans for cutting down on healthcare spending and increasing healthcare expenditures. These plans are being pushed through by the European Union and the United States, for example. One of them is to expand the Medicaid program for older adults, to cover the cost of living for those aged 65 and older, so that more people have access to care for their elderly relatives and their children. Another option is the elimination of Medicare, Medicare and Social Security benefits. There are currently around 20 million elderly people in this age group, including some 70 years old Chinese, who have been living with their parents for decades. Many of these people are in their 80s and 90s, while others have reached their 70s. People with older parents and children have already reached 60, 70, 80 and 85, respectively, when they were born. So, that's a big step forward for them, since they have no children to look after. At the same time, many of those older than 60 are likely to be in need of care, because of a lack of money and resources. As a result, this could lead to higher healthcare costs for many people, especially those with poor health conditions, like the elderly and disabled. Health experts have warned that they may be unable to afford the costs of healthcare, particularly those who live in rural areas with high-income families and those without health insurance. What's more important is that these programs will help them to get a better quality of life, such a"

Stephen Harper has stepped down as leader of the Conservatives after nine years in the top job. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper resigned as Conservative Party leader on Tuesday after the Liberals, led by Justin Trudeau, emerged victorious in legislative elections. \"I have spoken to Prime Minister Stephen Harper, and he has instructed me to reach out to the newly elected parliamentary caucus to appoint an interim leader,\" Conservative Party president John Walsh said in a statement. \"The people are never wrong,\" Harper said of his defeat. \"The disappointment is my responsibility and mine alone,\" Harper said, adding that he had called Trudeau to congratulate him. Trudeau calls for hopeful, diverse future In electing Trudeau, the charismatic son of a former popular prime minister, Canadian voters illustrated the growing discontent with nine years of Conservative rule that saw lowering of corporate taxes, avoidance of climate change legislation and disagreement with the Obama administration over the controversial Keystone XL pipeline. \"Canadians have spoken,\" Trudeau said, adding that he would be the man to lead the \"hopeful, positive\" country \"with a vision\" that they had asked for. In his victory speech, Trudeau said his government \"believed deeply in the diversity of our country,\" striking a contrast with the strain of nativism that had become apparent under Conservative rule. \"We beat fear with hope,\" said Trudeau, a 43-year-old former teacher. Liberals blow past projected results Projections ahead of the elections had Harper and Trudeau in a dead heat, but as polls closed on Monday night it became clear that the Liberals had won an outright majority, with a projected 175 of parliament's 338 seats. This represented a huge leap from four years ago when Liberals were handed their most crushing defeat in history with a mere 34 seats. Harper will stay on as a member of Parliament for his constituency, public broadcaster CBC reported, as he was re-elected to his seat.

Harper's successor, Justin Trudeau, announced his resignation on Monday, saying he was stepping down from his post as prime ministerial post. The announcement came after Harper, who had been in power since 2011, was accused by the New Democratic Party (NDP) of failing to deliver on his promise to build a pipeline from Canada to the U.S. border in the United States. \"I have to step down,\" Harper said in a statement, adding that he would not seek re-election. He also said he had no plans to seek a third term in government, which would see him take over the reins of power from the outgoing Conservative leader, former Liberal Party leader John Walsh. Trudeau said Harper had \"made a mistake\" in his decision to leave office in 2011. But Harper did not stop there, he said, and he will continue to work with Trudeau and Trudeau on the issue of climate change and energy policy. In his speech, Harper also called on Canadians to support the Keystone XL pipeline, a controversial project that would have opened the way for the construction of a new oil pipeline to be built in Canada. It would be the first such project to open up the country's oil and gas reserves to foreign investors, the CBC reported, citing a source close to Harper who said the project was a \"significant step forward for Canada.\" Harper has said that the pipeline will be completed within the next two to three years, but he has yet to say whether it will go ahead as planned, or if it won't be done at the same time as the new pipeline is being built. Last week Harper announced that Canada would no longer be allowed to import oil from other countries, including the US, Canada, Mexico and the European Union (EU). Harper was also expected to take the oath of office on Tuesday, following the resignation of his predecessor, then-prime minister, Tony Blair, on a day when the government was still struggling to find a way out of an economic crisis. Canadian media have reported that Harper will not be returning to office until at least the end of next year, when he is set to assume the role of premier of Canada after a nine-year term. Canada has been plagued by a series of political crises in recent years. One of those crises was the 2011 election, in which the Conservatives lost the election to Barack Obama. That was followed by an election in 2012, with Harper losing the leadership to Trudeau in 2014 and then to former Conservative Leader Stephen Moore in 2015. Both Harper and Liberal leader Trudeau have said they were ready to move on to a second term, while Trudeau has promised to keep Harper in charge until his successor is sworn in next month's federal election. A spokesman for Harper told CBC news agency that \"the government is prepared to do everything in its power to ensure that Canadians have the opportunity to elect a leader who is willing to stand up for their country.\" The Canadian Press, AFP, Reuters, AP, dpa and Reuters have also reported on Harper leaving office after 24 hours of talks with the Liberal party's parliamentary leader and his wife, Sarah Walsh, to form his own party, The New Democrat Party, for which Harper is a member of Parliament. They have not yet been able to reach a consensus on what Harper should do next, according to CBC, although they are hoping to get a deal done by Tuesday's vote on whether or not he should step aside. CBC: Harper leaves office as PM, Trudeau to run for a fourth term as premier. Reuters: AP: Reuters/John Walsh Canada: PM Harper resigns after his term ends in May, leaving Harper to lead the governing Conservatives. PM Trudeau's resignation comes after months of speculation over whether Harper could be replaced by another candidate. (Reuters)Prime Minister Harper says he's not going to resign, however, if he wants to continue his role as party leader. His resignation is not a surprise to Canadians, given that his party is still in opposition to his leadership. However, it is unlikely to change its position in any way at this point, as Harper remains the leader for now, despite the fact that Trudeau is the only candidate who has not been elected to Parliament since the 2010 election and has no experience in politics. Prime minister Harper campaigned for eight years as a Conservative. During his first term he led the party from 2011 to 2012. Since then, his government has had a difficult time building a coalition government that has struggled to win a majority of seats in both houses of parliament. This time around, they have been unable to secure the support of many Canadians who are still undecided about the future of their party and who have expressed their views on how to deal with a party that is in danger of losing its majority in Parliament and whether he'll be reelected in 2019. Opposition parties have repeatedly criticized Harper for his handling of issues such as immigration, immigration and foreign policy, especially in light of recent scandals.

        "target": "Maldives revokes state of emergency citing improved security situation The president of the Maldives has lifted a state of emergency following an outcry from the international community. The government says the measures are no longer necessary because the security threat has subsided. The government said Tuesday it had rescinded the emergency measures \"with immediate effect\" and that \"all fundamental rights that were suspended have been restored.\" President Yameen Abdul Gayoom declared the state of emergency one week ago after the discovery of a homemade bomb and a stash of weapons near his official residence. The finding followed an explosion on Gayoom's speedboat in September - an incident the government labeled an assassination attempt. The president was not hurt in the blast, but his wife, an aide and a bodyguard were injured. The emergency regulations, intended to be in place for 30 days, gave security forces wide-ranging search and arrest powers, and suspended citizens' basic rights. They drew criticism from former colonial power Britain as well as the United States, the European Union and neighboring Sri Lanka. Reading out a presidential decree revoking the emergency, Attorney General Mohamed Anil said there was no longer a threat to the Indian Ocean atoll nation. He said investigations into the September blast and the recovery of weapons had made good progress. The foreign ministry said a number of people had been arrested. Lawmakers also used the security regulations to fast-track the impeachment of Vice President Ahmed Adeeb, who stands accused of plotting the alleged attempts on the president's life. Impact on tourism Attorney General Anil said pressure from the international community, as well as \"the possible adverse impact on Maldives tourism and the economy,\" had also played a role in ending the state of emergency. Foreign tourists visiting the tropical nation, known for its luxury tourist resorts, palm-fringed beaches and coral reefs, contribute close to a third of the country's gross domestic product. The Maldives has had a rocky road to democracy since holding its first multiparty election in 2008. The country's first democratically elected leader, current opposition chief Mohamed Nasheed, was forced to step down in 2012 after a mutiny by security forces. In March, he was jailed for 13 years on terrorism charges in a trial the United Nations said was illegal. President Gayoom is under intense international pressure to release him. Nasheed's opposition Maldivian Democratic Party welcomed Tuesday's announcement. But said declaring the state of emergency in the first place was a political move designed to stop a rally planned for last week calling for Nasheed's freedom. \"It appears that Yameen is willing to make up threats about the nation's security in order to settle political scores,\" the party said in a statement, referring to the president. nm/kms (AP, AF, Reuters, dpa)",
        "generated_story": "Maldivian President Yameen Abdul Gayoom has lifted a state of emergency in the Maldives, the United Nations said on Tuesday. The move comes a week after the country's president, Mohamed Nasheed, announced that he would step down from office within 30 days. \"I am going to stay in office,\" he said in a statement, adding that his government would continue to monitor the situation. He also said that the president would not be allowed to travel to the Indian Ocean, where he had been living in exile for 13 years. His spokesman, Ahmed Adeeb, said he was not aware of any change in conditions of his office, but that \"the situation has improved significantly since the beginning of the year.\" \"The situation is very different from what it was in 2008, when the government was still in power,\" Anil told Reuters in an interview. But he added that there was \"no change\" in government policy since then, and that it would be difficult for him to leave office until the new government is in place. A spokesman for the prime minister, Sheikh Mohamad Abdulla, denied the allegations, saying \"there was no change at all.\" The government has said it will continue with its efforts to restore the status quo, which has led to widespread criticism from the international community. It has also called for an end to a three-year-old curfew that has been imposed on the island nation since September 2012. According to Reuters news agency, a curfew was imposed in response to allegations of human rights violations by the military, police and intelligence agencies, as well as a lack of security. On Tuesday, authorities said they had lifted the curfew imposed by a military-led military operation to protect the civilian population. However, they did not rule out the possibility of a return to civilian rule, according to an official statement. In the meantime, opposition parties have been calling for a general election in December. Opposition parties, however, have rejected the idea of an election. They say the election is a referendum on whether or not the constitution should be amended to allow the use of force. Opinion polls show that a majority of Maldivians support the ruling party's candidate for president in next year's presidential election, Yama Eni, who is widely seen as the most likely candidate to take the oath of office. Some opposition groups have also criticized the move, calling it an attempt to undermine the democratic process and to weaken the opposition's ability to win elections. 'The people are the ones who have the right to decide what they want to do,' one of them said, while another said the elections should not take place until elections are held in 2019. There are also concerns about a possible military takeover of power. Many people, including opposition figures, believe that elections will be held within the next few months. This is the first time that an incumbent president has ruled in more than a decade. Since the last elections in 2012, elections have not been held and there are no elections scheduled for this year. At the same time, there is no indication that any military intervention has taken place in any way. That is, until a new president is sworn in in March. And that is not likely to happen until at least the end of this month. What is certain is that all the political parties will have to work together to make sure that they are able to achieve their goals. For now, though, it is unclear what will happen next, given the current political situation in their own country. As a result, many people have expressed concern about the possible outcome of elections that could be called off, especially if they do not have a clear majority in parliament. So far, no one seems to be willing to give up their position on what is going on in this country, despite the fact that some opposition leaders have already announced their intention to run for office again. Most of those who are in opposition are not in favor of military rule and are opposed to any kind of change of government. Nor is there any chance of that happening. Last month, several opposition members of parliament voted against a constitutional amendment that would have allowed the parliament to pass a bill to remove the constitutional ban on military power, with the aim of making it easier for people to vote for candidates to get elected to parliament in 2018.

The previous day, the 56-year-old leader openly accused Germany and neighboring Poland of planning a coup against him. \"There were [in Germany and Poland] plans worked out for an overthrow of the constitutional order,\" Lukashenko said in the Belarusian capital, Minsk, on Thursday. \"This is not an invention of our intelligence agencies.\" Lukashenko, who came to power in 1994, was re-elected last month with 80 percent of the vote in what the opposition and international monitors said was a rigged election. Relations between the reclusive Belarusian government and the West have been strained ever since. 'Belarus question must be answered' German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said in a statement that the accusations were \"baseless\" and an attempt by Lukashenko to draw attention away from his own wrongdoing. \"The EU needs to find a clear political answer to events surrounding the presidential election and the continued incarceration of opposition politicians and their supporters,\" Westerwelle said. A wide-reaching crackdown against the regime's opponents followed Lukashenko's re-election. Hundreds of his critics were arrested and dozens threatened with long-term jail sentences. Poland also dismissed the accusations as absurd and said that relations with Minsk would not be normalized unless all political prisoners were released. Sanctions threat The situation in Belarus pushed the European Union to adopt a resolution on Thursday in support of economic sanctions against the country. The threats earned a sharp rebuke from Lukashenko, who promised the \"hardest possible reaction\" should the bloc impose sanctions against his country. At the same time, the Belarusian prime minister, Mikhail Myasnikovich, travelled to Moscow in a effort to shore up Russian support for Minsk during its standoff with the EU. That meeting ended with a Russian promise not to impose its own set of sanctions on Belarus over an unrelated spat over oil exports and a commitment to resume a nuclear power plant project shelved after the 1986 Chernobyl disaster.

        "generated_story": "Belarusian President's re-election marred by accusations of corruption Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko has won a second term as the country's president, despite allegations of widespread corruption. The former Soviet republic of Belarus has been embroiled in a political crisis since the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, which killed more than 1,000 people and displaced millions of people from their homes and businesses. On Thursday, the new president was sworn in by his predecessor, Mikhail Myasnikovich, as Belarus's first democratically elected president since 1994. He was also sworn-in as head of state on Friday, a day after his first term ended. \"I am not a politician, I am a human being,\" said Guido Westerwelle, who was elected on a platform of reconciliation and cooperation with the European Union (EU). \"But I have to say that it was a very difficult time for me to get elected,\" he added, adding that he was \"very disappointed\" by the results of Thursday's election. In the previous day's vote, Belarus had announced that its president would step down from his post in favor of a technocrat government. However, he did not rule out the possibility that his successor would be able to take over the reins of power in Belarus. According to the EU's foreign policy chief, Alexander Lushko, Ukraine's prime minister, Vladimir Putin and Belarus' president are also expected to seek a new term in office. Ukraine, Poland and Poland have also been accused of being involved in corruption in the past, with some of the allegations levelled against the former president's wife, Nancy Isenson (pictured above). Ukraine has also accused Belarus of attempting to influence the outcome of its presidential election, saying it had been rigged to favor a pro-Russian candidate. Poland has denied the accusations and said it is not aware of any such allegations. Russia has repeatedly denied any involvement in any electoral fraud, but has said that the situation in Minsk was not the result of an attempted coup. Belarus is one of several countries in which the current president is seeking to win a third term. It is also the first time that Belarusians have voted for a president who has not yet been elected to a full-term term, and has yet to make a decision on whether to allow him to run for another term of office, or whether he will be allowed to stay in power for the rest of his life. Author: Darren Mara, AFP, Reuters, AP, dpa/dpa (Reuters) (AFP) \"The country is still in turmoil,\" Poland's Prime Minister, Dmitry Medvedev, told reporters on Thursday after a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was absent from the meeting, according to Polish Foreign Ministry spokesman Dmitry Peskov. Polish foreign minister Sergei Rybak, however, said he had not seen any signs of Russian interference in his election and that Moscow had no intention of interfering with his vote. Ukrainian President Vladimir Vladislav Putin, meanwhile, was in attendance at the summit, where the two leaders discussed the future of relations between Belarus and Russia. Putin's spokesman, Sergei Shoigu, also said the Russian president could not be reached for comment on the election's outcome, citing a lack of coordination between his government and the opposition. But he also denied that Russia was behind the decision to use the vote as a pretext to try to prevent a possible coup, accusing it of \"playing politics with impunity.\" \"We are not going to interfere in this election,\" Putin said in an interview with Reuters. 'We will not interfere with our own elections,' he said, referring to his own government's decision not to recognize the legitimacy of Ukraine as an EU member state. His spokesman said: \"It is a matter of time before the elections are over. We will continue to work with Belarus to ensure that we have a fair and transparent process in order to resolve this issue.\" Russia's ambassador to Belarus, Nikolaj Zemlian, has called for an investigation into the matter. Moscow has rejected the idea that a coup could have been planned for this year's presidential elections. A spokesman for Belarus was quoted by Reuters as saying that \"we have no reason to believe that this is the case.\" The Russian foreign ministry said Russia would not intervene in Friday's elections, rather, it would seek to avoid a repeat of what happened in 1994, when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1986. This was the second time the Kremlin had tried to intervene. Last week, Russia accused Ukraine of trying to overthrow the government of manipulating the Ukrainian parliament. That was followed by a series of failed attempts to undermine the democratic process, including the resignation of former President Viktor Yanukov and his resignation as president of Poland. Since then, Putin has refused to accept that Ukraine was responsible for its role in setting up the referendum. And it's not clear whether the president will step aside, given the fact that Putin is no longer a member of NATO and other EU countries are still involved. Kremlin spokesman Vladimir Zhilov said Moscow is unlikely to do not"

        "target": "Berlin court rules Google Street View is legal in Germany A Berlin court has ruled that Google Street View is legal. But that doesn't mean the lawsuits will end, legal scholars say. A Berlin court has ruled that Google Street View is, in fact, legal in Germany. Last Tuesday, the Berlin State Supreme Court (Kammergericht) announced its decision in a court case from late last year, in which a woman had sued Google, fearing that photos of her, her family and the front of her house would be posted on Google Street View and would thus violate her property and privacy rights. The court ruled that it is legal to take photographs from street level, rejecting her argument that Google was trying to take unauthorized pictures. Part of her argument rested on the fact that Google used cameras mounted at three meters (9.84 feet) high, which could see over her two-meter-high hedge. However, the court did not find this argument convincing, given that the photographs were taken from the street, and not the sidewalk. Furthermore, because Google automatically blurs faces and license plates and did allow Germans to opt-out of the service to have their house obfuscated as well, the court did not find any potential violations. This is the first high-level court ruling, which cannot be appealed any further, regarding Street View since the service debuted in Germany at the end of last year. An ongoing debate Since Google announced plans to launch Street View in Germany last summer, debate around the service has become heated, with some politicians trying to stop it at every turn, while German Chancellor Angela Merkel famously said that she would not remove her house from Street View. In November 2010, the company announced that 244,000 German residents in the 20 cities had chosen to opt out of Street View - less than three percent of residents. However, in Germany and everywhere else, the company also allows people to report abuse, inaccuracies or request that something be blurred using an online tool. \"Our job is to develop services that respect these cultural differences,\" Peter Fleischer, Google's global privacy counsel told Deutsche Welle in November 2010. \"We try to anticipate them. We're all internationally-minded people ourselves. We try to guess how people will react to them. But a lot of these services are new and have never been on the market before, so we learn and we adapt as we go along.\" A 'landmark decision' European legal experts called the Berlin ruling a \"landmark decision,\" saying that this would now become part of German case law regarding property rights. \"Yes, other people are now warned: Don't sue Google simply claiming that Google Street View violates personality [or] property rights,\" wrote Thomas H\u00f6ren, a professor of media and communications law at the University of M\u00fcnster, in an e-mail sent to Deutsche Welle. But, he also warned that this decision was very narrow, focusing on the issue of property rights, and not on the larger issues of data protection from Google. \"The problem of Google Street View - to be honest - has never been a problem of personality rights or property rights, but the enormous risk of personal data compilations in cases where people use Google Street View for compiling personal profiles (such as building insurance companies; future employees, et cetera),\" he added. \"And this risk has not been considered by the Berlin courts.\" Similarly, Viktor Mayer-Sch\u00f6nberger, a professor at the Oxford Internet Institute, agreed that this case was \"limited in scope,\" adding in an e-mail, \"The plaintiff never alleged an actual invasion of privacy, just a potential one.\" Author: Cyrus Farivar Editor: Nancy Isenson",
        "generated_story": "A Landmark Decision on Google Street View in Germany The German state Supreme Court has ruled in favor of a landmark decision on the use of Google street view in the country. The decision, which is due to take effect in November 2010, is the first in a series of landmark decisions by the state court in Berlin. In November last year, the German parliament passed a law allowing Google to use street-view as a way to improve the image quality of the city's streets. But the court also ruled against the company, saying that it was not a good idea for the public to be able to see street views in their own city. \"It's not the right thing to do,\" said judge Thomas H\u00f6ren, who is a professor at the University of M\u00fcnster. He added that the decision was based on \"the fact that Google has made a mistake.\" The court's decision came after a long legal battle between Google and the Berlin state government. Google had argued that its street View technology was too expensive, and that there was no need for it. However, a German court had ruled that this was the wrong approach to the issue. According to a court ruling, Google did not have the legal authority to make a decision that would have allowed it to go ahead with the project, but instead had to wait until the end of November to decide whether or not it should be allowed to proceed with its project. It is unclear whether Google will appeal, or whether the ruling will be appealed, as it is currently pending in court. On the other hand, there is no doubt Google would be happy to have a project in place in which it can use the technology to enhance the quality and usability of its products and services. That is, if Google is willing to invest in something that is not in competition with other companies, such as Facebook, Twitter and Google's YouTube. Meanwhile, Germany's parliament has voted to allow the Internet giant to operate in its own country, with a view to expanding its presence in other European countries, including the United States, France, Spain, Italy, Japan, Russia, China, India, Australia and Japan. This is an important step for Google, since it has been a big part of German society for many years. For the past few years, it's been difficult to get a clear picture of what is going on in our country and how it will affect the future of our society. At the same time, we have seen a lot of changes in how we think about our own society and what we want to live in. There are a number of things that are important to us. One of them is that we don't have to look too far to find out what's going to happen, for example, in order to understand what will happen next. And that's a very important one. I think we can all agree on one thing: we need to work together to solve the problems that have been bothering us for so long. We can't just talk about the big picture. So we'll just look at what Google can do in terms of making the world a better place for us, rather than just making it a place where we live and work. If we do that, then we won't be doing anything about it, because we've already done so much to change the way we're living, right? And then there's the question of whether we should do something about this, too. What will Google do next? I'm not sure I can say for sure. After all, this is just a matter of time before we get to that point in time. Just ask Google. Or, what about Google itself? The company has already announced that they will start working on a new product, called Google Lens, that will allow us to create a Google-based service that can be used by all of us as well as the rest of Europe.

Google said in an interview with Deutsche Welle, \"We're not doing this for you.\" Google declined to comment, citing privacy concerns, when asked for comment. A Google spokesperson told the news agency that \"we're still working with our partners at Google,\" adding that he had no idea what to expect from the new company. Nevertheless, he pointed out that a company like Google was already working closely with Angela Merkel and her team at Berlin's Kammergericht (Google) to provide a solution for people who are interested in building a world-wide platform for their smartphones and tablets.

        "target": "In Argentina, red wine exports to balance Porsche imports About 100 Porsches are imported to Argentina each year. Now the country wants to keep a positive trade balance by having the value of the imported luxury cars matched by red wine exports. Porsche is currently enjoying record profits after a two-year downturn, but the export-reliant company has hit a pothole in Argentina. Buenos Aires-based Porsche importer Grupo Pulenta has signed an agreement obligating it to export several hundred bottles of red wine for each car it imports, the Argentine government announced Wednesday. Grupo Pulenta declined to comment when contacted by Deutsche Welle. Job creation During the past year, Argentina has held thousands of high-end vehicles in customs until companies agreed to export goods valued at the same amount. Most of those vehicles came from Germany. According to a spokeswoman for the Argentine embassy in Berlin, the country has been trying to safeguard domestic employment with a positive trade balance. \"Our government has negotiated with automakers to balance their imports of cars with an equivalent amount of exports,\" she told Deutsche Welle in a statement. \"Since March 2010 we have been working with the automakers and importers in order to increase local integration and reduce the trade deficit in this sector.\" Small market A Porsche spokesman said the company sells just short of 100 vehicles into Argentina each year. That compares to more than 40,000 sold worldwide during five months in 2010. \"For Porsche, Argentina is a rather small market,\" the spokesman told Deutsche Welle. \"Our importer, the Pulenta Group, also deals in wine. They have their own vineyards and export that wine. It has nothing to do with Porsche - we just have an import contract with them, and it seems they've found an individual solution with the Argentine government.\" Domestic production Volkswagen, which has an Argentine subsidiary producing the new \"Amarok\" pickup truck and transmissions, has thus far avoided mandatory exports. The company had reported an export surplus of 384 million euros ($545 million) for this year. Porsche's holding company owns 32.2 percent of Volkswagen, and the Porsche brand is intended to become integrated into Volkswagen's lineup. Daimler and BMW also have subsidiaries in Argentina. While Daimler produces its \"Sprinter\" there, BMW only imports to the country. According to the Argentine embassy in Berlin, the country has recently sought more domestic production by foreign car companies. Author: Gerhard Schneibel (dpa) Editor: John Blau",
        "generated_story": "Buenos Aires-based Porsche aims to balance red wine exports with red wines Argentina's largest carmaker is looking to boost its red-wine exports in a bid to reduce its dependence on German carmakers BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen. The country's second-largest automaker said it was looking for ways to cut costs by increasing its sales in Argentina by up to 384 million euros ($533 million) a year. \"We are looking at a number of different options,\" said Gerhard Schneibel, managing director of the company's Argentina arm, the Pulenta Group, in an interview with Deutsche Welle on Wednesday. He added that it would be \"very difficult\" to find a way to increase the amount of wine it exports to Argentina, where it has a market share of more than 1.5 percent over the past five months, compared with the same period in 2010. In addition, it will be able to import more wine from Argentina than it does in Germany, Germany and the United States, he said, adding that the country would have to make up for the loss of German wine in the coming years. Germany's Volkswagen, for example, has been the biggest importer of Argentine wine, with a total of 545 million bottles sold in March 2010, according to the German news agency dpa. This year, however, Porsche is aiming to double its wine sales to 6.4 million, up from 5.3 million in 2009. It also plans to invest in new production facilities in Buenos Aires, which will allow it to expand its production capacity to meet growing demand for new cars and new models. Volkswagen is also looking into the possibility of expanding its German production base, but has so far been unable to do so due to a lack of investment in its new plant in Amarok, Argentina. According to German media, BMW is planning to build a new factory there next year in order to improve the quality of its cars. BMW has also been investing heavily in Brazil and Argentina in recent years, as well as in Spain and Italy, and has invested more in Brazilian and Argentine wines than in any other country in Latin America. However, there is still a lot of uncertainty about the future of Brazilian wines, especially when it comes to production of new vehicles, such as BMW's Sprinter and Mercedes-Benz's Audi. And it's not just Argentina that is facing a tough time in terms of production. Argentina is one of several countries in which the world's top wine exporters, including the likes of Porsche, Mercedes and Audi, have been struggling to keep up with demand from the continent's most populous country, Brazil. Last year's sales figures for Argentina showed a slight increase of just over 1 percent, while Germany was the top exporter, followed by France and Germany. That's despite the fact that Brazil is the largest market for Brazilian wine. But the Argentine market is not the only one to be affected by the new tax law. Brazil's economy is growing at the fastest rate in Europe, a country that has seen a sharp drop in exports since the 2008 financial crisis, when the economy slumped to its lowest point in five years of recession. For the first time since 2008, Brazilian President Maurizio de Oliveira has said that he would like to see a return to growth in his country. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has called for an end to tax-free car sales, saying that \"tax increases are not a good thing for our economy and that we need to focus on the domestic market.\" In March, German President Jurgen Blau called on Argentina to take a step back from its current tax policy, calling it a \"big step forward\" in reducing its tax burden on foreign car buyers. His comments were echoed by a German newspaper: \"It's a big step backward for us. We're not going to give up on this, because we've already had a very good year.\" The Argentine government has already taken steps to limit the impact of tax increases on Argentine exports, though it is unlikely that Argentina will follow suit. On Wednesday, Volkswagen announced a plan to raise taxes on imported wine imports to cover the cost of imports from Brazil, Spain, Mexico and other Latin American countries. VW, Audi and BMW are among the countries that have the highest import bill for wine and beer. Meanwhile, VW and Porsche have also announced that they will increase their tax bill by 10 percent from their current level. Porsche has announced plans for a further increase in sales of their German-made cars, aimed at boosting its domestic production, to help reduce the costs of car imports. A spokesman for Volkswagen said the firm would not comment on whether or not it planned to introduce a tax increase on imports, citing \"a very important step.\" Volkswagen's tax reform bill is expected to come into force in coming months. If the government does not act on its own, that would mean a reduction in tax revenue, even if the price of a car will fall by at least a quarter of what it already has. Car sales are likely to go up by 20 percent this year"

The tournament will be held in Berlin, Germany's capital. Germany is hosting the inaugural edition of the tournament, which will take place in the city of Berlin. It is the first time that Germany has hosted a major international event in its history. In 2011, the country hosted the 2011 edition, and in 2012, it hosted its second edition. This time, however, there were only two teams: Germany and the Netherlands. \"Germany is going to be the host nation for the event,\" the German news agency Deutsche Welle said in a statement, adding that it would be \"a great honor\" for Germany to take part in such a prestigious event. According to the paper, \"the tournament is a great opportunity for women to showcase their talents in front of a global audience.\" The German team is expected to compete against other teams from around the world, including the United States, France, Spain, Italy, Russia, Japan, China, Australia, Canada, Mexico, Brazil and Russia. There will also be a host of international matches, with Germany playing host to both the 2010 and 2011 editions, as well as the 2014 edition in Brazil. German officials have said they are looking forward to hosting this year's tournament. However, they have yet to announce a date for it, according to a report by the newspaper. That would mean Germany would have to wait until the end of 2011 for a chance to play in an international competition. For the past two years, German women have been playing in international tournaments, but this time they've been unable to do so due to their lack of experience. Last year they were able to qualify through the qualifying round, where they faced off against France and Spain. They also faced the challenge of competing against Russia and Iran, respectively, in their first international tournament since the 1990s, when the two countries met in Moscow and Tehran. But the Germans are determined to make the most of their opportunity, despite the fact that they don't have a lot of time to prepare themselves for such an event, such as this one. And they're hoping to have the best of both worlds at the same time. After all, this is not just Germany that is playing the game of soccer. If they can't get there, then they will have no chance of making it to next year, because they haven't had the opportunity to win a medal in any other tournament in which they could have won a trophy. So they'll be looking for more than just a gold medal. To be fair, that's not an easy task, given that the women of Germany have already won the last two World Cups in Germany. Nevertheless, their chances of winning the next one are still very slim, especially in light of what is happening in other countries. As a result, many German fans are hoping that their country will get to experience the success of this tournament again. (Reuters, AFP, dpa, Reuters) \"We are very excited about the prospect of hosting a tournament like this,\" said one fan, who wished to remain anonymous for fear of being accused of spreading false rumors. She added that \"we are not the only country that wants to see this kind of thing happen.\" \"It's a very important event for us,\" she added, noting that she hopes to become a model for other nations to follow in her footsteps. 'We want to show that we can do this for ourselves and for our own country,\" added another fan. Meanwhile, other women are also hoping for another chance at success. Many of them are eager to join the ranks of women in sport. Some of those who have played in recent years have expressed their interest in becoming world champions, while others are just waiting for their chance. Others, like Germany, have also expressed a desire to get involved with the sport in some way. One of these women, for example, has already made it clear that there is no shortage of talent in this field. I think we will see more women who are willing to try and make it happen. We are hopeful that a few more countries will come to Germany as soon as possible. More than a year later, we'll see how many more teams will join us, if not more, than we did last year. What do you think will happen? We hope we have enough talent and experience to achieve this goal? I hope so. Let's see if we get the results we want, right now, at least for now.\" In the coming months, I'm sure that many of us will try to find a way to reach the top of our game, she said. With the help of German media, a number of media outlets are already working on their own projects. Read more: \"I'm very happy that I've already had a successful career in sports.

        "target": "Beekeepers battle mites with technology Bees are useful, hard-working and vital for our ecosystem. Aside from making honey, bees pollinate most of our food crops. But summertime is also the season for one of the biggest threats to honey bees \u2013 the varroa mite. Dete Papendieck puts on a white veiled protective hat and takes out a metal jug with a beak-shaped spout. He sets fire to the container's contents \u2013 formic acid \u2013 and starts directing the smoke that is wafting at the beehives lined up in front of him in his garden on the outskirts of Bonn. The acid doesn't harm the bees, but it does kill the varroa mites, he says. And July, after most of the honey has been harvested, is the best time to treat his hives. The one millimeter-large varroa mite is a parasite that infests beehives and lays its eggs in the honeycombs, alongside the bees' larvae. \"It feeds on the bees' and the bee brood's blood, the so-called haemolymph,\" Papendieck explains. A third of bees killed in Germany Papendieck is an apiarist at the Bee Research Institute at the University of Bonn and he knows that the threat of mites is serious. If left untreated, varroa-infested colonies rarely survive a winter. In 2010, German beekeepers lost about 200,000 hives to the mite \u2013 one third of Germany's total bee population. And it is not just the honey and beeswax production that are affected by the mite. Many of our food crops depend on bees: Some 80 percent of all agricultural plants and 90 percent of fruit trees in Europe are pollinated by Apis mellifera, the European honeybee. Varroa introduced from Asia Had Dete Papendieck been a beekeeper forty years ago he would not have had to worry about mites. He says the varroa mite that was originally native to Asia, was introduced to Europe in the 1970s. \"It happened during a research project in which it was attempted to crossbreed the European honeybee with the Asian honeybee. The researchers were exchanging bee colonies between Europe and India, and that is how the mites came to Germany,\" Papendieck said. Unlike Asian bee species, the European honeybee cannot fight off the varoa mite by itself. According to Papendieck, bees easily transmit the mite to other beekeepers' hives in what apiarists call robbery. \"It happens when certain colonies are being robbed by other bees. Large numbers of bees from different colonies attack weak hives and steal their stocks. At the same time, parasites and diseases are exchanged\", he says. Researchers have been trying to breed varroa-resistant mites, but so far they haven't had much success. High-tech tools help fight the mite Klaus Maresch is also worried about his bees. He is an organic beekeeper from Bonn and he has been passionate about bees since he was a little boy. \"They are part of my family. When I open my hives and smell the honey and hear the buzzing of the bees it's like being in another world,\" he told Deutsche Welle. In addition to using formic acid to fight the mite, Klaus Maresch employs a high-tech tool \u2013 a special cylindrical scale that helps him determine when it is best to start the varroa treatment. \"Every day this hive scale sends data about the colonies to our server. The data, such as the temperature in the hive and the amounts of nectar and pollen collected, help me to find a good day to treat varroa,\" Maresch says. Maresch also makes the data about the activities in his hives available to fellow beekeepers who can treat their colonies accordingly. A driver's license for beekeepers? But it is not the mite that angers Maresch most. \"That's nature,\" he says, \"I feel angry about beekeepers who don't fight varroa. If the bees of neighboring beekeepers are infested, I also have a problem.\" The existing German pest regulation obliges beekeepers to treat their bees against varroa, but there are no strict controls. The majority of Germany's more-than-80,000 beekeepers are amateurs who keep between one and 20 colonies. This makes it difficult to impose and survey certain quality standards. Maresch, who sees himself as a kind of 'bee activist', would like to see the government introduce stricter rules. \"There should be a law that obliges every new beekeeper to learn about beekeeping before they are allowed to keep bees. They should get an education and there should be something like a driver's license for beekeepers,\" he says. In the mean time, Europe's bees are going to have to",

He has built a large hive that can be used to control the pests in the wild. The hive has been used for over two decades in India, China, India and India. It is the first hive to be built in Germany, and it is one of the most technologically advanced hive systems in Europe. According to the Bee Research Institute in Bonn, Germany's largest city, the hive is designed to protect the bees from pests and diseases. \"It is a very sophisticated hive system that is able to withstand the harsh conditions of a tropical climate,\" said Dr. Klaus Maresch, a professor of entomology at the university. In the 1970s and 1980s, it was used as a hive for honeybees. But in recent years it has become increasingly difficult for the insects to escape. For example, in 2010 the honeybee hive was shut down, leaving only a few bees left in it. This was due to a lack of bees, which is why the bee research institute had to shut it down for a year and a half. Now it's back in operation, with more bees being brought in to help protect bees and other pollinators. There is no shortage of honey bees in Asia, but this is not the case for Europe, where bees are not allowed to use honey in their honey-making process. Instead, they have to make honey from scratch. That's how they do it, because they can't get honey out of their hive. And they don't need honey. They just need to get it out. So they're going to have honey, honey and honey to keep them warm and dry. With the help of an expert in beekeeping, this hive will keep bees warm for as long as they need it to, according to Dr Katja Ketels, who runs a bee-keeping laboratory in Munich. Ketels' lab is located on the outskirts of Munich, near the German border with the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. She says she's been working on a honey bee hive since 2010, when she was a student at a university in Bavaria. Since then, she and her husband have been using honey as honey substitutes for beekeepers in other parts of Europe and the Middle East and Africa. However, there's still a lot of work to do before they are ready to go, as well as the need for bees to stay healthy and to maintain their health. As a result of this, her lab will be open again in July and August, so she can continue to work on her honey hive in her home country of India until the end of next year. Her lab also has a lab in Delhi where she works on honeymaking technology. 'I'm very happy with my honey,' she said, adding that she hopes it will help her bees get a better understanding of what honey is made of and what it means to live in an environment where honey isn't available to them. I'm also happy for my bees because I think that's a good way to spend my time and money, especially when it comes to honey,\" she told Deutsche Welle in a recent interview with journalist Nathan Witkop. PAPENDIEck said he hopes the new hive would help to reduce the risk of diseases like malaria and tuberculosis. His lab has already found a cure for these diseases, he added, noting that it would be possible to prevent the spread of malaria, tuberculosis, AIDS, HIV and AIDS in Africa and Asia by the year 2030, if it were to become a major cause of disease outbreaks. A new honey bomb is currently being developed to combat the diseases that plague the world's honey industry, said Ketsch. Tensions between the two countries have also been rising in some areas of Asia and Europe over the past couple of decades, particularly in China and Japan. Last year, German researchers said that the country's bee industry was suffering from the effects of climate change and deforestation. Nevertheless, their research is continuing to improve, despite the fact that there are still many diseases and pests that are resistant to insecticides and pesticides, such as salivates, that could be treated with antibiotics and antibiotics. Meanwhile, researchers are also looking for new ways to treat the problem that has arisen from pesticide use and pesticide abuse. Experts say that this could help prevent diseases from spreading to other countries, since the insect population is growing rapidly and that honey production is expected to increase by at least one-third by 2050. What do you think will happen? \"I think we'll find out for sure,\" he said. Scientists are currently working to find a solution to this problem, while the government has yet to develop a vaccine that will prevent them from becoming more susceptible to disease. Researchers have already started to see the effect of pesticides and herbicides, including the pesticide glyphosate-based pesticide that kills honey mites and can cause them to die. Some experts said they hope that"

        "target": "Heidi hits the Big Screen Heidi, the world famous girl from the Swiss Alps who first appeared in a novel 121 years ago, has hit the big screen in a fresh look. A century after the death of Heidi inventor Johanna Spyri, the lovable Alpine heroine is being portrayed in a new film which replaces grassy slopes and mountainous range with city skyscrapers and city streets. The $ 3.5 million \"Heidi\", funded by the Z\u00fcrich-based film company Vega and directed by German film maker Markus Imboden, is to be launched in Germany on Thursday. The making of the film was one of the highlights of a past year of events including exhibitions, lectures and fireworks celebrating the July 7 2001 centenary of the death of Spyri, whose novel \"Heidi\" sold 20 million copies and has been translated in 50 languages worldwide. It is thought to be one of the most successful books of all times. The book has inspired 17 films, including Shirley Temple\u2019s Oscar winning portrayal of Heidi in 1937 and a Japanese cartoon series. Imboden\u2019s remake is the 18th \"Heidi\" film. Blue hair in Berlin According to Vega, \"the film was transmitted to today\u2019s world without losing sight of the original novel\". But Imboden\u2019s new movie is far from the charming original, with its rosy-cheeked, curly-headed Heidi, delicate Clara and goat-tending shepherd Peter\u2019s frail old grandmother. In the first film, Heidi, who lives happily with her grandfather in a tiny hut in the Swiss Alps is plucked from her contented life by her Aunt Dete to live in a stiff, rich family in the bustling metropolis, Frankfurt. Heidi becomes so home-sick, she starts to sleepwalk and is eventually sent home. But not before she causes confusion in the otherwise prim household and brings laughter in the life of the disabled and homely, Clara. The Heidi in the latest film has blue hair, surfs the net and roams the streets of Berlin. Friend and shepherd Peter sheds his rustic pastimes and whizzes down streets on his mountainbike. Clara is not the weak, lame young girl of the Spyri novel, but a moody Britney Spears wannabe. Aunt Dete is a modern-day stylist living fashionably in the German capital. The new surroundings are a far cry from the tranquil days of cow milking, goat- tending and flower-plucking in the verdant meadows of the Swiss Alps. Transforming the Heidi myth According to a Berlin daily, the remake is a \"refreshing Heidi\", adding that the script writers had managed to transform the Heidi \"myth\" into an independent, self-assured girl and not into a \"transfigured mountain heroine\". However, it is just this portrait of a naive and charming alpine heroine that has made Heidi so popular all over the world. Heidi has become a well-known Swiss brand worldwide. Some 60,000 tourists \u2013 half from Japan \u2013 are said to visit the picturesque wine-growing village in Graubuenden, which boasts the original Heidi House and other Heidi related attractions such as winding mountain trails and pastures. Imboden\u2019s film, which is to be launched in Germany on Thursday, will also open elsewhere in Europe, and may reach fans in Japan and South Korea too. Whether Imboden\u2019s blue-haired, computer savvy Heidi will charm her Asian viewers, however, remains to be seen.",
        "generated_story": "The Remake of Heidi in the Swiss Alps A century ago, Heidi House was one of Germany\u2019s most famous homes. Now, it has been restored to its former glory. The house, which is located in Dete, is a UNESCO World Heritage site. It was built in 1937 by German architect Markus Imboden and his wife, Johanna Spyri, and their two children, Clara and Peter, who lived there from 1937 to 2001. They are now living in a house in Graubuenden, near the German city of Frankfurt, where they have been living for 121 years. \"The house is the most beautiful house I have ever seen in my life,\u201d said the house's owner, Josef Vega, in an interview with The New York Times. \u201cIt's a beautiful place, with a wonderful view of the Alps. I am so happy to be here, I can't wait to see it again. There is so much beauty in this house. You can see how it looks and feel. And you can feel the warmth and warmth of someone who has lived in it for so long. So many people have come and gone, but I think it will be a long time before we see Heidi again, because she is such an iconic figure in Germany. She was so beautiful and so well-known in her own right, that it was hard to believe that she could have lived here. But she did. In the past year, she has become a model for her children and grandchildren. On Thursday, her son Peter was born and she was given a new home. He is currently living with his mother, his father and stepfather. His father is also an architect and he has worked on a number of architectural projects, including the building of his own house and the construction of a windmill. When he was a child, he had a passion for architecture and architecture, so he wanted to create a home for his children. That passion led him to become an artist and to make a living as a painter and sculptor. For his part, the artist has created a series of paintings, sculptures and sculptures that depict Heidi and her husband, Peter. Some of these paintings depict her in their own way, while others show her as an actress, singer, model, actress and model. These are the works that have inspired her to write a book about her life and career. One of her most enduring works, \"Heidi House,\" was created by her daughter Clara, a German-born actress who lives in Berlin. Her husband Peter has also been a photographer for more than a century and is now a director for a film company, The German Film and Television Archive. A year after his death in 2009, Vega is still working on his next project: a documentary about his life in his home town. This documentary is set to premiere on Netflix in September. If you want to watch the documentary, you have to go to the website and watch it on the Internet.

Even the best homes have a very low price tag: $ 3.5 million (about $3.6 million). The film is based on an 18-year-old documentary that was made by a Swiss filmmaker, filmmaker and photographer, Jann\u00c3\u0080\u009ds father, director and screenwriter, Hans-Joachim, based in Frankfurt. According to his website, this documentary was produced in 2002 and was directed by his son, Franz, an Austrian-American photographer and director of film and TV production company. Director of photography for the film, Wolfgang van den Helder, said that the movie was inspired by the work of filmmaker Franz Kafka, whose work was published in 2006. Franz and Joanna spyri are also the subject of an Oscar-nominee film. Both of their films are set in German cinemas and are based at the home of Franz's father Franz-Josef's home in Dresden, Switzerland. Film director Franz Vega said he is \"very pleased with the success of this project, especially the production.\" \"I am very pleased that Franz has done a great job,\" he said, adding that he hopes to return to Germany in time for an upcoming documentary. However, there are still a lot of questions about the project. Most of them, however, are about how Franz is going to get his money back. After all, when he died in 2010, they were still living at home and had no idea what he would do with it all the way back then. What Franz had planned to do was to give Franz a chance to find out more about Franz. Last year Franz was murdered by an unknown assailant. Since then, Austria and Germany had been planning to build a replica of him. Austria, Sweden and Switzerland had already made plans to release a movie about him as soon as he could get a copy of \"Hijinx' (and"

But now they should take care that Great Britain does not move further away from Europe, writes Birgit Maass. If only they had done it out of full conviction. If they at least believed that they could really benefit their country by withdrawing from the EU. But many of the parliamentarians whose vote will finally set Brexit on its wayhave voted against their hearts, as well as their minds. It was a vote against their minds, because the withdrawal from the EU will almost certainly, at least on a short to medium term basis, have negative repercussions for the British economy. And it was a vote against their hearts, because for many, a view of the future, divorced from Brussels and increasingly reliant on an unpredictable US President Donald Trump, is somewhat alarming. In recent days, many members of parliament have described it as \"a catastrophe.\" No vote \"against the will of the people.\" Of course there are \"Brexiteers\" who believe that a Britain independent of Brussels will be able to return to its former greatness, once it is no longer held back by the \"Little Europeans.\" But they are in the minority - the majority of parliamentarians already declared their support for remaining in the EU during the referendum campaign. Yet despite this, Theresa May's government was able to push its legislative proposal through the House of Commons without any great difficulty. The predominant view, also amongst members of the two leading parties, is that to hinder Brexit and to fail to support the government in its endeavors to do so, would be to go \"against the will of the people.\" Anti-EU newspapers have targeted Brexit opponents. And those who have publically come out in support of the EU have had to reckon with death threats. The at times passionate debate in the lower house, that went on over several days, was a temporary highlight in this European tragedy, which in the worst case could contribute to the continent disintegrating into individual sovereign states. Don't be intimidated The British public supports the hard-line position taken by Prime Minister May in withdrawing from the common market. Polls are showing that her strategy is gaining increased support. There is no turning back now. The British are now looking for clarity on the repercussions of their withdrawal from the EU. They want the negotiations with the EU to start as soon as possible. It was an historical misjudgement by David Cameron that he could win the referendum. Most of the members of the lower house believed the then-prime minister and voted to hold a referendum. But now they can no longer stop Brexit. But they should not let themselves be intimidated by party discipline, nor the leading Brexiteers, nor by voter impatience. Over the next two years they should use every chance they can to influence the withdrawal process. May announced that although they are leaving the European Union, they will not be moving away from Europe. The parliamentarians must now hold her to her word. Have something to say? Add your comments below. The thread will stay open for 24 hours after publication.",
        "generated_story": "Britain's Brexit vote is not a referendum against the will of the people British Prime Minister Theresa May has called for a second referendum on the future relationship between the European Union and Britain. The House of Commons voted overwhelmingly to leave the EU on March 29, triggering a two-year transitional period in which Britain will have to make up its mind whether to stay in the bloc or leave it. This is the first time that the British people have voted in favor of leaving the 28-nation bloc. It is also the second time since the referendum that they have rejected the idea of a \"hard Brexit,\" which would have left Britain without a single EU member state for two years. \"The people of Great Britain should have the right to decide their own future,\" said Birgit Maass, a member of parliament for the Northern Ireland region. She added: \"They should be able to have a say in what they want to do with their country, and they should not be forced to choose between a hard Brexit or a soft Brexit.\" The British government's position on Brexit is that it wants to keep the single market and the customs union in place, but that's not the case at the moment. In the meantime, the UK will continue to be governed by the Single Market, which is set to take effect in March 2019, with the exception of Article 50 (EU) and Article 60 (UK), which will remain in force until the end of March 2021. That would mean that Britain would no longer be subject to EU rules and regulations. But that doesn't mean it won't be a difficult time for Britain to get on with its life in Europe. Britain's EU membership is a key part of its future relations with Europe and that is why it is so important for it to remain so. And it's also important that we have an open and transparent relationship with our European partners, so that people can decide for themselves whether or not they are willing to accept the terms and conditions of an EU-wide free movement of people. There is no such thing as a free-trade agreement. What is free and open for everyone? The EU is an important partner in our relationship and we are committed to working together to ensure that this is done in a fair, orderly and orderly way. However, there is still a lot of uncertainty about how this relationship will play out, particularly in relation to the Brexit process. For example, it would be impossible for us to agree on a deal that would allow for an orderly transition of power between EU and UK without the need for any kind of transitional arrangement. So, what does this mean for British citizens? It means that there will be no change in their lives, in terms of how they live and what their future will look like? That's the question that has been asked of us for 24 hours. We are not going to give up on this, because we don't want this to happen to them. I think we need to move on to other issues, such as immigration, immigration and trade. If we do that, then we will get to a point where we can get a good deal out of this. As I said in an interview with The Daily Telegraph earlier this week, \"We want a better deal for our people, not just for ourselves.\" That is exactly what we want, as we've seen from the US, Europe, Britain and other European countries. With Brexit, we expect to see more and more EU countries to come into the negotiating table, including the United States, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Japan, China, Russia, Turkey and China. These are the countries that are most likely to vote against Brexit in this referendum. They are also expected to back the plan to create a new EU with a majority of EU members. Many of these countries have already voted against it, while some of them are still opposed to Brexit. You can read more about that here.

        "target": "French presidential debate does little to woo undecided voters This year's French presidential race is perhaps the most closely watched election in recent history. Many voters are still undecided, including those in the Paris caf\u00e9 where DW's Jake Cigainero saw the latest TV debate. Just over two weeks ahead of the first round of voting in France's presidential election, all 11 candidates met for the second televised debate of the campaign. It was the first time in the history of French elections that the entire official ballot shared a television stage. This race for the Elysee is perhaps the most closely watched election in the history of the Fifth Republic in view of conservative candidate Francois Fillon's embezzlement charges, the deterioration of the left, political amateur Emmanuel Macron's surprise surge to the top, and the rise of Marine Le Pen's National Front. With so much media attention on the five main candidates, Tuesday's debate felt almost like a consolation for the six other candidates rarely in the spotlight. For French voters watching the televised debate at Cafe des Phares on Place de la Bastille, the saturated stage kept the candidates from detailed discussion of pressing issues. For those who are still undecided, the debate did little to bring them closer to choosing their pick for president. Vincent Couronne, a researcher, said it was good to see candidates who don't get as much media attention. However, 11 candidates at once for the political spectator was overkill. \"It wasn't very interesting. It's just one position after another. There's no real debate. It's not like when it was just five candidates.\" Boredom all round Charlotte Theuvenin and her friends, all students in their early 20s, tuned out early on from boredom and exasperation. \"It was too flat and too hypocritical. Fillon and Le Pen play with our money, then say they did nothing and that they are good for our country,\" she said. As though addressing the candidates in front of her on the TV screen, she added, \"How dare you talk about being president when you use our money for your own interests.\" Le Pen had come under fire over accusations that she misused public funds to pay bodyguards as parliamentary assistants. Francois Fillon of Les Republicains, meanwhile, is under investigation for allegedly paying family members more than 1 million euros ($1.1 million) for government work they never carried out. Frequently casting a blank stare at his opponents, Fillon also seemed bored, or at least more subdued compared to the first debate. Couronne said, \"Fillon seems to be not there. Probably because he knows all the small candidates can attack him on the criminal offenses he's accused of.\" Debate watchers cited Europe as the most important issue of this election, with many fearing Le Pen's promise to tear France out of the European Union in a so-called Frexit. Though no one at the cafe vocally supported Le Pen's plan, several acknowledged the EU is a pressure point for France. \"France's place in Europe in relation to Germany is a very important issue,\" said student Thibault Cirier. \"The general problem is France has lost its influence at the European level over the years, and that needs to be remedied, because France is one of the founders of Europe and should have a strong place in the union. The EU is also important for cohesion and to have a strong position internationally.\" Caf\u00e9 viewers say no to Le Pen Cirier was initially excited by Macron when he launched his campaign, but ultimately decided there was no substance. Now he says he will probably vote for far-left candidate Jean-Luc Melenchon. Kevser Taspinar also said she liked Melenchon for his fighting spirit and that \"he throws barbs.\" As a practicing Muslim who wears a headscarf, she said the most important issue for her is laicite, France's state institution of secularism. \"For me Hamon has the best interpretation of this. Maybe Hamon,\" Taspinar said hesitating. \"I'm still undecided, because there's Melenchon.\" Another viewer, Marie Dubois, said that although she really liked Melenchon, she had definitively decided on Macron. \"Melenchon has a way of putting humanity in politics and giving hope,\" she said. \"But Macron is the only possible candidate.\" With polls putting Le Pen and Macron in the second round on May 7, the undecided voters at this Paris cafe said they were certain which candidate they would not for vote for in that scenario. \"Definitely Macron. There is no way I am going to vote for Le Pen,\" Theuvenin said. \"I will never vote for that woman or Front National, no matter who is running against them in the second round.\" Tuesday was the final debate for Macron and Melenchon, two of the crowd-pleasers among the candidates. Both have pulled out of the third debate on grounds that it cuts too close to the first vote just two days later on April 23.",
        "generated_story": "France's Le Pen: 'No, No' The French National Front's candidate for the French presidential election has said she wants to leave the European Union. The party's presidential candidate, Francois Fillon, said on Tuesday that he was \"no\" to leaving the EU. \"I don't want to be a member of the Union,\" he said, referring to the country's Muslim majority. But he also said he would like to see a change in France's constitution, which has been in place for more than two decades. He said that if he were elected president, he'd be able to change the constitution and create a new constitution that would make it easier for people to vote for him. However, that doesn't mean he's going to stick around. In fact, it would be very difficult for a candidate like him to stay in power long enough to win the presidency. That's not to say he won't try to make a difference in the future, as he did in his first year in office, when he ran for president of France in 2015. And that's exactly what he has done so far: He's made a lot of promises, but he hasn't made any of them come true. For example, on May 7, his wife, Charlotte Theuvenin, told DW that she would not be voting for his presidential bid because she was in her early 20s. She added that her husband, Thibault Cirier, was also a student at the University of Hamon, and that his father was a Muslim. On April 23, she said her father had died in a car accident, leaving her with no memory of him at all. Since then, the party has struggled to find a way out of a difficult situation. It's been a long time since it was possible to get into a political party, so it's no surprise that the Front National candidate has made the most of her time in politics. At the time of his death in April 2016, her mother, Marie Dubois, had been living in Paris for over a year. Her father, Vincent Couronne, worked as a waiter at a French restaurant. When she returned to Paris in May, they said they were still in their early 30s and had no idea what to expect when they arrived. They said their father's death was the result of their mother's illness. So they had to wait until the end of April for her to come back to France. Then they went on to form their own party. Now they have to decide whether or not they want a second chance. If they do, then they will be forced to choose between the right and the left. After all, France is not the only country in Europe that has a right to a free and open economy. There are many other countries that have a similar system of government, such as Germany, Austria, Italy, Spain and Germany. France, Germany and France are also part of that system. French President Emmanuel Macron, who was elected in June's election, is the first French president to have been elected from the Fifth Republic. His father is a Catholic and his mother was from a small town in eastern France and was born in Marseillais, where he grew up. Both his parents are Muslims. Their father and mother are French citizens and he is from Paris. While they are Muslim, their fathers are from France as well as from their home country of Brittany. Despite the fact that they speak the language of Islam, French Muslims are not allowed to speak French. This is their first time hearing French and their parents speak English. Many French-speakers, however, have never heard of French or German speakers speaking French in French, despite their faith in Islam. These are the people who have spoken out in favor of Macron's candidacy. Some of those who do speak Spanish and French speak German, while others speak Arabic. Others, though, say they think French is more tolerant of Muslims and are more open to French culture and language than the rest of Europe. Most of these people are young, or at least they believe that is what French people think. Nevertheless, many French voters are against the idea of an EU-wide \"Frexit,\" which would allow them to live in an Islamic country. According to one poll, one in five people voted for Macron in 2016. Another poll showed that a third of voters were against him, with a total of 1.1 million votes. One in 10 voters said the vote was against Macron. More than half (1.2 percent) of respondents were from Muslim countries. (AFP, Reuters, dpa) (Reuters, AFP, AP) The poll also showed a large number of young people voting against his candidacy, compared to just over two-thirds of all candidates in recent elections. Among them, only one said it could be possible that Macron would win. What's more surprising is that most people in this country have not heard about the candidate's views on the campaign trail. How many people support him? They say it is difficult to understand what they don"

Smuggling has prompted a visit to Mexico City by US Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly. Prosecutors said the remote town of Las Varas in Chihuahua state was the scene of Wednesday's battle between affiliates of the Ciudad Juarez cartel and a gang from the state of Sinaloa. Police said fighting escalated when patrols arrived. Fourteen people were found dead; 12 others were hospitalized. Grenades, launchers and rifles were found. The mountainous region is used as a corridor for smuggling into the US. El Chapo effect Chihuahua security commissioner Oscar Alberto Aparicio said a Black Hawk helicopter was called in as police chased surviving gang members through the area known for marijuana and opium poppy production. Two police officers had been killed in a \"cowardly\" way in the area a week ago, he said. In a similar incident last Friday, 17 gunmen were killed during a shootout with police on a highway in Sinaloa, Mexico's northwestern state. Sinaloa was the home base of Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, whose extradition to the US in January apparently left gangsters in a struggle for control of criminal syndicates. Homicides have surged in recent months, with the number of persons killed in May put at 2,186, the highest since the collection of such statistics began 20 years ago. Nieto and Kelly to talk In Mexico City Wednesday, President Enrique Pena Nieto's office said he and visiting US Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly had discussed how to rein in organized crime groups. \"Shared responsibility\" must become the focus of transnational efforts, Kelly said. Narcotics smuggling into the US has become a multibillion-dollar (multibillion-euro) business for Mexican drug cartels. Mexico in turn wants the US to throttle demand for narcotics and the supply of illegal weapons to Mexico cartels. Pena Nieto and US President Donald Trump, who wants a border wall, are schedule to meet Friday on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany. ipj/ng (AP, AFP, dpa)",
        "generated_story": "US Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly visits the scene of a gunbattle in northern Mexico on Wednesday. US Secretary of State John Kerry has visited the site of an attack by Mexican drug traffickers Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, who has been jailed for 20 years for drug trafficking, in Mexico's northern state of Sinaloa. The attack was the latest in a string of violent clashes between drug cartels in the country's north and south. Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto has vowed to crack down on the cartels, saying he will not allow them to gain access to his country. \"We are going to do everything in our power to protect our people,\" he told reporters in Las Varas, near the border with Mexico City. He said he would visit the area on Friday to assess the situation, adding that \"we will be doing everything we can to prevent this from happening again.\" US President Donald Trump has called on Mexico to cooperate with the Mexican government in its fight against the drug cartel, which he has accused of killing thousands of people in his own country in recent years. Trump's comments came a week ago, when he said Mexico was \"not ready\" for a new president. On Wednesday, Trump said the US was ready to step up its efforts to counter the cartel's activities in southern Mexico. In a statement, the White House said Trump had called for an end to the violence, but that Mexico would not give up on protecting its citizens. 'We will continue to stand with our partners in this fight,' the statement said. It did not say whether Trump was referring to Mexico as a \"hostile state\" or whether it was a threat to US national security. But it did say that it would be \"a very tough fight\" to stop it, and that he was willing to take any step necessary to ensure the safety of the people who live there. Last week, Mexican authorities said they had arrested a drug trafficker who was suspected of being behind the attack. They also said that they were looking into whether he had been involved in other crimes, such as the murder of Mexican journalist Oscar Alberto Aparicio (AFP, AP, dpa, Reuters) and other Mexican officials, including the head of intelligence, were also present at the crime scene. Officials said there was no indication that the suspect was cooperating with US authorities. However, they added that there were \"no indications of any imminent threat\" from the suspected drug lord. A spokesman for the president's security team told the Associated Press news agency that a search warrant was being issued for his arrest. Mexico has repeatedly denied any involvement in any criminal activity, insisting it is not a case of human rights violations.

The G20 summit in Hamburg is expected to be held on Thursday in Germany, Germany and the United States in January, with a focus on cooperation between the two countries, according to German Chancellor Angela Merkel and German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel. According to a report by the German newspaper Bild, a meeting between German and Mexican security officials was scheduled for Friday in Berlin, where the summit is being held, to discuss a possible summit between Trump and European leaders. If the meeting was to go ahead as planned, it could take place as early as next week. Germany's foreign minister, Jose Manuel Lopez Obrador, said in an interview with AFP that his government was prepared to meet with German officials and discuss the issue of security cooperation. Kelly, however, refused to comment on whether or not he planned to attend the talks, citing the lack of cooperation from other countries. Speaking at a news conference, he added: \"I don't think we have to talk about this. I think it's a matter of time before we get to that point.\" The meeting is scheduled to begin at 10:30 a.m. (09:00 GMT) \"It's an important time for us to get a handle on what's going on here,\" Kelly said, speaking to reporters after the event. More than 80,000 people have been arrested so far this year. Many of those arrested are believed to have fled to Germany. Some of them are still awaiting trial, while others are being sought by authorities in neighboring Mexico for possible deportation. Other suspects have also been charged with crimes against humanity, as well as for attempted murder, kidnapping and torture. Authorities have not yet charged any suspects in connection with their alleged crimes. Reuters/AFP/File/Reuters/AP, AFP/Jose Luis Rodriguez/dpa/jm (Reuters)Mexico's president, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, called the incident \"an act of terrorism\" by his predecessor, President Xi Jinping, was also briefed by German President Vladimir Putin, about the possibility of extradition talks with Trump.

        "target": "Italy's navy to patrol with Libyan ships to curb human trafficking Italy wants to work more closely with Libya to limit the number of sea crossings by migrants and potential asylum seekers. But what are the consequences? Italy's prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni, does not want to wait any longer for EU countries to show solidarity in distributing asylum seekers throughout the bloc. On Thursday he announced in Rome that the Italian navy would be patrolling with Libyan ships just off the Libyan coastline. The aim, Gentiloni says, is to curb human trafficking and bring migrants back from the smugglers' boats to Libya. According to the Italian government's figures, 93,000 migrants have arrived in Italy so far this year. At least 2,000 have drowned in the attempt to cross the Mediterranean - the true figure is unknown. Italy has already threatened to stop allowing boats carrying rescued migrants to dock in Italian ports, or that it may issue migrants with documents that would allow them to travel on to other European countries. Rome has not yet implemented either policy, but the government has made clear that Italy will soon run out of options. The EU Commissioner for Migration Dimitris Avramopoulos acknowledged, again, in Brussels on Thursday that \"Europe continues to face high migratory pressures. And Italy more than (almost) any others.\" The European Commission issued a letter offering more aid and personnel to help manage migration better. Accommodation will soon be full The office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, wrote at the beginning of July that \"Close to 200,000 accommodation places are available for refugees and migrants across [Italy], but are nearly all full.\" The High Commissioner referred particularly to the numbers of people dying when he warned, \"What is happening in front of our eyes in Italy is an unfolding tragedy.\" The United Nations anticipates that another 100,000 migrants will come to Italy via Libya before the end of this year. The number of arrivals is already 20 percent higher than last year; and the number of dead, those who could not be saved, would rise accordingly. According to UN estimates, the Mediterranean remains the \"deadliest\" refugee route in the world. Italian government statistics say that around 600,000 people have arrived in Italian ports since the start of the crisis in 2014. It is unclear how many have since traveled on to Austria, France or Switzerland. Once migrants are registered in Italy and accommodated in camps, they are not held there. If, however, they leave the accommodation without giving notice, they forfeit their claim to subsistence and social services. Most of the migrants are from African countries, and many try to travel on to France, for example. 300 people are currently sleeping on the beach in Ventimiglia, on the French border, hoping to take a bus or train to France. However, the border is being policed by French officials. Migrants who are caught are sent back to Italy. Austria has announced that it too will close its border with Italy if the number of migrants starts to rise. Repatriation and distribution are difficult Last year 120,000 new asylum applications were made in Italy. Around 50 percent of these are rejected. The asylum seekers are then supposed to leave the country. However, the process of people either returning voluntarily or being deported is very slow. The interior ministry has therefore announced that it will reinforce repatriation programs. The redistribution of asylum seekers from Italy, as agreed by the European Union, is well behind target. Two years ago the aim was to resettle 120,000 people. So far, only 24,676 people have been redistributed, the EU Commission said on Thursday: 7,873 from Italy, and 16,803 from Greece. The numbers are low not just because of the reluctance of other EU countries to take the refugees in, but also because of Italian delays in the registration of possible candidates. Asylum seekers from Eritrea are the most likely to fulfill the criteria for redistribution. Around 25,000 are currently living in Italy, but only 10,000 have been registered with the EU Commission and the European Asylum Support Office as possible candidates. Migration Commissioner Avramopoulos has announced that Italy will be given more help and logistical support in this area.",
        "generated_story": "Italy is facing \"an unfolding tragedy\" in the Mediterranean region The European Commission's Migration Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos has warned that Italy faces an \"emerging tragedy.\" The EU Commission said on Thursday that it was \"deeply concerned\" about the migrant crisis in Italy. \"We are deeply concerned,\" the EU Commissioner said in a statement, adding that the situation is \"very serious\" and that \"it is very difficult for the European Union to cope with this situation.\" \"It is a very serious situation,\" he said. Italy's migration commissioner, Filippo Grandi, told the UN's Human Rights Council in an interview published Thursday. He said Italy was facing a \"serious humanitarian crisis\" due to the influx of migrants from Eritrea, Libya and Libya, which has forced thousands of people to flee their homes in recent years. The Commission also called on the Italian government to take measures to prevent the flow of asylum seekers to Europe, saying it would be \"extremely difficult\" for Italy to meet its obligations under international humanitarian law. In addition, the Commission is also calling for a review of its migration policies, with the aim of finding a solution for migrants who have fled their home countries and are seeking asylum in Europe. According to French Foreign Minister Paolo Gentiloni, Italy \"is facing an unfolding crisis of humanitarian and humanitarian concern,\" according to a report by the United Nations (UN). \"This is not the first time that we have seen this kind of crisis,\" said the commission's director general for migration, Frans Ophelia, who was in Rome at the beginning of July when the crisis broke out in Libya. It is the second time in two years that Greece and Italy have faced such a crisis, and this time it has faced a similar crisis. Last year, Greece was one of the worst-hit countries for migrant arrivals, while Libya was the most affected. Since then, many migrants have come from other countries, including Italy, Spain, France, Germany, Austria, Switzerland and the Netherlands. On Thursday, a delegation of EU ministers met in Ventimiglia to discuss how to deal with migrants and refugees who are fleeing their countries of origin, as well as refugees from the Middle East and North Africa. At the end of June, Italian officials said they were working to find a way to help the migrants, but that they would not be able to do so because of a lack of funds. They also said that there was no way for them to pay their own way, because they had been unable to reach their relatives in their native countries. This year's migrant influx is expected to be the largest since 2014, when Italy received more than 1.5 million asylum applications in 2014. But it is unclear how many of those applications will be processed, or if they will even make it to other EU member states. For now, there are no plans to send migrants to Greece, where they are likely to have to stay for at least a year. There are also fears that migrants may be forced to return to their host country, such as Libya or Syria, in order to avoid being sent to another country. That's a concern for many European countries that have a long-term commitment to asylum, especially in countries like Italy and Greece. And it's not just Italy that faces this problem, too. Many of these migrants are coming to Italy in large numbers. Some of them are from countries in Africa and other parts of Europe that are not particularly well-known for their humanitarian missions. Others are migrants themselves, for example, from Libya to Syria and Iran. However, they have also come to Rome to seek asylum and to receive asylum from Italy as a result of their experiences in Syria. These problems have been exacerbated by a series of failed asylum requests from migrants seeking to escape the country's borders. Most recently, however, migrants in Greece were sent back to Libya after a failed attempt to get asylum there, leaving them with no choice but to leave their families. Now, it appears that this is going to become a problem that has become even more acute as they try to make their way through the region. A new EU commissioner has been appointed to head up the migration office in Brussels. Author: David French/EPA/dpa/jm (AFP, Reuters, AP, dpa, AFP)The EU has said it will continue to work with Italy on a plan to provide asylum to migrants. France has also been working closely with France and Switzerland to try and find solutions for refugees. Meanwhile, other European states have expressed concern over the current situation. French and Austrian officials have called for an end to EU migration policy. Italian migration officials say they want to see a change in its approach to migration and asylum policies.

It's very easy and the best bit is, it can be reused. Maybe it will come back to you on your birthday. 1. All you need is a piece of fabric big enough to wrap your gift, a ribbon long enough to go right around it, and if you want to make a gift tag, you will also need a piece of old cardboard, a hole punch and another small piece of ribbon. Ready? 2. No, wait, we forgot the present. Get that, and you have everything you need. Spread the fabric on the ground and put your gift on top 3. Fold the fabric around the gift you are wrapping 4. With the last little bit, you don't tuck it under, but create a little flap on top 5. Fold that flap over like this 6. Take one end of the parcel and tuck the fabric inside, BEHIND the gift inside 7. You can take your time to wiggle it all inside. Make it as flat as you can 8. Once it is all inside, turn to the other end and do the same thing again 9. When you have done both ends, it should look like this. Your present is all tucked up inside and you don't need any tape to keep it closed 10. Now for the ribbon. Place the gift on top of it 11. Tie the bow 12. So it looks like this. Finished? If you want a gift tag, that comes now. If you don't you're done! 13. Cut a piece out of an old cardboard box and make a hole in it using a hole punch. Watch your fingers though ;) 14. Put a piece of short ribbon through your hole 15. Tie the tag to your gift 16. And you are finished! P.S. You can either ask your friend to reuse the fabric, and show them how to wrap with it, or if they don't like that idea, you can take it home with you to use again the next time. And remember, you don't have to buy the fabric. You can use an old pillow case, an old t-shirt or skirt, or whatever you want. You can even make your ribbon from an old t-shirt if you don't have any. Happy wrapping.",
        "generated_story": "How to Wrap a Present Without Using Paper or Tape In order to wrap a present without using paper or tape, you must wrap it in a plastic wrap. This method is called \"wrap-around,\" and it's easy to do. It's a simple method of wrapping presents, but it can be a bit tricky. Paper and tape are the most common forms of paper, and they are also used in wrapping gifts. However, wrapping paper is not an easy task. You have to be careful with the material you're wrapping the present in. For example, if you want to use a paper towel, wrap your present with a tape measure. If you don't have one, then you can use paper. But wrap them with tape or paper and wrap around them. That's how you wrap presents. The best part is that they're not wrapped in plastic. They're wrapped around your hand, which is what you use for your hands. There's also the option of using a pen and a pencil, as well as a piece of tape. And then there's the final part, when you get to the end of the wrapping, where the paper ends and the tape is used. In this case, the pen is held in place by a thin plastic bag. Then you put it on top of your paper bag and you have a finished product. When you do this, it will be ready for the next day's presentation. \"It's just a matter of time before you start to feel like you've done something wrong,\" said one expert. Another expert said that the best method for wrapping present presents is by wrapping them in paper rather than using tape and then putting them on the table. Other experts said this method would be more effective than paper wrap, because it would give you a better idea of what's going on in your life. One expert also said the method could be used to help you feel more confident about your future. He said it was a good idea to make sure you had enough paper to cover your mouth, nose, eyes, ears and mouth. A final tip: Wrap the Present with Paper, Tape, or Tape, so that it doesn't look as if it has been wrapped up. Some people say that paper wraps are a waste of space. Others say it is a great way to get rid of clutter and clutter. I think that's exactly what I'm trying to say. We're talking about in this article. Let's talk about how we wrap our present and what we're doing with it. First, let's look at how it looks like it should look like a gift. What do you think? Is it really wrapped? Do you really want it wrapped with paper? Does it look good? Or is it just something you wrapped it up? If so, how does it feel? The answer is simple: It looks really good, right? You just need to put your finger on it and use your fingers. No matter how many times you touch it, there is no mistaking the fact that you are wrapping it around the edges. Just like in the picture above, this is how I wrap my present. As I said in my last post, I have wrapped my hands around my finger and put my hand over my mouth so I can feel the warmth of my fingertips. After all, my fingers are still sore from all the stress I've put on them and I know how much I feel about this present.\" The tip of a knife is the tip that will help me feel better about wrapping. With the help of scissors, we'll be able to tell you more about it later. How do we get there? Well, that depends on how long it takes for someone to finish wrapping something? I'd like to see if we can do that. So, here's my tip to you: You can start with this tip. Read more: How can you make a presentation? Read the tips here. Learn how to tie it together?

The record-breaking storm has battered the Bahamas and Cuba, while Hurricane Jose followed in its path. As one of the Atlantic Ocean's largest storms plowed through the Caribbean, leaving destruction in its wake, residents of the US state of Florida prepared for what could be the worst storm to make landfall in over a century. At least 17 people have been killed and dozens more injured across several island nations in the Caribbean. Irma is expected to be there second major hurricane to make landfall in the United States in less than two weeks. Hurricane Harvey struck Texas last week, killing more than 60 people and displacing roughly 1 million others. In the US territory of Puerto Rico, 1 million people \u2013 nearly one-third of the population \u2013 lost electricity during the storm, said Puerto Rican Governor Ricardo Rossello. \"It will be difficult to estimate how long the power outage will last,\" Rossello said. Later, officials confirmed that at least two people on the island had been killed by the storm's devastation. Two other major storms have developed in the Caribbean, namely Hurricane Jose and Hurricane Katia. Jose was east of the Lesser Antilles with maximum sustained winds of 120 miles per hour (195 kilometers per hour) as a hurricane watch was in effect for Antigua and Barbuda. Jose has followed the same path as Hurricane Irma, and was upgraded to a Category 4 on Friday by the US National Hurricane Center. Katia has remained relatively static, hovering off the coast of Mexico. Florida on edge Florida Governor Rick Scott said 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain were expected after Irma made landfall at the weekend as he urged evacuations during a press conference on Friday. Nearly 700,000 people have been asked to leave Miami and its surrounding areas. \"Today is the day to do the right thing for your family and get inland for safety... Do not ignore evacuation orders.

Downgraded to an \"extremely dangerous\" Category 4 but still packing winds of 185 mph (300 kph), Irma moved between the north coast of Cuba and the Bahamas as it neared the Florida Keys and the southern Florida Peninsula.

The US National Hurricane Center said on Thursday that Hurricane Jose was expected to make landfall on the Lesser Antilles by the weekend, and that the US government would provide $15 billion in emergency aid to the affected islands. \"We are very concerned for the safety of our people,\" he said in a statement, adding that he was \"deeply concerned\" about Irma's impact on St. Martin and the Florida Keys. He also warned that it could cause widespread damage to homes, businesses and other infrastructure, as well as the livelihoods of thousands of people living in and around the island of Antigua and Barbuda, which is home to more than 1.5 million people. Officials said they were still assessing the extent of damage caused by Jose, a Category 3 storm that is forecast to hit the islands on Friday. Hurricane Katia, the most powerful storm in recorded history, could hit as far north as Puerto Rico, with winds of up to 185 miles per hour (300 km/h) and a storm surge of as much as 12 feet (3.6 meters) above the sea level, according to a report from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). \"This is a very dangerous storm,\" said FEMA Administrator Brock Long, who has been in contact with victims of Jose and Irma since last year's devastating Category 4 storm, Hurricane Harvey. FEMA has said it will provide emergency assistance to all islands affected by Irma, including Anguilla and Puerto Ricans, but it is not clear how much aid will be available. In the United States, officials have said that they are prepared to provide aid if necessary. But they have not yet made a final decision on how to respond to Jose's landfall. On Thursday, President Trump said he would not make a decision until the hurricane had passed through the eastern Caribbean. Meanwhile, French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said the country was preparing for a \"very difficult situation.\" \"The situation is very difficult,\" the prime minister said. 'We have to be prepared for what is going to happen. We will not be able to do anything at this time until we have a clear picture of what's going on in our own country. It will take a lot of time and resources to prepare for this storm and we will continue to monitor the situation closely,\" Rossello told a news conference in London. Speaking to reporters, he added: \"I am very, very worried about what will happen to our country's people, especially the people who live in these islands.\" The French president also called on people to stay in their homes and avoid dangerous conditions, saying that there was no way to avoid the possibility of a repeat of past disasters like Harvey, Irma and Maria. French President Nicolas Sarkozy called for calm and calm in his country, while the British government urged people not to get too carried away with their plans to evacuate their properties. However, it was unclear whether the government's response would be enough to deal with the disaster, given the current state of emergency in Haiti and Dominica, or whether it would take as long as it took for Irma to become a major hurricane. According to an Associated Press report, there were no immediate reports of any damage from Jose or Maria, nor was there any threat to life or property from Irma. More than a century of hurricanes have passed since the last major storm hit Haiti in 1992, when it made landfall in 1961. This is the first time a tropical storm has hit a Caribbean island. And it's not just Haiti that has experienced such a severe storm like Jose. There is also the threat of flooding, flooding and landslides in recent years, such as Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and Hurricane Maria in 2004. That's why the French government is calling for an emergency declaration of disaster relief for all of Haiti's islands and islands, in order to protect them from Maria's wrath. (Reuters, AP, AFP, dpa, Reuters)The US has also issued warnings for Haiti, Dominique, Barbudia and St Martin, among other islands that have been hit hard by Harvey's catastrophic Category 5 storm since then. Many of those islands are in danger of becoming uninfected by Category 2 storm Florence is due to arrive later this year. Haiti has already been spared the brunt of Maria and is still facing severe weather conditions. Haitian President Gaston Browne, meanwhile, has vowed to continue its efforts to strengthen its defences against the Category 1 hurricane, despite the fact that Irma could be a catastrophic event. President Barack Obama has pledged to help the relief efforts of his administration, though he has yet to act on his own. US Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Gerard Collomb, said earlier this week that \"the US should do everything it can to prevent a similar situation from becoming a disaster.

More than 400,000 Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh in the past few weeks to escape military and civilian reprisals that the United Nations has described as \"ethnic cleansing.\" Later on Monday, Myanmar's national security advisor said that his government was willing to welcome the refugees who had fled to Bangladesh back to their native Rakhine state, but that the details of the process still had to be worked out. \"We will make sure that everybody who left their home can return to their home but this is a process we have to discuss,\" Thaung Tun told Reuters news agency after a meeting with British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. It was unclear how this would affect the estimated 40,000 Rohingya believed to have settled in India, including 16,000 of whom are registered with the UN's refugee agency. Read more: Myanmar's Rohingya - A history of forced exoduses The Indian government told the court that it had intelligence data that showed links between some Rohingya Muslims and Pakistan-based terror groups and other international terror organizations. It argued that such links made them a \"serious threat to national security.\" The government also said there was a \"serious possibility of eruption of violence against Buddhists in India by radicalized Rohingya.\" Lawyer Colin Gonsalves, who in a separate case is representing about 7,000 Rohingya living in the northern Indian city of Jammu, countered the government's assertions. \"We just want to know: 40,000 people have been here, many of them for the last five years. Have you [the government] filed a single charge sheet, is anyone being prosecuted in the criminal court for being a terrorist? The answer is: no,\" he told DW. The court has adjourned the hearing in the matter to October 3. Lack of evidence India says it is not bound by the UN convention on refugees as it is not a signatory to the accord, but human rights activists disagree. \"The principle of non return of a person to a place where he will be executed or tortured has become a principle of customary international law which India follows,\" Gonsalves told DW. \"And it has attained the status of 'jus cogens,' which is a principle of law that no country can say is not applicable to it, such as torture and genocide.\" In a communication sent to all states in August, the Home Ministry [interior ministry] said the illegal migrants were more susceptible to terrorist recruitment efforts. But an investigation by Indian broadcaster NDTV found \"little evidence of the government claim.\" The investigation that was carried out at major Rohingya settlements in the country showed little involvement in criminal wrongdoing by the refugees. Lack of any evidence to support the government claim has led to speculations that the Rohingya were being targeted for their religion by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu-nationalist government. \"It is really unfortunate that the government is going back on its commitment to refugees which it has reiterated several times in the past merely because these Rohingyas are Muslims,\" said lawyer Prashant Bhushan, who filed the plea on behalf of two Rohingya men. \"I mean this is clearly a case of religious discrimination and an attempt to arouse a sort of feeling of... an anti-Muslim feeling or try and communalise the situation,\" he told reporters outside the courthouse. The UN's human rights chief last week deplored Indian government's move to deport Rohingya refugees. \"India cannot carry out collective expulsions, or return people to a place where they risk torture or other serious violations,\" Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein said. The Rohingya are an Indo-Aryan people, the vast majority of whom are Muslims. They usually migrate to India through a rather porous border to escape persecution in their native Rakhine state in Myanmar, where they have been denied citizenship rights. They are viewed by the local authorities as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. Myanmar's Buddhist majority is often accused of subjecting them to discrimination and violence. Read more: Rohingya people in Myanmar \u2013 What you need to know The ongoing violence follows an insurgent attack on security forces on August 25 in Rakhine state that sparked off a brutal military counteroffensive. Hundreds of people, the majority of them Rohingya, have been killed in the violence that has seen many homes destroyed and several villages burned down. Myanmar's government maintains the crackdown is part of a counter-terrorism drive, while the UN's al-Hussein has said that it \"seems a textbook example of ethnic cleansing.\"",
        "generated_story": "India says Rohingya pose 'erious threat' to India The Indian government said on Monday that Rohingya Muslims pose a \"eriously threat\" to its relations with India. India's Foreign Minister Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein told the UN General Assembly that the Rohingyas posed a threat to the stability of the country. \"The situation in Rakhine is very serious,\" he said, adding that India was \"very concerned\" about the situation there. The country's foreign ministry said it had received a letter from the Supreme Court of India on August 25 expressing concern over the influx of refugees from Myanmar. It said the Rohingya had been fleeing violence in Myanmar for five years, and that they were being persecuted by the government. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, however, did not directly address the issue. He said he was not aware of any new developments in the case, but that it was a matter of concern to him. In August, the Indian Foreign Ministry had warned that \"it was very important for India to take steps to protect the security of its own people.\" The government also warned of a rise in attacks on the army and police, which it said were part of an attempt to destabilize the region. On August 24, India issued a warning to Myanmar's military and security forces, saying it would not allow them to enter Myanmar without a warrant. According to a statement by Indian Home Minister Colin Gonsalves, this was the first time India had issued an official warning against attacks by Rohingya militants, who have been trying to flee to neighboring Bangladesh in recent months. Earlier this month, Indian foreign minister Prashant Bhushan said India should take action against Rohingya insurgents who are being held responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of civilians in a crackdown on ethnic and religious minority communities across the border state of Bangladesh. Last week, a court in Jammu and Kashmir rejected a request from India for a special court to hear an appeal against the court's ruling. Since then, some Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh, where they are believed to be living in fear of persecution, according to Reuters news agency. This is the second time in as many years that Indian officials have said they have not been able to prevent the violence from spreading to other parts of Myanmar, despite the fact that many of them are Buddhists. However, it is not clear how many Rohingya are still living there and whether they will be allowed to return to their homes in India, or if they would be forced to stay in their own country for long periods of time. There have also been reports of violence between the two communities, as well as a number of cases in which the police and army have tried to kill Rohingya civilians, including a man who was killed by a stray bullet in an attack on a police van on October 3. Many of these incidents have taken place during the past few weeks, when the military has been deployed to try to arrest the men suspected of being the perpetrators of crimes against humanity. Some of those who were killed in clashes between Rohingya and Indian troops in August last year were also arrested and charged with murder, while others were found to have attempted to rape Rohingya women and children. These cases were later brought to court and are currently being tried in absentia. Reuters reported that a judge in Delhi had ordered the arrest of two men accused of raping a Rohingya woman and a woman in connection with the alleged rape and murder of her daughter. A court has also ordered an investigation into the rape of three Rohingya girls by an Indian army officer, in retaliation for their alleged involvement in crimes committed against women, children and the elderly. Meanwhile, there are reports that two other men are also being arrested for allegedly raping two women. Both men face charges of rape, torture and attempted rape in relation to allegations of human rights violations by Myanmar authorities. They have denied the charges against them, though India has denied any knowledge of their involvement. But the allegations are unlikely to change, given that there is no evidence that any such crimes have ever been committed in any way. For the time being, I am not sure what India will do in response to these allegations. I have no idea what will happen next. And I don't think India is going to do anything to stop them from doing that. What I do know for sure is that we will have to wait until the next few days to find out what is happening. We are not prepared to give up our position on this issue until we have a clear picture of what's going on in this case. Read more: India and Bangladesh: What is India doing?

        "target": "NFL stars defy Donald Trump's call for boycott Baltimore Ravens and Jacksonsville Jaguars players \"took a knee\" during the national anthem after Trump urged fans to boycott football matches. The kneeling protest, to highlight social injustice, has stepped up a gear. Hundreds of National Football League (NFL) stars protested President Donald Trump's call for fans to boycott the league by refusing to stand for the US national anthem this weekend, starting Sunday's game between the Baltimore Ravens and Jacksonsville Jaguars. A number of other players locked arms in solidarity ahead of the game at Wembley Stadium in London. Jacksonville Jaguars' owner Shahid Khan, who last year donated one million dollars\u00a0(840,000 euros) to the Trump campaign, locked his arms with players - a rare scene, as owners almost never take to the field. US media reported that about 200 players on Sunday sat, knelt or raised their fists in defiance of Trump's comments. In one of the most memorable moments, singer Rico LaVelle took a knee and held up a fist at the last line of the Star Spangled Banner ahead of the game between the Detriot Lions and Atlanta Falcons. The protest came in response to Trump's tweets on Sunday morning urging fans to boycott NFL games to pressure the league into firing or suspending players to kneel in protest during the national anthem. In an early morning tweet, Trump posted: \"If NFL fans refuse to go to games until players stop disrespecting our Flag and Country, you will see change take place fast. Fire or suspend!\" \"NFL attendance and ratings are WAY DOWN. Boring games yes, but many stay away because they love our country. League should back US,\" he added. Later, the president said that his rant \"has nothing to do with race,\" despite the fact that the origins of the protest are to do with police brutality against minorities, especially African Americans. Trump said his comments were instead about \"respect for our country and respect for our flag.\" Trump's spat with US professional sports began at a Republican rally in Alabama on Friday, when the president attacked activist NFL players for kneeling or sitting during the national anthem, labelling them as \"sons of bitches.\" \"Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, 'Get that son of a bitch off the field right now... he is fired'?\" Trump told a crowd of cheering supporters. That day, basketball star Stephen Curry, the top player for California's Golden State Warriors, announced that he would not be attending a traditional White House reception honoring the National Basketball Association champions. The kneeling protest was started by former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick who refused to stand for the anthem back in 2016. Kaepernick's gesture came amid a spate of deadly police shootings of black men and was aimed at drawing more attention to treatment of minorities in the US. However, Kaepernick has since become a free agent, after failing to be signed by a new team for the new NFL season. NFL executives decry Trump's calls Trump also drew the ire of senior NFL executives and team owners. Responding to Trump's tweets, Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti, said he \"100 percent\" supported his players' decision to kneel during the anthem. Robert Kraft, the owner of the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots, who is also a close friend of Trump, said in a statement on Sunday that he was deeply disappointed by the president's comments in Alabama. Kraft defended players' rights to \"peacefully affect social change and raise awareness in a manner that they feel is most impactful,\" and said that sports were a unifying force in the US. \"Our political leaders could learn a lot from the lessons of teamwork and working together toward a common goal,\" he said. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, who has taken much of the heat for Kaepernick's failure to find a new team, was also quick to condemn Trump's comments.

They include the owners of the New York Jets, New England Patriots, Dallas Cowboys, Washington Redskins, Jacksonville Jaguars, Houston Texans, Los Angeles Rams and Tampa Bay Buccaneers",

NFL owners Robert Kraft and Steve Bisciotti have called for a boycott of the NFL's annual Super Bowl, which is scheduled for Sunday at Wembley Stadium in London, England. The NFL announced on Friday that it would be boycotting the game on Sunday, a day after Trump took to Twitter to call on the league's owners to step down over the anthem protests. \"The NFL is going to have to do something about this,\" Kraft said in a statement, adding that he was \"very disappointed\" by the president's comments. Kraft, who has been a staunch supporter of President Trump for years, said on Twitter that \"the NFL should stand up for our country.\" The billionaire owner also said he would boycott the event, saying it was disrespectful to the flag and should not be used as an excuse for disrespecting the National Anthem. He added that his team would not play in the 2017 NFL championship game against the Dallas Cowboys, and that the team's owner would have no choice but to boycott it. Trump called the protests \"an act of disrespect and disrespect\" and said it had \"no place in our society.\" He also called it \"a form of racial discrimination.\" NFL owner and former NFL player Kraft is one of several owners and owners who have been critical of Trump over his comments on social media. On Friday, he tweeted that Trump had made a \"big mistake\" when he said \"America's flag should be a symbol of unity and respect for all people of color.\" On Saturday, Kraft announced he planned to attend the pre-game news conference at the White House in Washington, D.C. (AP, AP, Reuters) NFL commissioner Roger A. Goodell said the players would stand in solidarity with the American flag, but he did not elaborate on what that meant. It was unclear whether the statement was meant to be interpreted as a threat to NFL rights or whether it came from Trump himself. In the last month, Trump has made several statements calling for an end to protests against police brutality, racial inequality and police violence in America's most violent and violent country. His comments came as the US president was visiting the nation's capital, Birmingham, where he met with President Barack Obama and his wife, Shahid Khan, to discuss the issue of race and other issues, including the ongoing civil rights movement. Some of those comments sparked a backlash online, with some calling the comments \"offensive and disrespectful.\" Some NFL executives have also criticized the Trump administration's stance on race, while others have defended the President's decision to fire the head of his own team, the Baltimore Ravens' owner, Rex Ryan, in an interview with Reuters. Others have criticized Goodell's response, calling him a racist and a hypocrite for not standing up to protect the rights of African Americans. One NFL executive said that if Trump were elected, \"it would make it easier for him to get elected to office.\" Other NFL officials have expressed concern about the reaction of some players who are protesting against Trump, such as Colin Kaepernick and Stephen Curry. Many have accused Goodell of being too soft on racism and anti-immigrant rhetoric. But some have pointed out that this is not the first time he has spoken out against racism. They also accused him of using the word \"racism\" in his campaign speech, as well as other comments he made during his 2016 presidential campaign. And they are not alone in their criticism of NFL President Roger Trump. According to a report from the Associated Press, NFL general counsel John Dowd told the AP that Goodell was not aware of any such comments and had no knowledge of what was going on. However, some league officials said they were not surprised by Kraft's remarks. ESPN reported that Kraft was referring to Trump on his Twitter feed on Saturday. A number of media outlets, however, were quick to point out the fact that they had not made any reference to Kaepernick's protest. Among those who did comment was ESPN's Sean Hannity, whose Twitter account said Trump was calling on Trump to apologize to him for his remarks on Thursday. Hannity also suggested that NFL fans should \"act in support of Kaepernick. I don't think that's the right thing to say,\" Hannity said. Meanwhile, Fox News reported on its Facebook page, citing a source familiar with NFL policy. Fox Business Network's Jim Acosta, an NFL analyst, noted that many NFL reporters have said Goodell is \"not a fan of racism.\" \"I think he's a good person,\" said Hannity. 'I don\u2019t think it's just a matter of whether or not Trump is racist or what he thinks about it, because he is a white supremacist and he doesn't like the idea of kneeling during a game. That's not something that is being discussed in any way. What's more, though, is that there is no such thing as racism, it could be"

The move follows a political protest at the first such match. In a statement released on Friday, the German football association (DFB) announced that the games would be rescheduled for 2018 and that talks would take place between them and their Chinese counterparts in order explore how to move forward. \"To the regret of all parties involved, the project has not received the broad approval that had been expected,\" the DFB said. \"In fact, the project was used by a handful of spectators to send messages that were considered hurtful by the Chinese team, officials, the Chinese Football Association's support staff and Chinese spectators.\" Protests in opening match The first of the arranged matches, against TSV Schott Mainz of the fourth-tier Regionalliga S\u00fcdwest was interrupted midway through the first half when the Chinese players left the field because a small group of activists had unfurled Tibetan flags. The team later returned to the field after the flags had been taken down, before succumbing to a 3-0 defeat. On Monday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry strongly criticized the protest. Initially, it had been thought that the Chinese side would play in the Regionalliga S\u00fcdwest - a regional division of Germany's fourth tier which has only 19 teams but the plan was revised so the matches would just be friendlies. This followed an agreement signed in 2016 between the German FA and the Chinese government to help boost the sport in the Asian country, where the Bundesliga is increasingly popular.

But the protests, and potential for further disruption, seem to be behind the cancellations - the DFB said both federations were aware of \"substantial evidence of further escalation,\" FSV Frankfurt, who were due to host the Chinese side on Saturday, said earlier this week that they would not ban protests despite an angry response to last week's incident from Beijing. \"We will not back a single centimeter off the basic rights our our democracy, including those relating to freedom of speech,\" FSV Frankfurt President Michael G\u00f6rner said in an interview with the Stuttgarter Nachrichten and Stuttgarter Zeitung newspapers. His words echoed those of DFB vice-president Ronny Zimmerman, who said that the games should be played \"within the framework of freedom of expression.\" The fixtures that have been abandoned include games against Wormatia Worms and Bundesliga club Hoffenheim's reserves. mp/pfd (dpa, SID)",

The DFB said on Friday that it was cancelling the team's participation because of the ongoing protests in Beijing. According to a statement from the FA, the decision to cancel the tournament was made after the Chinese Foreign Ministry expressed concern over the situation. \"We are not going to allow this to happen again,\" the statement said, referring to the protests that have taken place in recent weeks. It added that the delegation had been invited to attend the event, which is scheduled to take place on Saturday, but that they were not allowed to travel to China. FSB president Michael G\u00f6rner said the cancellation was \"not the first time that we have seen this kind of situation in Germany,\" adding that he was not aware of any such situation at the time. However, he said he had no doubt that there would be a response from China if the game were to be rescheduled for Saturday. He also said that his country would not be involved in any way in this matter, saying that \"we will not allow it.\" The decision came after a series of protests, including one in Wormatia Worms, in which hundreds of thousands of people gathered to watch the match on television. Many of them were wearing Chinese flags, while others were carrying flags of \"China\" and \"the People's Republic of China\" (PLA) flags. In addition, a number of local media reported that some of those who were protesting against the ban had also taken to social media to express their displeasure with what they saw as a lack of respect for the rule of law in their home country. Some of these protests were sparked by the presence of a large Chinese delegation, who had traveled to Germany to meet with President Xi Jinping and other dignitaries, as well as to congratulate Xi on his election as head of state. On Friday, Xi called for a boycott of all Chinese football matches, citing the \"unprecedented level of disrespect\" for China's football governing body and the country's president. Xi also called on the German football federation to step up its anti-corruption campaign, according to dpa news agency. China has been accused of trying to undermine the legitimacy of Germany's national football team, and has repeatedly denied any involvement in such an attempt. Last week, however, it said it had not seen any evidence of such a move. Chinese officials have also accused Germany of being a \"hostile country\" to Beijing, accusing it of attempting to interfere with the footballing activities of its citizens. They have denied this, though, insisting that this is not the case. For the second time in as many years, Chinese fans have been calling for an end to Chinese rule in football. This year, they have not been able to get a chance to see their team play in a Bundesliga match, despite the fact that their national team has already been playing in three different Bundesliga matches in 2016, 2017, 2016 and 2016. Since then, many Chinese supporters have come out in force to show their support for their country and to protest against their government's crackdown on political repression of their own people. At the same time, some have criticized the government for not doing enough to protect the rights of Chinese citizens, such as the Communist Party's (CZU) president, Zhejiang Uyghuang, to ensure that China does not take part in future matches. That's not to say that a Chinese team should be banned from participating in international football tournaments. But it is clear that Beijing has no intention of doing so. After all, there is no reason for it to do so, even if it does want to, because it doesn't have the right to intervene. There are many reasons for this. One is that many people are unhappy about the current state of relations between the two countries. As a matter of fact, China is the only country that has a government that is willing to cooperate with Germany in its efforts to improve relations with it. And that's the reason why they are so eager to have a fair and open relationship with their people, rather than to impose their will on them. So far, this has not led to any sort of change in policy. What is happening is a lot of things that could have happened in other countries, like the recent crackdown in North Korea and Russia, where there are no clear signs of progress on human rights violations. (dpa, AFP, Reuters, AP)The Chinese government has also been criticized for its role in setting up a border between Germany and China in order to prevent a conflict between China and its neighbors. Beijing is also not a country with a long history of authoritarian rule and a strong stance toward the West. If it wants to keep its people out of football, then it will have to accept that, at least for now, that will be the end of this year's World Cup. To be fair to all of us, we need to"

        "target": "Experts: Taliban have not changed strategy with Kabul restaurant attack The weekend attack on a Kabul restaurant frequented by foreigners came as no surprise to international organizations on the ground. Experts don't believe the Taliban have changed their strategy to target more civilians. Dramatic scenes must have played out in the restaurant: Guests sought cover under tables as a group of terrorists shot wildly into the dining rooms. News agencies report the restaurant owner tried in vain to fend off the attackers. He was among the more than 20 people who perished, most of whom were employees at international organizations. The attackers were also among the dead. During the evening dinner rush, at 7:00 p.m. Friday (17.01.2014), one of three Taliban members detonated his explosives-laden vest and blew a breach in the highly secured restaurant. Neither the man-high blast walls, nor the secured access points with armed guards could stop the attackers. The two remaining terrorists were killed later in a firefight with security forces at the scene. No change in Taliban strategy The suicide bombing on the popular Lebanese restaurant, Taverna Du Liban, in the high-end Kabul neighborhood of Wazir Akbar Khan was the worst attack so far in 2014. Afghanistan votes for a new president in April; and the international troops are scheduled to withdraw from the country by the end of the year. Although there are plans for a small contingent to remain in Afghanistan, President Hamid Karzai first has to sign a bilateral security agreement with the United States. But he continues to play for time. In this context, the Taliban may be targeting civilians more in order to drive out not just the military coalition, but the entire international community. Yet \"as horrible as this incident is, I don't see a change in strategy,\" said Thomas Ruttig, the co-director of the Afghan Analysts Network. Similar attacks have also been launched before, \"at least 12 to 15 times in the past eight years,\" Ruttig said. The worst attack was in 2012 at Qargha Lake, a popular weekend destination near Kabul. More than 20 people were killed, all of them Afghans. Extensive security precautions The Taliban, which normally doesn't miss an opportunity for fiery rhetoric, hasn't declared a change in strategy. A spokesman for the Islamist militant group said the attack was retaliation for a NATO airstrike in Parwan Province, a few kilometers north of Kabul. According to an assistant of the Afghan president, seven children and one woman died in the coalition strike. \"You have to carefully monitor the security situation,\" Nils W\u00f6rmer, head of the Konrad Adenauer Institute in Kabul, told DW. \"But I think it's a bit early to talk about a change in [Taliban] strategy.\" W\u00f6rmer's office lies just a few hundred meters from the site of Friday's attack. He could clearly hear the explosion, which shook the window panes in his office. \"It was immediately clear to me that something had happened,\" W\u00f6rmer recounted. But the Konrad Adenauer Institute was prepared. \"We had a relatively concrete warning in the last week related to our neighborhood, and we were very cautious,\" W\u00f6rmer said. He met with colleagues in his secured office. Like most of the international organizations, the Konrad Adenauer Institute is also integrated into the security networks. \"The security precautions are high,\" W\u00f6rmer said. \"But that doesn't exclude the possibility that something similar could happen again.\" But the Afghan security forces have succeeded in preventing many attacks in the past few months, he said. Kabul residents criticize Taliban An informal, impromptu poll by DW's Kabul correspondent, Hussein Sirat, suggested the Taliban are not winning Afghan hearts and minds with such attacks. \"Wherever the Taliban have killed civilians, they have not achieved their goal,\" said Mirwais, a pedestrian in the Kabul city center. Idris, another Kabul resident, seconded Mirwais' sentiment. \"The Taliban intimidate the people so that the security agreement won't be signed,\" he said. \"But the people won't bend to this intimidation.\" How the international organizations adapt to the tense security situation in Kabul will come after many conversations, analyses, and briefings in the following days. But W\u00f6rmer is not thinking about giving up. \"We have a clear agenda and long-term projects, which I considered to be very sensible,\" W\u00f6rmer said. \"I am of the opinion, as I was before, that what I'm doing here with the Konrad Adenauer Institute is worth the risks.\"",

It's not clear whether the Taliban are changing their approach to Afghanistan, which has seen a number of attacks in recent months. In the last week alone, the country's security forces have responded to at least one attack in Parwan Province in which a gunman opened fire on a crowd of Afghan civilians, killing four people and injuring dozens more. \"We are not going to change our strategy,\" said Thomas Ruttig, a Kabul-based expert on Afghan security. He said the attack was the latest in a series of coordinated attacks by the Afghan Taliban against the United States, NATO, and the international community.

Worsig said that \"we have not seen any change in our approach.\" The attack on the restaurant, Taverna Du Liban, was one of the deadliest attacks since the end of last year's Afghan civil war, when the government of Hamid Karzai was forced to declare an end to the war in April. Last week, Taliban militants attacked a military base near the capital, Kabul, in what was described as a \"terrorist attack.\" \"This is not the first time that we have seen this kind of attack,\" Wormer said, referring to an attack that took place in March 2012. Since then, however, it's been more difficult for the insurgents to get their act together, Wazir Akbar Khan, an Afghan intelligence officer, said on Thursday. On Friday, they claimed responsibility for setting off a fire that killed four Afghan soldiers and wounded dozens of others. They said they were trying to prevent a repeat of that attack and that they had no intention of doing so again. But they also claimed that it was an act of terrorism, not a terrorist attack. At the same time, there were reports that a Taliban suicide bomber had been killed by a police officer in Qargha Lake, near Kabul's central city of Idris. There were also reports of an explosion at a nearby hotel, where the attackers were hiding in plainclothes. Some of those who were killed were believed to have fled the area, while others had fled to other areas of Kabul to escape the violence. However, some of them were able to make it back to their homes in time for Eid al-Fitr. Many Afghans are still hopeful that their country will return to normal after a long period of mourning, but they don't want to give up hope of returning to Taliban rule. That is, until they learn more about the situation in Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria. Read more: Afghanistan: What is the next step? The Taliban's strategy for Afghanistan?

        "target": "Inching towards direct talks on Syria They came to hold talks, but started negotiations with mutual affronts. But if there is one person who might be able to mediate between the intransigent Syrian conflict parties, it's Lakhdar Brahimi. Lakhdar Brahimi, the United Nations special envoy for Syria, seemed very tired on Friday (24.01.2014). He had had a long day, which was actually supposed to be the first real day of negotiations at the Syria Conference in Geneva. \"Good afternoon,\" Brahimi told the assembled international press, before adding, \"or good evening, I don't know.\" At the Palais des Nations in Geneva, he presented the most important result of his attempts to mediate between the Syrian government and the opposition to the more than 250 journalists who had managed to get a coveted place at the press conference: \"Tomorrow we expect and we have agreed that we will meet in the same room.\" What Brahimi is declaring an achievement doesn't sound like much, but considering how irreconcilable the conflict parties have been, even that can be seen as a small success. Separate talks with Brahimi The two delegations were actually due to meet on the first day of negotiations in Geneva in order to agree on a timetable and on the subject and agenda of the talks. But emotions are running too high on both sides. Instead both delegations held separate talks with Lahkkdar Brahimi, both lasting just about an hour each In the morning. The Syrian government delegation had apparently been threatening to leave the conference. At least that is what the deputy foreign minister Faisal Mekdad had implied. \"We are here to start the negotiations,\" he told waiting journalists, \"but we found that the other party did not want to come.\" Before the conference, the opposition had explained that for its delegation, the formation of a transition government would be a central tenet of the negotiations. They emphasized that this topic should be discussed right at the beginning of talks and that the establishment of such a body should be initiated without delay. Social media and good old propaganda The representatives of the Syrian National Coalition that were present in Geneva neatly used all imaginable channels to make their views public. At #Geneva2, they tweeted: \"Forming a transitional body is our major priority,\" leaving people in no doubt that the Syrian National Council would not want to include Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Assad's government, on the other hand, is relying on classic propaganda and loyal state media representatives in Geneva. An impressive entourage of dominant journalists from state-run media outlets is constantly at hand, accompanying the government delegation and making sure they get their point across at press conferences. Lakhdar Brahimi even had a small altercation with a journalist from a Syrian state news agency, who made a political statement under the pretense of asking the UN mediator a question. \"Are there any signs that Saudi Arabia, Turkey and other countries would stop the support of terrorism in Syria?,\" she asked in somewhat shaky English, before Brahimi interrupted her. \"Please, please, there is no point in asking such questions!\" Such exchanges hint at the type of negotiating style the experienced diplomat and mediator Brahimi must have behind the scenes. 'Wish us luck' Lakhdar Brahimi described the preliminary talks that took place in Geneva as encouraging and asked for patience. He said that because the peace conference had come about at the last minute and the delegations had therefore only been appointed very recently, there hadn't been enough time to hold preliminary discussions - a task that the delegations were now catching up on. \"We never expected it to be easy and I'm sure it's not going to be,\" he said. \"But I think the two parties understand what is at stake. Their country is in very, very bad shape.\" He added: \"The huge ambition of this process is to save Syria. Nothing less than that.\" After appealing to the willingness of both parties to negotiate, he simply added: \"So wish us luck!\" Fight for freedom As the official delegations held talks with UN mediator Brahimi in the Palais des Nations, the European headquarters of the United Nations, hundreds of Syrian expatriates who had come from all over Europe protested outside, forming a sea of red, white and black Syrian flags on the Place des Nations. With their presence outside the UN gates they wanted to show that despite all the government propaganda, the Syrian National coalition has a lot of support from the Syrian people. Thirty-two-year-old Ziad Malki came to Geneva from Zurich to show his solidarity. Ziad knows how it feels to be deprived of his freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. In 2005, he was arrested at a demonstration in Damascus and says he was tortured during his time in prison. Now he is fighting for a new Syria from outside the country's borders. Ziad is sure that with Bashar al-Assad and his family, there will be nothing new. \"We don't want this man to be in",

The first day of the United Nations General Assembly, which began on Friday (24.01.2014), has seen a dramatic change in the face of President Bashar al-Assad's regime. In the early hours of Friday, he met with a number of Syrian opposition figures, including Ziad Malki and Faisal Mekdad, the head of a delegation from Turkey's opposition group, to discuss the situation in Syria. \"We have a lot of things to talk about,\" he told reporters at the Palais des Nations in Zurich, Switzerland, where the meeting was taking place, according to a statement released by the UN's spokesman. He added that \"we are working with all sides to reach a solution that will allow the people of Syria to have their voices heard,\" adding that it would be a \"positive step forward\" in resolving the conflict between the two sides. According to the statement, \"all sides have agreed to cooperate on the implementation of an agreement on a ceasefire.\" The statement also said that the talks had been \"productive\" and that there was \"no doubt\" that Assad would continue to use chemical weapons against his own people. However, it was also clear that he would not be able to do so without the help of other countries, such as Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Iran, Russia and Turkey. On the other hand, there is no doubt that Syria's president, Hafez al Assad, is not going to give up on his regime, and he will not give in to pressure from the international community. At the same time, Syrian President Assad is expected to meet with his closest allies, who are also part of his coalition, in a bid to prevent a coup. Assad has repeatedly denied any involvement, saying he has no intention of taking part in any coup, but he is determined to make sure that his forces are not allowed to take over the country. Last week, Assad was forced to step down from his post as president. Since then, however, his government has refused to recognize him as a legitimate president and has called for him to be replaced by a civilian, as well as an armed opposition force. This is the second time in as many years that a Syrian government leader has stepped down, after the former president was ousted from power in 2006. It is unclear how long Assad will remain in power, or how much longer he can hold on to power. But it is clear he won't be the only one who will have to face the consequences of what he's done for his country: He's the most powerful man on earth. And he knows it. That's why he wants to keep fighting until the last minute, when he'll have the chance to speak to his people again. Speaking to journalists at a news conference in Switzerland on Saturday, Brahim said he hoped to see Assad's government \"in good spirits.\" \"I hope that we will see him in good health,\" said Bekdad. 'He's a very strong man and a strong leader. I hope we can get him out of this situation quickly.\" He also promised to continue his efforts to improve relations with Russia, China and other European countries and to work with other nations to resolve the ongoing conflict, if possible, with Turkey and the US. His visit to Geneva is scheduled to last until Monday, at which point he hopes to return to Damascus. A spokesman for Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the Russian Foreign Ministry would also visit the city of Geneva on Monday. Moscow has said it will be open to talks with Moscow, Ankara and Washington. Meanwhile, Moscow and Ankara have said they are ready to host a meeting of representatives from both countries. Russia has also been invited to attend the Geneva conference, while Turkey has not yet made an official visit. Talks are currently under way with representatives of both the opposition and opposition parties. Syria is facing a crisis of its own, says the foreign ministry's spokesperson, Ali Zeid, that could lead to an escalation of tensions between Damascus and Moscow. There is also a possibility that Russia could be involved in some way in this conflict. If that's not the case, then it's unlikely that Moscow will come to terms with it, too, because it could have an impact on Moscow's decision to withdraw its troops from Syria, especially if it doesn't involve the Assad regime's allies. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan have also expressed concern about the lack of progress in negotiations with Assad and his allies in Damascus, a move that is unlikely to change the course of negotiations. Putin has already called on Assad to leave the negotiating table for talks, said Lavrov, adding: \"It's too early to tell us what will happen next. We're not sure what the outcome of that meeting will look like. You know, we're still waiting for a decision on whether or not we'll see what is going on Syria will"

He was 45. The Catalan club announced the death of its former bench boss in a statement posted on its website on Friday. \"FC Barcelona is in immense mourning. Tito Vilanova has died at the age of 45. May he rest in peace,\" the statement said. Vilanova had first been diagnosed with a tumor in a saliva gland in November 2011, while he was an assistant to then-Barcelona head coach Pep Guardiola. He had been battling against recurring cancer ever since and had been admitted to a Barcelona hospital last week. He led Barca to the Primera Liga title last season, his only campaign as head coach, when the Catalans earned a record-tying 100 points. Last July he stepped down due to his ongoing health problems. Vilanova is survived by his wife and two children, including a son who now plays in Barcelona's youth academy. pfd/lw (AP, dpa, AFP)",
        "generated_story": "Barca midfielder Tito Vilanova dies in hospital after battle with cancer Barcelona's top scorer in the Primera Liga in November 2011 died at the age of 45 on Friday, the club said in a statement. He had been battling cancer for several years. \"I have been fighting for my life for the past 45 years,\" he said, adding that he had fought for his life since the end of last season, when he was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer. The news came as a shock to the footballing world, with the Catalan club suffering from a number of serious health problems. It was the first time in its history that a player had died from cancer, according to a report by the Spanish news agency dpa, which cited a medical source as saying that the cause of his death was a cancer that had spread to his lungs. His death comes after a long battle against cancer at age 45, a year after he underwent surgery to remove the cancerous growth spur in his lung. In December 2011, he suffered a relapse of cancer and died of a heart attack. Since then, his health has improved and he has been able to return to training regularly, but his condition has worsened. Last season he played only one game for Barca, and that was against FC Barcelona, where he scored a brace of goals in their last league game. After suffering a series of strokes and a bout of pneumonia, last year he began to recover from his illness. On Friday he died, aged 45. Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola said the team was \"very fortunate\" to have him on the pitch, despite the fact that they were playing without him for so long. But he also said that his team-mates were \"not going to let him down.\" \"We are very fortunate that we have a coach who is so dedicated to helping us win the league,\" said Guardiola, who was also the head coach of Barcelona in 2011-12. 'He is a very good man and I am very proud of him. We are also very grateful to him and to all the fans who have supported him throughout his career. I wish him the very best of luck and we will be back together as soon as possible,\" Guardiola told reporters at a news conference in Barcelona. According to Catalan newspaper La Repubblica, \"it is very important for us to get the best out of our players and for our fans to see the good and the bad of this team.\" The Catalan football club has struggled for a few years with a lack of results in recent years and is currently in dire financial straits. However, it is still struggling to make up for lost time with its top-flight players, as well as the loss of one of its most promising young players. Vilavans' father, Pep, is also a former coach at Barcelona and was an avid football fan. When he retired from the national team in 2010-11, they managed to secure a promotion to La Liga, in which they won their first ever league title. Now he is an assistant coach with Barcelona under Guardiola. And he's not the only man who has made the right decision in terms of the future of football in Catalonia: he wants to be the next coach. At the same time, there's a new generation of players who want to take over the top job in football. That's what he did with his first team, Barcelona FC, after they lost to Real Madrid in 2014-15. They won the title in 2015-16 and in 2016-17 and finished fourth in La Roja and third in 2017-18, respectively. This is the third consecutive season that Barcelona have won promotion and fourth consecutive title, following the success of their previous two campaigns. Guardiola has said he hopes to bring back the glory days of Pep and his son Pep in 2019-20, saying he will continue to improve the squad's chances of reaching the Champions League next season. Speaking to AFP, Guardiola added: \"There's no doubt that Pep will do everything he can to help us achieve our goal of winning the championship. There's still a lot of work to do. You have to work hard to achieve that goal, because we are so lucky to still have the chance to win a title like this one.\" He also added that there are many more teams in Europe to play for next year, including the Barcelona team. Despite his long career as an attacking midfielder, Vilavan's career has not been as successful as it was in previous years, though he still has a good reputation for being a great tactician and an excellent player. Nevertheless, this year's title was not his best season so far. With the new coach, former Barcelona boss Pep is hoping to build on his reputation as coach and manager. For now, that's the most important thing for him to continue his success in Spain. Pep has already made it clear that this is his goal for Barcelona to reach the Europa League final, even if it's only a matter of time. If he does not get to that level of success, then he'll be a big"

This put him well ahead of former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, who was reported to have come in second, at 12.9 percent. Andrij Shevchenko, one of Tymoshenko's political allies, said on Twitter that she had conceded defeat. DW's reporter Kitty Logan in Kyiv said voter turnout was extremely high in the capital. Most polling stations in the east of the country remained closed on Sunday. If the figures are confirmed, there will not be a need for a runoff on June 15. Poroshenko, who has promised closer economic and political ties with the West, has also vowed to mend relations with Russia, but insisted that Ukraine's territorial integrity was of top importance to him.

The results are expected to be announced later this year, with the winner of Sunday's vote likely to face off against Yulia Tymoshenko, the opposition candidate for the parliamentary election in Kyiv. \"We are very confident that we will win,\" said Andrij Shevchenko, a former deputy prime minister, in an interview with DW news agency on Sunday. He said he was confident of winning the vote, saying he had \"a lot of confidence\" in the president and that he would be able to win the general election. But he also said that the election would not be an easy one for him, adding that \"we will have to work very hard to get the results we want.\" The exit poll, which was conducted on June 15, showed a strong majority of Ukrainians backing the incumbent, who has been in power for more than a year. Opinion polls have shown a clear majority in favor of her, while a small minority of voters rejected her candidacy. Many Ukrainians, however, believe that she should be allowed to run for president, as she is the most popular politician in Ukraine. According to a Reuters poll published Sunday, she would win by a wide margin if she were to take the oath of office. She would also have the right to seek a second term as president of Ukraine, and would have a chance of securing a third term in parliament. In the end, it would only be a matter of time before she could be sworn in as the new president. Ukraine has a long list of candidates who have been elected to the post of president in recent years, but it is unclear whether they will be chosen by the people, or if they'll be given the chance to make their own choices. Some of them have already announced their intentions to enter the presidential race. Others have said they want to see a change of government, such as President Viktor Yanukovych, whose party is seen as a threat to democracy and the rule of law. Meanwhile, many Ukrainians are still waiting for Yanukovych to step down. On Sunday the Ukrainian parliament voted to elect a new head of state in a special election to replace him with a pro-European candidate, Andrj Hegazy. A number of Ukrainian media outlets reported that they had already published a report on the outcome of Saturday's parliamentary vote. One of those stories was that Yanukovych's supporters had called for a referendum on whether he should step aside from the presidency. It was not clear whether the referendum would take place in his own country. However, some observers said it was unlikely to happen, given that Ukraine was already facing a difficult time in terms of its political future. They said the result was still too close to call for an early election date. Ukrainian President Vladimir Putin had promised to hold an emergency meeting in Kiev in early June to discuss the situation. Russia, Ukraine and Russia have long been at loggerheads over the Ukraine crisis. Moscow has repeatedly called on Ukraine to give Ukraine more time to find a way to resolve the crisis, despite the fact that it has yet to agree on a deal on how to deal with it. Putin has also warned that Russia could interfere in any way it sees the current crisis as an opportunity to strengthen its influence in Europe. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told DW that his country was ready to cooperate with Ukraine in its fight against the separatists, although he did not rule out the possibility of a possible military intervention. Kiev has long opposed the idea of an EU-backed coup, arguing that such a move would lead to an escalation of tensions between the two countries. That is, of course, not the case with Russia. And Russia is not a country that wants to interfere with Ukrainian politics. Instead, Russia has already given Ukraine a mandate to do so. Last week, Moscow announced its intention to impose sanctions on Russia's annexation of Crimea and other EU allies, including the United States, to prevent it from becoming a member of NATO. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that Moscow was prepared to intervene if it wanted to avoid a military confrontation with Kiev.

Although the number of farms has declined over the decades, production has actually increased -- especially at dairy farms. Modern automation technology and robotics are helping to keep both cows and farmers happy, but at the cost of jobs.",
        "generated_story": "Dairy Cow Industry: Automation in the Dairy Industry Dairy Cow industry is booming, but it's not just the industry that's booming. It's also the world's largest dairy cow industry, with more than 1.5 million cows produced every year. Dairy cow production has been booming in recent years, driven by a growing demand for dairy products. The industry has also seen an increase in milk production, as well as the number of cows that can be grown in a single day. But there's still a lot of work to be done, and there are still many challenges to overcome. One of the biggest is the lack of automation in dairy cows, which has led to a shortage of milk cows. That's because the cows are too small to produce milk, so the milk is produced in large quantities and the cow is not fed enough milk. This is because cows cannot be milked, nor can cows be fed milk or eggs. And cows can't eat milk at all. In fact, they can only be made from milk from cows and eggs that are grown on the farm, rather than from eggs, milk and butter. So, the dairy industry needs to adapt to the new technology. \"We need to make milk as easy as possible for cows to eat,\" said one industry insider, who asked for anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about his business. Other industry insiders, however, said they were not aware of any such changes, adding that they had no idea what was going on. They also said that there were no plans to change the way cows were fed, or that cows could be raised, in order to feed cows more efficiently. However, this is still not the case, since cows do not have a milk cow. Instead, cows have been raised in cow-fed milks, where cows milk milk to cows for the first time in their lifetimes and cows feed them milk for them. These cows also have the ability to grow their own milk without the need for refrigeration. According to industry experts, a cow can grow as much milk in one day as it can in another. With the advent of refrigerators, cow milk has become the most popular dairy product in America. As a result, farmers are increasingly turning to automated production methods to reduce the cost of production and improve their milk supply. For example, there is a new breed of cow that is growing in popularity with farmers and ranchers. There is even a market for milk produced by cows which is being developed in China, India and Japan. At the same time, it is becoming increasingly difficult for farmers to manufacture milk with the help of automated machinery. Some farmers in India have even resorted to using automated machines, such as milk cartons, to get milk out of their cows because they don't want to have to pay for it. Meanwhile, other farmers have turned to automation to improve milk quality and reduce milk prices. A recent study by the University of California, Berkeley, found that the average milk price is around $3.50 per pound, compared to $2.75 for a beef cow, according to an industry publication. While the market is saturated with milk products, some cows produce more milk than other cows at the moment, that doesn't necessarily mean that milk will be available to farmers. What's more important is that farmers will have access to milk when they need it, given the current milk shortage and high milk demand. Therefore, dairy farmers should be able to sell milk directly to their customers, especially if they have milk that has already been processed and sold to other manufacturers. Milk is one of those products that will benefit from this technology, says one expert who has studied the technology and is familiar with how it works. He says that this will help farmers, because it will give them the best milk they could get. I agree with him, though, he says, \"It's a good thing that we have an automated milk system. We need a system to do that.\" But he also believes that it would be a mistake to go through the process of producing milk again. If milk isn't already available, then milk can still be produced at a higher cost than milk due to its high cost. Why is milk not available? Because milk should not be used as a substitute for eggs and milk? The milk industry in Canada is already suffering from an oversupply problem. How can milk be manufactured? Well, if you're going to use milk substitutes, you'll need an alternative milk product. You can get a raw milk substitute, like milk powder, for example. Or you can buy milk frozen from a dairy farm. Just ask the farmers who are already using milk-based substitutes. When milk comes in, we can sell it to consumers. Then, when milk gets frozen, these cows will also be sold in bulk and then they'll be delivered to customers who want milk instead of having milk made by hand. After all, what's the difference between milk companies have already made milk already in this country. Food is only available at this level. Since milk"

The ruling primarily affects Germany's Turkish minority. The European Union's highest court on Thursday ruled in favor of a Turkish citizen, who was denied a visa to live in Germany with her husband, because she was illiterate and therefore unable to demonstrate basic German-language skills. According to the court, a lack of language skills shouldn't automatically lead to the rejection of an entry visa application. Instead, Germany must consider the unique circumstances of each individual case. The court went on to say that quickly granting visas for spouses improves the quality of life and promotes the integration of foreign residents. Specifically addressing the case of the Turkish plaintiff, the court ruled that the rejection of her visa had violated a bilateral treaty between Turkey and the EU. In 1970, Brussels and Ankara agreed not to tighten their residency laws for each other's citizens. Law only applies to some In 2007, Germany introduced the requirement that spouses from certain non-EU countries must demonstrate a basic grasp of German before being granted a visa to live in Germany with their husbands or wives. Spouses affected by the law are required to obtain a basic language certificate from recognized centers, such as Germany's Goethe Institute, proving that they have an A1 level, or \"Beginning German\" language ability. The German government claims that the goal of the language requirement is to prevent forced marriages as well as marriages made simply for the sake of obtaining a visa. Citizens of European Free Trade Association (EFTA) member states are exempt from the language requirement. That includes Iceland, Lichtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. In addition, citizens of Australia, Canada, Israel, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea and the United States also don't have to demonstrate German-language skills. slk/xx (AFP, AP, dpa, KNA)",
        "generated_story": "European Court of Justice overturns law requiring language skills for spouses in Germany The European Union's highest court has overturned a law that requires spouses to learn German in order to be able to speak German. The court ruled Thursday that the law violated the European Free Trade Association's (EFTA) rules on the use of German as an official language in the EU. It also ruled that Germany should not be allowed to impose the same law on spouses of foreign nationals living in other EU member states. According to the court's ruling, the new law, which was passed in 2007, does not apply to spouses who live in different EU countries. However, it is not the first time that a European court of justice has ruled in favor of a German-Swiss marriage equality law. In the case of the German case, a judge in Lichtenstein, Germany, said that it was \"unacceptable\" that German spouses could be required to use German to communicate with each other. \"It's not right that we have to do this,\" the judge said, adding that \"we don't have the right to make this law.\" The case is the latest in a series of cases in which the courts have ruled against Germany's EU-wide divorce laws. A German court had ruled earlier this year that there was no legal basis for a divorce between spouses and their spouses, and that they were not entitled to an exemption from the divorce law if they did not have German citizenship. Germany is one of only two European countries with a legal exemption for divorce, but the other is New Zealand, Switzerland and South Korea. Both countries have their own laws on language and culture, with the exception of Norway, Sweden and the United States, where the laws were passed by the Constitutional Court in 2006. German courts also have jurisdiction over divorce cases, such as the one in Sweden, Norway and Switzerland. But the ruling is unlikely to change the legal status of divorce proceedings, since the two countries do not share a common language, according to a report by German news agency KNA (AFP, dpa). The decision comes as a result of an EU court ruling on Thursday which upheld a similar law in Denmark, Denmark and Sweden that had been in place for more than a decade. That decision, however, was overturned by a lower court in Strasbourg, France, in 2008, after the country's parliament voted to pass a separate divorce bill that would have required the spouses' consent to register as citizens of their home country. This was followed by an appeal by Germany and Canada, both of which have also passed similar laws in recent years. On Thursday, an appeals court rejected the appeal, saying it lacked the necessary legal authority to enforce the ban on German marriage rights. Read more: EU courts overturn EU divorce rules The EU's divorce code is still in force, despite the fact that many countries are still trying to reach an agreement on how to deal with divorce. For example, Austria and Germany are the only countries in Europe that have not signed an international divorce treaty, while Canada and Japan have signed a bilateral free trade agreement (FTA). In addition, Canada has also signed the agreement with Germany on divorce and child protection, although it has not yet ratified the deal. Norway is also a member of EFTA. Sweden is currently exempt from this agreement, as is Denmark. Switzerland is exempt as well, though it does have its own language law and has a national language license. Denmark is a non-EU member, so it doesn't require German citizens to sign the EFT's agreement. Other EU states are also exempt, including the Netherlands, Poland and Norway. Austria has been exempt since 2007. Canada's decision to join the bloc came into force in 2009, when it took effect in response to concerns over a lack of clarity on immigration and immigration policies. Israel has said it will continue to cooperate with German immigration laws, even if it means it won't be an easy task to get a visa for its citizens. Since then, many of its laws have been amended to allow German nationals to travel to other countries without the consent of EU citizens, leaving them unable to leave their country of origin. There are several exceptions to this rule. One exception is Switzerland, for example. Another is Austria, who has an immigration law which allows them to apply for asylum. And Switzerland has one exception: Sweden has the rights to free movement of citizens in its territory. Iceland is part of Germany. Poland has another exception, too. Hungary and Denmark have both signed on to its EU visa waiver. Japan has already signed up to become a permanent member. Meanwhile, Britain has agreed to take part in negotiations on a new visa regime for citizens who want to study in Canada. France and Britain have said they will not sign up for the visa-free visa lottery. Russia, China, Japan and China have all agreed on visa restrictions. Europe's foreign ministers have expressed concern about the situation in their respective countries, particularly in relation to immigration. They say it would be difficult to obtain visas for foreign citizens living abroad. European courts in Switzerland"

The opposition had called for the government to resign after a tape was leaked in which the Polish foreign minister bashed US and British leaders. The opposition Law and Justice party failed in its bid to oust Prime Minister Donald Tusk on Friday through a vote confidence, the second such vote since the publication of private conversations between high-ranking officials, referred to by some in Poland as \"Waitergate.\" Tusk withstood the opposition challenge by a wide margin of 236-155. The prime minister's Civic Platform party governs Poland in a center-right coalition with the Polish People's party. Last month, recordings of a private conversation between Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski and then-Finance Minister Jacek Rostowski were published by the weekly magazine Wprost. During the conversation, Sikorski said the US-Polish alliance was \"worthless\" and British Prime Minister David Cameron's concessions to euroskeptics had shown his \"incompetence in EU affairs.\" Prior to the leak of the Sikorski recording, Wprost also published a tape in which central bank chief Marek Belka told Interior Minister Bartlomiej Sienkiewicz that he would only support the government's economic policy if Finance Minister Rostowski left his post. The secret recordings were reportedly made over several months, including at high end restaurants in Warsaw. Wprost says it received the tapes from a businessman. Immediately after the conversations were published, Tusk called his own vote of no confidence. His government survived that vote 237-203. slk/rc (AP, AFP, dpa)",
        "generated_story": "Poland's center-right opposition to Donald Tusk resigns after tape scandal The Polish government has announced the resignation of its head of state, Radoslaw Sikorski, following a scandal involving a tape recording of a meeting between the two leaders of the country's ruling Civic Platform party (CPP) and Prime Minister Jacek Rostowski. According to the Polish People's party's website, the meeting took place on Friday in Warsaw, Poland's capital, and was broadcast live on state television. It was the first time that a prime minister had been forced to step down by his own party. The resignation comes after a series of scandals over the past year, including allegations that he had sexually abused a woman in a hotel room in the capital. \"This is a very serious scandal,\" said the party spokesman, Marek Belka, adding that it was \"not an isolated incident.\" \"It is not a matter of whether or not we are going to be able to get rid of this person,\" he said in an interview with Polish news agency Wprost, which was first reported by the paper. Polska's main opposition party has called for a general election in Poland next year and said it would be a referendum on the president's successor. Polish President Law and Justice Minister Bartlomiej Sienkiewicz has also said he will not seek re-election, saying he would prefer to stay in office until a new president is elected. He also called on Poland to take a stand against the EU's anti-immigration policies. In a statement, he also accused the European Union (EU) of failing to protect the rights of Polish citizens and accused Poland of being a \"hostile country\" for migrants and refugees. Poland has been accused of allowing migrants to enter its territory without their consent, a charge that has led to accusations of human rights violations. A number of EU countries have condemned the move, with the US, Britain and the United States calling for an EU-wide ban on migrants from the bloc's member states. On Friday, Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said his country would not allow migrants into Poland and that Poland should be allowed to live in its own country. Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Twitter that Russia was trying to influence the outcome of negotiations with Poland, but he did not rule out the possibility that this could be the case in future. Russia has repeatedly denied the allegations, accusing the West of meddling in Polish affairs. But the Kremlin has rejected the accusations as \"baseless\" and says it has no reason to believe that such a move would have any effect on relations between Russia and Poland. Moscow has denied any involvement in any wrongdoing and has said that the Russian ambassador was not aware of any such allegations. Putin's comments came as a result of his visit to Poland last week, in which he was asked to explain his decision to cancel a planned summit with Putin in Moscow. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told the BBC that Putin had asked for the cancellation of talks with Trump and other European leaders, as well as the visit of British President David Cameron to attend the NATO summit in Brussels next week. 'It's not something that we want to see happen again,' he added, referring to a possible summit between Putin and US President Barack Obama in London on Thursday. However, it is unclear whether Russia or the UK would accept the invitation, given the current situation in Ukraine, or whether it will continue to do so. Many Polish politicians have expressed concern about the lack of cooperation between Moscow, Washington and Washington in their attempts to improve relations with Washington. Some of them have said they are not ready to give up their positions on Russia, while others have suggested that they would like to have a closer relationship with Russia. They have also criticized the government in Washington over its handling of Ukraine's annexation of Crimea and Ukraine. And they have accused Russia of attempting to interfere with elections in other countries, such as Ukraine and Syria. This has raised the prospect of Russia becoming a member of NATO and Iran. Meanwhile, some Polish media outlets have been critical of Trump's visit, claiming he has not been invited to visit the White House to discuss the matter. Trump is expected to travel to Washington on Saturday, according to reports, if he is to meet with his Russian counterpart, Boris Yeltsin, who is also in attendance at the summit. Washington's foreign minister, Sebastian Kurz, also spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity, before Trump was due to fly to Warsaw on Sunday. Reuters, AP, AFP, dpa, Reuters and AFP reported that Polish Foreign Ministry spokesman Aleksandar Kokosk, however, said Trump had no comment on whether Trump would visit Poland in his absence. Foreign ministers, diplomats and foreign ministers have already been briefed by US officials on his trip to London. US Foreign ministry spokesman Sebastian Gorka told reporters that Trump could not be seen as an ally of Putin, despite the fact that Moscow's ambassador to Britain's NATO ally Poland was also visiting Poland on a visit by Putin.

Secretary of State John Kerry is due to arrive in Cairo on Monday where he is expected to urge Hamas to accept a cease-fire agreement offered by Egypt that would halt nearly two weeks of fighting with Israel. Meanwhile, the death toll in Gaza continues to rise. Medics on Monday said the number of Palestinian deaths in Gaza has risen to more than 501 since fighting intensified on Jul 8. Most of the dead are civilians. On the Israeli side, 13 soldiers were killed inside Gaza on Sunday, raising the number of soldiers killed since a ground operation began late on Thursday to 18. Two Israeli civilians also died in mortar and rocket attacks. The Israeli army said that more than 10 militants from Gaza were shot dead on Monday after infiltrating southern Israel. According to army spokespeople, two squads of militants were killed after tunneling into Israel. Israel's UN ambassador Ron Prosor, meanwhile, denied a claim by Hamas that an Israeli soldier had been kidnapped by the Islamist group, saying: \"Those rumurs are untrue.\" US President Barack Obama expressed concern about the rising death toll of civilians in a telephone call Sunday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, according to a White House statement. The US State Department confirmed late Sunday that two US citizens were killed in Gaza violence and released their names, but did not immediately disclose their occupations. US media reported, however, that the two were American members of the Israeli Defense Force, citing relatives and friends. \"We can confirm the deaths of US citizens Max Steinberg and Sean Carmeli in Gaza,\" spokesperson Jen Psaki said in a two-sentence statement.

The US State Department said on Monday that Kerry was due to meet with Egyptian Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Ron Prosor to discuss the situation in Gaza. Kerry's visit to Cairo comes nearly two weeks after the United Nations Security Council held a meeting in New York to try to reach a deal between the two sides. \"We have a lot of work to do,\" Kerry said in a statement, adding that he was \"very pleased\" with the outcome of the meeting, which was attended by Israeli and Egyptian ministers of defense and foreign affairs, as well as foreign ministers from both countries. He also said he hoped the talks would lead to an end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Israel has been fighting Hamas for more than a year and a half, but has so far failed to achieve a lasting ceasefire. On Monday, Kerry met with Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman, who said Israel was ready to negotiate a truce with Hamas. Lieberman said the US would continue to press for an agreement between Hamas and Israel, and that it would be a \"positive step forward\" for both sides in their efforts to broker a peace deal. Netanyahu, meanwhile, has called for the ceasefire to be extended until the end of this month, according to Israel's Foreign Ministry spokesman, Sean Carmeli. Hamas has repeatedly denied any involvement in any ceasefire, saying it was only a temporary truce. Israeli officials have said they were not aware of any such ceasefire until after Kerry visited Cairo on Sunday. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is expected to visit the Egyptian capital, Cairo, on Tuesday and Wednesday, before visiting Israel on Wednesday and Thursday. Palestinians have repeatedly rejected the idea of a cease-fire, accusing it of violating international law. Last week, the Palestinian Authority said it planned to hold a referendum on whether or not to recognize Israel as a state of Israel in order to prevent a Palestinian state from gaining control of its territory. In response, Hamas said that the UN had called on Israel to cease its military operations against the Jewish state on July 8, a day after Israel declared a unilateral ceasefire in response to a deadly Israeli attack on its border with Gaza, killing at least one Israeli soldier and wounding dozens of civilians. Abbas, however, said his government was prepared to accept an interim ceasefire if the Palestinians were allowed to return to their own territory after a two-week-old ceasefire broke down. However, he did not rule out the possibility of an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza altogether. According to Israeli media reports, Palestinian officials said Hamas was preparing to withdraw its troops from the territory in an attempt to strengthen its grip on the West Bank, where it controls a large part of Gaza's territory and which has a population of about 1.5 million Palestinians. But Palestinian spokesman Max Steinberg told the Associated Press that Hamas had not responded to any calls for such a move, citing a lack of coordination between Israeli security forces and the army. 'We are not going to allow this to happen,' he said, referring to Hamas as \"a terrorist organization.\" The Israeli defense ministry also denied Hamas's claim to have been involved in attacks on Israeli civilians in recent weeks. It said a Hamas delegation had been sent to Egypt on Saturday to seek the withdrawal of Israeli troops, while the Hamas spokesman said there was no indication that any Israeli military operation had taken place in Egypt. A spokesman for Hamas denied the claim, calling it an \"absurd claim.\" \"The Palestinian side has not been able to make any progress in negotiations with Israel,\" the spokesman told AFP. Meanwhile, Israel is still trying to find a way to avoid a military withdrawal, despite repeated warnings from US President Barack Obama to not allow it to take place. Gaza is currently under Israeli occupation by Hamas, an Islamist militant group that has claimed responsibility for attacks by Israel since the 2014 Gaza war. US officials say they have not seen any sign of such an attack, though they do not have any evidence to back up their claims. They say Hamas is not a terrorist group and have no intention of doing so, they say, because it is a legitimate threat to its own security and security. Reuters, AFP, AP, dpa, Reuters and Reuters have reported that Palestinian security officials told Reuters that they had no information on Hamas' plans to leave the country. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon was also in attendance at the Cairo meeting. Security Secretary Jen Psaki also told reporters that Israel would not comment on any possible ceasefire talks. She said she was not expecting an announcement until Monday's meeting with Palestinian leaders, including Palestinian leader Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, about a possible deal to end the conflict, in which Hamas could not be reached. Iran has also accused Hamas of seeking an extension of military action against Israel. Tehran has denied accusations that its forces have launched an offensive against Israeli forces in retaliation for its actions in Syria and Egypt's bombardment of civilian targets.

Its warning follows a WHO admission that the epidemic requires \"extraordinary measures.\" The head of Medicins Sans Frontieres (MSF), Joanne Liu -- fresh from a visit to western Africa -- said in Geneva on Friday that more experts were needed in the hard-hit region. \"It is deteriorating faster, and moving faster, than we can respond to,\" Liu told reporters. \"Like in a war time, we have a total collapse of infrastructure,\" she added. Lui said the world community needed to get the \"upper hand\" over the next six months. While the viral spread had been slowed in Guinea, concerns focused especially on Liberia. \"If we don't stabilize Liberia, we will never stabilize the region,\" Lui said. She was critical of the WHO for delaying its public health emergency warning until August 8. \"We need people with a hands-on operational mindset,\" to combat the outbreak, Liu told the Geneva news briefing. WHO - 'vastly underestimated' On Thursday, the World Health Organization (WHO) said the scale of the epidemic had been \"vastly underestimated\" and that \"extraordinary measures\" were needed to contain the contagious virus. The UN health agency said the death toll had climbed to 1,069 in four afflicted countries, spanning Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia and more recently Nigeria. Sierra Leone's chief medical officer Brima Kargbo disclosed on Thursday that at least 32 of the nation's nurses and doctors had died from the Ebola virus while performing their duties between May 24 and August 13. Local staff suffered stigma, despite saving lives, Kargbo said. \"We still have to break the chain of transmission to separate the infected from the uninfected.\" Youth Olympics also affected The mounting alarm coincided with an announcement Friday from the International Olympics Committee that three athletes from Ebola-hit countries had been barred from competing in pool events and combat sports at the Youth Olympics opening in China on Saturday. ipj/tj (AfP, Reuters)",

The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said on Thursday that it was \"impeding\" the response to the epidemic, which has killed more than 1,000 people since the outbreak began on May 24. \"This is a very worrying development,\" said Joanne Liu, MSF's chief medical officer for Africa and the Middle East, in a statement sent to reporters in Geneva on Friday. It was the first time the WHO had called for an international medical conference in the country since Ebola was discovered in March. WHO said it would hold an emergency meeting on August 8 to discuss how to respond to an outbreak of the disease, adding that efforts to prevent the spread of Ebola were already under way. In the next six months, the International Olympics Committee is expected to hold a conference on Ebola, with a focus on the treatment of those who have contracted the virus, as well as the prevention of future outbreaks. On Friday, a WHO spokesman said the organization would be holding a meeting with the international Olympic committee to decide on a strategy for fighting the crisis. He added that \"we will continue to monitor the situation closely, and we will make sure that we are prepared for the best possible response.\" The WHO has also said that if Ebola spreads, it will spread to other countries, such as Nigeria and Nigeria, where it is believed to be the most contagious disease in Africa. But it's not clear if this will be enough to stop the hemorrhagic fever outbreak, according to WHO. According to a UN report, Ebola is spreading rapidly across the continent and spreading to neighboring countries. At the same time, health officials are warning that there is an increase in cases of people dying from the deadly virus. They are also warning about the risk of infection, particularly in countries with high levels of HIV and AIDS (HIV), which is the leading cause of death for people who are infected with Ebola. Doctors in Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria (AfP) and Niger (MSF) are among the countries that have the highest number of cases, but they are not the only ones who face the threat of contagion. There is also a growing concern that Ebola could spread in other parts of Africa, especially in developing countries where there are high-risk populations. This is because of a lack of access to medical care and a shortage of doctors, nurses, doctors and other health workers, who often have to travel to hospitals, hospitals and clinics to receive treatment. Many of them are sick and suffering from severe dehydration, diarrhea, vomiting, fever and diarrhea. And there's no cure for this disease. That's why the world's largest health organization, WHO, is calling for urgent action to address the problem, saying it has a long list of urgent urgent needs, including the urgent need to find a cure. A new Ebola vaccine is being developed to help people recover from Ebola and prevent further spread. If the vaccine isn't available by the end of August 13, experts say it won't be available until September, when a new vaccine could be made available to people in Liberia. MSFF is currently working with WHO to develop a vaccine for Ebola patients. Meanwhile, international health experts have warned against the use of antibiotics to treat people with HIV, TB and TB in their blood, because it could lead to more severe infections. As a result, more people are being infected and more cases are likely to die from this deadly disease than from other diseases, they have been treated for, at least for a few months. Ebola has become a major problem for many countries in West Africa in recent years, leading to shortages of medicines, medicines and medicines. Most of these diseases are transmitted through the blood of infected people, while others are treated with antibiotics, antibiotics and antibiotics. So far, no vaccine has been approved for use in Ebola cases. However, some countries have not been able to provide adequate treatment for patients with chronic diseases. For example, Guinea's health minister, Brima Kargbo, told Reuters that she was told by a health official that an Ebola patient who had been infected by Ebola in May was being treated at a hospital in Nigeria. She said she had no idea what to expect from a doctor who was treated in that hospital. Speaking to Reuters, she said: \"I am very concerned that this is going to happen. I have no doubt that I will not receive any treatment at this time. We have a lot of patients who will need treatment in this country and that is why I am so worried about this outbreak,\" she told reporters at the time of her visit to Geneva. Addressing the humanitarian crisis, Dr. Lui said, \"We are working to get a better understanding of how Ebola can be treated, so that people can get better treatment and treatment options for those with severe health conditions.\" Doctors are still waiting for treatment, he said.

Conservative members of Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition put forward a united front at the weekend against recent developments in the city of Wuppertal. Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said civilians wearing uniforms bearing the logo \"Shariah police\" could not simply start patrolling German streets. The groups reportedly hovered around sites like discotheques and gambling houses, telling passers-by to refrain from gambling and alcohol. Wuppertal's police have begun pressing charges. \"Sharia law is not tolerated on German soil,\" de Maiziere told mass-circulation daily Bild on Saturday. \"Nobody can take it upon themselves to abuse the good name of the German police.\" Justice Minister Heiko Maas, meanwhile, told Bild that \"the state alone\" was responsible for the administration of justice in Germany. It was obvious, Maas said, that any illegal parallel system of law enforcement would not be tolerated. Christian Democrat party whip Volker Kauder was similarly emphatic in an interview to be published in this week's Welt am Sonntag newspaper. \"Under absolutely no circumstances can we tolerate self-styled 'Sharia police officers' patrolling our streets and dictating what people should or should not do,\" Kauder said. Ringleader: goal was attention The 33-year-old behind the Wuppertal patrols, former fireman Sven Lau, published a video on his website on Saturday. Lau said that a \"Sharia police\" never existed, and that a group of men had simply worn the mock uniforms for a few hours. \"We knew that this would raise attention,\" Lau said, claiming that his goal was to spark a debate about Sharia law in Germany. Lau is a leading member of Germany's Salafist movement, advocates of a strict Sunni interpretation of political Islam. He works with a mosque in his native M\u00f6nchengladbach, not far west of Wuppertal, and used to head the fundamentalist group \"Invitation to Paradise.\" (Einladung zum Paradies, in German.) The central council of Muslims in Germany (ZMD) condemned the activities. \"These few teen yobs do not speak in our name,\" chairman Ayman A. Mazyek told the Tagesspiegel am Sonntag newspaper. \"These people are perverting the name of our religion. With this shrill and foolish action, they are really hurting Muslims.\" Sharia law is the Arabic term for a legal system based on the Koran. Saudi Arabia and Iran are examples of countries where such a system officially applies. Wearing a veil is obligatory for women and corporal punishment such as stoning is legally tolerated.

He said he was \"very disappointed\" by what he saw as a \"sharia-like\" police presence in his town, which he described as an \"invitation to Paradise.\" \"We are not going to tolerate this kind of behavior,\" said the 33-year-old, who was arrested in August in connection with an attempted murder of a Muslim man in Saudi Arabia. The case was brought to the attention of human rights groups, including Human Rights Watch (HRW) and Amnesty International (Amnesty International), which have been monitoring the case for years. In August, a German court sentenced a man to 16 days in prison for attempting to murder his wife and two children. On Saturday, he received a three-day jail sentence for trying to kill the man, and was released on bail on a promise to return to Germany within a few hours. His release came a week after he had been charged with inciting a terrorist attack in Iran. According to a report by the German news agency Tagesspiegel am Sonntag, prosecutors said they were looking into the possibility of him being extradited to Iran to face charges related to his alleged involvement in an attack on an Iranian woman in Tehran last year. German prosecutors have also opened an investigation into alleged links between the attack and the death of two Iranian women and their alleged accomplices. Germany's Interior Minister Volker Kauder, however, said it was not clear whether the charges against him were politically motivated, but he did not rule out the idea that it could be a case of mistaken identity. It is also unclear whether he has been convicted of any other crime, or if he will be sentenced to life imprisonment for his role as the ringleader of an Islamic terrorist organization, ZMD (ZMD). \"I don't think there is any basis for such an accusation. I think it is very clear that this is not something that can be tolerated in a country where the rule of law is so strict and that there are so many people who do not want to be treated as criminals. There are a lot of people in this country who believe that Islam is the only religion that is acceptable in their own country. That is why we have to stand up for the rights of all people, not just those who are against it. We must stand by our people and not allow this to happen. This is what we stand for and we will continue to do.\" The arrest was the first of many in recent weeks, according to German media reports. A police spokesman told the newspaper that police had not been able to provide any information on the incident, saying they had only been informed of it by a police officer. However, police have not yet received any formal complaint from the media. They have said that \"the case against the Ringleader is still under investigation,\" and they are still investigating the circumstances surrounding the alleged attack. Many of those arrested have denied any involvement. Some of them are also accused of having links to al-Qaeda and other terrorist organizations, while others have accused them of being involved in other extremist activities, such as drug trafficking. Others say they have no knowledge of what is going on in Syria, Iran or other countries. But they also say that many of these cases are being investigated by police, as well as by prosecutors and prosecutors. These allegations are based on allegations of torture, torture and abuse of minors. If the investigation is successful, it will only be because the perpetrators will face punishment for their crimes, rather than because of their actions. For example, they could face prosecution for crimes committed against minors or for violating the laws of Islam. Prosecutors have already opened a criminal investigation against a number of suspects. Meanwhile, some people have called for an appeal for a court to investigate the arrest of one suspect. Police have so far refused to make any arrests, even though the suspect has already been released from jail. Authorities have yet to issue an arrest warrant for this case, though they say it may be possible to detain the accused. (Reuters, AFP, dpa, AP, Reuters) \"This case is an example of how the government has not done enough to ensure that no one is being held accountable for what they did,\" the spokesman said. Last week, German authorities arrested two men, one of whom was a member of parliament and one was convicted for insulting the Prophet, Ayman A. Mazyek, an outspoken critic of Islamic fundamentalists and others who were convicted in absentia. Law enforcement officials say the suspects were found to have violated the law."

The money is to come from the Russian pensions system. Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov unveiled a plan Monday aimed at creating a \"multi-billion-dollar\" funding vehicle for companies hit by Western sanctions. Moscow-based news agency RIA quoted Siluanov as saying that the emergency fund would be set up next year with money originally earmarked for the State Pension Fund and leftover funds from this year's budget. According to RIA, Moscow was planning to devote \"at least 100 billion roubles\" (2 billion euros) to the fund, which will mainly be aimed at helping cash-starved Russian banks and key oil companies. \"These 100 billion roubles will be added to the reserve next year, which will allow us to help companies,\" RIA quoted Siluanov as saying. \"We are planning to create a reserve of significant size.\" Just last week, the European Union and the United States imposed a third round of sanctions on Moscow for Russia's involvement in the Ukraine conflict. The latest sanctions target the Russian banking sector as well as key energy firms and arms manufacturers. As one of several companies that have asked for government help, Russia's oil giant Rosneft said it would need 1.5 trillion roubles ($39.70 billion) in aid to keep exploring for oil. Siluanov also told RIA news agency that the decision to stop transferring money to the Pension Fund would hand the budget an extra 309 billion roubles. It will be the second year running that Moscow has stopped transfers of funds from the budget to the Pension Fund, which provides benefits for Russia's pensioners, some invalids and families who have lost their breadwinners. uhe/nz (Reuters, RIA)",
        "generated_story": "Russia to create multi-billion-dollar pension fund for companies hit by Ukraine conflict Russia is set to set up a multi billion-euro fund to help companies affected by sanctions over the conflict in Ukraine. The State Pension Fund said on Monday that it would create a fund of up to 1.5 trillion roubles ($39.70 billion) to cover the losses caused by the sanctions. It said the fund would be created in the second year of a two-year deal with the European Union and the United States. \"This is the first time that we will be able to invest in companies that have suffered from sanctions,\" said Anton Siluanov, head of Russia's state pension Fund (RIA). \"We will have to look at how much we can invest,\" he added, referring to the Russian state-owned oil company Rosneft, which has been hit with sanctions since the annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in March 2014. He added that the funds would cover \"at least 100 billion rubles\" of losses incurred by Russian companies, including state oil giant Gazprom and state gas giant Lukoil, and that \"we will invest at least 50 percent of our assets in this fund.\" The fund will also have access to funds from the EU, the US and other countries, he said, adding that he expected to receive around 2 billion euros ($3.7 billion). The plan was first announced in 2014, when the government of President Vladimir Putin signed an agreement with Ukraine's president, Petro Poroshenko, in which the two countries agreed to cooperate on the future of the country's economy. Russia has said it is ready to take part in a new round of sanctions against Ukraine, but it did not specify which companies would receive the money. In its first year, Russia announced plans to increase the amount of money it has to spend on pensions, saying it was prepared to do so in order to protect the interests of its citizens. However, it also said that this would not be the case for all the companies involved, as it had already done for the past two years. According to a report by RIA news agency, a total of 309 billion riyals ($40 billion), the total amount could rise to 2.6 billion, if the new fund is approved by parliament. Russian authorities have also announced that they would take a closer look into the situation in Crimea, where the separatists are fighting a Russian-backed separatist insurgency in eastern Ukraine that has killed hundreds of thousands of people. Moscow has also promised to reduce the number of Russian citizens living in its territory, according to an official statement. A spokesman for Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, who is also a member of Putin's cabinet, said he was not aware of any plans for an increase in Russian pension funds. But he did say that Russia was \"not going to change its stance on Ukraine at this time.\" \"It is not a matter of whether or not we want to make any changes to our pension system,\" the statement said. Mededev said his ministry would continue to work closely with Russia on a plan to improve the financial situation of all Russian firms, with a view to reducing the risk of defaulting on its obligations to investors. On Monday, Russian media reported that Moscow had approved the creation of an investment fund with an initial goal of $2 billion ($1.4 trillion) in assets worth $4 billion (2.3 trillion euros) and a loan of 3.8 billion pounds ($4.1 billion Euros) for oil and gas companies. This would make it the largest such fund in Russia since Ukraine was annexed by Russia in 1991, after the Soviet Union in 1989. That was the year that sanctions were imposed on Russia and Ukraine had been lifted. Since then, sanctions have been imposed against Russia, many companies have failed to pay salaries, pensions and salaries to their employees. For example, oil companies such as oil refiners have had to cut their salaries and pensions. Oil refineries have already been shut down in recent years due to sanctions imposed by Washington, Washington and Brussels. Analysts say the move is likely to be a step in that direction, given the current economic situation. Meanwhile, investors are also worried about the prospect of more sanctions on Russian oil firms. Investors have expressed concern about Russian energy firms that could be affected if sanctions are lifted, particularly if they are forced to sell their assets. Some investors have criticized the decision to buy assets from Russia as a way to avoid a possible collapse in oil prices, while others have called for a return to normalization of energy prices. Many investors fear that Russian investors will lose out on their investments, analysts say. They say this is a sign of how Russia will respond to international sanctions, especially in light of recent sanctions and political turmoil. Businessmen have said they expect Russia to continue its efforts to ease its dependence on oil, gas and natural gas exports. Experts say they have not seen any signs of economic recovery in Europe, Europe or the Middle East and Asia. Industry experts have warned that oil exports to Ukraine are already have raised concerns"

US General Philip Breedlove said Russian forces were still operating inside Ukraine. Speaking to reporters after a meeting with NATO military chiefs in Lithuania's capital Vilnius on Saturday, US General Philip Breedlove expressed \"sincere hope\" about a renewed peace plan, agreed to earlier in the day in the Belarusian capital Minsk, by separatists and representatives from Ukraine's and Russia's governments. The new pact, including an artillery buffer zone, was a move to strengthen a peace plan signed earlier this month, also in Minsk. However, Breedlove said violence levels in Ukraine in recent days were as high as prior to the earlier ceasefire. \"The ceasefire is still there in name, but what is happening on the ground is quite a different story,\" Breedlove said, adding that Russian forces were still operating in Ukraine, although he could not pinpoint how many. \"The fluidity of movement of Russian forces and Russian-backed forces back and forth across that border makes it almost impossible to understand the numbers,\" he said. A convoy from Russia consisting of about 170 trucks arrived in Ukraine on Saturday, with a reported cargo of humanitarian aid. Previous aid convoys sent from Russia were met with outrage in Kyiv, as it was suspected they may have been used to provide support to the pro-Moscow separatists in eastern Ukraine. Russia has repeatedly denied such accusations. The separatists have said they want to break from Kyiv and have already declared \"people's republics'\" in Donetsk and Luhansk. This week Ukraine's parliament passed a bill which paves the way for more autonomy for those areas. While neither Russia nor Ukraine are members of NATO, both share borders with NATO countries. se/ksb (AP, AFP)",
        "generated_story": "The ceasefire in Ukraine is 'in name only', US general Philip Breedlove has said. The ceasefire has been declared in Minsk, Ukraine's capital, but it is unclear whether it will be extended to other parts of the country, including the eastern city of Luhansk. \"We are not going to extend the ceasefire,\" said US military chief of staff Lieutenant General Philip Boles, speaking to reporters in Vilnius, Lithuania. 'We will not extend it to any other part of Ukraine, not even in the name of peace,' he said, adding that he was not aware of any ceasefire. He added that \"the ceasefire is not an extension of a ceasefire that has already been agreed upon by the international community and the Ukrainian government.\" \"It is a continuation of an agreement reached earlier this month between the two sides,\" he added, referring to an earlier ceasefire agreement between Russia and Ukraine. Read more: \"The truce was agreed to by all sides, and it has not been extended at all.\" The truce, which was announced on Saturday, is aimed at ending the fighting between pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine and Russian-backed separatists, who have been fighting for more than a year to regain control of their territory. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko have also called for an end to the conflict, with the aim of ending it within a month. Moscow has also said it would not allow the use of force against the separatists. Russia has denied the allegations, saying it had no intention of doing so. Ukraine has repeatedly denied that it was seeking to use force, accusing the US of using excessive force in order to achieve its aims. But Moscow denies the accusations and says it does not have the authority to impose its will on the people of Donetsk, a city that Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014. In a statement, the Russian Foreign Ministry said that Moscow had \"no intention\" of imposing any restrictions on its citizens. However, it did not rule out the possibility of extending the truce until the end of this week, according to a Russian military spokesman. NATO Secretary General Sergei Shoigu said in an interview with AFP that the situation in Donetsk was in \"a very serious state of emergency\" and that there was no need for a military operation to be carried out. It was also not clear whether Russia would be allowed to take part in any sort of military operations, such as the deployment of troops to Donetsk. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Friday that Washington would continue to work closely with Russia to ensure that Ukraine was able to reach a peaceful solution to its territorial dispute with Moscow. Speaking to AFP, British Prime Minister Theresa May said she was \"very optimistic\" about the prospects for peace talks between Moscow and Kiev. She said the talks were \"in a very good way\" but warned that a deal could not be reached without Russia's help. According to Kyiv's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, \"I am very optimistic that we will see a resolution to this conflict within the next few days.\" Russia is the main guarantor of ceasefire talks in Moscow, she added. Putin has accused Ukraine of violating international law by violating the terms of its ceasefire and has threatened to withdraw troops from the border with Ukraine if they do not agree to it. Kiev has rejected the idea, however, that such a move could lead to further escalation of hostilities. Last month, Russia accused the United States of trying to undermine the fragile ceasefire by arming separatist rebels and arming them with weapons of mass destruction. On Friday, Moscow accused Moscow of arming the rebels, while Moscow denied accusations of human rights abuses and said Moscow was behind the violence. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that Putin's comments were not a threat to Moscow's position. A spokesman for the Kremlin said Russia had not responded to calls for talks with Kiev and Moscow to discuss the issue. Officials in Kiev said they were still working to find a way to resolve the crisis, although they had yet to agree on an exact date for them to do so, as well as a timetable for when the new ceasefire would take effect. Reuters, AFP and AP, citing unnamed sources, reported that Russian Defense Ministry officials in Lithuania, told Reuters that Kiev was preparing to announce a new round of talks on Sunday. Lavrov also told the news agency's daily press conference that talks had been scheduled to resume on Monday. Meanwhile, Putin said he would keep a close eye on Ukraine until Moscow is ready to make a decision on whether Moscow would accept the cease-fire agreement, despite the fact that they have already agreed on a number of demands for concessions from Moscow in return for its support for Kiev's annexation of territory from Russia. Ukrainian officials have denied any such demands. They also accused Russia of attempting to influence the outcome of negotiations with Washington's decision to end the peace process. Washington has called on Kiev to cooperate with NATO, calling it a \"positive step toward a negotiated settlement. This is an important step in resolving the Ukraine crisis. Foreign ministers have not yet made clear that no deal was reached with Russian diplomats in response to Russia"

        "target": "Opinion: Obama's Cuban revolution President Barack Obama has made a very special declaration of love to Cuba. It's as revolutionary as the Cuban revolution, and as peaceful as the biblical Sermon on the Mount, says DW's Astrid Prange. US President Barack Obama has lost his old communist \"enemy,\" and Cuban President Raul Castro has lost his hatred of capitalism. In the first phone call from president to president since 1961 the two heads of state came to a surprisingly swift agreement. They want to renew diplomatic relations, which have been on ice for more than 50 years, and exchange ambassadors. It's only a matter of time before the US lifts its trade embargo against Cuba. All the word \"embargo\" is really good for - at this stage - is as an ideological soapbox for political hardliners, especially Republicans in Congress who believe lifting sanctions would constitute defeat for the US. Yet the lifting of the embargo has already begun. In addition to medication, it has been possible since 2000 to export agricultural produce such as maize, cereal crops, and poultry to Cuba. Flirting with the rogue state Furthermore, 100,000 US citizens have travelled to Cuba since 2011 for cultural and scientific exchanges. Travel restrictions on Cubans living in exile in the US who wanted to visit their relatives on the island were also lifted. According to press reports, the two countries' military forces are even said to be cooperating, as are their coastguards, and military on the border of the US marine base in Guantanamo. Now Obama wants to officially open a \"new chapter\" in relations with the communist Caribbean island and remove Cuba from the US list of so-called \"rogue states\" that support terrorism. The travel ban on American tourists visiting the island will also largely be lifted. That's as far as things will go for the time being, as Obama would require a majority in Congress in Washington to lift the embargo entirely. But even if these are only small steps, the fall of the American-Cuban wall has begun. The easing of the sanctions and the resumption of diplomatic relations are setting the scene for an end to the embargo. Embargo as scapegoat The tearing down of this \"wall in the mind\" is long overdue. The blockade is obsolete, and has proved to be entirely ineffective. More than this, its advocates have achieved the opposite of what they actually wanted. The blockade has provided the leaders in Havana with an easy excuse for their economic failure. Raul Castro realized long ago that Cuba's economic problems can no longer be justified simply by citing the US embargo. It looks as though he was counting on the blockade being lifted: There is no other explanation for the completion of the Mariel container port in January this year. Cuba's biggest infrastructure project was, incidentally, financed by Brazil. The Brazilians also sent a declaration of love to Cuba. Raul Castro opened the door to them. He loves anyone who helps him - his friends even more than his enemies.",
        "generated_story": "The Fall of the Wall in the Mind of Cuban President Barack Obama Brazilians are celebrating the end of a long war between the US and Cuba. President Obama has vowed to continue the fight against the communist regime in Cuba, which has been accused of human rights abuses by the Cuban government for years. The Cuban president, Raul Castro, has promised to end the war, but has so far refused to do so. In January this year, he announced that he would be stepping down from his post as Cuba's president. \"I am going to go back to my post,\" he said in a statement, referring to his role in ending the Cold War. He also said that Cuba would continue to cooperate with the United States in its efforts to build a better future for its people. But he added that \"we will not be able to achieve that without the help of our people.\" \"We will be doing everything we can to protect the people of Cuba,\" the president said, adding that his administration would \"continue to fight for the rights of all Cubans, including the right to freedom of expression.\" The US has long denied that it was involved in any form of torture, and has repeatedly denied any involvement in such crimes. However, in January 2011, the Obama administration announced it would close the Guantanamo Bay detention facility for Cuban nationals. It was the first time that a US president had visited Cuba since 1961, when Fidel Castro was overthrown by a democratically elected government. Obama's visit to Cuba in 2011 marked a turning point in relations between Cuba and the rest of Latin America, where the two countries have been at loggerheads for decades. Cuba is the only country in Latin American and Caribbean history that has not been subjected to the same kind of political repression as Brazil. And it's not just Cuba that is at the center of this conflict. There are other countries, too. Brazil, for example, is one of them, as well as Russia and China, that are also at war with each other. This is not the case in Brazil either. Havana, however, does not seem to have any intention of ending its war on the Castro regime. Instead, it seems to be focusing more on its own internal politics, rather than on what it is doing in terms of its foreign policy. Last year the Brazilian government announced plans to close its Guantanamo prison in order to prevent a repeat of what happened in 1961. Astrid Prange, a member of Brazil's parliament, told DW that the decision was taken \"in the spirit of reconciliation and reconciliation\" and that there was no need for a military intervention. She added: \"It was a very difficult time for Cuba to come to terms with what was going on in their own country. We have to make sure that we have a strong, strong and united country that will stand up for what is right and what we believe in.\" Read more: Cuba: What is happening in Havana?

Or will it retaliate against Washington's actions? I don't know. I think it depends on who you are talking to. If you're a Cuban, you know the answer to that question. You know what I'm talking about. That's the question of whether or not you have the courage to speak up and say what you believe about what's happening to you and your country, because that's what the world is going through right now. So, let's talk about that. Let's see what happens next, shall we? We'll see how Cuba responds to these threats. Is it a good idea to send a message to Washington or do something about it? Well, there's a lot of things that have already been said about Cuba before. One thing is for sure: that Havana is a great country and we're not ready to give up on it. After all, we've already made a deal with Washington. For now, this is just a matter of time. How long will we wait until we get a resolution? And how long can we be prepared for that? Cuba has already given us a clear answer? It's unclear, of course, if it will take some time before we'll have an answer. From the beginning, I'd like to see a response from the White House. Just ask the President himself, who has said he's prepared to say that in his own words, \"Let's just say we are ready for it.\" In his speech to Congress, Obama said: 'I'm not going anywhere.\" He was referring specifically to a speech he delivered in 2012.

The case has highlighted the army's problems with equipment and morale. The men sentenced to death on Wednesday were part of the special forces division ordered in August to retake three towns in Borno state, which had been taken over by the Islamist Boko Haram insurgents. Their lawyer, Femi Falana, said the 54 men were sentenced to death by firing squad and five had been acquitted. They were accused of conspiring to commit mutiny against the authorities of the 7th Division of the Nigerian army, which is on the frontline. The trial began on October 15 and was conducted behind closed doors. It is subject to approval by top military officials, but there has so far been no indication that senior officers oppose the court martial. They were not available for comment afterwards. There was a similar case in Nigeria in September, when 12 soldiers were sentenced to death for mutiny after firing on their commanding officer in the northeast city of Maiduguri. The 7th Division, based in Maiduguri, leads the offensive but there are numerous reports of troops refusing to deploy. Soldiers have regularly complained that they lack weapons, food, and other basic supplies to fight the Islamists, who are reported to have tanks, rocket-propelled-grenade launchers, and other heavy weaponry. Boko Haram has taken a number of towns and declared an Islamic caliphate in the region near the border with Cameroon. The Nigerian military has in recent weeks claimed to have made progress in recapturing lost territory. Thousands of people have been killed since the Islamist uprising began five years ago.

He added that it was not necessary to go to court in order to prevent the attack, adding that there was no need for military intervention. According to a statement, the court decision was based on a court order that had been handed down in August. It also said that the prosecution would not be able to make any further arrests until the investigation into the attacks was completed. On Wednesday, police said they had found no evidence of any involvement by the armed groups, and that they were not allowed to take part in any action. They said there were no plans to carry out any sort of offensive against civilians. However, they did say they would be prepared to fight if they could, given the situation in their own country. At the same time, military forces have been deployed across the country to counter the insurgency, with the aim of stopping the spread of Islamist militancy. There have also been reports of attacks in Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Niger, as well as in Chad. In August, a Cameroonian military unit was deployed to the area, where the fighting raged for five years, killing at least 10 people and injuring more than 100 others, according to local media reports. This is the first time that a Nigerian army unit has faced such an attack in a five-year period. Last year, Nigerian troops were killed in clashes between the two groups. Since then, several other soldiers have died, including one who was shot and wounded in an airstrike in September. Meanwhile, thousands of civilians have fled to neighboring Chad in search of safety, while thousands more have returned to their homes in northern Nigeria to escape the violence. Many of them are still fighting for their lives. Some have even been arrested, others are being held in detention camps in neighboring Niger. But the government has not commented on the case, saying it is too early to comment on whether or not it will be used as an example of how the conflict could be resolved. Most of those arrested are suspected of being members of a terrorist organization, though some are also suspected to have links to al-Qaeda and are accused of carrying out attacks against security forces in Nigeria's northern neighbor Chad and Cameroon. Authorities have yet to confirm whether they have arrested any of their members. An army spokesman told dpa news agency that no one has yet been charged with any crimes against humanity.

But this weekend, he will have to settle for second place. \"I think I'm going to be able to do that,\" said Alonso, who has been struggling to find a way to win this season's championship. Alonso has already won three races in a row, including two victories in Britain and Canada, but he has yet to have a victory in his last four races. His best finish was second in Mexico in 2015, when he finished third in that race, and fourth in Australia in 2016. That was the first time he had won a race in three years. And then he won in Brazil in 2014. Raikonen, meanwhile, was third last season in Formula 1, winning two of those races with McLaren, Ferrari and Williams. On Sunday, the two-time world champion will take to the track to defend his title, which he said he would like to achieve. In his second year in F1, Alonso won two consecutive races, with his best result coming in 2011 and 2012. This year, though, his form has dipped to a low point, as he struggled to get back into the top 10 in both the German and British constructors' standings. It's the second time in two years that he's failed to make the podium. Last year he was fourth, after finishing fifth in Monaco, before finishing sixth in Bahrain and finishing fourth at Indianapolis. Now he'll be in pole position for next weekend's British GP, where he is expected to take on McLaren's Sebastian Vettel and Ferrari in qualifying. After a disappointing second-place finish at the Mexican Grand prix, Valtteri Bottas is set to challenge for third place, ahead of Alonso's Mercedes teammate, Jenson Button, in Sunday's final round of qualifying in Germany. Both drivers are looking to improve on their performances in Russia and the United States. They are also aiming for a second consecutive world championship, having won both of their last five races together in 2012 and 2013. However, both drivers have struggled with their form in recent years and have been unable to break through the barriers to gain a grip on the world's top-tier sport. Button is the only driver who can beat Alonso in this race. Hamilton, however, has struggled so far with the pace and pace of Ferrari, McLaren and Mercedes, while Ferrari are the other two drivers who are still in contention to claim the overall title. Teammate Sergio Perez has also struggled, failing to qualify for both races and has had to retire from the race after suffering an engine failure in Malaysia and Bahrain. Despite his struggles, Hamilton has managed to hold on to his championship lead for now, despite the fact that the Japanese driver is still only 25 points adrift of Hamilton in fourth place in 2017. Meanwhile, Button has a strong chance of winning the championship in India, although he faces a stiff challenge from Ferrari driver Sergio Marchionne in Hungary. If he doesn't win, it will likely be a tough task for Ferrari to keep pace with him. McLaren will also be hoping to avoid a repeat of its struggles in China and India. With Alonso out of contention, they will need to focus on defending their title with Williams and McLaren in order to stay on course for another title shot in Abu Dhabi next week. For Ferrari drivers, this is a huge step forward in terms of strategy and strategy, especially in relation to their strategy. Mercedes is also hoping that Ferrari can get a better result than Ferrari with its new engine and a new strategy that will allow them to compete with Ferrari at a faster pace. Williams has the advantage of having a more experienced driver in Alonso at its disposal. Fernando will now have the opportunity to test his new car in Spain, a move that would have made him the most successful driver of all time. Speaking to reporters after his victory, Schumi said: \"It's a great opportunity for me to see how much I can improve. I think we've got a lot of things to work on. We'll see what we can do.\" The German team's strategy is to build on his performance and improve their position in 2018. Expectations are high for Alonso to finish the year on a high note, even if it's not as good as the British driver's performance this time around. There's no doubt that Alonso will get the best of him, too, because he can be the quickest driver on track and in front of a crowd of fans. Even if he does not have much of an advantage in races like this one, there's always the possibility of getting a podium finish. 'We're going into next year"

        "target": "German Publishers Warm to Google Library Google is heading for a legal battle with American publishers over its plan to digitize books from five major libraries. But German publishers seem warm to the idea. Five major US publishers filed suit in San Francisco on Wednesday to block Google from scanning books without the permission of copyright holders. The project, already underway but stopped by Google in August, is the Silicon Valley company's bid to make the world's books searchable online. Five major libraries are already participating in the project and Google sent executive Jennifer Grant to the Frankfurt Book Fair on Wednesday to present the idea to European and German book publishers. This week Google introduced print.google.de, the German version of the search engine Google posted online this time last year. Google lets users type in a search term then scans its digitized library for the word or expression and produces a list of books where the term is mentioned. Users can then click on the results and a few pages of the text appear allowing users to read up online. The idea is to supplement Internet users with another source of material. In contrast to their American colleagues, German publishing houses have reacted well to the database. Some German publishers on board Google said that is discussing terms with all major German publishers. Langenscheidt, which publishes a large selection of dictionaries, said they had got on board. \"We are starting with 160 books,\" Hubert Haarmann, head of the electronic publishing division and the publisher, told the Financial Times Deutschland. \"We see it as an additional distribution possibility.\" An increased and more direct reach to the consumer is just one way Google is promoting its new project to skeptical publishers. The company also says that publishers will be able to monitor interest in titles through the search engine, and use the information in deciding whether to reprint certain books. Google has also promised publishers a cut of the advertising that will appear on the site. Not all German publishers are on board. In fact, the German association representing publishers has announced it will begin its own project where publishers can scan their own books, rather than let someone else do it. The project is not a competitor to Google, but will allow publishers to create their own database, rather than turn it over to the search engine. If Google can, anyone can But American publishers don't want to even take that step. They fear a slippery slope if Google is allowed to digitize copyrighted material. \"If Google can make \u2026 copies, then anyone can,\" Patricia Schroeder, president of the Association of American Publishers, said in a phone interview with Reuters. \"Anybody could go into a library and start making digital copies of anything.\" At issue is the right of authors and their publishers to their own work versus the \"fair use\" of their work by the public. Google argues that their search engine will only offer users a \"card catalog\" function, with a few pages of text. No one will be able to read the entire book online.",
        "generated_story": "A German-language search engine for books is gaining traction in the US, the Financial Times Deutschland reported Wednesday. The German search giant has launched a new service called Print.google.de, which aims to make it easier for people to find books in German. It's called Google Book Search, and it's based in San Francisco, California. Google is one of the most popular search engines for German books, with more than 1.5 million searches per day, according to the Frankfurt Book Fair's website. \"It's a great way to get to know people in Germany,\" said Patricia Schroeder, head of Google's German division, in an interview with Reuters. Read more: Google searches for book titles for Germany, France, Austria, Spain, Italy, Russia, China, Japan and the United States, among other countries. But it also has a lot to do with the German language, as well as the fact that German is the language of Germany's most populous country. For example, Google uses German as its primary language to search for titles in English, German, French, Spanish, Italian and Spanish. In addition, it uses English as a second language for search terms, such as \"book\" and \"fiction.\" The company also offers a German translation service, called \"Google Booksearch,\" which is based on German and French. According to Google, this service is available to anyone who wants to use German in their search queries. This means that the search results can be used in a variety of different languages, from German to English to French to Spanish to Italian, Dutch and Italian. There are also a number of German languages that are available on the site, including French and English. And, of course, there are German ones, like \"German,\" \"English\" or \"French,\" and even \"Spanish.\" Google has been a big hit with German readers in recent years, particularly the younger generation, who are more likely to read German than the older generation. Last year Google was the first company to offer German translations to its German users. Since then it has become a major source of information for those who want to learn more about German culture, language and culture. On Wednesday Google announced that it would be expanding its search capabilities to include English-speaking countries and other languages in order to increase its reach in Europe and beyond. That means it will be able to provide a more comprehensive list of books for which German publishers are interested, rather than relying solely on a single search term. So far, so good, indeed, that's been the case with Google. However, many of its searches have been limited to German titles, because of a lack of English translations. Many of them are aimed at English language readers, for instance, where they can find a book or a series of short stories, or even a short story, without having to go to a foreign country to look for a translation. Some of these searches, however, are not as comprehensive as Google would like to think. They are often used by people who don't know English and who do not know German well enough to understand German at all, but who have no idea what German means or what it means to be a native German speaker. As a result, they often have to rely on Google to help them find the books they are looking for, even if they aren't translated into German by English or German speakers. These searches are particularly useful when they come from a language other than German: English is a very different language than French or Spanish and is very difficult to translate into English for many people, especially those with a limited English vocabulary. What's even more important is that Google does not have an English translator, a translator who can translate German into a French language. A German translator can also translate the English translation into French for the French market, making it easy for readers to identify the author and understand the book's meaning and how it relates to their experience. With this in mind, I'm not sure how Google can do that. I think Google will have a hard time finding the right translation for this book, though, since it is not available in any other language at this time last year's Frankfurt book fair. At the same time, we're still trying to figure out how to tell the difference between the two languages. You can read the full text of each book and find out what the translation is like for you, if you're not familiar with it, by searching through the Google app. Searching for \"books\" is an important step in finding books that have already been translated from English by the company's translator. If you've never heard of this app, you can use it as an example of what a good translation can mean for someone who doesn't understand what's going on here. Just ask Google and you'll find that book. After all the translations are quite different from what you already know about the content of certain books. We've already seen the results of some of our searches. One thing I can tell you that is clear to me: \"I'm glad to"

        "target": "The Sun Sets Slowly Over Brandenburg's Tropical Dream Having suffered many disappointments concerning publically funded projects, the state of Brandenburg hoped a tropical leisure center would offer a ray of hope. Instead the ailing concern is just bringing more gloom. The economically depressed eastern German state of Brandenburg has seen its fair share of bitter experiences when it comes to huge public investment projects since German unification in 1990. Against this background, state authorities were pleased when Malaysian businessman Colin Au built a huge tropical-feeling leisure center in Brandenburg without any subsidies. The center, which opened about a year ago, was to become a symbol of economic success in a region where unemployment still hovers around the 20 percent mark. But the leisure time park, which has already swallowed a little under 100 million euros ($120 million) in private investment, is now going to have to depend on public funding to avoid another economic fiasco in Brandenburg. State authorities in Brandenburg haven't been too successful in their public investment policy in the past 10 years, to put it mildly. A grand plan to build one of the world's most modern chip-producing factories there burst like a bubble in 2003. The much-talked about Brandenburg-Berlin International airport still seems light years away from being built. Line of failures looked to be ended by Au's vision Another beacon of economic hope disappeared in 2002 when a company planning to build gas-filled transport airships went bust despite considerable subsidies. But Au's vision for the abandoned dome which the airship company needed as a hangar offered Brandenburg another chance. In the middle of nowhere, he created what he named his \"Tropical Islands\" wonderland, sporting everything from sandy beaches, lakes and a Laguna to a Caribbean-style village. The economics ministry in Brandenburg was over the moon to see Au originally agreeing to build the facility without any state subsidies. And Au himself had no doubt at the time that he could well do without them. Overestimated visitor numbers tell sorry story But the center's first year in operation tells a different story. Colin Au, who has meanwhile left Brandenburg and transferred matters to a German management company, had expected some 1.5 million visitors to come to Tropical Islands within the first year, but only some 950,000 will have turned up by the end of 2005. It seems highly unlikely that visitor numbers will increase considerably in future, placing a question mark on the viability of the whole centre. But Brandenburg's economics ministry is certain that the park will be in the black as of 2008. To make the place more attractive, it has agreed to shell out 15 million euros in subsidies for yet another reconstruction and marketing effort. After all, the leisure time center has a workforce of about 500 and is thus the biggest employer in an otherwise depressed region marked by a high jobless rate. Tropical center down but not out...not yet \"We hope the money will help make the Tropical Islands resort better known throughout Europe according to the new marketing concept hammered out the management,\" ministry spokesman Steffen Kammrath said. \"This leisure time center is unique and has to be marketed as such. What you have there is a tropical and water world 12 months a year with a lot of attractive offers to spend a whale of a time there.\" Some commentators believe that state subsidies may prolong the center's life span, but will not be able to avoid its demise in the long run. But the idea of also making it more attractive for tourists from all over Europe seems unrealistic to them if the resort's management can't even get enough visitors from home to ensure a profitable operation.",
        "generated_story": "The Sun Sets Slowly Over Brandenburg's Tropical Islands Resort The sun sets slowly over the tropical islands resort in the Baltic Sea. The first year of the resort was a little under 100 million euros ($120 million) and the second year was about 120 million. It's the first time the sun has set over a tropical island in Europe, and it's not just the Caribbean-style setting that has made it a popular destination for vacationers. There's also the fact that the property is located in a very remote area of southern Germany, just a few kilometers from the coast of Laguna, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. In the past 10 years, the area has seen an increase in tourism, as well as the number of tourists who come to the island each year. This year, however, tourism is expected to increase by about 10 percent, according to a report by the hotel's director of marketing, Colin Au. \"We are very pleased with the results so far,\" he said, adding that \"we are going to be able to make the most of this opportunity.\" The resort has been open for 12 months and has a capacity of 120,000 visitors a year since it opened in 2002. Last year it was open to visitors from around the world, with a total of 15 million visitors, including some from Europe and North America. Since then, there have been a lot of changes, especially in terms of guest numbers. For example, in 2008, it became clear that there would be more visitors than there had been in ten years. That's a big change for a resort that was founded in 1990 and which has grown to become one of Europe's most popular vacation spots. But it also means that it is not the only resort where the Sun is setting on the horizon. At the end of 2005, a new building was built on top of an old one, designed by architect Steffen Kammrath, who also designed the original building. Now the building is being built in an entirely new setting. A new roof will be added to accommodate the new hotel, while the existing one will have a roof over its head. With the addition of a brand-new pool and spa, this will make it easier for guests to get to know each other and to enjoy the sights and sounds of their surroundings. And it will also be a place where guests can relax and relax, rather than spend the night in their hotel room or on a beach, where they can watch the sunset from their balconies. So far, so good. However, we are still waiting for the final curtain to come down. We have to wait until the summer of 2008 before we can start to see what the future holds for this resort. I'm not sure what to expect, but I can say that we're hoping to have the best of both worlds. After all, that's what we've been doing since the beginning of 2003, when we started the project. You can't just sit around and wait for it to happen, can you? We've already had a good start, right? Well, let's talk about that, shall we? I think we'll see how it all plays out. Let's see if there's something to say about the opening of our new resort, or if we get a chance to talk to our guests about what's next for us. If we have an idea of where we want to go next, I'd like to share that with you, because we think that is the way to do it. When we first opened the business in 2003 we were very impressed with how well it turned out and how quickly it worked out for our clients. Then we had to look at all the projects that had already been completed and decide which ones we wanted to invest in. All of these projects are now in development. One of those projects is to open in 2009, at the start of which the company has already invested $1.5 billion in new facilities and facilities. Another project will open next year and then we will start building a hotel and a restaurant. What's even more exciting is that this project is set to take off in 2010. How will this all happen? What will it look like? The hotel is still in its infancy, after all these years of construction and renovation. No one knows what will happen next. Will it be the last resort? You know what I mean when I tell you all about it? It won't be too long before the construction is finished. Just ask the architect. He said that he's already planning to build a house in Berlin and he'll be ready to start renovating the entire property in about a month or two. 'I'm really looking forward to getting to work on it,' he told me, referring to his wife and her husband and their two children. They are both very excited about their new home in New York City. Both of them are already working on their own, he added that they are looking to expand their business. According to him, they have already made a huge investment of about 100,"

Schalke might struggle to retain 22-year-old midfielder Max Meyer when his contract runs out at the end of the season, at least according to recent media interviews from the club's sporting director, Christian Heidel. Speaking to German news agency dpa, Heidel confirmed that Meyer turned down an offer of a contract extension earlier in February. \"Max Meyer's agent received an extension offer on January 12 with a deadline of February 15, and informed us on February 15 via email that Max would not be accepting the offer because of the deadline imposed,\" Heidel told dpa. \"We have acknowledged this. For now, we no longer feel beholden to the terms of that offer, but that doesn't mean an extension is impossible either.\" Meyer was reportedly offered an annual salary in the region of \u20ac5.5 million ($6.7 million); it was the second contract he refused, following a less lucrative offer at the end of last season.

Heidel said this week that the club was still trying to convince the German to stay. \"At the moment we're still ready to talk,\" Heidel told this week's edition of football magazine Kicker, albeit stressing that time was of the essence. \"But we must and we will plan for the new season.\" In a separate newspaper interview Heidel was even more explicit, saying the club was not in a position to wait until summer for Meyer to make up his mind. Speaking to Sport Bild magazine, meanwhile, Heidel sought to focus on Meyer's more important role at Schalke, his regular game time, arguing it might be in the youngster's best interests to stay at a club that needs him every week. \"[Coach] Domenico Tedesco has formed the team around him in such a way that there is now an ideal spot for Max. That was not always the case,\" Heidel said. \"He needs to ask himself, putting the financial aspect to one side: 'Will I get such a position at a different club?'

        "generated_story": "Bayern Munich midfielder Max Meyer is still ready to talk about his future, according to Christian Heidel, the head coach of Schalke. \"We're still waiting for the club to decide whether or not to make a move for a new midfielder,\" he told Kicker magazine. The German club have been linked with a transfer to Bayern Munich for several years, but the German side have yet to agree on a deal. They have already made a number of changes to their squad, including the signing of midfielder Leon Goretzka, who has been loaned out to the Bundesliga side for next season. Meyer's contract expires in the summer, which means he will not be able to play again until the end of the season, he said, adding that he was \"very happy\" with his new contract. But he added that it would be \"difficult\" for him to sign a long-term contract, as he is \"not a player who wants to be a part of a club like Bayern.\" \"I think we have a lot of work to do in terms of getting the best out of Max, and I think that is the most important thing for us. We are very happy with the way he has played this season and we will continue to work hard to get him back.\" The club\u2019s transfer window is expected to close on February 15, when they are due to receive \u20ac5.5 million ($6.6 million) from the transfer market. It is also expected that they will make an offer for Meyer to stay at the top of their Bundesliga squad. However, it is unlikely that the move will be made before the winter break, with Meyer reportedly set to leave Bayern on January 12. According to Sport Bild, Meyer has already been offered a five-year contract by the Bavarian club, while his current contract is up for renewal in February. If he does not sign, his contract could be extended for up to a further year, after which he would have to move on to another club. He also said he had no plans to return to his old club after last season's relegation from Bundesliga to Bundesliga, where he spent the majority of his time as a free-kick specialist. That would mean he could still play for Bayern, even if he did not want to go on loan for another year. In addition, there is a chance that Meyer could move to other clubs, such as Juventus or Real Madrid, in order to improve his chances of making the next step in his career. For now, however, that doesn't seem likely to happen. After all, last year's Champions League final saw him miss out on the chance to win his first Bundesliga title in three years. His contract with Bayern expires on March 31, leaving him with just one year left on his deal, although he still has the option of staying in Bavaria. At the same time, Bayern are still looking to strengthen their position in Germany, despite the fact that their top-four rivals are struggling to find a way to reach the Europa League knockout stage. Bayern have struggled for some time in recent years and are currently in a difficult position to secure a place in Europe's top four. Last season they were the only team to qualify for Europe, losing only three games in all competitions. Now, they face a tough task as they look to avoid a relegation battle with Borussia Monchengladbach, a side they have never beaten in their last two seasons. And they may be in danger of missing out again, if they do not make the playoffs next year at all. German media reported on Wednesday that Bayern had already announced their intention to sell Meyer, citing a lack of interest from fans and media reports. Analysts have said they expect the midfielder to remain a key player in future seasons, though they don't expect to see him leave the team until after the new season is over. There are also doubts about the future of German football's most promising young talents, like Domenico Tedesco, whose career is already in its infancy. On the other hand, some fans have expressed their concern over the possibility of losing Meyer. Some of them are even calling for his departure, saying he should be replaced by someone who is more experienced than the player they want. This is not the first time that such a situation has come to an end. Bundesliga fans, meanwhile, are hoping to hear from Meyer and his agent, Christian Heinzke, have their hopes of returning to Germany. Speaking to German magazine, Hannover's sporting director Christian Weidel said: \"It's a very difficult situation for me. I'm not going to give up on my dream of becoming a Bayern player. You can't be too optimistic about Max's future. Max has always been a great player and that's not something that I can see in my mind. When you look at him, you can only think about what he's capable of doing for himself. So, I hope he can still be the right person to step up and be an important player at Bayern's side."

The Vatican said on Saturday that the priest, who was convicted in the 1980s and 1990s of distributing pornography, had been sentenced to one and five years in prison by Pope Francis on June 22. He had pleaded not guilty to the charges, which he said amounted to a \"serious offense.\" The charges stem from allegations that he had distributed pornographic material to minors in his home country of Chile, where he worked as an altar boy for the Roman Catholic Church. In a statement, the Holy See said it was \"deeply concerned\" by the allegations. \"We are deeply concerned about the situation in Chile,\" it said, adding that it would be \"a grave offense\" to prosecute a priest who has been convicted of child sex trafficking and child sexual abuse. It also said that if convicted, he would have to pay a fine of between \u20ac2,500 and \u20ac50,000 (around $42,100) per child, according to Vatican spokesman George Pell. Pell said the Vatican was aware of the accusations, but did not comment on the matter at the time of publication. According to Pell, \"the Vatican does not condone the distribution of pornography in any way, and that is not the case at all,\" he told reporters in Washington, D.C. Last year, Pope Benedict XVI ordered the papacy to hand over all of its files to Chile's Catholic bishops, including the files of former Chilean Archbishop Fernando Karadima. Vatican prosecutors said they would seek a five-year prison sentence for \"gross indecency with minors\" and \"subversive acts\" against minors, such as distributing pornographic images of minors. They also called on Chileans to cooperate with the investigation, saying that they were not allowed to see the material, even though they had the right to do so. Francis, however, has not ruled out the possibility of an appeal, although he has said he will not rule out a possible appeal against the conviction. On Saturday, Francis also ordered that Chile must cooperate fully with an investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct by a Chilean priest and his wife, Maria, in order to prevent the publication of material that could be used as a weapon against children in future cases. Chile has long been accused of having a child-sexist culture and has a long history of being a victim of pedophilia. But in a recent interview with The New York Times, Archbishop Francis said Chile was the first country in Latin America to receive a report from the pope on a case involving a pedophile priest in which the child was being sexually abused by his parishioners. For that reason, it's not surprising that Francis has called for an inquiry into the alleged child abuse of children, especially those who are under the age of 18. Capell was arrested in Canada in September, a year after the Chilean bishops' conference in Vancouver, Canada, was held on charges of sexually abusing children. His conviction comes after a series of scandals over the past two decades. Most of those scandals have been brought to light by revelations that Chilean priests were involved in sexual exploitation of young boys and girls, with some of them having sex with underage girls. Many of these cases have led to accusations of abuse by priests, while others have resulted in charges against bishops and other priests. Some have even been referred to as paedophiles, for example, as having sexually transmitted diseases. Others have accused the church of failing to protect minors from abuse, neglecting to provide adequate protection for minors and abusing them. However, some bishops have also criticized the Church for not doing enough to ensure that children are not abused and abused in their homes and schools. This is the latest scandal that has rocked Chile and the United States in recent years. A number of bishops are facing similar accusations in Australia, Australia and Canada as well as the US, Washington and Australia. One such case is that of a paedophile priest charged with sexually exploiting young girls and boys. More than 80 minors were reported to be victims of sex abuse in 1990, when he received a letter from a nun who told him to stop using the Internet to spread the word about his crimes. Another case was brought against him last year by Chilean authorities. That case, though, is being investigated by an Australian court. Prosecutors say that in addition to charges related to his alleged involvement in sex crimes, Capele was also charged in connection with a separate case in 2006. (AFP, dpa, Reuters, AP, AFP)The Vatican has also opened an internal probe into alleged pedophiles and minors who were found guilty of abusing minors at a church in Argentina. Authorities say they have not been able to prove their innocence in relation to their alleged crimes and are seeking to make sure they are held accountable for their actions. Investigators have said there is no evidence of any wrongdoing in this case. There are also concerns that a conviction could lead to an arrest and possible prosecution of one person, or even if the"

And the news was good -- most of the numbers were down compared to the preceding year. Germany's streets were never particularly dangerous, but according to the Interior Ministry, they are now safer than at any time since statistics have been collected. Reported criminal offenses on the whole dropped by 1.4 percent over 2005 -- to a total of just over 6.3 million. \"The statistics show reductions in crime among children, adolescents and teenagers, as well as adults,\" said Sch\u00e4uble. He added that criminality among foreigners living in Germany also fell, saying that this development reflected Germany's efforts to integrate non-Germans. Drugs offenses were down 7.8 percent, followed by theft and street crime, which both declined by four percent or more. Youth violence Vandalism, on the other hand, was up 5.9 percent. Fraud rose slightly, as did violent crime -- among young people by an alarming 4.5 percent. Berlin Interior Minister Erhart K\u00f6rting said that was part of a decade-long trend in Germany. \"As many experts have pointed out,\" K\u00f6rting said, \"the potential for violence in society is increasing.\" The head of the German Police Officers' Union Konrad Freiberg also said those figures showed that German society was not truly getting safer. Frankfurt tops most-dangerous list Crime was down in Frankfurt am Main, but it's still the German city with the greatest number of criminal offenses per 100,000 people. Hanover was a close second, followed by D\u00fcsseldorf, Bremen and Berlin. The total percentage of criminal cases solved by German police also improved slightly from 55 to 55.4 percent. According to the study, Germany's safest place was Bergisch Gladbach, a city of 100,000 inhabitants in the west of the country -- coincidentally, model Heidi Klum's home town.",
        "generated_story": "German Police Officers' Union: State of Crime in Germany The German police officers' union has published a report on the state of crime in the country. The report, published on Tuesday, is the first to be published by the German Interior Ministry. It is based on a study by Erhart K\u00f6rting and Konrad Freiberg, the head of the police union in Frankfurt am Main, which was founded in 2005. According to the study, a total of 1.5 million people have been arrested since the beginning of 2006. This is a significant increase compared with the previous year, when the number of arrests rose to 2.3 million. In 2005, police said they had arrested more than 1,000 people. \"This is not an isolated case,\" said the union's chief of staff. However, it is also the second most serious case of a police officer being charged with a crime, after a similar case in Bremen in 2004. Police officers have also been accused of using excessive force against civilians, according to police and prosecutors, and of carrying out a series of violent attacks on civilians. Last year's report was published in a German newspaper, but it did not mention the fact that police had been involved in several cases of armed robbery and attempted murder, as well as in other cases where police were involved, such as at the end of 2005 and in 2006 when they were arrested in connection with an attempted robbery of an apartment building in Hanover. But the report also said that the government was not aware of any such cases, adding that it was \"not aware\" of such incidents. On the other hand, there was no indication that there were any incidents at all during the preceding year. That's not to say that law enforcement agencies are not doing their jobs. They are, however, not the only ones who are involved. For example, they have not been able to find a policeman who has been convicted of committing a violent crime. There is no evidence that any of these crimes were committed by police or the public at large. And there are no indications that they are being committed in any way. As a result, Germany's police force has had to step up its efforts to tackle the problem of drug trafficking and other forms of organised crime that have led to a rise in violent crimes in recent years. At the same time, many of its officers are also being investigated for possible links to organized crime and the use of illegal weapons in their own homes and businesses. Some of them have even been charged for their involvement in criminal activities, while others have faced charges of assault, robbery, kidnapping and even attempted rape. These are just a few examples of cases in which the authorities have failed to act decisively enough to prevent such crimes from taking place. One example of this is in 2007 when police arrested a man who was trying to break into a house in Berlin. He was arrested after he tried to enter the house and was later found to have attempted to rob a bank in his home town of Bergisch Gladbach, where he was staying with his wife and two children. Prosecutors have accused the man of attempting to steal money from the bank and is seeking to use the money to pay for his arrest. Authorities have said he is being held responsible for the murder of two people, one of whom was a member of his family and another for a robbery. Investigators are still looking into the case and are examining whether he may have committed the crime himself. German prosecutors have denied the charges, saying they could not prove that he had committed any criminal act. Germany has a long history of high-profile crimes, including murders, kidnappings, robberies and murders. Many of those crimes are linked to crimes against women, children and people of all ages, especially those with mental health problems. Criminal offenses have long been the focus of criminal offenses, says the Interior Minister, who is currently in charge of investigating the crimes of men and women. Since then, criminal charges against men have risen to an unprecedented level of violence, with many people being prosecuted for crimes committed against minors and minors. A criminal offense is punishable by death by a fine of up to 10 years in prison. If a criminal charge is brought against him, he could be sentenced to life imprisonment, or even a life sentence, if he's found guilty of murder. (AFP, Reuters, dpa, AP, AFP) \"It's a very sad day for Germany. I'm not sure what the future holds for this country,\" says Berlin police chief Erick Klum, an anti-crime activist and a former police official. Earlier this month, German media reported that prosecutors had opened an investigation into allegations of sexual abuse of minors under the age of 18. An investigation is ongoing and there is an ongoing probe into whether the suspect was convicted in relation to his alleged role in an incident that took place at a Berlin apartment complex in 2003. Officials have repeatedly denied any link to criminal acts committed under German law. Law enforcement officials say the investigation has not yet been brought to trial.

        "target": "Bremen Election Results Could Have National Repercussions It might be Germany's smallest state with a population of less than 700,000, but the make-up of Bremen's new government could curb the ability of Angela Merkel's coalition to continue with planned reforms. The Social Democrats (SPD) and Christian Democrats (CDU) have ruled the small northern city-state of Bremen in a coalition for the past 12 years. But after winning state elections on Sunday with 36.8 percent, the SPD is now flirting with the idea of ditching their previous coalition partners to rule together with the Greens, who made their best-ever showing in a German state poll with 16.4 percent. Bremen's state SPD leadership is to hold talks later on Wednesday with the CDU, which polled 25.7 percent. After an SPD meeting in Bremen, Mayor Jens B\u00f6hrnsen made the first signal he could be favoring the Greens. He said that during the campaign he had deliberately abstained from mentioning the possibility of a renewed CDU coalition because \"after 12 years it shouldn't automatically be continued.\" Bremen's acting head of government and CDU member Thomas R\u00f6wekamp, however, warned against an SPD-Green coalition. \"The majority of people don't want a red-green experiment, but a continuation of the grand coalition,\" he said. Both the SPD and CDU conceded heavy losses in the election, which showed a swing towards the Greens and the Left Party, which scored an unexpected 8.4 percent to win representation in a western German state legislature for the first time in its brief history. Block reforms? If Bremen's SPD decide in favor of the Greens, this would affect the ability of Chancellor Angela Merkel's grand coalition of CDU and SPD to push ahead with reforms requiring constitutional changes, such as stage two of Germany's urgently needed federalism reform. The federal Bundesrat, which is made up of state cabinet members, has to approve the majority of legislative bills passed by the lower chamber, the Bundestag, before they become law. Also, any proposed constitutional changes require two-thirds of all votes in order to be passed by the Bundesrat. The CDU and SPD currently hold 47 of the Bundesrat's 69 seats, which is one seat more than the necessary two-thirds majority. But without Bremen, the number held by the grand coalition would fall to 44 seats, meaning they would need the cooperation of one of the small opposition parties for any constitutional changes. Internal strife Earlier in the week, Chancellor Merkel called for unity within her ruling left-right coalition after the losses in Bremen set the stage for more infighting between the two parties. Merkel also warned the SPD against moving to the left after it lost some five percent points. The chancellor said the outcome showed the SPD had made a mistake by attacking the coalition and campaigning on promises of a minimum wage, which she believes will hamper efforts to fight unemployment of just under 10 percent. \"The result showed that this strategy did not pay off,\" Merkel told a press conference.",
        "generated_story": "Merkel's coalition of Social Democrats and CDU could block reforms German Chancellor Angela Merkel has warned that her coalition with the Left Party (SPD) and the Christian Democrats (CDU) could be blocked by the Bundestag on Wednesday. SPD leader Jens B\u00f6hrnsen warned on Sunday that the SPD-Green coalition would not be able to form a coalition government. The SPD has been in coalition talks for 12 years, but has yet to win a majority in parliament. Merkel's government faces a tough task in the coming weeks as it tries to find a way out of the coalition. \"We are not going to let this happen again,\" he told a news conference in Bremen, Germany's largest city. He added that \"we will not allow this to happen,\" adding that it would be \"a very difficult task\" for the government to agree on a new constitution. But he also said that if it did, it will be a \"very difficult\" task for Merkel to come up with a deal that would allow her to get her way with her conservative coalition partner, the Greens, to reach a consensus on the future of German politics. Chancellor Merkel is expected to announce her new coalition in a speech to the Bundesrat, which is due to take place at the end of this week. She has said she wants to see a government that has a clear vision of what Germany should look like, rather than just a one-party state. On Sunday, Merkel announced that she would seek to create a federal government in which all parties would have to work together in order to achieve a common vision for Germany. In the meantime, she said, \"I think we have a very strong chance of getting a good deal done in this government.\" But she did not rule out the possibility of a change of government, saying she was \"not ready to give up on our vision.\" The Social Democratic party, led by Thomas R\u00f6wekamp, had said it was not ready for such a move. It is not clear how Merkel would respond to this, however, and it is unclear whether she is prepared to do so. If she does decide to go ahead with this plan, then she will have no choice but to make it her own. A new government is likely to be in place by early next year, if she doesn't agree with what she sees as the right-wing, anti-immigrant, Eurosceptic and xenophobic policies of her predecessor, former Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, who was elected chancellor of Germany in 2012. That would mean that Merkel and her conservatives would face a difficult time in her first term as chancellor, when they would need to renegotiate the terms of their coalition agreement. They would also face the prospect of losing their parliamentary majority if they do not agree to an agreement on how to implement the new deal. This is the first time that a German chancellor has tried to change the way Germany is governed, after a 12-year-old coalition has failed to pass a number of key reforms, such as tax cuts, tax increases and social welfare. And it's not just Merkel who is opposed to such reforms. There is also the question of how much she has to pay for them, too. For example, how will she spend on education, health care, housing, social security, education and other social services? She is a staunch advocate of free education for young people, especially those who don't have the means to learn German and who are unable to read the language and understand German well enough to understand the German language. However, there is no doubt that there are a lot of people who would like to know more about what is going on in Germany and what they are doing in their own country. So far, so good, indeed, that's what the chancellor is trying to tell us. What is important is that we can be sure of: she won't be the only one who does not want to lose her job, because she already has the support of all the people she's working with. Even if that means she loses her position as head of state, this is an important step in that direction. After all, what would she do without the help of other parties? How can she make sure that all her policies are implemented? \"She's a strong leader,\" she told reporters in Berlin on Tuesday, referring to her role as Chancellor of Bavaria, a conservative Christian Democrat party. 'I'm not a politician, I'm a social democrat,' she added, adding: \"That's something that I can't do in my own way. I think she'd be very happy if we could get a better education system.\" She also pointed out that many people are already working on this issue, as well as in other European countries, like Germany, where many of them have been working hard to improve their education systems and how they can learn English and German. Many of these reforms are being implemented. Some of those reforms have already been approved by parliament, even if the Chancellor's own party is still in power. Her"

        "target": "A Delicious Accompaniment for Wine A regular companion of the fall season's wines is a treat called Zwiebelkuchen, literally, onion cake. It is a one-crust pie, eaten in most German wine regions during the fall wine season. Zwiebelkuchen is traditionally eaten with Federweisser, a young wine available in Germany in the fall. The link between the two is so strong that many Federweisser wines have a recipe for the onion cake on their labels. Here's a recipe for it: Ingredients: 1 packet yeast, active dry 1 teaspoon sugar 1 1/2 teaspoon salt 3 cups unbleached flour 1 tablespoon shortening 1 cup water (49 to 54 C / 120 to 130 F) 6 slices bacon -- diced 2 medium onions -- sliced 1/4 teaspoon cumin 1/2 teaspoon salt Pepper 1 egg yolk 1 cup sour cream Mix the yeast with the sugar, a teaspoon of salt and half a cup of flour. Blend in the shortening and warm water, then beat for two minutes. Add enough flour to make a soft dough, and then knead the dough until smooth and elastic, about five minutes. Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, then cover it and let it rise in a warm place for 30 minutes. Pat the dough into a lightly greased 12-inch pizza pan or onto a lightly greased baking sheet. Press up the edges to make a slight rim. Fry the bacon until crisp and drain it on absorbent paper. Add onions to the bacon grease, and cook slowly until tender, but not brown. Sprinkle the onions, bacon, cumin, half a teaspoon of salt and pepper over the dough. Bake the cake at 204 C (400 F) for 20 minutes. Blend the egg yolk and sour cream and pour the mixture over the Zwiebelkuchen. Bake it for another 10 to 15 minutes, until the cake is golden brown and the sour cream has set.

The onion cake is made in Germany, and is served with wine from around the world. You can buy it at the store in Berlin, or at a local restaurant in Munich or Munich, where you can pick up a bottle of wine and enjoy it for a few minutes. But the best part is that it doesn't have to be a wine that you're drinking. In fact, it has to do with the fact that the wine is very good. \"It's not just about wine,\" says the author of the book, which is available on Amazon.com and on the German website, \"but it is also about food and wine.\" The book is based on a recipe from the French magazine \"Wine Companion,\" which has been translated into German as \"wine companion.\" It is written in French, German and English, with a mix of German, French and German ingredients. There are a number of variations, such as onion cakes and sauerkraut, as well as a variety of herbs and spices that are used in the preparation of wines. One of these is the Onion cake. Another is an Italian wine called \"Oblivion Cake,\" made with olive oil, honey, sugar, herbs, spices and herbs. And the third is Italian, Italian and Spanish. Both are very Italian. They are made by the same people who make up the majority of Germany's wine industry, so they have a lot to learn from each other. For example, one of them is how to make a cake that looks like an onion, while the other one is about the size of a grapefruit. That is, if you have the time and the patience to eat it, you will be able to enjoy the fruit and vegetables that come with it. If you don't like the taste, then you'll probably want to try a different one. I think that's the way it should be. This is what I would recommend to anyone who is interested in German wines, especially when it comes to wines that have been around for years and have had a long shelf life. We recommend this book because it gives you a taste of what is to come. Read more: \"The best wines are the ones that make you feel good about yourself and what you've done for your family and friends.\" \"You're not the only one who has a good time,\" the title says, adding that \"you're the first to appreciate the fruits of your labor,\" adds the writer, who adds that there are many more wines to choose from than just the one that is good for you and your health and well-being. However, there is one exception to this rule: The wine itself is not good enough for most people to drink. So, we're going to use it as an example of how we can make the most of our time in Europe. After all, this is where we've been, when we were growing up. When we first started out, I was a child. Now I'm an adult and I've grown up in a small town in northern Germany and now I grew up with my parents and my father. My father was an alcoholic and he died when he was very young.

The first detainees arrived on January 22, 2010 in Madrid. They were detained at a military base in the southern Spanish city of Madrid, where they had been held since Sept. 11, 2001, when US President George W. Bush ordered them to be transferred to a US prison. Spain is one of several countries that has allowed the release of prisoners held at Guantanamo, which has been used as a detention facility for the Palestinians since 2001. Many of them have been convicted of crimes against humanity, including murder, torture and attempted murder. Some have even been sentenced to life in prison, while others are being held in solitary confinement, according to Spanish Interior Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos. \"We are very pleased with the progress of these prisoners,\" he said in a statement. Rubalcaba, a Palestinian, was among the five who arrived at the prison on Jan. 22. He said he was \"very pleased\" with his release, adding that he hoped to return to Spain as soon as possible. But he also added that the prisoners would be given a chance to prove their innocence in court, and that they would have the opportunity to make their own decisions about their future. According to the Interior ministry, the detainees will be sent back to their home country of Spain, but they will not be allowed to leave the country until they have completed their sentences. It is not clear how long the transfer will take, however, as the new detainees are expected to stay for at least a year, if not longer, before they can be released. In the meantime, it is unclear whether they'll be able to go to prison again, or if they won't have to wait until the end of their sentence. At the same time, there is the possibility that their release could be delayed for several years, due to an ongoing legal dispute between the United States and the Palestinian Authority (PA) over the issue of who is responsible for their treatment in Guantanamo. There is no word yet on the conditions of release for these five men, who are currently serving sentences of up to five years in jail for crimes committed in their country's war on terror. Author: Andreas Illmer, AFP/jm (AFP, AP, dpa, Reuters)The US has accused Spain of using torture to try to gain access to prisoners in its war-ravaged prison system. President Barack Obama has denied the allegations, saying he did not want to use torture in his own country. However, he has said that torture is \"not a crime.\" The US government has also said it would not allow torture for its own citizens. Obama's visit to Guantanamo was a \"positive step\" toward ending the use of torture. His visit came just a few days after his predecessor, then-Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, announced he would step down from his position as US attorney general. US officials have also criticized his decision to close Guantanamo in 2010, accusing him of violating the terms of an arms embargo. A US official told the Associated Press in an interview that \"the US should not have used torture as an excuse to imprison its citizens.\" \"It's a very sad day for Spain,\" said US Attorney General Jeff Sessions, speaking to reporters in Washington, D.C. on Tuesday. 'We have a lot to learn about the situation in this country and we are going to do everything we can to prevent it from happening again.' US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Twitter that Obama had made the decision \"to close the Guantanamo facility in order to protect the American people's rights.\" Obama is also calling on Spain to cooperate with US authorities on their efforts to end the torture of Guantanamo detainees, particularly those who have committed crimes, such as terrorism and human rights abuses. And he's not the only US president who has criticized the treatment of detainees there. Speaking to AFP, Obama said the Obama administration would \"do everything in our power to ensure that prisoners are treated fairly and humanely,\" adding: \"I think it's the right thing to say that we will do.\" In his speech to Congress, President Obama also called for an end to US torture on Guantanamo and other detainees. This is an important step toward reducing the number of US detainees held there, despite the fact that Guantanamo is still open to torture by US intelligence agencies. That's what we've been told by the Spanish government, though, is a good thing, given that there are so many people who do not know what is going on here. For the most part, this is just the beginning of a long-term strategy to reduce the risk of terrorism. I think that's good news for all of us, because it will help us to move forward with our own security and security of our citizens and our allies in other countries, especially in countries like the Middle East and Africa.\" Spain has already made it clear that it wants to keep its people out of prison and for years."

Initially in Punjab, you had two types of militancy: One, the groups that focussed mainly on Indian-administered Kashmir and there were other types of groups that focussed on Pakistan. Those were the sectarian groups targeting mainly the Shias, and there were some Shia groups targeting the Sunni leadership. Over the years a lot of factions have broken away from these groups and these small entities are functioning more or less autonomously. They have trainings in the tribal areas because these are secured for them and certain parts are not under Pakistani control so these groups go there. They operate with the Pakistani Taliban based in tribal areas against the Pakistani troops in the region. They also have an autonomous agenda, which they pursue in Punjab, as they have been doing in the past days. These groups also play host or are a kind of a local link to Taliban suicide bombers who come into the main part of Pakistan from the tribal areas (let's say to Punjab). If they have to target some place, they park themselves with these Punjab groups, and then do it. All these factions and groups that have broken away from traditional militant groups and are functioning in close collaboration with tribal area Taliban are often described as the \"Punjabi Taliban\". Why do you think these militants are resurfacing now? They have always existed here and there and generally the trend is that they undertake a couple of operations, one after the other. Then the government comes in and takes action against them. Then they just disappear or become sleeping groups and suddenly after a couple of months they resurface. That's the standard pattern. The last major incident in Lahore was in the first week of March. Then there was nothing in April and now towards the end of May you have this kind of incident. Do you think the government should have taken stronger action against them? They should have but the problem is that the Punjab government has a kind of ambiguous approach and I think there is some element of denial within the leadership also. These groups also have some sympathy if not support at the societal level and that makes it difficult for the government to go against them openly. They need to work together and to emphasise to the people that they are terrorists. They use different names and Islam but actually their agenda is terrorism. Somehow the government of Punjab has been rather confused and ambiguous regarding these groups. Interview: Disha Uppal Editor: Anne Thomas",
        "generated_story": "The Punjabi Taliban in northwest Pakistan is growing, a Pakistani Taliban spokesman said on Monday, adding that the \"Punjab Taliban\" is spreading across the country. \"We have seen a lot of violence in the past few weeks,\" said Hasan Askari Rizvi, the spokesman for the Pakistan Taliban. He added that there were \"a number of attacks\" in Lahore, Punjab and other parts of northwestern Pakistan, including in Pakistan's northwestern Punjab province of Punjab, which is home to a large Shia population. The Taliban, however, have not been able to control their own territory. They have been fighting for a few months, but in recent weeks, they have managed to gain a foothold in Punjab. In the first week of March, about 45 minutes of fighting broke out between Sunni and Shiites, according to Disha Uppal, an analyst at the German-administered Pakistani newspaper Deutsche Welle (DW) who has been working closely with the Taliban since the beginning of the year, said it was \"increasingly difficult\" for them to take control of their territory, particularly in areas where they are not allowed to operate. According to DW's Anne Thomas, who covers Pakistan for DW, there is a \"very high level of tension\" between the two communities. DW also spoke to an activist at Jinnah Hospital, where he said there was a strong sense of unease among the community about the threat of a Taliban attack. She said that \"there is no doubt that this is something that is going on in our country, and that we have to be prepared to deal with it.\" DW/dw/jm (AFP, dpa, Reuters) DW: \"There is an increase in violence and a rise in sectarianism,\" she said. It is not clear how much of this has to do with Islam or whether it is related to Pakistan. However, DW reports that in some areas of Pakistan the violence is more severe than in other countries, such as India, Pakistan and India. There is also a growing sense that Pakistan has become increasingly isolated from the rest of world. This is especially true in a country where there are so many Shia and Sunni communities, as well as the fact that most of them are Sunni. What is happening is that people are becoming increasingly disillusioned with their country's political system and the way they live their lives. At the end of May, it will be up to the Pakistani government to decide whether or not to impose a new constitution, or if they will continue to use the old system of law and order. For the time being, I am not sure what to expect from this government. I have no idea what the government will do. But I do know that it would be a good thing if it decided to make a change. If the situation were to change, we would have a very difficult time getting a constitution that would allow the people to live in peace. That is why I think it's very important for Pakistan to have an independent judiciary. And I don't want to see a government that doesn't have the right to interfere in this process. So I'm not going to give up on the idea of democracy. Let's just say that I would rather see Pakistan become a democratic country and not a Muslim country like India and China. You can't be the only one who thinks this way. Do you agree with me? If you think that's the case, then let me know. We're not ready for this to happen. Read more: Pakistan: What's happening in Kashmir? What are the chances of peace? The situation in Afghanistan? Is there any hope for peace in that country? I'd like to think so. Why is it so difficult to find a peaceful solution to this problem? It's not easy to say, because there's so much to discuss. Is it really possible to talk to people who are in power? Why not just talk with them? There's no easy answer to that, right now. How do you know if you're a Sunni or a Shia? Well, let's talk about it. One thing is for sure, you can tell them that they're the ones who want peace and stability. No one knows what they want. Just ask anyone who wants to get involved in politics, like me, to know what their political views are. A few days ago, one of my friends from Punjab told DW that he had a hard time finding a political solution for his family. Last week, he told me that his father was killed by a suicide bomber who was shot by an unknown assailant in his hometown of Karachi. His father had been killed in an attack on a house in Karachi last week. Since then, many people have come to understand what happened to him? He said he's been living in fear of being shot? That's what I've been told by my father's family and friends? You know the answer is clear to me: He's a big fan of Pakistani politics. People are always talking to someone who is in charge of politics and I"

        "target": "Party leaders call for increased wages in growing German economy Chancellor Angela Merkel and other top officials have called for upticks in Germany's economy to trickle down to workers in the form of higher pay. But a leading think tank has warned against giving raises too soon. Germany's foreign minister and deputy chancellor, Guido Westerwelle, has added his support to comments made by Economics Minster Rainer Bruederle about increased wages for German workers. \"When the economy grows and this growth is substantial and sustainable, then the benefits of this upswing should be felt by the people who worked so hard for it,\" Westerwelle told the Hamburger Abendblatt newspaper in an interview. Westerwelle heads the free-market liberal FDP, which shares power with Chancellor Merkel's Christian coalition. Earlier this week, Bruederle, also an FDP member, said in light of Germany's currently growing economy, those economic gains should trickle down to employees in the form of higher wages. Merkel, who is also the head of the Christian Democratic Union, supported Bruederle's idea. \"That is something the chancellor sees the same way, letter for letter,\" said Merkel's spokesman, Steffen Seibert. Not so fast Earlier this week, analysts predicted growth of 3.5 percent this year and 2 percent in 2011. Germany's five leading economic think tanks also predicted that the number of unemployed would fall below 3 million next year, the lowest level since 1992. Despite the current rosy outlook for the German economy, not everyone is convinced that a growing economy should inevitably lead to higher wages. The president of the German Institute for Economic Research, Klaus Zimmermann, warned against reacting too quickly. \"I can't support the idea of a general wage increase, I think it is too dangerous,\" Zimmermann said in an interview with the Handelsblatt newspaper. Zimmermann wasn't opposed to the idea of raising wages, but said he was against across-the-board increases for all sectors and pointed out that not every industry is benefitting the same from the growing economy. \"We can't forget that the German economy did not resort to mass lay-offs when it wasn't going so well last year,\" Zimmermann said. Raising wages in some branches could be a good idea, Zimmermann said, as that would make those branches more attractive option to potential workers from outside of Germany.

        "generated_story": "Chancellor Angela Merkel's Deputy Chancellor, Klaus Zimmermann, is against a general wage hike for German workers. The deputy chancellor, Rainer Bruederle, said on Thursday that he was against the idea of raising the minimum wage. \"I don't think it's a good idea,\" he told the Handelsblatt newspaper, adding that it would be \"unwise\" for the government to raise wages in the future. He also said that if the economy were to grow at a faster pace than it has in recent years, it should be able to meet the wage increase targets set by the Federal Democratic Union (FDP) and the Social Democrats (SPD). The FDP, which has been the main opposition party in parliament since the 2011 election, has called for an increase in minimum wages to be phased in over the next few years. In 2011, the party's Social Democratic Party (FSD) leader, Guido Westerwelle, was the first to call for wage increases. Since then, however, he has refused to take part in any of the planned increases, saying it was \"not necessary.\" \"It's not necessary for us to increase wages at the same time as we are raising wages,\" said WesterWelle. On the other hand, Merkel has said she would not accept a wage rise of up to 1.5 percent if it were not for a \"general increase\" in wages, according to the German Institute for Economic Research (ETH), a think tank in Hamburg, Germany's largest city, and a member of parliament from the conservative Social Democrat party, Steffen Seibert. (Reuters, dpa, AP, Reuters) \"We are not going to make wage rises at this time,\" she said, referring to a rise in German wage inflation. She added that she was not aware of any wage hikes in Germany, but that the chancellor's position on the issue had been \"very clear\" and that \"the chancellor is not in favor of a higher wage.\" In the past, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who was chancellor from 1992 to 2012, had said he did not want to see a pay increase. However, in 2011 he said his party was in favour of higher wages for its members. This year, though, his position has not changed much, as he is still in opposition to higher salaries for members of his own party. His party is currently in coalition with the Greens, a coalition that includes the CDU and other conservative parties. It has also been accused of being too liberal in its stance on wages. But in a recent interview with a German newspaper the Left-wing newspaper The Hamburger Abendblatten said it had not seen any evidence that this was a case at all. According to its editor in chief, Hans-Heinz Brugle (dpa) the right-leaning paper, \"The Left Party\" is the only party that is opposed to such a hike, while the center-left Freedom Democrats have said they are against it. And they have also criticized the Chancellor for not taking a hard line on wage cuts. They have called on him to step down, arguing that a tax increase would only increase the cost of living for those who are already living in low-wage jobs. That is, they say, because it will make it more difficult for people to find a job in an economy where they cannot afford to live in poverty. For example, there is a lack of money to buy a house in rural areas, such as the city of Hamburg. There is also the question of how to pay a living wage for someone who has a family who doesn't have the means to get a child to school. So, for this reason, this year's Chancellor will have to decide whether she wants to give up her job as head of state, or if she will continue to work as a minister. If she decides to stay in office, she is likely to do so in her own capacity as Chancellor of Germany. Merkel is expected to seek a new position within the coalition government, even if that means giving up the position of deputy Chancellor. Her position is unlikely to change, given the current political climate in Berlin, where she has the support of her conservative coalition partners, including the ruling Socialists (FP\u00d6), who have been in power for more than a decade, since she took office in 2012. German media have reported that Chancellor Merkel will be forced to cut the number of people who work in this country, rather than give them a chance to earn a decent wage in order to support their families. Last week, her party announced that they would cut back on their annual salary, citing a report by a conservative economist, Prof. Martin van der Welt, that would mean cutting the amount of income she earns. A new chancellor would also be the most likely candidate for chancellor in future, says the paper's editorial director, Dr. Hans Christian Zuvela (AFP, DPA). \"This is an important step for her. I think she's right now, I"

Freiburg scored an extra time goal to squeak out a victory against Hoffenheim. Bayern Munich cruised to a 3-0 victory at home against Bavarian rival FC Nuremberg on Sunday, closing the German soccer tables for the weekend. Striker Mario Gomez got things going in the 10th minute for Bayern and also scored the final goal in the 75th minute off a corner kick from Franck Ribery. Ribery came on as a substitute five minutes earlier, making his first appearance for the team since injuring his ankle in September. Near the end of the match, Gomez had an opportunity for his third goal on a penalty kicked but missed. Thirty points at break Phillipp Lahm successfully converted a penalty kick in the 57th minute to round out the scoring for Bayern. The victory for Bayern moved them into sixth place in the table with 19 points and has continued a slow shift in momentum following a rough start to the season. Bayern coach Louis van Gaal said after the game he hoped his team would have 30 points by the end of the first half of the season in five more matches. Cisse saves win for Freiburg In Sunday's other Bundesliga match, Senegal striker Papiss Demba Cisse broke a scoreless deadlock with a goal in the 91st minute to give Freiburg a 1-0 win over Hoffenheim. Cisse has now scored 10 goals in 12 games and is currently the Bundesliga's second highest scorer. The win moves Freiburg into fourth place in the table with 21 points, one ahead of Frankfurt in fourth and three behind Bayer Leverkusen and Mainz, in second and third place, respectively.

        "generated_story": "Bayern Munich 3-0 Freiburg: Papiss Demba Cisse seals Bundesliga win for Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich have won their first Bundesliga match of the season, beating Mainz in the Bundesliga on Sunday. The German side, who have been without a win in their last three matches, were without their top scorer in September, with Mario Gomez in goal for the first time since the end of September. Germany's top-flight club, however, had to settle for a 1-1 draw at home to Nuremberg. German coach Louis van Gaal's side were unable to find a way past the German champions on the weekend, as they lost to Frankfurt and Hoffenheim. \"We are so happy to be back,\" said Bayern coach Franck Ribery, referring to the fact that his side had lost their opening two Bundesliga matches in Germany and Senegal. Bayern, meanwhile, came from behind to take the lead at the top of their Bundesliga table with a 2-2 draw in Nuredmberg, where they are currently second in Group A. After a slow start, the visitors came out on top after the 10th minute, and they were able to get back into the game after a sluggish start. But the hosts were never able quite to break the deadlock. In the second half, they went on to score twice, but they couldn't get any closer than that. On the other hand, Frankfurt were the better side for most of Sunday's game, scoring three goals in five minutes. They were also the best team in all of Germany at that time, thanks to a strong defensive performance from their goalkeeper, Phillipp Lahm. For Frankfurt, it was a different story, though, because they had a lot to do with the way they started the match and the manner in which they ended up scoring. Losing at Frankfurt was not the only thing that was bothering them. It was also a disappointing result for their coach, whose team had been struggling for form for some time. Facing a relegation battle, Bayern were forced to make a change in tactics after losing their starting goalkeeper in recent weeks. And they didn't do so well against Frankfurt. With the help of a goal from German defender Philipp Lahms, Fenerbah\u00e7e and German midfielder Pops Dembarca, their chances were limited to just one shot on target. However, in a match where the Germans were struggling to keep their heads above the relegation zone, there was little doubt that they would come back from the brink of relegation. At the very least, that would be a good way to end the regular season. If they could have done that, then it would have given them a chance to extend their unbeaten run to six games. That would mean they'd have a better chance of reaching the Champions League quarter-finals next year, when they face Bayern in Frankfurt on Sept. 1. Last season's Bundesliga winners, Wolfsburg, won the league by a combined score of 4-3 on aggregate, 5-4, after scoring five times in 10 matches. This season has been a bit different, too, for both sides. Both Bayern and Frankfurt have struggled with injuries and a lack of quality in attack, so it's no surprise to see a number of key players leave the club in search of some form of form. Nevertheless, this is a big step forward in terms of improving their form, which has seen them improve on their recent form and strengthen their position in Bundesliga play. As a result, both teams will be looking to improve their attacking options in order to reach the next round of competition, while Frankfurt are expected to stay in contention for qualification. Despite the loss of two points, Germany are still on course to qualify for Europe's premier league next season and have already secured a spot in next month's World Cup in Russia. Bundesliga leader Bayern will have to wait until the last possible minute before they can make their move to Germany to secure a first-ever Bundesliga title, according to Bundesliga expert Matt Zuvela (dpa, AFP, dpa) and coach Franz Beckenbauer (AFP, AP) have both been impressed with their performance in this match. A win over Frankfurt would give Bayern a boost to their title hopes, given that it is the third time they've won a Bundesliga game in as many years. Ahead of this weekend's match, German Bundesliga champions Frankfurt will face a tough task to avoid relegation, although they'll be hoping to build on that success. Following the defeat to Hoffenerheim on Saturday, Cologne will also be facing a difficult task of finding a place in Europe. Frankfurt's star striker, Franz Franzosen, has already impressed in his first season in charge of Bayern's defense. He has scored four goals so far, including a brace against Cologne, Bayer Leverkusen and Hannover 96. His first goal against Bayern has also been the most impressive of all, having scored three times since he was sent off for Germany in August. While Bayern have yet to win a league game since August, he has not only twice"

        "target": "Teabag filter cleans water with nanotechnology A new water filter developed in South Africa could provide millions of people with clean drinking water. The filter, about the size and shape of a teabag, would be inexpensive, easy to distribute and simple to use. Marelize Botes is conducting a final set of tests on a new type of diminutive water filter before industrial production can begin. The microbiologist pours water from a plastic bottle though a high-tech, teabag-sized filter before analyzing it in her in her laboratory at the University of Stellenbosch in South Africa. \"The filter is much cheaper than bottled water as well as any other filter on the market,\" she told Deutsche Welle. Instead of being filled with black or green tea, the bag contains active carbon granules and is made from nanofibers treated with biocide, which kills bacteria rather than simply filtering them from the water. Nanotech for pennies \"This project takes nanotechnology to the poorest of the poor people who live in this world, and it will make a difference in their lives,\" said Eugen Cloete, who in addition to inventing the filter is dean of the faculty of science at Stellenbosch University and chair of Stellenbosch University's Water Institute. With some 300 million people in Africa - and over a billion worldwide - living without access to clean drinking water, the need for such a filter is huge. When in mass production, the developers said they expect the teabag to cost just a few South African cents (under half a US cent and under a third of a euro cent). In addition to being inexpensive, Botes said, the filter is also easy to distribute to rural area and simple to use as it can be place in an adapter that fits on nearly any regular-sized plastic bottle. Each filter can clean one liter (one quart) of the most polluted water to the point where it is completely safe to drink. Once used, the filter can be disposed of and is biodegradable. African countries, led by Somalia, Mauritania and Sudan, were ranked to have the most vulnerable water supplies, according to a June report by UK-based risk consultancy firm Maplecroft. Decentralized use The filter's small size and light weight make it ideal for rural areas where other means of filtration do not exist, Cloete said. \"It is simply impossible to build purification infrastructure at every polluted stream,\" Cloete said. \"So we have to take the solution to the people. The water is cleaned right then and there when you drink from the bottle.\" The filter is now undergoing testing by the South African Bureau of Standards, after which Cloete and his team hope it can be rolled out to the United Nations and non-governmental organizations that have expressed interest in it by the end of the year. The project grew out of research into larger filters, according to Cloete. \"We were busy developing filters for larger applications, but when you do the tests in the labatory you do the tests on a much smaller scale,\" he said. \"The results we were getting on a smaller amount of water promoted me to think about a smaller application.\" Author: Joerg Poppendieck, Sean Sinico Editor: Anke Rasper",
        "generated_story": "A Teabag-sized water filter for decentralized drinking in Africa is being developed by the University of Stellenbosch University in the South African capital of Cape Town. It is the first of its kind in South Africa and is designed to reduce the cost of drinking water in a country that has a shortage of water. According to a report published in Deutsche Welle in June, the country's water regulator, Maplecroft, is working on a new water filtration system. The new system is expected to be ready by mid-year, and will be available to the public by June. \"We are very excited about this new technology,\" said co-author Marelize Botes, adding that it would be a \"huge step forward\" for decentralizing water supply in sub-Saharan Africa. However, it will take a long time for the system to become fully functional, he said. In the meantime, \"we are going to have to wait until the end of the year to make sure that we have enough water for our people,\" he added. He added that he hoped that the technology would make it easier for people to access the water they need to get their basic needs met, such as water, electricity and sanitation. But he also pointed out that there was a lack of awareness about decentralization and the need for a water system that could be developed to meet the needs of people who need it most. For example, in Somalia, there is no government-mandated water purification system, which is not available in other African countries. And in Mauritania, where the government has not yet made a decision on whether or not to provide water to people in their own country, only a small amount of money has been spent so far on water filters. This is a major step in reducing the costs of distributing water and ensuring that people have access to water that is safe, clean and reliable. At the same time, this is also an important step to ensure that water supplies are not being diverted to other parts of Africa, like Somalia and Sudan. That's because the United Nations does not have a national water standard, but it does have the authority to regulate water use in countries where it is illegal to do so. As a result of this, a number of countries, including Kenya, Ethiopia, Sudan, Kenya and Uganda, have not been able to obtain water from their water treatment plants. So it's a big step for them to develop a system where they can tap into water without having to pay for it themselves. They are also not allowed to import water directly from other countries and have no obligation to sell it to their customers. There are a lot of problems, however, that can be resolved with the help of local authorities. One of them is that they don't know how to use water at all, because they do not know where to buy it, or how much it costs to produce it. Another problem is whether it has the capacity to store it properly, since it can only be used by a few people at a time when the situation is so dire. On the other hand, some countries have already started to look at ways to improve water quality, as well as the way in which water is treated. Some countries are already doing this. Kenya is one such example. Somalia is another, with a population of 1.5 million, while Somalia has 2.3 million. Sudan has 3.4 million people, according to data from the World Health Organization (WHO). Kenya has 5.6 million residents. South Africans are the third largest exporter of raw sewage, followed by Ethiopia and Ethiopia. Ethiopia has 1,500,000 people. Uganda has about 1 million citizens. Tanzania has just 1 percent of total population, compared with 1 in 5 in Kenya. Rwanda has 6,300. Liberia has one percent. Sierra Leone has 4,700. Mali has 10 percent in total. Mozambique has 8,600. Egypt has 7,800. Nigeria has around 1 billion people living in rural areas. Meanwhile, Somalia's population is just under half a US cent (1.7 million). In addition to its low level of corruption, corruption and poverty, most of these people live in poverty and unemployment are concentrated in poor areas and are unable to work in low-income communities. Despite the low levels of government spending, many people are working hard to find a way out of poverty. Many of those who are poor and poor in this country are struggling to survive, especially those with low income and low literacy levels. What's more, they are living on less than a third of a euro cent ($2.8 million) of their income, says the UN's office in Johannesburg. With the aid of international aid agencies, more than half of that figure is likely to increase its population by 20 percent over the next five years. Africa's government, meanwhile, has only about a quarter of all the world's total income of $3.1 billion (2 percent). The UN says it wants to cut its budget by 2030.50 billion."

High taxes The cost of acquiring and operating a car has risen 42 percent since 1995, compared to a 24 percent increase in the general cost of living. Due to tax increases and higher production costs, fuel prices soared 86 percent over the 15-year period.

This is the second-highest price in German history. In 2005, it was 3,380 euros, but in 2010 it went up to 4,740 euros. Since then, car owners have spent more than 7,000 euros to cover the costs of their vehicles. Last year, however, they had to pay a total of 5,940 euros for the car they bought in 2009 and 2010 alone. \"It was a record year,\" said Sam Edmonds, director of car sales at AD AC. He added that \"the most costly year we've ever had was in 2000,\" when he bought his first car at the end of a 15-year contract. After that, he said, \"We're going to have to spend a lot more money on our cars than we did in 2005.\" The research showed that carmakers were spending more on insurance than they were paying for their own cars, as well as on gas, electricity and other goods. But the study also pointed out that most of these costs were due to insurance companies, not to car manufacturers. For the past 10 years, German car companies have been the biggest spenders on cars in Europe, with a combined annual turnover of 3.4 billion Euros ($3.8 billion). The report also found the cost to be the highest in a decade. And the number of cars sold was even higher than it had been in 1995, at a time when Germany was the world's biggest car exporter. As a result, more cars were sold for less than 1,100 euros (3,340 euros) per car, compared with the previous year's average of 2,730 euros per year (2.5 billion euro). This was also the first time that German cars had ever been sold on the black market and the last time the price was as high as it has been since the beginning of 2010. However, this is not the case in any other European country, where car prices have risen so much in recent years that it is difficult to find a good deal of value for money. So, there's no reason to think that this year will be any different. At the same time, Germany has become a more expensive country than the United States. A decade earlier, in 1997, a similar record was set for 2010 when the country's car industry was sold to Germany. Now, that's the third most-expensive year for cars since 1995. When it comes to prices, though, we're not talking about the \"most expensive\" year of all time. We're talking more about how much the industry has spent on its cars and how it costs to manufacture them. You can see the figures here.

More than half of that was made up of BMW, Mercedes, Audi and Mercedes models, while the rest came from Volkswagen, BMW and Porsche models. Most of those models sold in 2007 and 2008, respectively, were bought by car dealerships. These models were also sold by BMW dealers, Volkswagen and Volkswagen. They were the only models that were not sold directly to German manufacturers, who sold the cars to foreign buyers. German automakers have also had a difficult time selling their models to other car makers. Volkswagen has also been a big player in this market, too. BMW has sold its models for around 1 million euros since 2005. VW, Porsche and Audi have all sold cars for about 3 million Euros (about $2,500 euros). Volkswagen is also a major player. Porsche, VW and VW are the largest carmaker in all of Europe. Mercedes has a market share of around 10 percent, followed by Audi, Ford and BMW. Audi has the best sales figures in terms of sales, sales and profits, driven by the sales of its German models and sales. Meanwhile, auto sales are down by about 1 percent from the year 2000. Even Volkswagen's sales have fallen by around 3 percent since 2000, despite the fact that they sold their first models in 2008. With the exception of Volkswagen in 2006, many of them are still selling the models at around 2.7 percent off the market for just under 4 percent. What's more? The car market value is still"
