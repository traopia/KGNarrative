        "target": "Myanmar Junta Announces Amnesty The junta in Myanmar, also known as Burma, announced an amnesty for more than 7,000 prisoners on Friday, including a few political detainees. The amnesty came on the 21st anniversary of the brutal crackdown of a student-led pro-democracy movement in 1988 and the subsequent seizure of power by the current junta. Journalists were invited to Yangon\u2019s notorious Insein prison on Friday as the authorities released the first batch of prisoners. At least 600 inmates were freed as part of an amnesty for over 7,000 inmates nationwide. Among those released in Yangon were two journalists and 25 political prisoners -- rights groups say this is only 1 percent of the total number of political prisoners held by the military regime. Maung Zarni, a research fellow at the London School of Economics, was \u201chappy for the prisoners who were part of the release\u201d. \u201cThis is a very positive personal development and I am happy they have been released but we need to understand that the junta is using the prisoners\u2019 release as a public relations exercise. It is the 21st anniversary of the military coup so they are using this as a way to pacify political discontent in the country.\u201d Amnesty comes ahead of next year\u2019s polls Myanmar's director general of prisons, Zaw Win, said that the prisoners had been freed so they could take part in next year's polls. In recent months, rights activists, pro-democracy activists and Western countries have cast doubt on the credibility of the planned elections as many key political activists are still in detention. This includes pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who recently began a new 18-month period of house arrest after being found guilty of violating her house arrest order in a widely condemned trial. \u201cThe whole Suu kyi trial is rather unlawful,\u201d said Zarni. \u201cBecause the country does not have an independent judiciary, the judges are just puppets who dance to the tune of the top leadership.\u201d Junta is holding on tightly In 1990, Suu Kyi\u2019s National League for Democracy won Myanmar\u2019s last general election by a landslide. But the junta never recognised the results and has since tightened its control over the country. The 2008 constitution, which was drafted and approved by the military generals, which guarantees the army 25 percent of parliamentary seats, is yet another sign of its desire to consolidate power. \u201cThe military is going to be in power for a long time,\u201d warns Zarni, \u201cbecause they have got control of all the political and economic institutions in the country as well as the entire state of Burma. So with or without elections, this is likely to remain the same.\u201d New Democratic Party formed Meanwhile, a new political party has been formed in Myanmar. The Democratic Party is headed by Mya Than Than Nu, who is the daughter of the country\u2019s first democratically-elected prime minister, U Nu. The party has proposed a power-sharing deal with the military, which would give 40 percent of power to politicians and 60 percent to the military rulers. Harn Yawnghwe, the director of the Brussels-based Euro-Burma Office, doubts the new party stands a chance: \u201cIt is possible that they they would be able to get some votes. But it is not likely, even if they were able to contest the elections freely, that they will be able to form a new government because the military is not prepared to let any party rule.\u201d Democrats should exploit elections He thinks the only way out for the democratic forces in Myanmar is to use the upcoming elections wisely and \u201cto take part in them even if they are against them. I think we have to look at the elections as a process which will lead to democracy -- maybe in few more years.\u201d The National League for Democracy has indicated that it will not take part in the polls unless all Myanmar\u2019s political prisoners, including Suu Kyi, are released. Suu Kyi\u2019s lawyers have filed an appeal against the extension of her house arrest and the court is expected to give a ruling on October 2. But few are hopeful that the junta will amnesty her anytime soon. Author: Disha Uppal Editor: Anne Thomas",

The New Democratic Party (NLD) called for the release of the prisoners, who had been imprisoned since 1988. Amnesty International said it would release the detainees on October 2, the day after their release from prison. \"We will release them immediately,\" said Amnesty's Maung Zarni, a researcher at the London School of Economics in the UK, adding that it was \"impossible\" to find a political prisoner who would be willing to give up his right to freedom of movement in order to fight for his country\u2019s future. Insein Zaw Win, an Amnesty researcher, told Amnesty that the government had failed to provide a fair trial to the jailed prisoners. He added that \"the government has not done enough to ensure that all detainees are released.\" Amnesty also said the new government would not release prisoners who were convicted of crimes against humanity, including murder, rape, torture, attempted murder and attempted rape. It also warned that if they were released, they would face a long prison sentence of up to five years in prison, which would amount to a death sentence. According to Amnesty, more than 1,000 prisoners have been released since the end of 1990, when Suu Kyi took office as the country's first democratically elected civilian president. Many of them are still in jail, while others are being held in solitary confinement. Some have even been sentenced to life imprisonment for crimes committed during the 1990s and 2000s, according to rights group Amnesty. Others, however, say they have not been freed at all, and that they are not even allowed to return to their home country of Myanmar. They say the military has been trying to force them out of their homes for years, but they do not have the means to do so. On Friday, Amnesty said they had received a letter from former military chief General Harn Yawnghwe, calling for them to be released immediately. However, it did not say whether they will be allowed back into their country, saying it is too early to make a decision on whether or not they want to go back to jail. There is also a lack of information on the whereabouts of detainees, such as their families, relatives, friends and relatives who have fled to neighboring countries, as well as relatives of those who are imprisoned in jails and prisons. A recent report by the International Criminal Court (ICC) said that a number of prisoners were being released from jail in recent years after being tortured and tortured in a military prison camp in Rakhine state. This is not the first time that this has happened. Last year, there were reports of torture and forced disappearances of hundreds of thousands of people. At the same time, police were still searching for suspects in connection with the deaths of dozens of soldiers and police officers who died in clashes between police and soldiers in 1988 and 1989. Since then, many of these detainees have returned to Myanmar, where they face charges of human rights violations and are now being tried in absentia for their alleged involvement in crimes that have no basis in international law. Most have also been tried for treason, though the charges against them were later dropped by a court of military court in 2008, after which they pleaded guilty and were acquitted of all charges. More than a dozen people were also convicted in court on charges related to drug trafficking and other crimes. These charges have since been brought to trial, although the trial is still ongoing and there is no trial date set for any suspects. But the case against the former army general is being investigated by an independent court. If convicted, he could be tried as a war criminal, if he is found to have committed the crime of murder. His conviction could also be used as evidence that he has committed a crime against his family and the people of his home state of Hanoi. That is the main reason why he was imprisoned, says the ICJC's director of research, Harkghwil. U Nu's wife, Disha Uppal, said her husband was released on bail in 2009. She said she was not aware of any charges and had no knowledge of what had taken place. Her husband, Mya Than Than Nu, was arrested in 1990 and is currently serving a life sentence for drug offenses, she said. UNICEF has also issued an appeal for a ruling party to reinstate him, accusing him of failing to act on his own convictions. I am not sure whether he will appeal to his conviction, or if the court will allow him to continue his sentence, because the prosecution is likely to take him into custody. We are hopeful that his case will not be brought before the Supreme Court, I think it will only be a matter of time before he can be extradited to face the death penalty. What do you think will happen to him? The National League for Democracy (UNICEFI) says it's not clear what the verdict will do? It is"

She will share the prestigious award with US compatriot Oliver Williamson. The jury from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said the Americans' research had shown how \"economic analysis can shed light on most forms of social organization.\" Ostrom, a professor at Indiana University, was honored for her \"analysis of economic governance,\" especially in relation to the management of common property or property under common control. The political scientist's work challenges the widely accepted belief that common property is poorly managed and should be either regulated by central authorities or privatized, it added. She carried out numerous studies showing how self-organization and local-level management work to keep common resources viable. Her studies included both natural resources, such as forests, and artificial structures, for example police forces. Ostrom told Swedish television that she felt \"great surprise and appreciation\" and was \"in shock\" about being the first woman to win the prize. The pros and cons of big firms In his work, co-prizewinner Oliver Williamson, of University of California, Berkeley, examines why large corporations tend to arise - and why they do not - based on the cost and complexity of transactions, according to the Nobel committee. \"He has taught us to regard markets, firms, associations, agencies, and even households from the perspective of their contribution to the resolution of conflict,\" the jury said. Williamson authored 'The Economic Institutions of Capitalism' in 1975, a landmark text of the 'new institutional economics' movement that questioned the idea of firms as simple profit-making machines. Last but not least The Nobel prize for economics is the only Nobel award that was not created by the will of Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel in 1896. It was actually founded by the Swedish central bank, the Sverige Riksbank, to celebrate its tri-centenary a year earlier. It was awarded for the first time in 1969 under its official name: the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel. But although it was the last \"Nobel prize\" to be created and the last to be announced each year, the prize is not a poor relation in monetary terms. Winners of the awards for peace, literature, medicine, physiology, chemistry and physics all receive 10 million Swedish crowns (969,000 euros). A good year for women This year was a record year for women laureates. German-Romanian writer Herta Mueller won the Nobel Prize for Literature. Australian-American Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider of the United States were awarded the prize for medicine. And Ada Yonath of Israel was one of three scientists recognized for her work in chemistry. Americans more or less swept the board this year. Nine of the 11 laureates were US citizens. The most prominent of those was US President Barack Obama, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for his \"extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples.\" jg/AFP/dpa/Reuters Editor: Sam Edmonds",
        "generated_story": "First woman to win Nobel Prize for Economics The Nobel Peace Prize has been handed out for the first time in the history of economics. Elinor Ostrom won the prize for economics in 1968 for her work on the Economic Institutions of Capitalism. The Swedish Academy of Sciences, the country's most prestigious scientific society, announced the award in a press release on Tuesday. \"This year's prize is for economic research,\" the Sverige Riksbank said, adding that it was \"a very good year for science and economics.\" The prize, which is awarded annually to the most successful economist in history, was established in 1969 by the Swedish government. It was first awarded to a woman in 1967, and it has since been expanded to include more than 10 million Swedish crowns (10 million euros) and 10,000 euros ($11.5 million) in prize money. In 1968, a year earlier, an Australian-American woman was awarded the top prize in economics, with the second-most money going to research and teaching at the University of California, Berkeley. This year, it will be a second consecutive year that an American woman has won it, after the previous record holder, Elizabeth Blackburn, won in 1972. Both women have been awarded prizes for their work in economic and social sciences since the 1970s, when they were both in their mid-20s and early 30s. Oliver Williamson, who was born and raised in New York City, is the youngest woman ever to receive the Nobel prize. He won for his work, \"The economic institutions of capitalism\" (AFP, Reuters, dpa) \"It's a great honor to be able to share the laureates with other women,\" Williamson said in an interview with Reuters. 'I think it's very important that we all have the opportunity to work together to make the world a better place to live,\" he said. Author: Carol Greider (Reuters, AFP) The award for Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel is presented annually in Oslo, Norway, in honor of the 70th anniversary of his death in 1975. Since then, he has received a number of awards, including the prestigious \"Nobel Prize in Economics,\" which honors the best work of literature by a Nobel laureate and the \"most influential economist of all time.\" In the past, this has also been the case for women, as well as for men and women who have worked in finance and business for a long time. But in recent years, women of color have won more prizes than men, according to researchers at Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana. They have also won several other prestigious prizes, such as the American Economic Achievement Award, for literature, economics and political science, among other subjects. One of them was the Economics Prize, given to women in 1976. That year the U.S. president, Barack Obama, received an honorary doctorate in philosophy from the university's department of business administration. Another award was given in 1970, awarded in memory of Nobel peace prize winner, Nobel Laureate Elina Nobel (1962), who died last year at age 88. She was one of only two women to ever win the economics prize at that time, along with her husband, Swedish economist Carl Bilderberg (1975). \"I'm very proud of my achievements,\" she said at a news conference in Stockholm, where she gave a speech in which she thanked the president for giving her a chance to give back to her country. Her speech was a powerful reminder of how important it is to have a positive impact on society and that she was not only a scientist, but also a human being, she told the audience that \"the world is a good place for people to think about the future of economic development.\" She said she had been inspired by her father's work as a young economist and a professor of political philosophy at Purdue University and was inspired to write a book about his life and work. Now she has a new book, 'The Economic Institution of Economics' (pdf), which was published in her honor, titled 'Economics and Political Economy of America'. The book is based on her life experiences and her experiences as an economist, author and economist. And she is not the only one who has had a successful career in business, politics and politics. I'm sure she will continue to do so, too, because I think that's what I've always thought of her as: a strong woman with a very bright future. However, I don't think I'll ever get to see her again in my lifetime. So I hope that I won't be the last woman who gets to read the book. If I do, that would be an incredible achievement for my country, since I have no idea how much money I can make in this country.\" \"We are a nation of people who want to study the economy and how it works. We are not a country that doesn't have that kind of money,\" said Nobel laureate Oliver Williamson (pictured above), the author of \"Economy and Economics in America's Memory,\" who is"

In a document on combating AIDS, the Commission said that as of 2007, around 2.2 million people carried the virus in the EU and nearby countries, an increase of 700,000 from 2001. According to Commission figures, around 730,000 of these live within the EU's 27 member states. France, Italy, Spain and Portugal have relatively high infection rates - ranging from 0.4 percent to 0.5 percent. In the Baltic country of Estonia, the infection rate stands at around 1.3 percent. In neighboring Ukraine, around 1.6 percent of the population has been diagnosed with HIV, while in Russia around 1.1 percent are HIV positive. The Commission warned that now was not the time for Europe to drop its guard on preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS, adding that in some neighboring countries the number of people carrying the virus had doubled. EU Health Commissioner Androulla Vassiliou said political momentum in the fight against HIV/AIDS needed to be maintained, adding that people must \"take responsibility for themselves and their partners by talking about and practicing safe sex and going for HIV testing.\" A cure for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has yet to be found more than a quarter century after it was brought to public attention. However, efficient treatments exist to slow the evolution of the virus. dfm/AFP Editor: Chuck Penfold",
        "generated_story": "One in three people living with HIV/AIDS in the EU and neighboring countries are unaware they are HIV-positive, according to a new report from the European Commission. The report, published Monday, found that one in four people in Europe is unaware of their HIV status. This is a worrying development for many of the 28 EU member states, which together with the United States and Canada have a large number of HIV and AIDS patients living in their own countries. It is the first time in history that people have been unaware their status was HIV positive, the report said. \"This is not an isolated case,\" said Chuck Penfold, a spokesman for the Commission, adding that it was \"not a case of being unaware that you have HIV.\" \"It's not something that can be prevented,\" he added, referring to the fact that many people do not know they have the disease. In 2001, more than a quarter of EU citizens had HIV. Since then, this number has risen to three-quarters of all EU residents, compared to one-third in 2001. That's a significant increase compared with 2001 and 2007, when the average age at the time of diagnosis was around 30. Now, it's up to two-thirds of those who have tested positive for HIV, and the rest are not aware of it at all. According to an analysis by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in New York, HIV is an extremely serious disease that affects the body's immune system and can lead to AIDS and other forms of AIDS. There is no cure for AIDS, but it is possible to prevent it from spreading to other people, such as children, elderly people and people with pre-existing medical conditions. And that's the main reason why so few people are aware that HIV has been found in all of Europe's countries, including the US, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece and Spain. Many of these people live in countries with high HIV levels, while others in other EU countries have low HIV rates. But in some cases, that doesn't mean they don't have an HIV problem. For example, in Greece, for instance, there are a total of three HIV cases a year, with one of them being in a country with a population of 1.5 million people who live there. Another one is in France and Belgium, where the health minister, Androulla Vassiliou, said he had been living there since 2001 when he was diagnosed with AIDS in his home country of Greece. He said that in many cases HIV was not a serious illness and that this was a result of a lack of awareness of its effects on the public health system. A recent study by a leading HIV expert in Brussels, however, showed that there was no clear link between the virus and HIV in most people's lives, as well as the treatment of other diseases. On Monday the commission said there were no new HIV diagnoses in any EU country, although it did not specify which countries had the highest HIV prevalence in that country. However, they did say that the most recent cases were in Spain and Portugal. They also said they had not been diagnosed until 2007 when they received a diagnosis of hepatitis A, an infection that had spread to several other countries and was spread across the entire European Union. These cases are now being treated as a preventable disease, he said, saying that they were not considered serious enough to be considered a cause for concern by health authorities. One in five people infected by HIV are currently living at risk of dying from AIDS - a condition that has caused them to live with symptoms of liver failure and kidney failure for several years - and this is only the second time since the outbreak in 2007. More than 70,000 people were infected in 2006. Among the new diagnoses: AIDS was the leading cause of death among those infected. AIDS is linked to high blood pressure and cancer. HIV can also be transmitted through the bloodstream, causing the spread of cancer in certain parts of France. Experts say it can cause people to become more susceptible to infections, especially in areas where there is high levels of infection, particularly in high-risk populations. Health officials have warned that AIDS has become a major problem in this area. Officials said the current outbreak was linked with an increase in HIV infections in recent years. France has not yet been able to find a cure. Meanwhile, officials in Germany and Italy have also been working on a plan to address the issue. EU health ministers have already begun to take steps to reduce the burden on their citizens. European health officials are also working to improve the quality of life for those affected by this disease and will continue to do so until the end of this epidemic. Europe has a long list of countries that have not seen a change in health conditions, experts say. Doctors say the number is expected to increase by at least 10 percent of cases in 2008. If the situation is confirmed, Europe will have to look into the future, researchers say, \"We will look at how long it will take to treat the infection. We"

The private firms have been asked to provide security for the tournament, which kicks off on Monday, May 26, in St. Gallen, the capital of Switzerland. They will be working closely with the Swiss security agency, Protectas, to ensure that all security measures are in place, according to Urs Stadler, head of security at Prisec, a private security firm based in Zurich. \"We are going to do everything in our power to protect our citizens,\" he said, adding that the firm would be providing security services to the country's security forces, as well as to other countries, including the United States, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Russia and the Netherlands. It will also be the first time that a Swiss national team has been invited to compete in a major international tournament since the 1990s, when it was known as the \"World Cup of Sport.\" It is the second time in two years that security is being sought by the government, following the success of last year's tournament in Moscow. According to a statement from the DPA, \"Security is a very important part of our security strategy and we are working very hard to make sure that we have a strong security system.\" The statement also said that \"we will continue to work with our partners in this area,\" and that it is \"very important for us to be able to secure our own security and security systems.\" In addition, it added that there was \"a lot of cooperation\" between the two security firms, with a number of them working in cooperation with other security agencies. For example, one of these firms is called \"Securitas,\" which is an NGO that works with law enforcement agencies to prevent the spread of false information. In the event of a terrorist attack, they will provide information on the whereabouts of those who have committed acts of terrorism, such as those responsible for attacks on police officers, soldiers, civilians, and other civilians. This will include the use of drones and drones to track down suspected terrorists and to monitor the movements of people who are suspected of being involved in terrorist activities. There are also plans to use drones as a means to gather information about the attacks. Last year, there were more than 1,000 people killed in an attack on a police station in Z\u00fcrich. Now there are at least 2,500 people injured in that attack. That number is expected to rise to 3,600 by May 20, but it could be even higher if the attack is not prevented by a drone strike. And that's just the beginning, because the police have already begun to take action against the attackers. At the same time, security experts have also been called on to step up their efforts to keep the situation under control and prevent any further attacks from becoming too dangerous. As a result, police will have to increase their presence in areas where they are most likely to have access to sensitive information, like the area where the terrorists are hiding. But that doesn't mean that they won't be allowed to enter the city. If they do, that will only be a matter of time before they get caught up in their activities and they can be arrested and charged with crimes. So far, no one has come forward to say they have done anything to stop them from doing their job. However, this is unlikely to happen. Police are still working on their own and there is no indication of any imminent threat to public safety. A police spokesman told the press conference on Tuesday that police would not be present at the start of this week's event. Security experts said they were not aware of what was going on at all. Authorities have not yet made any official announcement, however, nor have they made a decision on whether or not to issue an official statement about what they would do. Officials have said it will take place in order to reassure the public that their officers are not being deployed in any way. Nevertheless, authorities are already working to prepare for this event and will not hesitate to act if necessary. We are hopeful that this will go ahead with their plans, given the current security situation in Switzerland and in other parts of Europe. Meanwhile, we will keep a close eye on security, especially in Europe, where security remains a top priority for security. I'm not sure what will happen in terms of who is in charge of guarding the venues. What do you think? I don't know what I can tell you, I think it's too early to tell us what we can do about it. How can we do that? What are we prepared for? We have no idea what to expect? The security team is working with us. All we know for sure is that any of us will do is to stay on top of all the information that is available to us, so we'll keep an eye out for any incident that could lead to an arrest. Pensions are being closely monitored by security officials. On the other hand, some of course, if there will"

        "target": "German Minister Urges Peace in Georgia's Separatist Regions German Foreign Minister Steinmeier has called for an end to the \"spiral of violence\" between the Georgian government in Tbilisi and its Russian-backed rebel regions and presented a three-stage plan to break the deadlock. Steinmeier issued the plea as he began a tour of the region to sponsor a new peace plan aimed at calming the simmering tensions over Georgia's separatist regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. \"This is my appeal to break out of the spiral of violence. A lack of dialogue is not an option for the future,\" he said after meeting with his Georgian counterpart Eka Tkeshelashvili. Steinmeier, who chairs the so-called Group of Friends of the United Nations' Secretary on Georgia, is proposing a three-phase peace plan based on a mutual declaration of non-violence and repatriation of about 25,000 ethnic Georgians expelled from Abkhazia in the 1990s. Negotiations over the status of the two rebel regions, which have enjoyed de facto autonomy since the end of a civil war in 1994, was reserved for the final phase of negotiations. Tkeshelashvili said, \"The plan has great potential for success,\" but added that the most difficult thing would be to convince Russia. Peace talks remain distant The threat of armed conflict in the region last month has given urgency to international pressure for renewed peace talks, but Tbilisi, Moscow and the Russian-backed regions remain far apart on the basic premises for restarting peace talks. Officials in Tbilisi oppose a treaty on the non-use of force without guarantees on the return of refugees and the withdrawal of Russian peacekeeping forces base in the region. Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was skeptical of peace efforts Thursday. \"Signing of a treaty on the return of Georgian refugees to Abkhazia is unreal now, because such a return requires a calm situation,\" Lavrov was quoted as saying by news agency RIA-Novosti. \"We think that signing a treaty on the non-use of force without any preconditions is an absolutely unavoidable first step,\" he added. Experts see little hope for Steinmeier's plan Analysts do not expect anything conclusive from Steinmeier's trip, pointing to intransigence on the part of the Abkhaz President Sergei Bagapsh, who said he would \"not consider the plan.\" \"We are not going to discuss Abkhazia's status with anyone. We are building an independent, democratic state,\" Bagapsh was quoted by Georgian news agencies as saying. Speaking to journalists ahead of the meetings Thursday, Steinmeier admitted: \"We don't have any illusions about simple answers, but we cannot stand by without acting on this conflict. That would be irresponsible.\" From Tbilisi, the German minister is to travel to the Black Sea city of Batumi for talks with Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili and then to Abkhazia on Friday before ending his three-day tour in Moscow. Most citizens of the breakaway republics have been issued Russian passports and over 2,500 Russian peacekeeping troops patrol the region under a UN ceasefire agreement. In opposition to Georgia's bid to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Russia moved to strengthen diplomatic ties with the breakaway regions sharply aggravating tensions with the Georgian leadership in recent months.",
        "generated_story": "A New Peace Plan for the Separatist Regions of Tbilisi and Abkhazia A new peace plan has been drawn up by the Georgian government. The new plan is expected to be signed by President Mikhail Saakashvili and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Bagapsh on Friday. According to the plan, the two regions will be part of a new \"peace plan\" with the aim of creating a stable, stable and prosperous region in the future. It would be the first step in a long-term peace process between the former Soviet republics of Georgia and Ukraine. In the long term, it is hoped that the region will become a model for other regions of the world to follow. For example, in 1994, Georgia signed a peace agreement with Russia, but the agreement was not signed until 1994. Since then, however, there have been a number of disagreements over how to deal with this conflict. One of those disagreements is the lack of cooperation between Russia and Georgia, which has led to a series of violent clashes between ethnic Georgians and the Soviet Union. Another is that Russia is not willing to cooperate with Georgia in any way. \"We are not ready to give up on the conflict,\" said Eka Tkeshelashvyili, a Georgian political analyst who has worked closely with Russian President Vladimir Putin for more than 30 years. He added that \"we are ready for a peaceful settlement of this dispute.\" The plan would also include the creation of an independent state, with a political and economic system. But it would not be possible to create a state of peace, he added, adding that it was \"not possible for us to agree on a solution to this problem.\" Russia's Foreign Ministry said on Thursday that Moscow and Moscow had agreed to work together to find a way to solve the problem of ethnic separatism in Georgia. Moscow said it had also agreed with Moscow's foreign minister, Vladimir Lenin, that there should be a \"dialogue\" between Russian and Georgian states, as well as the United States. Russia has repeatedly rejected the proposal, saying it did not meet the international standards of international peace and stability. However, Moscow has not ruled out the possibility of such a deal, and in recent years it has made it clear that such an agreement would have a positive impact on Georgia's political situation. Putin has also said that he would like to see a return to normal relations with his former country, where he was president from 1994 to 1994 and when he became prime minister in 1999. Russian foreign ministry spokesman Vladimir Zakharov said Moscow was prepared to discuss the issue with Lavrov, who is also a former Russian ambassador to Moscow, on \"the sidelines of talks in Moscow.\" \"I think it's a good idea,\" he said in an interview with RIA-Novosti, referring to talks between Lavrov and Putin in which the Russian president was invited to attend the UN General Assembly in New York. On Thursday, Lavrov said he had been invited by Putin's government to meet with him and his Russian counterpart, Boris Yeltsin, for talks on ending the Cold War. 'I'm very happy that we have reached this point and I'm looking forward to it. I think we'll be able to make it happen,\" Lavrov told reporters at a news conference in Washington. Lavrov's visit to Russia was also welcomed by Russian Prime Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, whose country is a close ally of Russia. Both Putin and Lighthizer said they were \"very optimistic\" about the prospects for an end to fighting the war in Syria. They said the talks would take place \"in the near future,\" but they also stressed that they had not yet reached a point where the situation could be resolved, given the current situation in Ukraine and other neighboring countries. That's not the case, they said, because the negotiations are still going on. And they have not reached the level of normalization that was agreed on before the 1990s, when the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) was established in 1993. There is still a lot of work to do, though, of course, to resolve the question of whether Russia should join the peace talks. This is something that is very important for Russia to take into account, since Russia already has a strong position on this issue. At the same time, Russia also has an important role to play in resolving the Ukraine crisis, especially with regard to Ukraine's territorial integrity and its role as a guarantor of stability in international relations. Foreign ministers have also expressed their support for Ukraine, although they do not want to talk about it in terms of its future, according to Krasnodarsk, an influential member of NATO's Security Council. A Russian delegation from Moscow is due to visit Moscow on Saturday and will continue to press ahead with talks with Putin. Meanwhile, Putin will also visit the country's defense ministry in Russia next week. President Dmitry Medvedev has promised to hold a meeting with President Putin at the end of next month. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Pesk (AFP, Reuters) said Russia will not to"

        "target": "Bayern's Klinsmann Praises, Hoeness Attacks Hoffenheim The Bundesliga's two top teams don't play until Friday, but the mind games are already underway. Bayern's coach Juergen Klinsmann says Hoffenheim are legitimate contenders, but commercial manager Uli Hoeness disagrees. When the Bundesliga scheduled Bayern's home match against Hoffenheim in the league's unloved Friday night slot, they probably didn't imagine that it would turn out to be the match of the first half of the season. Indeed, few experts or fans thought that Hoffenheim, a first-division debutante located in a southern German village with 3,000 inhabitants, would give mighty Munich a run for its money. But it's the first week of December, and Hoffenheim top the table by three points. They also have a much better goal difference than their second-placed rivals -- and that has drawn praise from Bayern's coach, Juergen Klinsmann. \"I have the highest estimation of Hoffenheim because they've built the squad very ambitiously, rationally and with very good players,\" Klinsmann told DPA news agency. \"They can be proud of that.\" Klinsmann said he thought that the club could establish itself among the top three or four sides in Germany in the years to come and qualify for international competition next season. He also had words of praise for Hoffenheim's software billionaire patron, Dietmar Hopp, whose money has funded the club's ascent. \"There's nothing negative about it,\" Klinsmann said. \"He used to play for the club, is a soccer man through and through and helped the team get on its feet.\" Some fans have criticized Hopp and Hoffenheim for paying inflating salaries and luring talent away from other clubs instead of developing homegrown players. In fact, Hoffenheim's official salary budget is about average for the Bundesliga. Hoeness sounds his horn But while Bayern's coach was praising his opponents to the skies, Munich's commercial manager Uli Hoeness has been trying to play with their heads. On the heels of Bayern's convincing win over Leverkusen last weekend, Hoeness is back to taunting rivals. \"The performance we showed in the second half against Leverkusen will be enough against Hoffenheim,\" Hoeness told the German soccer magazine kicker. Hoeness also dropped a none-too-thinly-veiled hint that Hoffenheim's personnel expenditures were far higher than the officially released figures and scoffed at the idea that strategy would determine the outcome of Friday's match. \"Games are decided by the better players, not by tactics,\" Hoeness said. \"And of course, we've got better players than Hoffenheim.\" But that particular verbal attack may represent some wishful thinking of the manager's part. Hoffenheim coach Ralf Rangnick is one of only two current Bundesliga skippers with a winning record against Munich. Rangnick, whose team cruised past Bielefeld last weekend to keep Bayern three points back, reacted to Hoeness' remarks with a shrug. \"We're preparing for Munich exactly the same way we did against Bielefeld,\" Rangnick said. In any case, soccer fans in Germany know what they'll be doing Friday evening -- finding a bar with cable sports television to watch a top match that no one, before the start of the season, would have considered possible.",
        "generated_story": " Hoffenheim's Commercial Manager Reacts to First Half of the Bundesliga Season Uli Hoeness, the club's commercial manager, has reacted to the first half of this season's Bundesliga season with a resounding \"yes\" and \"no\" in his voice. The German club has been struggling to find the right balance in the transfer market, with the likes of Bayern Munich, Leverkusen and Bayern all struggling in their first two Bundesliga games. But the German side have managed to make the most of their chances, and they will be hoping for a strong start to their Bundesliga campaign. \"We have a lot of work ahead of us,\" said Ralf Rangnick, head of DPA. He added that he was \"very pleased\" with his team-mates' performance on Friday night, adding that they had \"a lot to learn from the last few games.\" \"I'm very pleased with our players and the way they have responded so far,\" he said, referring to Jurgen Klinsmann, who has won three Bundesliga titles in a row and is now Bayern's head coach for the second time in three seasons. Rangingnick added: \"The players have done a great job in training, but we have also had to work hard to get the best out of them. We have to be patient with them, because we don't know what the future holds for them.\" The Bundesliga's most successful club is Bayern, whose first-half results have been so impressive that it's difficult to see how they can keep up with their rivals. In the end, though, they are the only team to have won a Bundesliga title in recent years. On Friday, however, their coach, Dietmar Hopp, was forced to step down from his role as the team's chief commercial officer after a difficult first week of training. Hoepp said he would be returning to his position of commercial director at the beginning of December, when he is expected to take over the reins of a team that has struggled to adapt to a new system of competition. After all, there are so many things that can be done to improve the quality of football in Germany. For one thing, he's not going to give up on the idea of being able to compete with other Bundesliga teams. Another thing is that the players will have the opportunity to develop their own brand, which is something he has always wanted to do. At the same time, it is important to remember that this is not a club that is trying to win the league. That's why he wants to stay in charge of his own business, rather than try to build a brand for himself. And that's what he will do when the season is over. It's also important for him to keep his eye on his players, too, as he knows they're the ones who are most at risk of losing the title. This is the kind of thing that makes him a man who can't stand to lose his job, even if it means losing a game. As a result, his contract is up for renewal in December and he won't be allowed to renew it for another year. His contract expires in January 2019, after which he hopes to return as a player. If he does not return, then he'll be back to Hoffensheim, where he spent his entire career, in 2016-17. With the exception of one season as an assistant coach at Bayern and now as head man of youth development at Bayer Munich. Losing the Champions League is a big blow for Hoffenerheim. However, that doesn't mean they'll let him go. They have already lost a couple of key players to injury, so they've had a tough first few weeks and that will not be the case this time around. Nevertheless, a positive start is in store for their future. A positive result is likely to come, especially after the loss to Bayern on Saturday night. There's no doubt about the importance of having a good team in this Bundesliga, particularly in terms of quality, quality and attacking play. What's more, this could be a very positive step forward for his future, given the fact that his side are still in contention to reach the next level of European football. How can he do that? \"It's very difficult for me to say no,\" says Ragnnick. 'But I think he can do it. I'm really looking forward to seeing him back in action, I really hope that we can get to that stage of our career.\" Ranglingnick adds: 'He's the man we've been waiting for for so long. You've got to believe in him, right? He's always been one of those guys who is always there to help us get back on our feet. When you're not playing well, you can always count on him. So, we're hoping that Juergen has a chance to prove himself again. Last week, Jocki was a key player for Bayern in Munich and in that regard, Juersmann was the main reason why I was so much"

The move has been questioned by officials, with some saying it places the EU at-risk of taking sides in an internal dispute. The European Commission's decision to launch the rule of law procedure on Warsaw puts the EU's executive institution at-risk of taking sides, Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Konrad Szymanski told reporters in the European Parliament. \"I have the impression that the [European] Commission risks taking a role as a side in a political dispute inside Poland,\" Szymanski noted. On Wednesday, European Commission Vice President Frans Timmermans - a former Dutch foreign minister - announced the move, marking the first time the EU has used the mechanism. Timmermans said that the move was aimed at entering \"into a dialogue with the Polish authorities, to clarify the facts in an objective way and help find solutions if necessary.\" He added that the procedure is focused on seeking answers regarding the new right-wing Polish government's actions not to apply two judgments by the country's constitutional court, and the reasons behind the president and vice-president's terms were shortened. Preserving rule of law However, Poland's deputy foreign minister said that the European Commission was informed of the reasons behind the government's actions. \"We would insist that the questions are phrased precisely because we have provided much information to the Commission in recent days and we are not entirely clear as to what the Commission is still not clear about,\" Szymanski noted to reporters at the European Parliament. New media laws, giving the government the power to hire and fire senior figures at state broadcasters, were also called into question by Timmermans. The controversial legislation prompted mass pro-democracy protesters in the European country. \"The rule of law is one of the EU's fundamental values. Making sure the rule of law is preserved throughout the Union is a key part of the European Commission's responsibilities,\" Timmermans wrote on his official Facebook page.

The EU's foreign policy chief has warned that Poland's political situation in the country could lead to an escalation of tensions between the European Union and the United States. \"If we take sides, we will have to be very careful,\" Timmmans told a news conference in Brussels, adding that he was \"very concerned\" about the possibility of a conflict between Poland and its neighbors. He added that \"we are not going to let the situation get any worse.\" \"We are very concerned about Poland,\" he said in an interview with the German newspaper dpa on Wednesday, referring to a dispute over the rule of law that has been brewing for two years. In the past, the two countries have been at loggerheads over a number of issues, including the right to free movement of people. But the current situation is different. Poland is a member of the 28-member European Parliament, which has a majority of EU member states, and it is not the first time Poland has had a serious political crisis. It is the second time since the end of World War II that it has faced a crisis of its own. Polish Prime Minister Konrad Szymanski, who was elected to the post of prime minister in 2015, has said that his country is \"not a democratic country.\" The Polish government, however, rejects the idea of an EU-wide \"regime change\" that would allow Poland to become an independent state. On Wednesday the Polish president, Viktor Orban, said he would not accept a change in its constitution, saying it would be \"unacceptable\" for Poland not to follow the rules of international law. However, he did not rule out that the new constitution could be amended to make Poland a free and open country, as he has done in other European countries, such as Hungary, Slovakia and Hungary. Hungary's government has also been accused of meddling in Polish politics, but has denied any involvement in any such meddling. According to Hungarian media, Hungary has repeatedly denied the allegations, calling them \"baseless\" and \"absurd.\" Hungary and Poland have also repeatedly accused each other of violating the law, with Hungary accusing the other side of doing the same. At the time of his election, Poland was one of Europe's most liberal democracies, while Hungary was the only other member state to have a parliamentary majority in parliament, according to state-run news agency Dpa. Hungarian foreign ministry spokesman Konstant Szmanski said the government was not aware of any new proposals to amend the constitution. Timmersmans also said Hungary had not yet made any changes to its laws and that Hungary should not be allowed to impose new laws on its citizens. A spokesman for the Hungarian Foreign Ministry told Reuters that a new law was being drafted to protect the rights of Polish citizens who have not been able to obtain a visa to live in Hungary for a long period of time. Tensions over Poland are also rising in Germany, Austria and Austria, where Hungary is currently the largest EU country with a population of more than 1.5 million. There is also a growing sense of unease among the Poles that they are being treated unfairly in their own country. Some Polish politicians have accused Hungary of being a victim of political interference, even though they claim they have no legal basis to do so. Many Polish lawmakers have said they don't want to interfere with their country's legal system. They have called for an investigation into the matter, arguing that there is no basis for such a move. This is an example of how Poland should be treated as a separate country from other EU countries. For more on this, Reuters reported on Tuesday that Hungarian lawmakers had called on Hungary to change its law on the use of force against Poland.

The European parliament has rejected the proposal to create a \"rule of Law Framework\" in which Poland will be governed by a constitutional court, despite the fact that many EU members have expressed their opposition to it. That's not an easy task to achieve, of course, because it's the most democratic nation in Europe. If Hungary does not have the power to take part in this kind of legislation, it will face a lot of pressure from the courts and other countries that have already made a mistake in setting up a system of laws. And that's why we need to look into this issue,\" the spokesman said. Slovakian President Viktor Orbban told reporters in Warsaw, \"I think we should do everything we can to prevent a situation like this from happening. I'm not surprised that this is something that will not happen.\" In a statement, a Hungarian lawmaker told the press conference this week,"

        "target": "Turkey, Greece seek NATO mission in Aegean, says German official Germany, Greece and Turkey will ask NATO to approve a maritime surveillance mission in the Aegean to combat illegal people smugglers. Greece had previously voiced reservations about the proposal. The proposed mission to be discussed at a NATO defense ministers meeting in Brussels on Thursday comes days after German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutolgu said they would raise the issue of refugees with the Alliance. According to a Reuters report citing a senior German official, initially reticent Greece has now given the green light for the operation, which could see NATO assets deployed in the Aegean in a mostly intelligence and reconnaissance role. Under the proposal, which would need to be approved by Alliance members, NATO maritime assets would provide information to national coastguards and the EU border agency Frontex to combat illegal smugglers using rickety boats to bring migrants to Europe. Turkey would then take back the refugees, as envisioned as part of a 3 billion-euro ($3.2 billion) EU-Turkey deal agreed to last year. According to German sources, the mission would not be similar to the NATO mission in the Mediterranean intercepting migrant boats making the dangerous run from Libya to Italy. However, NATO ships could intervene in emergency situations to save passengers. \"It is not NATO's remit to push back or stop refugee boats,\" the official told Reuters. The mission would use assets from the Alliance's standing naval group, a permanent reaction force deployed in the Mediterranean. The naval group's current flagship is the German combat support ship \"Bonn.\" Denmark has already said it would provide additional ships to the mission, according to the official. However, it is unclear whether NATO members will approve the mission which may fall outside the bounds of the Alliance's mandate. Complicating matters is a long-running maritime dispute between Greece and Turkey over sovereignty in the Aegean, where the two NATO members' jets regularly engage in dogfights. Turkey has taken in more than 2.5 million Syrian refugees, and is a major transit point for migrants from Asia and Africa. More than a million migrants and refugees reached Europe last year, many making the dangerous boat journey from Turkey to Greece by boat. So far this year, more than 340 have perished in the cold waters trying to reach Europe. cw/msh (AFP, dpa, Reuters)",
        "generated_story": "NATO's Standing Naval Group in the Aegean to combat illegal smugglers NATO's NATO-led alliance has deployed its largest naval force in Europe to fight illegal drug trade. The alliance is deploying three naval vessels to patrol the Mediterranean Sea. NATO member Turkey's defense minister, Ahmet Davutolgu, said on Thursday that it had deployed three ships to the area. \"We are going to be there for three days,\" he said, adding that the ships would be used to search for illegal migrants. Frontex, the European Union's border agency, is also deploying a naval ship to intercept illegal boats. It is expected to deploy around 3 billion-euro ($3.2 billion) this year, according to a statement from the alliance's head of naval operations in Bonn, Germany, which is part of the EU-Turkey alliance. In addition, it will also deploy a patrol ship and a helicopter to monitor the movement of migrants and refugees. According to an alliance statement, NATO will deploy three vessels, with the aim of intercepting illegal vessels and bringing them back to Turkey within a day or two. This will be followed by a deployment of two patrol boats and two helicopters, as well as an anti-subsidy patrol boat. Both ships are based in Germany and are equipped with a radar and radar system. They are also equipped to detect and detect illegal boat traffic, a NATO spokesman said. Germany's Bundesnaval Group (DFG) has also been deployed in Turkey, where it has been tasked with monitoring the flow of illegal drugs and weapons into the country. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she was \"very pleased\" that NATO was deploying its naval forces in Greece and Cyprus. But she also said it was not enough to stop illegal smuggling, saying it would not be possible to prevent it from spreading to other parts of Europe and the Middle East. For now, however, she said that Turkey would continue to cooperate with NATO in its efforts to tackle the smuggling of drugs, weapons and other illicit goods. (Reuters, AFP, dpa, Reuters, AP) The NATO alliance said the deployment was aimed at preventing the spread of illicit drugs into Europe, Africa and Asia, and to reduce the number of deaths and injuries that can be caused by drug trafficking. There were also reports that Turkish vessels were being used by smugglers to smuggle drugs across the Turkish border, but that they were not operating in a safe manner. At the same time, there was a lack of information on how to deal with smugglers, who were trying to get around the border. That was the main reason for the increase in smugglers' movements. On Thursday, Turkish officials said they had not been able to make contact with EU member states. However, they said there were no reports of any new arrivals from Turkey and that there had been no reported departures of Turkish nationals from Europe. Turkey has not made any arrests in recent days, despite the fact that its border crossing with Turkey was closed for several days. Last week, Ankara announced a new round of border checks with Germany. Ankara has denied any attempts to detain Turkish citizens in an attempt to gain access to EU territory. Turkish authorities have also denied that Ankara was involved in any smuggling operation, accusing Ankara of harboring drug traffickers. EU officials have said Ankara had no plans to take any further action against the smugglers. A spokesman for Germany told Reuters that \"we are not aware of this and we will not comment further on the matter at this time.\" The EU is currently negotiating with Ankara on a deal to limit the amount of money it can spend on border controls, although it is not clear how much money Ankara will receive from Ankara. Berlin has promised to increase its own border patrols, while Ankara is working on an agreement to ensure that all border crossings are closed to all EU citizens, including EU nationals, in order to avoid the risk of a border closure. European leaders have expressed concern about the possibility of an influx of refugees and migrants from Africa, Asia and Latin America. Merkel has called on Ankara to do so, though, that this is unlikely to happen before the end of next year. Meanwhile, Berlin is preparing to send a delegation to Berlin to discuss the issue of asylum seekers. Officials in Berlin have already announced plans for a meeting of EU members to meet with German officials in Brussels on Friday. Brussels has warned that Berlin could not meet its request for asylum requests. Moscow has already agreed to allow the migrants to travel to Europe in return for their asylum request. If Ankara does not cooperate, Brussels is likely to issue an ultimatum to Ankara over the next few months. Europe's EU partners are hoping for an extension of its cooperation with Berlin on this issue. Foreign ministers, meanwhile, have vowed to keep the situation under control of Turkey. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said he is ready to give Ankara a chance to secure the borders of European countries. He said last week that Europe will continue its support for Ankara's accession talks with Moscow and Beijing.

        "target": "Opinion: The pope's impossible mission in Mexico Pope Francis's trip to Mexico is a dangerous mission - a diplomatic as well as political balancing act, one that brings with it enormous expectations. Francis won't be able to meet them, says DW's Astrid Prange. Dead prisoners, disappearing students, refugees shot dead and murdered priests. Mexico has lived through one violent episode after the other. The mood in the nation is explosive. And now this: just a day before the pope is set to arrive, more than 50 people died in the largest prison revolt in the country's history. What meaning does the pope's presence hold on such an occasion? Only one thing is certain: Francis won't be able to resolve the problems of the world's second largest Catholic nation in just a five-day trip. The unrealistic demands placed on him are not something he can fill. Yet the pope carries with him an important message: you don't have to love your enemies but you do need to speak with them. And he's living the example himself by meeting with the Russian Orthodox Patriarch Kirill on a stopover in Cuba on his way to Mexico. Cuba all over again It's sensational! Bannings and mutual ex-communications are ancient history. Nearly a millennium after the split, the head of the Roman Catholic Church and the head of the Russian Orthodox Church are speaking to each other. It's not as if the two will become friends - their positions are far too different. Yet their centuries-old enmity feels out of place and in view of the massive worldwide persecution of Christians, almost unchristian. And both of these church leaders know this. In Mexico, efforts to stem the polarizing forces at play in society have not been successful. The extreme differences between rich and poor are dividing Mexican society. President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto has prioritized economic growth over dialogue with his critics - a group which includes students as well as teachers and union members who regularly protest against government policies. They demand an end to lawlessness and corruption. The presumed murder of 43 teaching students in Iguala in September 2014, a crime which remains unsolved, stands as a symbol of the lawlessness sweeping Mexico. The recent mutiny in a Monterrey jail serves as further proof of the country's shortcomings in regard to human rights and the rule of law. With a visit to Ciudad Juarez and the largest prison in Mexico, Francis will only make that deficiency more transparent. Even the pope of peace has enemies. The route he's chosen to take on his travels through the country has displeased the staunchly Catholic president. A meeting with the relatives of the Iguala victims is therefore hush-hush and participation in a holy mass remains secret. Considering the tense situation in the country, it's still possible that the pope's route will change once again. The church in the pillory Even within his own church, Francis has met with opposition. A meeting he requested with victims from the church's abuse scandal will not take place - a bitter disappointment for many former seminarians who were abused by Marcial Maciel, the founder of the Legion of Christ, and members of his order. It's just one example of how impunity continues even within the church itself. None of the perpetrators have yet to answer for their crimes in court. It appears as though the pope has accomplished more on the world stage than he has brought on reforms to the Vatican. Despite the revolutionary coming together of Cuba and the US and the revolutionary meeting with Patriarch Kirill, the revolution in Rome has yet to materialize. Do you have something to say? Add your comments below. The thread to this editorial closes in 24 hours.",
        "generated_story": "Pope's impossible mission in Mexico ends with a five-day trip to Iguala, Mexico Pope Francis has been unable to travel to Mexico for the first time since he was elected as president of the Roman Catholic Church in September 2014. The Vatican said the pope would not be able to reach the country's capital in the next five days due to a lack of funds. \"We are not going to give up on this mission,\" the Vatican spokesman Marcial Maciel told DW, adding that the pontiff would be \"trying to make the most of this opportunity.\" \"It is impossible for me to go to the capital,\" he said, referring to President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, who is currently in office as the head of Mexico's state-run state of Guerrero. He added that he hoped to meet with President Kirill and his wife, Astrid Prange, to discuss the future of his country. In the past, the two had been close to each other, but in recent years, they have become even closer. But in this case, their relationship has not been as close as it was in 2014, when Pope Benedict XVI visited the city in an attempt to get a better understanding of what it means to be a Christian. Francis, however, will not go far enough to convince the Mexican government to allow him to visit the state. Instead, he will be traveling to neighboring states, including Mexico City, where he is expected to spend a day with his family and friends before returning to his home country of Argentina. For now, though, Francis will stay in his native Mexico, which he has called home for more than a century. It is not clear how long the trip will last. On the other hand, it is likely to last for at least 24 hours, with the possibility of a return to Rome in a few days. That is, if he can get through the day without being forced to leave his office. If he doesn't, then he'll have to take a long, hard look at what he's doing. And he won't be the only one to do so. After all, there are many other countries in Latin America that have had similar problems. One of them is Chile, for example. Another is the United States of America (US), which has had a difficult relationship with Mexico since the end of World War I. This is a country that has suffered a lot of economic and political turmoil since that time, and that is why the current government of President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez is so desperate to find a way out of it. Many of these problems have been brought to light by the fact that there is no easy solution. There are a number of reasons why this is an impossible situation for Francis to avoid. First of all is that it's not easy for a pope to come to this country and then there's the question of whether or not he should be allowed to stay. Second is whether he wants to continue his mission. Last week, a Vatican official said that Francis' visit to Chile was a \"very difficult one\" for him, saying that his visit was \"not an easy one.\" The Pope's visit came after a series of events that took place in Chile and Argentina, in which the Chilean government was accused of trying to influence the outcome of an election campaign by a group of anti-gay activists. Some of those events, such as a referendum on the constitution of Chile's constitution, were not successful. Other countries, like Russia, have also accused the Pope of being too lenient in dealing with this issue. Others have accused him of not doing enough in order to protect the rights of minorities. However, this was not the case with Chile. Chile has also been criticized by some of its own bishops who have criticized the church for failing to provide adequate security for its members. Argentina is one of several countries where the Church has a strong presence, as well as in other Latin American countries. More recently, Argentina has accused Chile of meddling in elections and the US of attempting to interfere with elections in its electoral system. Mexico is also facing a similar situation. At the moment, Chile is facing an uphill battle to win a presidential election in 2018. President Nicolas Maduro has vowed to keep the government in power. According to an official statement, \"I hope that Mexico will continue to cooperate with us in our fight against corruption. I think that we will do everything we can to prevent this from happening.\" In a statement issued on Sunday, President Pe\u00f1 Nieto said he would welcome the visit of Chilean President Vladimir Putin. A spokesman for Chile called on Chile to step down from his post-election visit, calling for his removal from the presidency. Meanwhile, Russia has said it will try to ensure that Chile does not become a victim of corruption and abuse of power, according to Reuters.

President Obama vowed to nominate a successor 'in due time,' despite political opposition. The 79-year old justice died in his sleep, presumably of natural causes, local media reported on Saturday. Scalia was visiting Texas for a hunting trip, and his body was discovered after he failed to appear for breakfast in the resort where he was staying. US President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama extended \"their deepest condolences to Justice Scalia's family,\" White House deputy spokesman Eric Schultz said. Texas Governor Greg Abbott described the conservative justice as a \"man of God, a patriot and an unwavering defender of the written Constitution and the rule of law.\" \"He was the solid rock who turned away so many attempts to depart from and distort the Constitution. His fierce loyalty to the Constitution set an unmatched example, not just for judges and lawyers, but for all Americans,\" Abbot said. Battle for the empty seat His passing is likely to open a new political front between President Barack Obama and the Republican Party, as Scalia's replacement could shift the composition of the court towards a more liberal persuasion. Several Republican lawmakers have already urged Obama to leave the decision to the next president who will be voted in later this year. \"The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court justice,\" Senate Republican majority leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement, referring to the upcoming November general election. \"Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president,\" McConnell concluded. President Obama, however, said he would fulfill his constitutional duty and nominate Scalia's successor \"in due time.\" \"These are responsibilities I take seriously, and so should everyone. They are bigger than any one party,\" he said. Decades of controversy Scalia joined the Supreme Court in 1986, becoming the first Italian-American to serve in the top judicial body. He was nominated by US President Ronald Reagan. Throughout his long carrier, Scalia voted in favor of privacy and protecting defendants' rights, but also against legalizing abortion, same-sex marriage and gun control. He also drew public attention for his theatrical flair and sharpness of tongue, as well as his alleged unwillingness to compromise. In June last year, the nine-person Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage with a five-to-four vote. Scalia, who was in the minority, commented he would \"hide my head in a bag\" if his own name were associated with the decision. He also said that the majority opinion was \"couched in a style that is as pretentious as its content is egotistic.\" dj/jm (AP, Reuters, AFP, dpa)",
        "generated_story": "US Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia dies at 79-year-old age The death of a US justice of the highest court in the land has been confirmed by the US Senate, where Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky) and Democratic Senator Greg Abbott (D-Texas) are mourning the loss of one of their own. Scalia, who was 79, died in his sleep in a Texas hospital on Saturday. His body was found by his wife, Michelle Obama, at his home in Austin, Texas. The cause of his death is not yet known, but it is believed to be a heart attack, according to a statement from McConnell's office. \"We are deeply saddened by this tragic event,\" McConnell said, adding that he was \"deeply saddened\" by Scalia's death. McConnell, the Republican majority leader, said the death was a \"tremendous loss for our country.\" \"It is a sad day for all of us,\" he said. He added that \"we are very saddened to learn of this terrible tragedy.\" The Senate's conservative majority is expected to vote to confirm Scalia to the bench in November, when he died at the age of 79. It is unclear whether McConnell will be able to replace Scalia with a new justice, or whether he will have to wait until the next election to fill the vacancy. In the meantime, McConnell and Abbott will continue to work together to find a replacement for Scalia. They are also working on a plan to make it easier for the president to appoint a successor to Scalia who died last year at age 79 in an apparent suicide. Senate Republicans have called on McConnell to step down from his position as Senate majority whip. Democrats have also called for a special election next year to decide the fate of Scalia and replace him with an Italian-American justice. Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona, a close ally of President Barack Obama's, has said he would be willing to run for re-election if he were to win a seat on the high court. But the Senate is unlikely to take up the issue until after the November election, which is scheduled for mid-December. Republicans, meanwhile, have vowed to continue their efforts to protect the Constitution from further politicization. On Saturday, they announced that they would not be voting on whether or not to recall Scalia from the court, saying they wanted him to serve out his term as the justice's successor. Democratic Senate leader John Cornyn of Texas said they were \"very disappointed\" that Scalia had died suddenly, and that it was too late to overturn the constitutionality of its framers. John Boehner of Ohio, another Republican senator from Ohio and a former Obama ally, also said his party would seek to have Scalia replaced by a Democrat. Obama has also promised to seek a second term in office when the new president takes office in January. Abbot, however, did not rule out a possible run-off for his seat in Congress in 2020. (AP, AFP, dpa, Reuters) \"I think it's a good thing that we have the opportunity to do something about it,\" Abbott told reporters at a news conference in Houston, referring to his role as a Republican-controlled state Senate. Abbott, an Ohio Republican, was also in attendance, as well as Abbott's spokesman, Eric Schultz. Both Abbott and McConnell have said that the two men had been discussing the possibility of replacing Scalia in their party's future. A spokesman for McConnell told the Associated Press that McConnell was not aware of any plans for an election in which the former Justice Scalia would have been a candidate for president. However, Abbott said McConnell had \"no plans to announce his candidacy,\" adding, \"but we will do everything in our power to ensure that this is the right thing for him.\" Abbott is also a conservative Republican who has long been in favor of repealing the constitutional amendment that was passed in 1986 to repeal the 1986 Constitution. That would give him a chance to appeal to voters in states where he won't have a majority of votes. If he does not win, he is likely to face a tough reelection battle in 2018. There is no doubt that his successor, former President Ronald Reagan, will win the election. President Obama will also be the first Republican to hold the office of president in years to come. When Obama was elected in 2008, Obama campaigned heavily on his support of abortion rights. Since then, his campaign has focused on protecting the rights of women and minorities, including women, minorities and the elderly. Many of them have expressed concern about the lack of respect for women's rights, particularly women who have lost their right to speak out against abortion, abortion and contraception. This is an important step in that direction, given the fact that abortion is still illegal in many states. Abortion rights are a big part of American politics, especially in this country. And he's not the only one who thinks abortion should be allowed to become a federal law. Lawmakers in both houses of Congress have already voted to remove the ban on abortion. Congress must pass a law that would allow abortion restrictions on federal judges"

The 53-year-old will be leading Germany's second biggest lender. After successfully weathering the Great Recession, Commerzbank's board of directors appears to want to signal a continuation in its growth trend with Martin Zielke's appointment as the new CEO as of May 1. Outgoing head Martin Blessing announced last year he would not renew his contract. Zielke had previously been put in charge of implementing reforms in the company's private banking sector following the recession. His restructuring measures attracted 800,000 new customers to the bank and changed the image of the 146-year-old financial institution. The 53-year-old has an illustrious career across several German financial institutions to look back on, having started at the teller of a local branch in 1983. Zielke's crowning achievement The beleaguered German financial institution recorded a profit of more than a billion euros (more than $1.1 billion) last year. It was the first time in five years that Commerzbank had made such profitable gains, which it said would translate into paid dividends for shareholders. A good portion of the yields were achieved by a restructuring and expansion drive of Commerzbank's private banking arm under Zielke's leadership. However, some of that money will go to the German government, as it had to step in and rescue the bank in 2009 to the tune of 18 billion euros ($25 billion at the time) by chiefly acquiring more than 15 percent of the shares, effectively nationalizing part of Commerzbank's operations. ss/jlw (dpa, Reuters)",

He will take over the reins in May at the end of the five-year-old company's financial year, which starts May 1. The new CEO, Martin Blessing, will be the first person to hold the top job in the German lender's history, according to a Reuters report. \"He will have the responsibility of taking the company to the next level,\" said the report, citing a source familiar with the matter. It was not immediately clear who would take the job, but it is widely expected that he would be able to fill the position within a short period of time. According to Reuters, the CEO would have to step down in 2009, when the Great Recession began, and then in 2010, after a series of financial crises, a number of companies were forced to close their books. Zilke, 53, was appointed CEO in 1983. In 2009 he took over as CEO for a total of 18 billion euros ($25 billion) in losses and losses. His successor will then be named by the board of directors, who will also be responsible for the financial stability of all the companies he has led since the beginning of his career. A source close to him told Reuters that the appointment was \"not a surprise\" and that \"the company is not in a position to make a profit.\" \"It's a very difficult position,\" the source said, adding that it would not be difficult to find a successor who could be as successful as Zulke as he was in his early years as head of investment banking at Deutsche Bank (Deutsche Bank). \"We have a lot of work to do,\" he said at a news conference in Frankfurt, Germany, where he had been CEO since 1983, before he became CEO of Germany's largest bank, Deutsche Boerse (DB) from 1983 to 2009. At the time, it was the biggest bank in Germany and the world's second-largest bank by assets after Goldman Sachs (GS) and JPMorgan (JPM) combined. Now the bank is looking for new investors to invest in its future, as well as to create a new business model that will allow it to compete with rivals such as Citigroup (C), which is also the largest lender by market capitalization and which has a long history of lending to German banks. That's not to say it's an easy task, however, because the current CEO is already well-known for his ability to run a company that has long had a strong reputation for being a successful one-stop shop for investors. After all, he is the only one who has managed to turn around the fortunes of German banking in recent years and has done so well in many countries, including the United States, Europe and Japan. But he also has an impressive track record of success in Europe, particularly in financial markets. For example, in 2008, his bank was one of Europe's biggest lenders and a leading lender of foreign exchange to Germany. When he joined the banking giant in 1982, there was a huge financial crisis that led to an exodus of depositors from Germany to France and Italy. This was followed by a recession that left more than a million people out of their homes and businesses. Since then, many of them had to leave their jobs, leaving their families to fend for themselves and their children. Today, that's what has happened to many German companies. And that is exactly what is happening in this country. There is no doubt about it: the economy is going to continue to grow, even though the recession is still going on and there's no sign of an end to it. If the economic recovery is any indication of what will happen, this is a good thing for business. So far, so good news is that there are no signs of slowing down the pace of economic growth. What's the big question is how long it will last? What will it take to get to that point? The economy will grow again? In the long term, though, I think it won't be easy to predict what the future will look like. I don't think we'll see much of a turnaround. You can see that in terms of job creation, if you look at how fast things are coming along. We've already seen the effects of this, of course, from the fact that many companies are going through a difficult period in their history. Business is booming, too. Even if the stock market is doing well, you can't expect the same thing. As long as business is healthy, we're still in recession and people are working on the right direction. Just ask the people who have been in business for many years, or at least the jobs that are being created, they'll be working hard. How long can you expect to keep the business going? If you think about that? I'm not sure about the prospects of growth? Well, let's going forward"

        "target": "A quarter of deaths caused by environmental degradation, says UN A new United Nations report warns that pollution and global warming are causing millions more deaths than conflicts. The UN's environment agency has called for an urgent roll-back on harmful substances and fossil fuels. In its report \"Healthy Environment, Health People,\" the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), the World Health Organization and several other environment organizations said that, in 2012, an estimated 12.6 million deaths were attributable to deteriorating environment conditions. The largest numbers of deaths took place in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific regions, followed by sub-Saharan Africa, where around a quarter of deaths were likely caused byair pollution, chemicals, climate change and a lack of access to sanitation. \"By depleting the ecological infrastructure of our planet and increasing our pollution footprint, we incur an ever-growing cost in terms of human health and well-being,\" said UNEP Executive Director Achim Steiner. He added that humanity's life support systems had been compromised by globalization and powerful economic interests. The report was released during UN climate talks in the German city of Bonn which are drawing up rules pertaining to the Paris agreement, which seeks to lower carbon emissions. The document suggested that several drivers were responsible for the threat to human health, including ecosystem disruption, climate change, inequality, unhealthy and wasteful lifestyles, along with unsustainable consumption and production. Worsening effects UNEP estimated that an extra 250,000 deaths could occur each year between 2030 and 2050 as a result of climate change, leading to malnutrition, malaria, diarrhea and heat stress. Between them air pollution and a lack of access to clean water and sanitation cause almost 8 million premature deaths each year. Environmental impacts are responsible for the deaths of more than one quarter of all children under the age of five, the report states. UNEP called for governments to act to remove harmful substances from working environments, reduce the use of carbon fuels and rely instead on renewable energy, and change lifestyles to allow a more sustainable use of the world's resources. The report also called for a bigger investment to protect the planet's natural ecosystem. UNEP predicted a further increase in emerging zoonotic diseases (spread between animals and humans), and called on developing countries, in particular, to prioritize prevention methods. \"Never before have so many animals been kept by so many people - and never before have so many opportunities existed for pathogens to pass through the biophysical environment and wild animals to livestock and people,\" the report warned.",
        "generated_story": "Nearly a quarter of deaths due to environmental degradation, says UNEP Nearly one-quarter of the world's deaths related to climate change have been attributed to human-caused environmental pollution, the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) has said. The World Health Organization (WHO) said in a report that more than half of all deaths in the Western Pacific are linked to the effects of human activities on the environment. It said the number of people who die from climate-related diseases is at the highest level since the 1990s, and that the death toll is expected to rise to at least 10,000 by 2030. \"This is an alarming statistic,\" said Achim Steiner, director general for the organization's environmental protection program, which is based on a study published in 2012 by the UN's Environment Programme (EP). \"It is a very worrying statistic that almost one in five people die every year,\" he said, adding that it is \"not a good statistic to have in your lifetime.\" The report also said that about one third of those deaths were caused by human activity, such as deforestation, overfishing and over-polluting of crops and livestock. More than two-thirds of these deaths have occurred in Southeast Asia, according to a UN report. In addition, almost three-quarters of children die in this region, while half have died in other parts of Asia. This is the second-highest number since 2012, when the WHO said it was looking into the causes of global warming and the impact on people's health and well-being. Most of them are children under the age of five, but in some cases, they are still in their early thirties. That's because they live in an environment that is not conducive to healthy living. And that's not just because their parents don't want them to go to school. They also have to work hard to make ends meet. For example, in Indonesia, for instance, there are over 1,500 deaths a year. There are also over 2,300 deaths per year in Thailand alone, with the most recent figures from 2012 showing a rise of 1.5 per cent. These figures do not include the deaths of women, children and people with disabilities. But they do show that human health is still very much a priority in many countries, especially in developing countries like Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia, where human rights groups have called for an end to air pollution. What's more, many people are already suffering from respiratory diseases, including asthma, tuberculosis and malaria, as a result of exposure to toxic chemicals. How can we prevent this from happening? What are we doing to prevent it? How do we protect our children? We are working to improve the quality of life in our communities. We will do everything we can to ensure that we have a healthy, healthy environment, health-conscious and healthy society. So, we are going to try to do something about it. Let's start with what we already do, right now. I think it's important to start by looking at how we do that. If you are a child, you know what you're doing. You are doing something right. Do you want to be a parent? You know that you should be able to take care of your child. Don't you? Go ahead and take a look at what's happening to you.

Learn more about how you can help prevent the spread of diseases and reduce the risk of premature death and premature deaths from diseases like cancer, stroke and heart disease. Here are some tips on how to get there. First, let's talk about the health risks associated with pollution: The WHO recommends that people be aware of what is going on with their children. Then we will discuss the risks of drinking water and sanitation in schools and hospitals. Second, what are the best ways to address this problem? I would like to talk to your doctor about this, too, because we want you to understand that this is something that can be done, so you have the knowledge that there is no harm in doing that, OK? Let me tell you what I can do. Start by saying that I am a doctor and I'm a scientist, not a politician. Tell me about my family. OK, tell me what can I do?

Learn how the government is working on this issue. Or, do you think you've done something wrong? \"I'm not doing anything wrong.\" \"You can't do anything about pollution,\" says a WHO expert who has been working with children, who are living in China and Taiwan. Experts say that if you go ahead with this project, it will be the first step in reducing the amount of water pollution that could be taken out of China's environment and whether you will have access to health care.\" Ach"

        "target": "Opinion: Yet another crisis for Merkel A summery turquoise blazer and fresh makeup could not hide the fact that Angela Merkel was \"not amused.\" Now she is needed as a champion in the fight against populist forces, DW's Kay-Alexander Scholz writes. Britain-EU divorce proceedings will probably last about two years. Until then, the status quo must be maintained, German Chancellor Angela Merkel emphasized in her press statement. If she is no longer chancellor after the upcoming parliamentary elections in 2017, then others will have to live with the consequences of Brexit. But that is not what she is actually thinking. It is not coincidental that foreign ministers and government leaders are visiting Berlin in the coming days. They want to discuss how things will continue. Berlin, under Merkel's chancellorship, has become a center of power outside of Brussels. Difficult international politics The Brexit decision has disrupted Europe's equilibrium. Germany has lost an important ally on European issues related to economic growth and budgetary discipline. Now, France presumably will be the next to raise its voice against Maastricht Treaty criteria. If the Netherlands and Denmark also decide to leave the EU, Germany will become isolated, as Eastern Europe is not as tight with Germany as it once was. Poland now plays a key role for the Balkan nations and the Visegrad Group (Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic and Slovakia). And Poland is still annoyed about Merkel's refugee policy. What about Germany's populists? They're giddy with glee as they feel that their anti-establishment policies have been validated. They are teaching potential AfD (Alternative for Germany) voters a lesson: \"Here, have a look: it's possible. There is always an alternative. Vote for us!\" Those are exactly the words that protest voters want to hear. Germany's AfD has forged ties with other right-wing parties in Vienna, Paris, The Hague and London. They are all pursuing a \"European\" plan to gain power. The recent Austrian presidential election was significant, as the populist candidate lost by a very narrow margin; in fact, the final election results are still undecided as they are being contested. The Brexit vote was also triggered by populist powers. Domestically difficult Many populists believe that the stronger populism becomes - no matter where - the more advantages there would be for individual parties of their persuasion. Many would also like to see Donald Trump as US president. That is how AfD may become even stronger in Germany, which also means that political majorities would fluctuate even more. Will there be enough seats after the next election for a Christian Democrat and Green coalition, or will yet another grand coalition made up of Christian Democrats and Social Democrats be formed? Can Angela Merkel change course? Can she counter the trend with a new political model in Europe and Germany? Or do we stand on the edge of a new era, a \"political revolution,\" as the AfD calls it? Until now, Europe has survived attacks on its currency (euro crisis), the principle of peaceful coexistence (Crimea crisis) and its open borders policy (refugee crisis). Merkel deserves credit for defending these values, despite mistakes that have been made along the way. The outcome of the Brexit crisis is, however, still open. Have something to say? Add your comments below.",
        "generated_story": "AfD and the Brexit Crisis in Europe The AfD, the left-wing Alternative for Germany, is a far cry from the anti-immigrant party. It is an alternative to the Social Democrats (SPD) that has been in power for two years. The party's main opposition is the Christian Democrat (CDU) party, which has lost its majority in parliament in the last two elections. But it has also lost the support of many of its members, including Angela Merkel's conservative Christian Democrats, who have lost their parliamentary majority. In the coming days, they are expected to form a coalition government with the Greens and Greens. They are also likely to have a strong presence in government and parliament, as well as in a number of other political parties, such as the Green Party (Green), which is also in opposition to Merkel. \"We are not going to allow this to happen,\" Merkel told DW's Kay-Alexander Scholz in an interview published on Monday. She said that the party would not be able to win elections in Germany because of the lack of support from other parties and that it would be difficult to get a majority of voters to vote for it. However, she added that she was confident that \"we will win the election\" and would have the chance to make the right decision about the future of Europe. Merkel, however, has said she is not ready to give up on the idea of a \"grand coalition.\" \"I think we will have to wait and see what happens,\" she said, adding that her party was \"not ready for a grand coalition,\" which she described as \"the most extreme of all the parties in this country.\" She also called for the formation of an independent political party that would take over the leadership of Germany's ruling Social Democratic party (SDP) in 2017. Germany has a long history of liberal democracy, but it's not the first time that this has happened. For example, in 2015, Merkel was elected as chancellor of Bavaria, and in 2016 she won the most votes of any chancellor since the previous chancellor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der. Since then she has become the head of her own party and has campaigned on a platform of social democracy and social justice. On the other hand, her conservative Social Democrat party has suffered a setback in recent years when it was unable to secure a deal with Donald Trump's US-led European Union (EU) bloc. This year, it is Merkel who is in charge of forming a new government in Berlin. Her party is now facing a backlash from its own voters who want to see a more open and inclusive Germany. Many of them are disillusioned with Merkel and her government's policies on immigration, migration and other issues. Some are even calling for her to step down from her post as Chancellor. Others are calling on Merkel to take a hard line on migration, saying she should be allowed to leave the EU. And others, like the SPD, have been pushing for an EU-wide migration policy that will make it easier for migrants and refugees to move out of Eastern Europe and into the West. At the same time, there are concerns that Germany will be left without a stable, stable and prosperous future for refugees and migrants. That is, if the country's migration policies remain in place, that could be a problem for future generations of migrants, especially those who are fleeing the Middle East, Europe's poorest and most vulnerable regions. There are fears that migration will become a major challenge for Europe as a result of Brexit. So far, so good, indeed, this is what the German government is trying to do. What do you think? What are the chances of that happening? Is it possible? Do you have any idea what will happen? Or is it just a matter of time before we get to a point where we have an open Europe? If so, how will we find out? The question is whether or not we can get there? Merkel has already made it clear that we need to be careful about what we do in terms of how we approach migration. If that's the case, I think she's right. I don't know what she will do about it, because I'm not sure how she'll do that. We're not even sure what to think about that right now. How will she react to this? How can we make sure that Europe is stable? And what can she do? We'll see if she does that? She's already had a lot of good things to say, right? \"She's a very good person,\" said Kay Alexander Schollz, a German politician who works closely with her husband. He's also a member of parliament from a Christian Democratic Party that wants to change the way Europe looks at immigration policy? That's one thing that can be done? I'd like to talk to her about this, too? It's something that is very important for us to try and find a way to solve the migration crisis in our own country? You know the answer to that question. After all, we've already know that,"

The lockdown was lifted by President Obama, who was in the vicinity of the base when the incident took place, according to a statement released by the White House. Obama said he had been briefed on the situation and that the lockdown would be lifted \"as soon as possible.\" The president also said that he was \"very pleased\" with the response from the military. \"I am very pleased that we have been able to secure the area,\" Obama told reporters at a news conference in Washington, D.C. On Thursday, the Pentagon announced that it had lifted restrictions on military personnel leaving the site. Officials said they would not be allowed to leave the premises, but that they were working to ensure that no one was injured. In addition, they will not allow anyone to enter the facility at any time during the day, as they are required to do so at all times. According to the statement, Obama was briefed by Vice President Joe Biden and other senior military officials on what had taken place. It was not immediately clear how many people were injured, however, and it is not clear whether there were any other casualties. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack, which was reported at around 9 am local time (9 am ET). The military said it was conducting an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the shooting, with no further details being released at this time. At least one person has been taken into custody and is being held in police custody, officials said, adding that there is no indication of a possible terrorist attack. A military spokesman told the Washington Post that \"we are not aware of any such incident and we are very concerned about the safety of our troops and our personnel.\" Officials have not released the names of those who were involved in Thursday's incident, although they have said there was a \"strong possibility\" that an attack may have occurred. However, a number of people are believed to be in critical condition and are being treated for minor injuries, including a gunshot wound to their head. Police are searching for a suspect in connection with an incident that occurred on Wednesday, when a man opened fire on an Air Force One flight from Andrews to Washington. Authorities said the man was taken to hospital, where he later died, by air force helicopter. US media have reported that a military helicopter was flying over the scene and a bomb was found in a nearby field. Military officials have also been deployed to protect the air base from an unknown assailant who had entered the building. This is the second incident in less than a week, following a series of incidents in which a soldier was shot and killed by an unidentified assailant at an airfield near the British town of Fort Benning, Georgia, earlier this week. Several other soldiers were also injured in that incident as well as in other incidents. One of them was critically injured when he fell from a helicopter while attempting to land on a hillside, while another was wounded by a stray bullet. More than 100 others were wounded in this incident. That incident occurred shortly after noon Thursday when an officer fired a shot into a crowd of about 100 people, injuring two people in an apparent attempt to stop the gunman from entering the aircraft. No injuries were reported and no suspects have yet been identified, though the suspect has not been arrested. An investigation is ongoing and the FBI is investigating whether the shooter was responsible for any of these incidents and whether he has any knowledge of what happened, or if there are any possible motives for his actions, authorities said. Investigators are also looking into what may be the motive behind the assault. Reuters/Andrews News Agency/AFP/File/Reuters/file/jm/dpa (AFP, Reuters, AP, AFP)The military has announced the closure of military bases in Afghanistan, Afghanistan and Pakistan, saying it will continue to monitor the security situation. They are expected to continue their operations in Pakistan on Friday. Air force One is currently on standby to provide air support to troops stationed in Iraq. If necessary, there will be an evacuation of troops from Afghanistan.

NATO has also announced it has deployed troops to Pakistan's southernmost city of Mosul. President Donald Trump has ordered the deployment of US troops. He has promised to visit the country's airbase in retaliation. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said Thursday that US officials are still investigating the possible involvement of foreign forces. Secretary of State Joeb Biden has told Reuters he is \"notifying the president's decision. We are confident that this is an act of terrorism. I can't comment further on this matter.

The book is a collection of short stories, essays and essays about the life of a water drinker. It is written in German, English, French, Italian, German and Spanish and is available on Amazon.com and elsewhere. In addition, the book has been published in English and German by Klaus Stadeck, who is also the author of several other books on water and the environment. He has also published several books about water purification, including a series on how to use water to clean up the body of water. His latest book, \"Water purifying water,\" is set to be released in the fall. According to his website, it will be available to anyone who wants to buy water from a company that produces bottled water, but is not allowed to sell it to the public. \"It's not for me to tell you what to do,\" he said, adding that he was not aware of the fact that it was being sold to a private company and that there was no such thing as a \"free\" water source. However, he added that \"it's a good thing that we have a free water supply.\" He also said that the company is committed to making water safe for people who need it, not just for those who don't want to drink it. For example, if you are a person who doesn't drink water at all, you will not be able to get it out of your system. You will have to pay for it yourself. That's why I have chosen to publish this book. I think it's the best thing I've ever done for myself and for the people around me. And I'm very happy with the results. There is no doubt that I am a very good writer, and I would like to continue to write about this subject for a long time. But I also think there is something more to it than that. If you have not read the books, I highly recommend you read them, because they are very interesting. They are not only interesting to read, they're also very entertaining to listen to. One of my favorite things about them is that they make you feel like you're part of something bigger than you really are. When I was a kid I used to work at a school in Germany. Now I work in a small town in northern Germany, where you can get a taste of everything that's going on around you. So I write a lot of things that are different than what you would expect from me, which is to say that this is the first book I ever read. This book was written by a man who was born and raised in an environment where the water is safe and clean. What I learned was that you had to make a decision based on your own experiences and experiences, rather than the opinions of other people, that is what I wanted to share with you, so I decided to give it a try and get to know you as well as I can. We're not going to waste any more time on this topic. Let's talk about it in terms of what we've learned from our own experience as an artist and publisher. Here's how I came up with that book and how it came about: I wrote it and then I put it together and published it on my own. Then I went to Germany and got a copy of it at the end of last year's edition of The New York Times and it became a huge success. Since then, there's been a tremendous amount of interest in it because I thought it would be a really good idea to have something like this in my home town of Hamburg, Germany.\" \"I'm a great writer and editor and author,\" I told the magazine's editorial team. 'I think I know what it means to me.\" The title refers to an author who has worked in this field for more than a decade and a half and has written a number of books and articles on a wide range of topics, such as water conservation and environmental issues.

It was the second time in two weeks that the media had reported a killing of a woman this way - the first being the murder of Pakistani social media star Qandeel Baloch. There are strong similarities between the cases. Both were murdered in places where they would have felt they were at their safest - in their family homes. It's likely they knew their killers - in Baloch's case, her brother has admitted to strangling her, and Shahid's father and cousin have already been questioned. And as more reports emerge about Shahid's death, it's clear that both were killed because they didn't behave in a way deemed acceptable in a conservative, patriarchal society. 'Deeply offensive' term The debate around terminology in \"honor killings\" isn't new, and after Baloch's murder there were members of the media - such as ABC Australia journalist Juanita Phillips - who decided against using the term, calling it \"deeply offensive\" and referring to it as a \"family killing\" instead. And there are outlets, like the Guardian, that already use inverted commas with the word honor. But some commentators argue that more needs to happen if media consumers are to gain a better understanding of the problem. \"I think an important step for the media would be to refuse to give weight to the term 'honor crimes,'\" said UK-based freelance journalist Shehnaz Khan. \"While it is imperative to highlight that these crimes and murders stem from the roots of misogyny and therefore a false sense of 'honor,' there is absolutely nothing but'shame' within them, as murder is nothing but dishonorable.\" \"The word 'honor' can sometimes carry an almost positive connotation that we are inclined to automatically accept just because it's not happening to us, when the reality is, this a huge problem affecting thousands of girls and women across the world,\" she added. Naming the issue But this isn't a view shared by all journalists. Ruby Hamad, a writer at Australia's Daily Life newspaper, said that the first step in dealing with the issue is naming it. \"There are some deeply patriarchal societies that still limit women's freedom according to old tribal concepts of honor, where, unfairly, the behavior of women reflect on their entire family,\" Hamad said. \"By naming these 'honor killings,' we are acknowledging the role that this misogynistic concept of honor plays, not only in the murders themselves but in these entire societies, and how it entraps both men and women.\" Through the eyes of the perpetrator? There are other issues with the term though. Some have argued that by framing it as such, media outlets are showing the crime through the eyes of the perpetrator - and not through the victim - as they should. And with such cases regularly hitting the headlines, framing is important. The United Nations estimates that around 5,000 women - predominantly from Asia and the Middle East - are killed annually in honor-related crimes, a figure that women's advocacy groups say is closer to 20,000 worldwide. This raises an important cultural element for the media to consider - how far does the term play into cultural stereotypes? \"When honor is considered the most important thing in life, then all family members become expendable,\" Hamad said. \"The collective outweighs the rights of the individual. Does this feed into cultural stereotypes? Perhaps. But that doesn't mean we should pretend that this cultural context isn't there.\" Looking for answers - and alternatives There have been many alternatives put forward by women's advocacy groups, including hate crime, misogynistic murder, femicide and shame killings. But which one should we pick? Al Jazeera for one has decided which one they won't use. \"We are always updating our style guidelines to convey a deeper and more authentic understanding of world affairs. Recent events in Pakistan ignited a healthy debate in Al Jazeera on the term 'honor killings' in particular. Our editors are currently studying alternatives to the term, but'misogynistic murder' is not one of them,\" said an Al Jazeera spokesperson. Terminology in the media matters, and for murders as complex as these, it's the media's responsibility to find a name that better fits the crime. Only then will it become easier to work towards a solution.",
        "generated_story": "Rethinking Honor Killings: A Cultural Perspective The United Nations has released a report on the death penalty in the Middle East. The report, published in The Guardian, calls for an end to the practice of double-handed killing of civilians. It is the first report to be published by the UN since the end of July, and it is based on an analysis of the deaths of more than 2,000 people in Iraq and Syria over the past two weeks. This report is part of an ongoing review of human rights in Asia, which is being conducted by a group of researchers at the University of Western Australia (U.N.) and the Australian government. \"We are looking at how we can change the way we kill people,\" said Samia Shahid, a researcher at U.S.-based Al Jazeera. Shehnaz Khan, who is also a journalist, said the report was \"a very important piece of information for us to understand.\" \"It is important that we have a clear understanding of what is going on in our country,\" she said, adding that it was a \"very important point\" for her to have been able to share her experiences with the world. In addition, she added that she was grateful for the support of her family, friends and colleagues who had supported her in her struggle to end her own life. According to her, \"I am grateful to my family and friends who have supported me in my struggle for my life and my freedom.\" She said she had also been in contact with a number of people who were killed in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Egypt and elsewhere. Her husband was killed during the Syrian civil war in 2011, when he was in his 20s. He died in a car bomb attack in Aleppo, Syria in 2014. His body was later found buried under the rubble of a destroyed house in Damascus, the United States capital of Damascus. Author: Gouri Sharma/AFP/Getty Images The UN has also published an article calling for a revision of international law to address the issue of death sentences for people convicted of crimes against humanity, including murder, attempted murder and attempted rape. A report from the International Criminal Court (ICC) found that the commission of inquiry into the killings had found no link between the two crimes and that they had been committed in an attempt to protect the lives of innocent people. However, it did not rule out the possibility that these killings could be linked to other crimes, such as the murder of children, or the torture of women and girls. That is, if the investigation is carried out in any way at all. There is no evidence to support the findings of this report. But it does suggest that there is a lack of evidence that such killings have occurred in other parts of Asia. For example, in China, there are many cases where the perpetrators of child rape and sexual abuse were convicted and sentenced to life in prison for life without parole. These cases are being investigated by an international court, but there has been no finding of guilt or innocence in this case, according to a statement from a senior UN official. One of these cases, however, was the case in which a woman was convicted for killing a child and was sentenced in absentia to death for rape, torture and murder. Another case was brought to court in Australia, where a jury convicted a man of rape for his role as an accessory to an act of terrorism. As a result of that conviction, an investigation was launched into whether the perpetrator had committed a crime against his family or his country and whether he had acted in self-defence. At the time of his arrest, police were still investigating the incident. Police were also searching for him and his wife, Juanita Phillips, at a news conference in Sydney in July. They also said they were looking for evidence of possible links between his alleged involvement in these murders, as well as a possible motive behind the murders. Investigators are also looking into possible motives for their arrest. And they are currently investigating whether there were any links to any possible connection between these crimes. Meanwhile, some of them are still being tried in court. If the allegations are true, they will be prosecuted under a court-martial. Prosecutors are expected to file a criminal case against the accused and will seek to extradite him to Australia. Authorities have not ruled out any charges against him in relation to his death, though the prosecution is still pending. What is clear is that he has not been charged with any crime. When the trial is over, he will face a maximum sentence of 10 years in jail and could face up to 20 years behind bars. We are hoping to find out more about what happened to him. I am hopeful that this will not be a case of mistaken arrest and if he is extradited to Hong Kong to face the charges. (Reuters, AFP/Reuters) The BBC reported on Wednesday that police had not found any suspects in connection with his case. Reuters reported that investigators have already begun their investigation, saying they have yet to make a final decision on whether or not yet."

        "target": "A Brief History of the Seaside Holiday These days, millions take seaside holidays for granted as one of life's pleasures. But 200 years ago, a dip in the sea was more a test of courage. Hardly anyone could swim. As late as the 18th century, many Europeans still thought of the sea as the realm of Satan: storm-tossed and inhabited by terrifying monsters. \"Unlike the mountains, the coasts were terra incognita as a holiday spot,\" says Manfred B\u00e4tje, director of the Bade-Museum on the North Sea island of Norderney. Anyone who set foot in the water was \"stepping into the unknown\". Brighton showed the way That only began to change after the British aristocracy discovered the healing power of salt water. As early as 1780, Brighton, England's biggest and oldest seaside resort, was a bustling spa. Philosopher and physicist Georg Christoph Lichtenberg (1742-1799) of G\u00f6ttingen gave Germans the starting signal with his 1793 essay \"Why doesn't Germany have any large public seaside resorts?\" In it, he called for the creation of a resort in Cuxhaven on the North Sea. He received support from the most notable German physician of the time, the Prussian king's court physician, Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland. But things turned out somewhat differently. Germany's first seaside resort was indeed built in September, 1793, but in Heiligendamm on the Baltic Sea. Four years later, permission was granted for construction of Germany's first resort on the North Sea, on Norderney. \"For the first bathing season on July and August of 1800, only around 250 guests turned up. Now, the nearly 6000 residents host a good 530,000 bathers annually, plus around 230,000 day-trippers,\" B\u00e4tje reels off the figures. Romanticist inspiration In the 19th century, the landscapes of Caspar David Friedrich, such as his famous Chalk Cliffs on R\u00fcgen (1818), gave seaside holidays added impetus. From then on, the sea was no longer a voracious beast. From the shore, the cultivated, modern European contemplated the vast melancholy of the deep. \"The calm sea became an embodiment of unspecified yearning, the waves an expression of vitality and dynamism,\" soliloquizes museum director B\u00e4tje. But the journey to the sea long remained an arduous, time-consuming one. It took the mail coach a good thirty hours to cover the distance from Hamburg to the North Frisian town of Aurich over bumpy, muddy roads. The express cab from Bremen only took about 16 hours to reach the East Frisian town of Norden - including six changes of horses along the way. \"It wasn't comfortable,\" explains B\u00e4tje. Not until the introduction of seaside tourist steamers out of Hamburg and Bremen to the islands and the expansion of the railways did the journey become easier. Strict bathing rules At first, it was primarily the well-to-do bourgeois and nobility who were able to afford a seaside holiday. Victorian-era society is known for its extreme prudishness, and the beach was not exempt. Bathing machines were essentially changing cabins on wheels that could be rolled into the surf. The sexes were kept strictly separated. Wet swimsuits could not be allowed to cling, thus revealing the body's contours. Women sported baggy flannel garments with bloomers underneath that swiftly became waterlogged to where the bather was risking her life. Hardly anyone really knew how to swim anyway. \"Most bathers wouldn't stay in the water any more than two minutes, often just seconds at a time. The English had a rule: 'Three dips and out',\" quips archivist Manfred B\u00e4tje, whose Bade-Museum is housed in a building for a former wave pool, just a few steps from Norderney's Weststrand, where, during the summer months, vacationers sunbathe in wicker beach chairs and on blankets, cooled by a salty sea breeze. Sunbathing first came in style early in the 20th century, and the first true swimsuits were produced in the United States. \"Starting in 1919, today's bathing culture gradually began to take shape,\" B\u00e4tje looks back. At the same time, ideals of beauty were in flux - such as the attitude towards tan skin, which had long been regarded as a mark of farmers and manual laborers. B\u00e4tje: \"People were still cultivating their genteel pallors.\" Water, Waves, Wellness Today, the sun worshipers are the devout masses, and seaside holidays are their pilgrimages. The North Sea resorts alone count some 12.9 million overnight stays annually. Health is once again a primary concern: sea air, sea water, sea salts and the algaes and mud used in",
        "generated_story": "A Brief History of the Seaside Holiday in Germany A brief history of Germany's seaside holiday in the 19th century. The Bade-Museum in B\u00e4tje, Weststrand and the Baltic Sea are among the most visited places on the planet. It is the only place in Europe where the sea is free to roam. In 1793, the ship Chalk Cliffs visited the North Sea for the first time in more than 200 years. During the summer months of 1818 and 1819, it was a popular summer holiday, with many tourists visiting the coast to enjoy the spectacular scenery. However, many of them were not able to make it to the beach because of poor weather conditions. They were unable to get there in time, so they had to return to their homes, where they would have to wait for a boat to reach them. This was the beginning of a long and arduous journey for many Germans, who had come to Germany in 1792 to escape the harsh winter months. But the journey was not without its challenges. For example, there were a number of people who were forced to leave their houses in order to go to sea. Many of these people had no choice but to stay in their own homes. There was also a shortage of food and a lack of water. That was one reason why many German tourists left the country. And that was because they didn't want to spend time with their families, friends, relatives or relatives. So they decided to travel to other parts of Europe and spend a good thirty-six hours on their holiday. These days, however, they are not as popular as they used to be, and they don't have the luxury of staying in a hotel or a restaurant, or even a small restaurant. Some of those who did stay stayed in hotels and restaurants. Others stayed at their parents' home, which is where most of their children were born. Other German vacationers stayed with relatives and friends in other countries, such as the Netherlands, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece and Spain. Germany is one of many countries in which the German state of Saxony is a major tourist destination, but it is also one that has a reputation for being a tourist hotspot. As early as 1790, a group of young men from the East Frisian village of Badesdorf, near the city of Wiesbaden, had a great time. After the 18th-century German reunification, people began to come together to celebrate the birth of Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland as a father and grandfather. At the time of his death, his son, Caspar David Friedrich, was still living in his home town of Kiel. He died in 1817. His wife, Maria, took his place. When he died, he left his wife and two children to live with his parents in Berlin. Since then he has lived with them for over a year. \"I have lived here since I was about ten years old,\" he said, adding that he was \"very happy to see my wife again.\" In the early 1900s, German historians had begun to draw parallels between the past and present. Now they have a better understanding of what it means to have been a European nation and what the future holds for German culture and history. Today, this is still the case in many ways, especially when it comes to German society. German intellectuals, historians and historians have long been fascinated by the region's rich history and its rich cultural heritage. One such history is that of German-born German poet and novelist, Georg Christophile Lichtenberg, author of \"The Great German Novel\" (1818-1918), who wrote a book about his experiences as an author and journalist. A series of books on German history, including the \"Great American Novel,\" was published in German in 1918. More than 100 years later, in 1919, Lagerfeld's book was translated into English and became a bestseller, as well as in English, French and German. According to his book, \"It's a wonderful book.\" The book is based on his life and travels, written and illustrated by his father, Dieter Sell, an English-language journalist and author who was born and raised in Hamburg and who is now a professor of history at the University of Hamburg. Its author has written several books about German literature and literature. Among the books he wrote: \"There are a lot of interesting things that have happened to me. I am a German who grew up in this country and I have always wanted to write about it in my own language. My father's father was an avid Germanophile and my mother's mother was German born in Dresden. She died of tuberculosis when she was just a young girl. Her father died when her mother died and was buried in her hometown of Stuttgart. Later in life, she wrote that she and her father were married to a man she met while studying at a university in England. Both of her parents died while she lived in London."

        "generated_story": "Irish Olympic hopeful Patrick Hickey freed on bail in Rio Olympic bid Ireland's 71-year-old Olympic athlete has been released from jail after being freed from custody in the Rio de Janeiro Olympics, the European Olympic Council of Ireland (EOC) has announced. The former Olympic champion, who won a gold medal at the 2012 London Games, is due back in court on 10 August to face charges of fraud, corruption and money laundering. He was freed after a three-month jail sentence for fraud. \"I am very happy that I have been freed,\" he told reporters on Monday, adding that he hoped to return to Ireland by the end of the Olympics in 2020. In the meantime, he will be allowed to travel to the United States, where he hopes to compete for the first time in his life. His release comes just three months after he was arrested in Dublin on suspicion of bribery, fraud and other charges related to his involvement in a failed bid to win an Olympic medal in Tokyo in 2012. Ireland is one of eight countries that have failed to qualify for next year's Olympics. A total of 1.5 million euros ($1.6 million) was seized from him on the day of his arrest, according to a statement from the EOC. Irish Olympic Committee president Juliana Leal de Melo said he had been granted bail by an appeals court in Ireland, which he said was the result of an appeal by a court of appeal against the conviction of a man who had tried to bribe a judge to release him in absentia. Prosecutors said the man, 71, of Dublin, had not been convicted of any crime and was not charged with any crimes. But they added that the case against him was \"a case of mistaken identity\" and that it was unlikely he would be able to appeal the ruling. According to Reuters news agency, \"the case is being investigated as a matter of course, but it is not yet clear whether he has committed a crime.\" The case was brought by prosecutors in connection with the 2016 Tokyo Olympics and is expected to go to trial in September. It is unclear whether the court will rule on whether or not he is guilty of all charges, or if he should be sentenced to life in prison for his alleged role in an attempt to influence the Olympic committee's decision to extradite him from Ireland to Germany. After his release, Ireland will have to decide whether to send him back to Dublin for a second time, and whether it will allow him to attend the 2020 Olympic Games in South Africa. If he does not, it could be a long time before he can be extradited to Europe. There is no way to know for sure, however, if the trial will take place before then, because the prosecution is unlikely to be successful. At the moment, there is a lot of speculation about the future of Olympic sports in Europe, including the possibility that Ireland could become the host nation for 2020, when it hosts the Tokyo Games. However, a number of other countries have already announced that they will host the next edition of Tokyo's Olympic games in 2022. Many of those countries are already holding their own Olympic events, such as the 2014 and 2016 editions, while others have announced they won't be held at all. For now, all eyes are on Ireland. Dublin is the only country that has yet to host a major international sporting event in which Ireland has not hosted an Olympics since the 1980s. That's because it has never hosted a world-record-breaking event, with only two major sporting events being held in its history. Olympic organizers have said they hope to hold a similar event at a later date, as well as at least one other Olympic venue, Tokyo, in 2021. They have not ruled out a possible host city, though, they are not ruling out the idea that Dublin could host an international event. This is something that could happen at any point in time. And that's not an option for Ireland at this point, given the current political situation in terms of political and economic conditions. As a result, I think it's a good idea to try to find a solution to this problem before it becomes too big a problem. I'm not sure what will happen. What do you think? Do you have any idea what the outcome of this case might be? I'd like to hear from you? Let me know in my own words. Let's hope that we can find out. You know what you want to do? Read more: Ireland wants to make sure you don't miss out on Rio. Here's what we've learned so far, here's how to prepare for Tokyo. We're hoping to have a better chance of winning the 2024 Games and then we'll have the chance to see what happens next. 'The Olympics are a very important event for us,' said a spokesman for Dublin's mayor, Julian Leals deMelo. She said she's hopeful the country will hold its own Olympics at some point this year, saying that a new Olympic event is still a possibility. So, let's hoping for Rio"

Since taking office in 2005, however, Merkel has also been praised for navigating Europe's largest economy through the financial and eurozone crises. According to an Emnid survey published in the German newspaper \"Bild am Sonntag\" 55 percent of Germans are in favor of Merkel remaining head of the German government for another four years. Thirty-nine percent said they were against her re-election. Sign of stability Should she be elected next September, another full four-year term would put Merkel on a par with her mentor Helmut Kohl who set the post-war record and presided over the Fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. In light of the UK's shock vote to leave the European Union in June and Donald Trump's election last week as US president, Merkel's re-election is likely to be welcomed in many capitals as a sign of stability. During his final visit to Berlin this week, US President Barack Obama said that if he were able to, he would vote for his longtime partner and friend. In an interview with German magazine \"Spiegel\" and broadcaster \"ARD,\" Obama said: \"She has great credibility, and she is willing to fight for those values in a way that is very, very important.\" \"I'm glad that she's there and I think the German people should appreciate her. Certainly, I've appreciated her as a partner.\" Winning back votes With the less that a year until Germany heads to the polls, Merkel's CDU is now turning its efforts to wooing back disenchanted voters who have left the conservative camp to support the right-wing populists, Alternative for Germany (AfD). Formed as a Euro-sceptic party in 2013, the AfD won 4.7 percent of the popular vote in the last federal elections in 2013, just falling short of the 5 percent threshold required to enter the Bundestag - Germany's lower house of parliament. After benefiting from the rise in europsceptic, anti-immigration sentiment, seemingly sweeping across western Europe, the party now holds seats in nine of Germany's 16 states.",
        "generated_story": "Merkel's re-election bid comes amid growing populist sentiment in Germany Chancellor Angela Merkel's bid for a fourth four-year term in office has been met with growing anti-immigrant sentiment across the country. The CDU and the Social Democratic Party (SPD) are the two main parties vying for the next four years of the German federal parliament. Merkel, who was elected as chancellor in 2005, faces a tough task in her bid to stay in power for four more years. She faces an uphill battle to win a second term as Chancellor of Germany, whose conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) have struggled to gain traction in recent months. In the past, Merkel has faced criticism over her handling of a number of domestic issues, including the rise of populism. But she is also facing a backlash from her own party, the right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD), which is seen as a far-right alternative to her conservative coalition partner Merkel. \"I don't think I can win,\" Merkel said in an interview with German newspaper Bild am Sonntag on Sunday, adding that she was \"not going to be able to do anything about it.\" The AfD, which was founded in the 1990s, is now the largest party in parliament, with a majority of more than 80 percent of seats. It is the second-largest party after the conservative Social Democrats, but it has lost the support of many of its own voters, according to a poll published Sunday by the newspaper Der Spiegel. Germany's Social Democrat party (SDF) is expected to lose its parliamentary majority this year, while the Greens, a left-leaning bloc, has a slim chance of winning a third term. Chancellor Merkel is seeking to strengthen her grip on power in a country that has suffered a string of economic and political crises since the fall of communism in 1989, when the Berlin Wall fell on the eastern German city of Duesseldorf. German Chancellor Helmut Kohl (pictured) and SPD leader Emnid Schr\u00f6der (left) were among the first to congratulate Merkel on her election victory. (AP, AFP, dpa) Merkel was also due to take the oath of office at the end of her first term on Monday, after which she would have to step down as head of state. Her predecessor, Gerhard Schroeder, was sworn in as prime minister in June. After Merkel won the election, she faced a difficult task of trying to convince voters to accept her government as the new leader of Europe's largest democracy. That task, however, did not come easy for Merkel and her party. On the other hand, it was Merkel who won a landslide victory over the SPD in 2013, despite the fact that the party had been unable to form a coalition government for nearly a year and a half. Since then, Germany has seen a rise in antiestablishment sentiment, as well as an influx of migrants and refugees from other European countries who have fled to the United States to seek refuge in Europe. This week, German media reported that Merkel would be sworn into office by her husband, former finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, on July 1, 2013. According to German daily Spiegel, \"She will not be allowed to run again until after her term ends.\" She will be replaced by a new cabinet member, and she will also be given the chance to make up for lost votes in 2014 and 2015. If she does not get elected, her chances of becoming chancellor will depend on how she manages to keep her position in government. For now, there is little chance she can do that, though she has made it clear she won't be the only one who is willing to give up her seat. A new coalition of parties is being formed to try to replace Merkel with an independent chancellor. And that's not just because she doesn't have the votes to change her mind. There are also a lot of people who want to see her succeed, such as former President George W. Bush and former US President Barack Obama. Many of them are young, educated and working-class Germans who grew up in rural areas of eastern Germany. Some of these people are now in their early 20s. They have become disillusioned with the current political climate and are looking for ways to get out of their homes and into the political system. One of those is Merkel herself. Another is her younger sister, Emnaid, an outspoken critic of President Donald Trump's policies on immigration, immigration and other issues that have been a source of frustration for many Germans for decades. Last year she campaigned on a promise to end the \"war on migration\" in order to avoid a repeat of what happened in 1990. However, that is unlikely to happen again in 2017, since she's a member of parliament from the center-left Christian Democrat bloc. Both parties have a long-term vision for Europe, even if it means she'll be forced to leave the Bundestag for good, given that it's still a minority government in Berlin, where she still has the power to decide what she wants to continue to"

        "target": "France's conservatives: Combating the National Front with a swing to the right A staunch conservative is joining the race for the French presidency. Republican candidate Francois Fillon could turn into a big problem for right-wing extremist Marine Le Pen's National Front. France's Republicans are moving to the right: by choosing Francois Fillon, voters nominated a presidential candidate who has a reputation as a staunch conservative. The former prime minister has already announced that he intends to refocus politics with the traditional family in mind. Fillon takes a dim view of homosexual couples adopting children. He wants to introduce a cap on the number of refugees allowed into France, he intends to make it harder for foreign nationals to access the social welfare system, and he wants to put Muslim communities and mosques under government control. In addition, Fillon advocates a renationalization of school curricula. Fillon makes gains in FN territory Fillon's agenda could turn out to be a problem for the \"National Front\" (FN). The 62-year-old appeals to similar sentiments as the right-wing party's base: concern about foreign domination and loss of identity, fear of terrorism and crime. \"For a long time, FN was the only political force that addressed those fears,\" said Henrik Uterwedde of the German-French Institute (dfi) in Ludwigsburg. \"Now a politician has arrived on the scene who addresses those fears using a different language and makes them a political offer.\" In rural, Catholic France especially, where traditions still matter a great deal, the avowed Catholic Fillon strikes a chord with his proposals pertaining to family and society policies. He receives support from traditional Catholic groups who, for years, have been able to mobilize crowds for demonstrations against gay marriage. During the intraparty election campaign, Fillon predominantly traveled to France's villages and small towns - regions which FN leader Marine Le Pen had labeled the \"forgotten France,\" regarding herself as their foremost lobbyist. \"Fillon has made gains in an environment that is also canvassed by Le Pen,\" Andreas Jung, Chairman of the Bundestag's German-French parliamentary group, told German broadcaster rbb-Inforadio. \"He does not represent the lofty levels of Parisian politics, but rather provincial entrenchment. Fillon is committed to traditional values, like the family. Therefore, he may not only be capable of defeating Le Pen, but also of taking the lead during the first ballot.\" 'Most dangerous candidate for FN' Consequently, the FN camp is less than enthusiastic about the conservative's candidacy. \"Because of Fillon, we now have a strategy problem,\" Marion Marechal Le Pen, the FN leader's niece, recently told journalists. \"He is the most dangerous candidate for the National Front.\" Pollsters' findings appear to support that statement. Recent surveys establish Fillon as the current favorite in the French presidential election scheduled for next May. However, Fillon's election is not a foregone conclusion. By denouncing the conservative candidate as a member of the establishment, FN tries to win over those who are frustrated with politics and politicians in general. There is persistent opposition against his economic-liberal plans in particular. Fillon wants to abolish the 35-hour working week and raise the retirement age to 65 years. In addition, he wants to cut 500,000 jobs in the public sector and reform industrial law. Fillon is known as an admirer of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. \"Issues pertaining to liberal economic policy have always been heavily contested in France,\" said Uterwedde. \"Fillon's adversaries have already taken up their positions, criticizing what, in France, is called 'ultra-liberalism.'\" That was one of the nastiest words in French politics, he added. An offer for the left Fillon wants to raise VAT by 2 percent. This would predominantly hurt low-income households. Exactly that clientele, however, is wooed by FN with a program that is regarded as rather left-wing. The right-wing extremists are on a clear anti-globalization course, intending to seal off the French economy against foreign countries and exit from the European Union. The party is already trying to present Fillon as a symbol of anarchic, ultra-liberal capitalism. \"Francois Fillon will even go beyond EU demands for austerity and liberalism,\" David Rachline, Marine Le Pen's election campaign manager, wrote on Twitter. According to current polls, it is very likely that Fillon will have to face Marine Le Pen in a runoff election in May. The main hazard for the Republican candidate: his economic-liberal course could deter left-wing voters from choosing the conservative in order to avert Le Pen. \"Francois Fillon will have to start making offers, also to those voters who are closer to the center and more moderate,\" said France expert Uterwedde. \"And he will, prior to the runoff election at the latest, have to make offers to left-wing voters - without changing his original course.\"",
        "generated_story": "French presidential candidate Francois Fillon is the most dangerous candidate for the French presidential election, according to the German-French Institute of Political Economy (Rbb-Inforadio) The \"National Front\" candidate has the highest chance of becoming the next president of the European Union (EU) in a long-term presidential race. The right-wing National Front (FN) candidate is a far cry from the far-right candidate Marine Le Pen, who has been in the lead for years. But the \"national front\" is also far more dangerous than the left-leaning opposition, which has long campaigned for a more moderate candidate. \"It's a very dangerous party,\" said Uterwedde, a professor of political science at the University of Leipzig in Germany. He added that the party's candidate would be a \"very dangerous one\" and that he would have to be careful about what he said and did not say. In the end, he added, \"I don't think it's the right thing to say, but I think we should be very careful what we say and do.\" \"We have a lot of people who are very, very worried about the future of this country,\" he told Rbb Inforademio, adding that \"we are not going to allow this to happen again.\" He also said that if he were to win the presidency, it would not be possible for him to run as a candidate who was not a member of parliament for 65 years and who had no experience in politics at all. If he was to become president in May, his chances of winning the election would likely be much higher than they currently are. And that's not just because he has no political experience. It's also because of his lack of experience with politics, and the fact that his father was a Catholic and his mother was also a Roman Catholic. His father had been a priest for more than 70 years before he became a Christian and had served as the head of a church in his home town of Strasbourg, France, where he grew up. For his part, the former prime minister of France was the first person to have been born in France and has had a family of four children. That's why he is considered one of Europe's most important political figures. At the same time, there are a number of other candidates who have had the misfortune of being born and raised in French-speaking countries. One of them is Francois \"Fillon,\" who is currently the country's youngest and most powerful politician. Another is Marion Marechal-Le Pen (pictured above), a former student of Margaret Thatcher. She is an outspoken critic of French Prime Minister Manuel Valls (left) and her father, Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon (right). She has also been critical of President Emmanuel Macron, calling him \"a dangerous man.\" The former French president's party leader and a close ally of Macron's, she said in an interview with the magazine dfi last year that she would \"never be able to stand up to him.\" She also called on Macron to step down as France's president, saying he should step aside from his role as \"the leader of our country.\" In her interview, MLC's political director, Andreas Jung, said she was \"not surprised\" by the comments from her former colleague and friend, former German Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der. However, they were not surprised by her comments. They were a bit of an understatement, as she had said earlier this year, when she told DW that her party had \"no idea what to expect\" from Macron. Her comments came after a meeting with French President Nicolas Sarkozy in which the two men discussed the possibility of forming a coalition government. French Chancellor Angela Merkel has called for an EU-wide \"grand coalition\" of European countries, including the United States, to ensure that France is not left alone in its decision to leave the EU. On the other hand, Germany has said it will not allow the creation of such an alliance. Germany's foreign minister, David Rachline, has warned that it is too early to make a decision on whether or not France should join the bloc's new alliance with France. France has not yet decided whether to join a new bloc of EU member states, such as Germany, Spain, Italy or the UK. Merkel said last week that Germany would welcome the idea of joining the new EU bloc, even if it was only a temporary arrangement, because \"it's too late for us to agree on a solution to this problem.\" But she also pointed out that there was no agreement on how to deal with a situation that could lead to a change of government in Europe. According to her, this could not have happened in any other EU country. German Foreign Minister Josef Heydrich said on Wednesday that a deal could be reached between the government of Germany and France that would give France a chance to strengthen its relationship with Europe if the current government does not act on its own. A new government is unlikely to take a position on the issue. So far"

Minister wants ban on meat names for plant-based foods Terms like \"vegan sausage\" and \"vegetarian schnitzel\" confuse consumers and need to be replaced, according to German Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt. He wants new names for plant-based dishes. Germans shouldn't be biting into a \"vegan sausage\" or cutting a slice of \"vegetarian schnitzel,\" German Minister for Food and Agriculture Christian Schmidt told the daily \"Bild\" newspaper on Wednesday, adding that names traditionally used for meat-based dishes should not be applied to plant-based foods. \"I don't want anyone to pretend that these pseudo-meat dishes are actual meat dishes,\" Schmidt said. The minister said manufacturers should come up with distinct names for plant-based meat-substitutes. Schmidt also said meat was part of a healthy and balanced diet and belonged on the menu in schools and kindergartens. Soy? Steak? Soy-steak? Schmidt's statements echo demands from the German Farmers Association and German Butchers Association. Both lobbying groups have asked for a ban on terms such as \"vegetarian ham\" or \"soy steak.\" Schmidt's call for plant-based foods to have their own name was also made in October in the state of Lower Saxony, a state with many large livestock farms. The German Vegetarian Association, however, argued against the proposal. A spokesperson for the organization said that \"names that are used for animal-based products should without a doubt also be legal to use for vegetarian substitute products.\" More meatless 'whatever-you-want-to-call-thems' The market for vegetarian and vegan dishes has grown steadily in the past few years in Germany, partly at the expense of the meat industry. According to a research paper by the Institute for the Study of Trade (IfH), revenue for vegetarian and vegan products in Germany was 454 million euros ($474 million) in 2015 and grew by more than 100 percent between 2010 and 2015. In the same time period, the demand for meat products fell by almost 10 percent. mb/sms (dpa, epd)",
        "generated_story": "No more'veggie sausages' and no more'vegetarian schnitzel' German Butchers Association (IfH) has announced that it will no longer be able to sell veg in Germany. The association, which represents farmers in the country, said on Wednesday that the decision was made to stop selling vegetables. \"We have decided that we will not sell vegetables at all,\" said Christian Schmidt, director of the Institute for the Study of Trade (ISS) in Berlin, adding that \"we will continue to do so.\" Schmidt said the move would be a step in a long-term effort to reduce the number of \"veg products\" that are sold in German supermarkets. But it is not the first time that this has been the case. In the past few years, IfH has sold more than 454 million euros worth of vegetables to farmers. It has also sold over 474 million kilograms (474.4 million pounds) of meat since 2010, according to the institute's study of trade. This is the second time in three years that German farmers have sold their produce to a foreign buyer. Before that, they sold meat to foreign buyers for a profit of around 1.5 billion euros ($2.6 billion) a year. Since then, the industry has become a major source of income for farmers, who have been forced to cut back on their meat production in order to make up for lost income. For example, in 2015, a German farmer sold his meat at a price of 1,000 euros a pound (1.2 euros) to an American farmer. He said that if he sold the meat, he would have had to pay for it with his own money. If he did not have the money to buy meat from the farmer, then he said, \"I don't know what I would do with it. I think I'd rather sell it to someone else.\" But if you ask me, what would I do? If I sell my meat? The answer is that I wouldn't eat it, because it's too much meat. That's the way I see it: I'm not going to eat meat that's not good for my health, and I won't be eating meat I've never eaten before.\" The German Vegetarian Association, founded in 2010 and which has since expanded to include the German meat industry, says that meat is a very important part of its diet and that is why it should not be sold to anyone else. According to its website, it has a range of products ranging from meat and dairy products to fish and poultry, eggs and meat products. However, there is no such thing as a substitute for meat or meat substitutes. There are no substitutes for beef and eggs, but there are a lot of other products that can be used to prepare meat for people who want to have meat in their diet, such as beef, fish, vegetables and fish. And there's no shortage of substitutes to choose from. You can find them on the internet, or at the grocery store, where you can order a meat substitute from a variety of different countries.

Twenty years later, relations between Libya and Europe have done an about-face. The Berlin disco \"La Belle\" was packed as usual on the night of April 5, 1986. Among its guests were many US soldiers, who were certainly not thinking of politics, the Middle East or strained relations between the United States and Libya. But reality caught up with them: a bomb detonated near the dance floor that night, killing two Americans and a Turkish woman. Over 200 people were injured. A Berlin court ruled that Libya and its intelligence services were responsible for the bombing. In 2001, following a nearly four-year long trial, the judges convicted a Libyan diplomat and three others to prison sentences between 12 and 14 years. The big oil-exporting country in the meantime was busy working on its reputation. Already in the 1990s, Tripoli began striving to improve its relations to the European Union. Financial reparation opened the door to Europe In 2004, the Gaddafi International Foundation for Charity Associations and the legal representatives of the German La Belle victims settled on $35 million in compensation. This opened the door to Europe. Just a few weeks later, Germany's chancellor at the time, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, visited Moammar Gadhafi in a traditional Bedouin tent outside of Tripoli. Britain's Prime Minister Tony Blair also paid Gadhafi a visit. A few months earlier, in April 2004, the European Union had welcomed the Libyan leader to Brussels. It was Gadhafi's first official visit to Europe in 15 years. Bernd Westphal, the German ambassador to Libya, said bilateral relations had been through difficult times. \"The German Embassy in Tripoli today is working for a quick return to the liveliness of close relations between Germany and Libya,\" Westphal said. \"We want to build on our traditional friendship with Libya and we want to strengthen the political, economic and cultural cooperation between our two countries and peoples.\" Business interests booming in Libya In the past few years, Libya has moved from being the supporter of international terrorism to an attractive economic partner for the West. European business representatives have been increasingly knocking on Libya's door. Even the United States is showing increased interest in the northern African nation. Washington is pleased that Libya announced at the end of 2003 that it would discontinue its efforts to develop and produce weapons of mass destruction. Libya's ambassador to Germany, Said Abdulaati, said political and economic relations between Libya and Germany were \"excellent.\" Libya is one of Germany's strongest trading partners in northern Africa. Last year, Germany exported goods to Libya worth 657.7 million euros ($805.7 million), according to the German Federal Statistics Office. \"The economy is the driving power in German-Libyan relations,\" said Abdulaati in an interview with the Arab-German association for trade and industry. But Germany isn't the only European country making deals in Libya. France last month signed an accord with Libya on peaceful nuclear research. \"This accord represents a qualitative leap in relations between the two countries and proves that Libya has transformed its weapons of mass destruction into constructive weapons,\" Public Works Minister Maatuk Maatuk said at the signing ceremony in March. \"We are telling the world that we are moving towards the development of Libyan nuclear technology for peaceful purposes.\" This week, the Netherlands' Economics Minister Laurens Jan Brinkhorst will visit Libya to negotiate gas and oil agreements. It will be the first high-level visit by a Dutch official since Gadhafi took power in 1969.",
        "generated_story": "The Shift in Libya's Relations to Europe The shift in relations between Libya and the West has been marked by a change in the way the country's relations with the rest of the world are governed. In the past few years, the two countries have been at loggerheads over the fate of their own people. The Libyan government, however, has made no secret of its desire to be closer to the people of Libya. For example, in April 2004, it announced that it would close its embassy in Tripoli, Libya, for the first time since the overthrow of dictator Moammar Gadhafi in January 2011. \"We are not going to allow this to happen again,\" German Foreign Minister Bernd Westphal said in a statement. He added that \"we will not allow the Libyan regime to continue to operate in this way.\" \"It is not an easy situation,\" he said, adding that he hoped that Libya would be able to find a way out of this situation by the end of 2003. But he also said that the situation was not as bad as he had hoped, and that there was no need for Libya to become a \"failed state\" as it was in its early years. According to a German newspaper, \"La Belle\" is the best-selling book of all time. It is also the most expensive book ever written by an author, who has spent more than $35 million on the book since its publication in 2004. And it's not just about the money. There is a lot of money involved, too, as well as the fact that Gaddafi's regime is still in power, which is why the German government has invested so much money in it. That's why it is so important to me that I am not the author of La Belle, but rather, I'm the one who wrote it, because I think that's what I want to do. I don't know what to think about that. What I do know, though, is that this is something that can only be done through the eyes of a human being. If you are a person of Libyan descent, you know that you have to have a very strong sense of responsibility for your own country. This is one of those things that makes you think of your country as a place to live and work, rather than just a country in which you can be a part of, say, a group of people who have come to know you and your family. So, what do you do when you're a Bedouin? What does that mean for you? You can't just say \"I'm a Muslim\" or \"You're not a Christian.\" The German Embassy in London, where West Berlin is located, said it had been in contact with Libya since April 5, 2001, when the former dictator was overthrown by his own forces. Since then, they have worked together to develop a new constitution. They have also worked on a number of projects. One of them was the creation of an art museum in Benghazi. Another was a project to create a museum of African art and architecture. Now, there are plans to make it available to people from across the Middle East to visit the museum. A new museum is being planned to open in Berlin in March. At the same time, plans are being put in place for an exhibition in Tunis, Tunisia, Egypt, Morocco and Egypt. Many of these projects will be funded by Germany, according to German Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der (pictured above). The museum will also be open to visitors from other countries, including the United States, Britain, France, Italy, Spain, Japan, Germany and Australia. Germany's ambassador to Libya has also been invited to speak at the event. Berlin's German ambassador in Cairo has said he would like to see the exhibition. However, he has not yet received a formal invitation from the government to attend. Instead, his office is planning to hold a press conference to discuss the project. German officials have said they would rather talk to Libyan officials about it in Brussels, Berlin and Berlin, saying that they will discuss it with their counterparts in Washington, D.C. and other European countries. Speaking to DW, West Germany said: \"This is an important step forward in our efforts to improve the quality of life for our citizens. We are committed to making it a reality for all of us. Let's talk about what we can do to help our people and make them feel better about themselves and our country.\" Germany has long been a staunch defender of democracy in Africa, particularly in parts of that continent. After the fall of Gaddafi in 2011, German President Angela Merkel said she was \"very concerned\" about how Libya was being treated by Western governments. She said this was because of \"the lack of cooperation between the countries of Europe and North Africa,\" but she did not see any sign of any kind of progress on this front. 'I think it will take a long time to get to this point,\" she told DW in an interview with DW. Meanwhile, British Prime Minister Tony Blair has called for a meeting with a few months"

        "target": "EU Mulls Warning Labels to Curb Alcohol Abuse While still targeting smoking, European Union's public health commissioner is considering adding alcohol to the list of vices the bloc should clamp down on. In a report commissioned by the European Commission, the London Institute for Alcohol Studies recommended raising the legal age to buy alcohol to 18 (in some countries, such as Germany, 16-year-olds can buy beer), lowering the permitted blood alcohol level while driving to 0.5, banning alcohol advertising on TV and in movies as well as adding warning labels to bottles as ways of preventing alcohol abuse across the bloc. Which of the methods EU Health Commissioner Markos Kyprianou actually introduces will be announced \"sometime in the autumn,\" according to a spokesperson. Other options include a 10 percent increase in the price of alcohol. Kyprianou has, however, hinted that he favors warning labels -- similar to those that appear on packs of cigarettes -- that make the dangers of alcohol clear. \"Drinking harms your unborn baby\" on bottles? Brewers and wine makers across Europe, however, have come out against placing \"Drinking Kills\" or other labels on bottles of beer. \"Warning labels are the completely wrong way to go,\" Peter Hahn, head of the German Brewers Association told Germany's Express newspaper. \"The do not deter people who have lost a sense of how much to drink and unsettle the people who enjoy a beer after work.\" Industry groups also opposed implementing EU-wide guidelines in countries with traditionally different ways of approaching drinking and drinking problems. \"Policies that do not consider cultural and regional differences, will fail to deal with the social problems, while at the same time generate a rising level of political objections,\" said Rodolphe de Looz-Corswarem of Brewers of Europe. Keeping social vices separate Green party EU parliamentarian Hiltrud Breyer meanwhile called on the alcohol industry to stop \"saber rattling\" before it sees the a final version of the EU's strategy to prevent alcohol abuse. German Consumer Affairs Minister Horst Seehofer said he would wait to see what Kyprianou's actual suggestions are before commenting. Other German politicians, however, were more willing to voice the opposition to putting a sip of wine on the same footing with a puff of a cigarette. \"People should not expect that a skull and crossbones end up on every bottle of beer and wine,\" German EU representative Karl-Heinz Florenz told Der Tagesspiegel newspaper, adding that when it comes to alcohol, each member state should be responsible for how it deals with alcohol abuse. The harm of \"passive drinking\" While cigarettes are a health risk from the first puff, moderate drinking can actually be healthy and there is no danger from \"passive drinking,\" Peter Liese, a German EU representative, told the paper. The commission's report disagreed with Liese's conclusion, saying alcohol abuse had a major role in as many as 200,000 deaths in Europe due to car accidents and disease and played a role in some 60,000 underweight births. The report also estimated the effects of alcohol abuse of costing the EU 125 billion euros ($161 billion) in 2003. Some 25 percent of men and 10 percent of women in Europe drink what the EU considers to be more than healthy amounts of alcohol and between 3 percent and 5 percent are suffering from alcoholism, according to EU statistics.",
        "generated_story": "German Brewers Association warns of \"passive drinking\" on bottles of beer German Brewers' Association has warned of the dangers of binge drinking on beer bottles. The group's president, Peter Liese, told Der Tagesspiegel in an interview published on Wednesday that the problem was \"very serious.\" \"It's a very serious problem,\" he said, adding that \"it's not something you want to be a part of, but it's something that you should be aware of.\" In 2003, the European Commission warned that underage drinking could lead to the death of up to 16-year-olds in Germany. \"This is the first time in the history of our country that we have seen this kind of behavior,\" said Dietrich Hiltrud Breyer, director of research at the London Institute for Alcohol Studies (DLI) in London. He added: \"The problem is that young people are drinking too much alcohol. It's very difficult for them to understand the consequences of this behavior, and it is very, very bad for their health and well-being.\" Lyinge's comments come as the Green party's leader, Horst Seehofer, has called on the German government to take action against underage drinkers. In the autumn, his party announced that it would be launching a campaign to ban underage consumption of alcohol in Europe. According to LSI, \"We are going to do everything we can to prevent this from happening again.\" The Green Party, which has been in power for the past three years, is calling for an end to alcohol-related alcohol consumption in all European countries, including the United States, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece and Spain. But the party is not alone in its concern over alcohol use. A German newspaper has published an article in which it argues that alcohol can be used as a weapon against people who drink excessively and who do not have the right to have a drink in their own home. German media have reported that a number of people have been arrested in connection with the case. Some of them have also been charged with drinking in public places, while others are charged for drinking alcohol on a regular basis. This has led to a rise in cases where alcohol is used to make people drink more and more alcohol, as well as for those who don't drink alcohol at all. One of these cases was in 2003 when a group of teenagers who had been drinking a beer in a pub in central Berlin called for a ban on alcohol sales in order to protect themselves and their families from alcohol abuse. They were arrested and sentenced to life imprisonment. More than a year later, they were released from prison for drink-driving, according to their lawyer, Markos Kyprianou, who was also convicted of driving while underage and was later released for driving. Prosecutors have said the charges were politically motivated and that they could be brought to trial. However, there is no evidence to suggest that these charges are related to drinking. Instead, prosecutors have accused the government of trying to influence the outcome of a referendum on whether or not to allow alcohol to enter the country. On the other hand, many of those accused of drinking have denied the allegations, saying they are not guilty of any wrongdoing. These charges have not been proven in any court of law, however. And they have no basis in fact. For example, a German court has ruled that beer sales are illegal under German law. That is, if you are underage, you have to buy a bottle of wine from a bar in your home state of Bavaria. You can't buy alcohol without a license. What do you need to know about alcohol? The German beer industry has a reputation for being a good source of cheap beer for people to drink. There are a lot of good reasons for this, of course. I think that's the main reason why the EU is so desperate to get alcohol out of its system. If you buy beer, then you can get a better understanding of how alcohol affects people's lives. How can you know what you're drinking? And what are the chances of that happening to you? What are you doing to your family, friends and your children? I'm not sure what to think about that? \"I think we are doing a really good job of educating our children,\" says Peter Hahn, head of Germany's Brewers of Europe (MLI), a trade association that is based in Berlin. (Reuters, AFP, dpa) \"There is a huge problem with alcohol and alcohol,\" Peter Liese told the newspaper, The Sunday Independent, citing a study published by the British Institute of Alcohol studies, that there are no laws that prevent alcohol from being sold to minors. So, what can we do about it? We have an obligation to educate our kids. We are working on that, right? Let's talk to our parents and make sure we educate them, because we know they will be able to help them understand what's going on in our lives and what they're going through the process of becoming a responsible adult?

        "target": "All or nothing for Bayern in Champions final Bayern Munich have one last chance to salvage a season that has otherwise been marked by their inability to beat Borussia Dortmund: a win against Chelsea in the Champions League final at their home stadium. All season long, Bayern Munich have been consumed with achieving one goal: reaching the final of the Champions League, held at their own Allianz Arena in Munich, and raising the trophy in front of their home fans. After finishing a distant second place to Dortmund in the Bundesliga and dismally losing to them 5-2 in the German Cup final, Bayern Munich are in a must-win situation Saturday against Chelsea. A loss would be the final straw in a disappointing season for a team that can't stand second place. A win for Bayern would mean redemption, to some extent, for their shortcomings in the league. Key players were rested down the stretch in the Bundesliga, especially before the two legs of Bayern's European semifinal against Real Madrid. That was an indication that Bayern had given up on the league and put all their eggs in one basket, hoping for a big payoff with the Champions League title. The same can be said for the German Cup final against Dortmund: true, Bayern essentially beat themselves by making mistake after mistake, but Bayern could, if they win Saturday, wipe the slate clean. Saving the season Win this match, and all will be forgiven in Munich. Lose, and it will be Bayern's second straight season without a piece of hardware, not to mention the heartbreak of losing the biggest match at Allianz Arena since it opened in 2005. \"We must not even think about [losing],\" said Bayern's Franck Ribery on Thursday. \"If we win the Champions League, then we can forget about not winning the league or the cup, nobody will care about that.\" Bayern are a team that thrives under pressure, and the high stakes of this match will be good for them. Chelsea are a team that showed in their semifinal upset of Barcelona that they can rise to a challenge, even if that challenge is simply holding on against a superior opponent. \"We are not the favorites of the game, we are playing away,\" Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech said on Thursday. \"It is very rare when you have the home team playing in the home stadium, using the home dressing room, so I think the advantage goes to Bayern Munich because of that. But we know we have a chance and we will fight for it.\" But this match will come down to the team that can better take advantage of holes that have been blown in each team's defense due to injuries and suspensions. Filling the gaps Between the two sides, seven starting players will miss out on the final. Chelsea saw Raul Meireles, Ramires, and Branislav Ivanovic each get their third yellow card in the second leg against Barcelona, and captain John Terry was given a straight red. Terry and Ivanovic are fixtures on Chelsea's backline, which was already at half-strength due to hamstring injuries suffered by Gary Cahill and David Luiz. Chelsea coach Roberto di Matteo hopes those two are fit enough for the final, since Chelsea will need all the help they can get in the back. For Bayern, David Alaba and Holger Badstuber - both defenders - and Luiz Gustavo, a defensive midfielder, are also suspended for picking up three yellow cards. The impact of the suspensions will hit Chelsea the most. In addition to a weakened back line, Meireles and Ramires are mainstays on offense, supporting strikers Didier Drogba or Fernando Torres. With Ramires out, Drogba could start as striker, with Torres moving to the wing. At any rate, there is more uncertainty in The Blues' lineup than there is in Bayern's, who will be able to rely on striker Mario Gomez and the dynamic-duo of Arjen Robben and Ribery on the wings as they have all season. Most of the question marks will still be defensive for both teams, but to think that this is an indication of a high-scoring affair on Saturday would be a discredit to both team's last lines of defense. Between the posts Neither side would be competing in the final if it wasn't for the heroics of the teams' keepers. Cech defended against wave after wave of attacks from Barcelona in the semifinal for Chelsea, and Manuel Neuer showed nerves of steel in Bayern's penalty shootout in the final leg against Real Madrid, blocking penalties from Madrid stars Cristiano Ronaldo and Kaka. Chelsea's best shot will be to come out of the gate at a sprint and gain an early advantage against Bayern, who will be doing everything they can to keep their long-cultivated dream-final in their control. Otherwise, Bayern's determination to salvage their season may be enough to carry them through to the trophy ceremony - at home, just like they planned it.

        "generated_story": "Bayern Munich to face Chelsea in Champions League final Bayern Munich will face the prospect of facing Chelsea at the Allianz Arena on Thursday. The German champions will be hoping to avoid a repeat of their 2005-06 season, when they lost to Real Madrid in the German Cup final. But they will have to wait until the end of the season to see if they can make it to the last 16. At the very least, they have a chance of reaching the final, which will decide the fate of Chelsea's Cristiano Ronaldo. Chelsea, meanwhile, have already won their last three games in Germany, but they face a tough task in their quest to qualify for the next round. And they are not going to be able to do that. For the first time since 2005, Chelsea have not lost a game in five years. They have only lost one game this season and that was in 2005. That was a season in which they failed to win a single Bundesliga game, and they were eliminated from the competition by Bayern. Now, the Blues are looking for their first title in a decade, having won the Bundesliga in 2006 and 2007. \"We are very disappointed,\" said Raul Meireles, head coach of Borussia Dortmund, who is also in charge of Bayern's youth system. He added: \"It's a great opportunity for us to get back on the right track. We want to make the most of this opportunity.\" Chelsea coach Roberto di Matteo said he was \"very happy\" with his side's performance against Bayern, despite the fact that they did not have the best of intentions in terms of attacking play. However, he also said that he would be happy with the way the team was playing, given that it had been a good season so far. It's not just the players who have been playing well, it's also the coaches who are the ones who know what to expect from their players. In addition to their star players, Bayern are also looking to strengthen their squad for next season's Bundesliga final against Chelsea. Coach Josep Maria Bartomeu said the club was looking forward to a return to Europe's top-flight, where they could be the favorites to reach the quarter-finals for a second time in three seasons. Barcelona coach Franck Ribery said his squad was ready to go into the tournament with a strong squad and a lot of young talent in mind. His side are expected to take on a number of key players in next year's competition, including the likes of David Alaba, Mario Gomez and Kaka, as well as their new coach, Manuel Neuer. Germany's talismanic midfielder, Cristian Ronaldo, has been in fine form in his first season at Bayern and has impressed in all competitions, scoring three goals and setting up three assists in four games. Spain's Eden Hazard, for example, scored a brace against Manchester United on Wednesday and set up a goal against Barcelona. Manchester City's Romelu Lukaku, in particular, was the only player to score twice against the Red Devils in that game. Arsenal's Fabian Schalke, however, were unable to find a way out of a difficult situation and were forced to settle for just a draw against Dortmund. Luka Modric, though, is the man to blame for that, because of his lack of experience in front of goal and his inability to adapt to his new role as a central midfielder. Bayern coach Jose Pekerman is hoping that his players will find their way back to form after a disappointing start to last season. Former Chelsea player R\u00fan Ramires, a former Bayern defender, said on Friday that \"the team is a very good team and I am very happy that we are here to help them win the title,\" adding that the squad is still in good shape and will continue to improve. 'We have an excellent squad,' he said, adding, \"I'm very pleased with how well we have played in this competition and the quality of our young players and how we've played so well. I'm sure we will get through the group stages and we'll be ready for another season of competition.\" The Bundesliga's most successful season has come to an end in recent years, with Chelsea and Bayern being the top two teams in Europe and Germany. Pep Guardiola's men have won three consecutive Bundesliga titles, while Bayern have two more to play for in 2017-18 and in 2018-19. Josef Maria Costa, Jose Mourinho's successor, took over the reins at Chelsea on Saturday, saying he wanted to focus on his team-mates and improve on their attacking skills in order to achieve their goal-scoring potential. Guardiola has also been impressed with their ability to create chances in attack, especially in attacking midfield and attack. Last season he had a few good performances in defence, particularly in midfield but he has not been as effective as he is in goal, so he will need to step up his game as soon as we get the chance to compete again this year.\" In a statement, Guardiola said Bayern will take part in Saturday's side"

Security forces were put on high alert, with riot police patrolling streets after calls by the opposition for the resignation of Maoist Prime Minister Baburam Bhattarai. \"Nepal has entered an uncertain constitutional and political period,\" Ban warned in a statement read by his spokesman Martin Nesirky. \"The government and the political leaders, as well as leaders of various communities, need to demonstrate the courage and wisdom to come together to address the challenges the nation faces,\" the statement added.

The country's elections are set to take place on Monday, the UN said, adding that the country is in a \"very difficult situation.\" The election is expected to be held within the next few days. Nepal's election commission has said it will hold a special election in November to determine the winner of the November general election, which is scheduled for November. It is not yet clear whether the election will be called, but it is widely expected that it could be. In the past, elections have been held in several parts of Nepal, including in Kathmandu, where the government has been in power for more than two decades. But in recent years, it has become increasingly difficult to predict the outcome of elections. Last year, Nepal voted for a new president, Ban Ki-moon, who was elected by a landslide in 2008. Since then, a number of candidates have failed to win a majority of votes in elections, with the most recent being the former prime minister, Bhattarai. He is the only candidate who has won a seat in parliament since 2008, when he was a candidate for the Nobel Peace Prize. \"We have a long way to go,\" he said in an interview with AFP on Sunday, referring to the year when the elections were held. Many of those who have lost their seats have fled to neighboring countries, while others have returned to their homes, according to a report by the United Nations human rights office (UNHCR). The UN has called for an early election on November 6, saying it would be the first time that Nepal has held a presidential election since the 1990s. UN Secretary-General Martin Nesirky said Sunday that he expected a peaceful election. However, he did not rule out the possibility of an election that could lead to violence, as he had said earlier this year. According to UN officials, there is \"a lot of uncertainty\" about who will win and who is going to lose. There are also concerns about the security situation in neighboring India and Pakistan, and that there may be a lack of information on what is happening in other countries. At the same time, many people are worried about what will happen to Nepal if the new government is forced to step in and take over the reins of power from the incumbent government. That is, if it's not already clear by now what the future will look like, because the current government of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has not been able to do anything about it. This is a country that has long been plagued by instability and instability in its political system. For the last decade, Nepali's political situation has deteriorated in many ways. After the 2008 earthquake and the collapse of democracy in 2006, its government was unable to form a government that had a clear vision of what it wanted to achieve. Now, that vision is being challenged by political parties and people who want to make it clear that they don't want it to happen again. And that is what has led to widespread unrest in some places, such as India, China, Pakistan and India. On Sunday the Nepal government announced it was launching a fresh round of protests, calling on the international community to intervene to prevent it from happening again, in order to protect its people from being swept into the political fray. India's government, however, has refused to give up on its efforts to resolve the situation. Indian President Ram Nath Kovind, meanwhile, said the protests would not be allowed to continue for at least another decade. His government had promised to hold an emergency meeting on Tuesday to discuss the issue of electoral reform. Ban said he would continue to press ahead with his government's plans to implement the reforms, although he didn't specify what that would entail. Meanwhile, opposition parties in India have continued to try to influence the process. Opposition parties have also been trying to push through a series of reforms that have stalled the implementation of democratic reforms. Some of them have tried to impose their own agenda on Nepal. They have refused, for example, to introduce a constitution that will allow them to pass a law that allows the constitution to become law and recognize the rule of law. A new constitution was introduced in 2009. One of these reforms is to allow the people of India to vote on a referendum on whether or not they will have the right to run for office. If they do not do so, this will give them the opportunity to have their voices heard. While the opposition has so far failed so many times, they are unlikely to succeed in their bid to ensure that elections will not happen in any way. So far, no one has come forward with a plan to create a constitutional amendment to amend the Constitution. What is certain is that this is an important step forward, though, at the very least, India has already begun to move forward in this regard. Earlier this month, Indian Foreign Minister Bijan said that a draft constitution would only be approved by parliament. President Ban has promised that an amendment would give the constitutional amendments to"

It sided with a German firm in its legal battle with US giant Oracle. The European Court of Justice on Tuesday ruled that used software licenses may generally be resold by individuals or companies. The Luxembourg-based court thus sided with the German firm UsedSoft in a protracted legal battle with US software giant Oracle. The ruling made it clear that trade in used software was permissible even if the software had not been shipped on a physical medium such as a CD or DVD, but had been digitally downloaded from the Internet. UsedSoft's business model hinges completely on reselling used packages or legally obtained license keys for them. By reselling the keys to clients, the latter are then able to download the latest version of a given program directly from a company's Internet site and obtain all new updates and patches in the process. Legal clarity Oracle had sued UsedSoft over its business model, trying to prevent buyers of used software licenses from downloading programs again. But the European court ruled that the so-called principle of exhaustion applied whenever software was originally sold to a customer for an unlimited time span, not giving the maker of the software the right to prevent the resale of that software. \"The door for the trade in used software has been pushed wide open throughout the European Union,\" UsedSoft said in a statement, welcoming \"perfect legal safety on the market.\" The court in Luxembourg emphasized, though, that whoever resold pieces of original software and their accompanying licenses must erase every copy on their own computers in advance and was not allowed to keep a copy after resale. hg/mz (AFP, dpa)",
        "generated_story": "European Court of Justice rules that reselling software is permissible The European court of justice has ruled that it's permissible to resell software without a license from the European Union (EU). The court ruled Tuesday that the EU's software licensing system, used by Oracle, is not permissible under EU law. The decision comes as a result of an EU court ruling in a case involving the use of software by companies such as Apple, Google, Microsoft, Oracle and others. In the case, which is being heard by a court in Strasbourg, France, the court said that Oracle had violated EU rules by selling software to third parties. \"This is a significant step in the right direction,\" it said, according to AFP news agency. Oracle has said it will appeal the ruling, saying it has no legal basis to do so. It's the first time in Europe that a software license has been allowed to be used without the need for a licensing agreement with a third party. According to court documents, this is in line with European law and the law of the land. However, it does not apply to software that has not been used before, for example, since the software was first released to the public in 2009. This is the second time the courts have ruled in favor of Oracle. Earlier this year, they had ruled against the company's application, using an application that had been downloaded from an app store. Now, after years of legal wrangling over the application's legality, a new court decision is expected to rule on the matter on Tuesday. At the same time, an appeals court has rejected Oracle's argument that its software should not be sold without an author's permission. That would be a violation of EU laws, and it would also be illegal for Oracle to sell software from a reseller to another company, as well as for other companies, including the US, Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. (AFP, AP, dpa) The case is part of a broader legal battle over how to enforce EU regulations on software sales, with the aim of making it easier for companies to obtain software licenses from other countries. For instance, in Germany, where Oracle is based, there's a requirement that all software must be downloaded by the end of each year. There's also the issue of whether a company should be able to buy software directly from another country without having to pay for it, or whether it should only be reselled through the Internet. But in this case the decision was made in an attempt to make it more difficult for the German government to regulate software resellers, rather than the companies themselves, who have the legal right to use software in their own countries, to have their software. After all, that's something that can be done legally, even if they don't have a valid license. And that means they can't sell it to anyone who doesn't already have one. With the exception of used software, companies can only sell to companies that do not have an existing license, like Apple or Google or Microsoft. If they do, then they have to give it back to their customers, but only after they've paid a certain amount of money. As a matter of fact, Apple and Microsoft are the only ones who can do that, because they're the ones that have access to all the data that is available to them. Apple is one of those companies. Google is another. Microsoft and Oracle are another, too. Amazon, however, has a similar problem: It has the ability to distribute software through its cloud service, Amazon Web Services, while Microsoft has its own cloud-based cloud platform. So, if you're not using the cloud, you can use the Oracle cloud to store all of its products. You can also use Oracle software on Amazon.com and Google's cloud services. What's even more important is that you use it for your own business, so you know what you are doing, right? That's what I'm doing here. I think that makes it very easy for you to get the information you need to know about what's going on in your home country. Just ask Google and Apple. Or, I guess you could say that Google has done a lot of good things to you, just because you've already done it. We're going to try and get rid of all that stuff. Then, we'll see what we can get out of this. Let's see how that works out, OK? You know who's responsible for this? Google will be the one who has to decide who gets to choose which software and which ones are available. How can you do it? And what do you think about that? Or what are you doing?

The Curiosity rover will soon re-start its sluggish search for signs of life. NASA's Mars rover, \"Curiosity,\" will wrap up a lengthy self-testing phase on Thursday, freeing it up to continue exploring the surface of the Red Planet. Mission manager Jennifer Tropser told reporters in a conference call on Wednesday evening that the plan, once the final checks were completed, was to \"drive, drive, drive\" until Curiosity discovers a rock suitable for analysis. She added that the instrument checks have delivered positive results. \"Through every phase of the check-out, Curiosity has performed almost flawlessly,\" Tropser said. \"The success so far of these activities has been outstanding.\" Many of the tests have concerned Curiosity's robotic arm. The 2.1-meter (7-feet) appendage will be used to pick out and sample rocks and soil. NASA is investigating whether Mars can sustain life, or whether it could in the past. The tests were designed to identify any damage sustained during its interplanetary flight and also to ensure that the arm still functioned properly on Mars, with its different temperatures and gravity. The Mars rover landed in the giant Gale Crater, near the Martian equator, on August 5; it has so far moved about 109 meters within the crater. The rover is traveling east, heading first to an intersection called Glenelg, where three types of terrain meet. This is likely to be the location for the first rock and soil samples, though NASA said Curiosity was unlikely to arrive there for several weeks. Curiosity's ultimate destination is the nearby Aeolis Mons or Mount Sharp, a 3-mile-high mound of rock rising out of the crater. Mount Sharp is about 4.3 miles (7 kilometers) away from Curiosity's landing site. The $2.5-billion (1.93-billion-euro) six-wheeled rolling science lab is designed to last two years in order to complete its Mars mission. msh/jm (AFP, AP, Reuters)",
        "generated_story": "Curiosity's self-testing has been a success -- and so far, so good -- NASA astronaut Jennifer Tropser says the Mars rover Curiosity has had a successful two-year mission to Mars. The rover, which was launched on August 5, has conducted two years of self testing on the Red Planet's surface. On Wednesday, the rover began its second year of mission testing, with the results of which are expected to be published by the end of the year. \"We are very pleased with our results,\" she told reporters at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, in an interview published on Wednesday. In the past, NASA has used the Curiosity rover to test the Martian surface, but in recent years, it has not been able to prove that it is capable of detecting the presence of extraterrestrials. That is, until a new rover is launched in August, and that is when the mission will be launched. It is the first of its kind in the world and is scheduled to launch in September next year, according to a NASA press release. After a two year mission, Curiosity is now on its way to the surface of Mars, where it will conduct its first test of a Mars-based rover. Analysts at the International Astronomical Union (IAF) said the test was a \"very good success.\" \"It's a very good start,\" Troepser told Reuters, adding that the team was \"extremely pleased\" with its results. She said that \"the rover has done a great job of testing the samples and has a lot of confidence in its ability to detect extraterrestrial life.\" The team also said it had found no signs of alien activity on Mount Sharp, a mountain in Gale Crater on Mars' south coast. But they did find that there was no sign of an alien presence on Earth, she said. Scientists said they were confident that Mars was not a hostile planet, despite the fact that its surface is relatively flat. They also noted that Curiosity's rover had not detected any alien life, although they said there were signs it might have been, as well as a number of other Martian objects that could be potentially hostile to human habitation. And they are hopeful that this will not be the case for the future, because they have already tested a variety of Martian features, such as water, rock, ice and even the moon's atmosphere. For now, however, they say, there is no indication that any of these features are causing any danger to humans. According to Troopser, who works for NASA, \"we are not going to have a hard time finding anything that we don't already know about. We will have to wait a long time to find out for sure.\" She added that she is optimistic about the success of Curiosity and her team's next mission: \"If we can find something that will help us, we will do it in a few years. I'm optimistic that they will find a solution to this problem.\" In addition to its success in testing samples, researchers have also found a large amount of data that can be used to determine whether Mars is a habitable environment for humans to live on. If so, that would be a good sign for future missions. NASA is also working on a plan to expand the program to other planets, including Mars and Venus. So far the project is progressing well, at least in terms of funding. More than 2.5-billion-euro ($2.93 billion) is being budgeted for this year's mission. There are also plans for further testing in 2018, when NASA will release a report on how much money Curiosity will spend on this mission and whether it's worth the money. (Reuters, AP, AFP, Reuters)NASA's Curiosity mission has already been successful. Its first mission is to explore the red planet's rocky surface and the impact of climate change on it. This is an important step in that direction. Researchers are hoping to get a better understanding of what's going on in Mars as the planet is getting warmer and warmer. At the same time, scientists are looking for new ways to make sure that more people will come to understand the benefits of this new approach. With the latest findings from Curiosity, their findings are likely to help them understand how to better understand Earth's climate and how it could affect its climate. Experts say the new mission could have an impact on human health, if it can help to improve the quality of life for people who are already living there. What do you think will happen to Earth?

        "target": "A borderline war The crisis in Syria is in danger of drawing in neighboring countries. Despite the Syrian government's immediate apology, the shelling on the Turkish border has led to concerns about possible escalation. These weren't the first incidents on the Syrian-Turkish border, but the fact that several people on the Turkish side were killed by Syrian shells on Wednesday (03.10.2012) has brought the conflict between the two countries to a new level. It has led the Turkish military to retaliate for the first time. Several people were killed when Turkey shelled Syrian territory. But neither Turkey, which is a member of NATO, nor Syria would benefit from a broader conflict. An adviser to the Turkish president tweeted, \"Turkey has no interest in a war with Syria.\" Volker Perthes, director of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs in Berlin, agrees: \"Assad has no interest in an escalation,\" he told DW. \"That can be seen from the fact that the Syrian information minister apologized and expressed his regret over the victims immediately after the attack on Turkish territory.\" Perthes doesn't think it's likely that the Syrian President, Bashar Assad, wants to provoke Turkey to intervene in Syria. \"That would only accelerate the fall of his regime,\" he said. It's not yet clear who was responsible for the shelling. According to Syria's ally, Russia, it was a \"tragic accident.\" Relationship damaged The armed incidents on the Syrian-Turkish border have been going on for months. According to Amnesty International, some 300,000 Syrians have left their country since the start of the uprising against Assad, and many of them have fled to Turkey. The relationship between the two countries, which used to be close, has deteriorated dramatically, and the Turkish government is now openly supporting the Syrian opposition. \"Turkey is itself a player in the Syrian conflict,\" said Perthes. \"It provides shelter for many refugees and it's through Turkey that supplies come for the opposition.\" NATO has lined up behind Turkey and told Syria to end its \"flagrant violations of international law.\" Call for 'great discretion' The German chancellor, Angel Merkel, has also positioned herself alongside Turkey. \"We call on all parties to show great discretion,\" she said in Berlin. The foreign minister, Guido Westerwelle, declared that everything must be done to deescalate the situation, so that the Syrian conflict did not turn into a conflagration in the region. Indeed, the Syrian crisis is not only spreading to Turkey, but also to Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon. According to Perthes, \"The neighboring countries are partly victims and partly instigators. Jordan too has taken in refugees and supplies the rebels. On the other hand, Iraq has tended to support the government of Bashar Assad.\" Even so, he said, all the neighboring countries had an interest in ensuring the conflict was confined to Syria. Appeal to the international community But the number of Syrian refugees is rising by the day. Ruth J\u00fcttner, a Middle East expert with Amnesty International, believes this will continue in future months. \"It's important that the countries bordering on Syria are supported by the international community in providing accommodation, medical and psychological care and schooling for children,\" she told DW. It's an appeal she directs especially to European countries. The shelling on the Syrian-Turkish border has made it more likely that there will be armed conflict between Syria and its neighbors. According to Perthes, \"It's probably the case that political resistance in Turkey to intervention in Syria is decreasing right now.\"",
        "generated_story": "Turkey's response to the Syrian-Turkish conflict is \"not likely,\" German Foreign Minister Volker Perthes said on Wednesday (03.10.2012) in an interview with DW. \"Turkey is not likely to act in the way it wants to,\" he said, adding that the situation in Syria \"is not going to change at all.\" The German foreign ministry said the Turkish military was not planning to intervene militarily, but that it would be \"very, very difficult\" to prevent it from happening. The Turkish Foreign Ministry said in a statement that Ankara would \"act in accordance with the international community's position\" on the conflict. It also said that Turkey would not be involved in any kind of military intervention. However, it did not rule out the possibility of an intervention by the United States, the European Union, NATO, or the US. In the event of a Turkish intervention, Germany's foreign minister, Guido Westerwelle, told DW that \"we are not prepared to take any action at this time.\" \"We do not think that we will be able to respond in this way at the moment,\" she said. On Wednesday, she added, \"If we were to, we would have to be prepared for the consequences of this intervention.\" Germany, however, said it was too early to make a decision on whether or not to send troops to Syria, which is a country with a long history of violence against its own people. Germany has long been a staunch ally of Turkey, and it has been for many years. But in recent years, when the two countries have been at loggerheads over the fate of Syria's President Bashar Assad, they have had a lot to say about each other. For example, in 2011, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she would send a delegation to Ankara to meet with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to discuss the future of the country's relations with Russia and the Middle East. At the same time, a number of other countries, including Russia, Turkey and Iran, have also expressed concern about Turkey's role in Syrian civil war. According to a report from the German Institute for International and Security Affairs (IISS), Turkey has \"no intention\" of intervening, even if it does decide to do so. This is the first time in more than a year that Germany and its allies have agreed to step up their support for Assad's regime, according to an Amnesty International report. That report, published on Tuesday, was based on an assessment by a German think tank that said Turkey was unlikely to use military force against Syrian rebels in retaliation for its intervention in eastern Syria. Turkey is also not ready to withdraw its troops from Syria and has not yet made an official statement on its involvement in that conflict, although it is expected that this will take place within the next few months. There are also concerns about the role of NATO and other regional powers, such as Iran and Russia in fighting the Islamic State (ISOK), which are currently fighting alongside the Assad regime in neighboring Syria in its fight against ISOK. These concerns have not been fully addressed by German officials, who have said they will continue to work with Turkey to try to resolve the issue. They have repeatedly stressed the need for a ceasefire between Syrian and Turkish forces, as well as the fact that there is no agreement on how to end the ongoing conflict between Assad and his regime. Last week, I spoke to German diplomats in Ankara about this. I told them that they should not expect to see any military action from Turkey until the end of next year. And I said this was a very long time coming, because it's not something that will happen. So I don't think we should expect a military response from Ankara. We will wait and see what happens after that. If that's the case, then I think it will only be a matter of time before we have a chance to find out what is going on. Let's be clear: Turkey will not do anything to stop the bloodshed. What do you think about that? I'm not sure what we can do about it? What is your opinion on this? Do you agree with me? Let me tell you what you want to know? Tell me about your views? You can tell me if you have an opinion. You know what I mean? If you are a member of parliament, you know that you can't say that I am not an expert on Syria - but you should be aware of what's happening in our country - and that is why we need to talk to you - because I have no doubt that Russia will do everything in my power to help us to get a solution to this problem. As I've said before, this is an important step forward in terms of our relationship with our allies and partners. Do I really think there's a good chance that something will come out of my mind? That's something I would like to hear from my colleagues in Germany. Otherwise, let's just say we'll be very clear - we're not talking about what the president has said to me - I'd rather than I"

Effect on cycling and sponsorship Monday's decision comes as the sport of cycling reels from Armstrong's well-documented fall from grace. Organizers of the Tour de France will be trying to move on from the scandal as the race prepares to celebrate its centenary next year. Sponsors have been deserting Armstrong and the sport in general. Last week, Nike - one of Armstrong's main corporate sponsors - said it was terminating its relationship with the cyclist and accused him of deception. Trek, the company that made the bicycles Armstrong rode to seven titles, announced on the same day it would terminate its sponsorship contract - as did the beer maker Anheuser-Busch. The Dutch institution Rabobank ended its association with professional cycling after the doping allegations came to light, leaving 17 riders in need of a sponsor. Last week Armstrong also announced he would step down from his own charity, the Lance Armstrong Foundation, also known as Livestrong, a move believed to have been intended to limit the damage to the organization from the USADA report.

Armstrong, who has been banned from cycling for three years, is the first cyclist to be stripped by USADA of two world titles. The UCI said in a statement that it was \"deeply disappointed\" with the decision. \"We are disappointed that Lance has not been able to win any of these titles,\" it said, adding that the sport's governing body, the US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), had decided not to renew his contract with Armstrong's cycling club, Livestrong, which he founded in 2009. Lance's team, Nike, has also said it will not renew the contract. He has said he will continue to fight for the titles until the end of the year, when he hopes to return to cycling. In October, he was banned for life from competing in the Tour of France for a year and a half for doping violations. But he is not the only cyclist stripped from his titles, as he also has a number of other titles he has won in Europe and the United States, including two in cycling, cycling's most prestigious event in France. His former team-mate Pat McQuaid, meanwhile, said that he had \"no desire to compete in any sport at all.\" \"I am not going to give up,\" he told AFP, referring to the cycling world's biggest sporting event. 'I don't want to waste my time and energy on doping.' \" I have no intention of giving up my title, but I am very disappointed in my team's decision to withdraw from this year's Tour. I would like to congratulate them on their success, and I think they will be very proud of their achievement,\" said the former cyclist, now a cycling coach at the University of California, San Francisco, in an interview with Reuters.

Read more: \"The World's greatest cycling champion is now out of a position of power,\" the report said. French cycling federation says the investigation is ongoing and will take place at a later date. It is expected to take at least a week to determine whether or not Armstrong is still eligible for an Olympic medal. However, it is unlikely that Armstrong will receive a medal for his performance in his first race since his doping conviction in 2006. According to French media reports, Armstrong has already won three more titles since then, with two more coming in 2014 and 2015. A further three in 2015 and 2016. This time around, there is a chance he could win a third in 2017. That would be a big step forward for him, if he were to become the next world champion. And that would give him the opportunity to continue his career as a professional cyclist. For now, though, that's not likely to happen. There is no way to know for sure. We will have to wait and see what the results of this investigation are, however, before we can make a final decision on whether to award him another title. If he does not win one, we are not sure what will happen to his chances of winning another, because he already has two. After all, this is an interesting and difficult year for cycling and cycling in this sport. Many of us have been rooting for Lance since he became a cyclist in 1999, so we have a lot of confidence in him to do well in that sport and that is something we will never forget. What's more, I hope he can do even more for himself and for our sport as well as his family. So, let's be honest: He's a great cyclist and he's the best cyclist we've ever had. Let's just say he doesn't have the experience to make the most of it, right? \"It's been a difficult couple of weeks for me to say that I'm very happy to see him back in sport,\" added Pat, a former cycling executive at Rabobank and now an executive director of cycling consultancy, \"but I can't tell you how many more years I'll have.\" He is currently working on his own career, working with a new company, Anheuser-Busch, based in New York, to find out what his future holds. Meanwhile, his cycling career is set to get even further ahead of him. At the same time, many cycling fans are hoping he'll be back on the road again next year. On Monday, an Italian cycling team is due to start training again in Italy, where he won a world championship in September. Despite the fact that cycling has become a very important part of our lives, some of them are very difficult to prepare for that, too. With the World Cup, you can expect to have an even harder road to go through this season, especially in terms."

        "target": "Bayern blast five as Schalke draw Bayern Munich stamped their authority over the Bundesliga on Saturday, with a ruthless 5-0 drubbing of Hannover at home. Meanwhile, second-placed Schalke and third-placed Frankfurt were forced to share the points. With many critics saying Bayern might as well be given the giant Bundesliga dish already, perhaps the struggle for second is shaping up to be the more compelling battle. But Saturday afternoon's clash between second-placed Schalke and third-placed Frankfurt did not take a decisive turn, with the game ending in a 1-1 draw. Schalke drew first blood in the 11th minute, when Frankfurt's Stefan Aigner was dispossessed in midfield, and Lewis Holtby released Klaas-Jan Huntelaar in front of goal - the Dutchman's first in the Bundesliga since September. But the hapless Aigner waited just over 100 seconds to make amends for his error, when the Royal Blues allowed him a free header that left goalkeeper Lars Unnerstall with no chance. But neither side could make inroads in the second half, which allowed Dortmund to leap-frog both sides and claim second place. Bayern take command Meanwhile the imperious Bayern Munich dispelled any talk of winter form-dip - following last week's draw to Nuremberg - with a brutally efficient 5-0 win at home to Hannover. The Bavarians stormed to a 3-0 lead in just 37 minutes, celebrating a nifty overhead kick for star signing Javi Martinez in the fourth minute. Toni Kroos and Franck Ribery scored the next two against a Hannover side that were torn open at will. The overhead kick was the first for the 40-million-euro ($52-million) signing Martinez, and in the second half new defender Dante also opened his account with a straightforward header from a Kroos free-kick. The festival of football continued just four minutes later, when Mario Gomez - making first Bundesliga appearance of the season - slammed the ball into the net from a tight angle just 30 seconds after replacing Mario Mandzukic. Dortmund win The champions Dortmund, meanwhile, are still nine points behind Bayern after beating Mainz 2-1 away. It was a potentially tricky fixture in the town where J\u00fcrgen Klopp began his coaching career, and Mainz showed their brilliance in the fourth minute, when Elkin Soto knocked a dream ball into the path of Marco Caligiuri, whose volley fairly screamed into the top right corner. Dortmund's own star-Marco - national team player Marco Reus - leveled the scores just eight minutes later. Reus worked himself some room at the outer edge of the penalty area, and slotted a beautiful 17-meter effort into the far corner. And Dortmund's second goal, just before half-time, was equally aesthetic - a vertical ball bisected the Mainz defense perfectly down the middle, where Polish predator Robert Lewandowski got his eighth league goal of the season with a deft lob over the onrushing Christian Wetklo in goal. Allofs' homecoming Bremen's 1-1 draw at Wolfsburg had a special frisson of its own, as Wolfsburg's newly-minted sporting director Klaus Allofs faced the club he had served as general manager for over a decade. And there was some gesticulating from the Bremen bench in the general direction of the Wolfsburg management when the guests took the lead in the 35th minute. Just seconds after Wolfsburg missed several chances, Marko Arnautovic was left free in the box after Eljero Elia found space on the left and cut the ball back for the Austrian to finish. But Wolfsburg got their own back in the second half. In the 62th minute, Bremen were reduced to ten men when Lukas Schmitz was given second yellow card for a hard tackle on Adelino Vieirinha. Just two minutes later, Bas Dost took advantage of their guests' disorgnaization and smashed the ball into the goal after neat piece of play from Vieirinha. Dirty derby The Franconian derby between Greuther F\u00fcrth and Nuremberg was a cagey affair that ended in a frustrating 0-0 draw. The first half was marked mainly by a straight red card for Nuremberg's Markus Feulner after an ugly, flying lunge on Stephan F\u00fcrstner. But the home side's numerical advantage was short-lived - Sercan Sararer was also sent for an early ice bath after his high elbow on Javier Pinola was adjudged worthy of a second yellow card in the 61st minute. But the aggression in the tackles was not matched by ruthlessness in front of goal, and neither side could eke out any clear chances.",
        "generated_story": "Bayern Munich host Wolfsburg for the first time in over a decade Bayern Munich are set to face off in the Bundesliga on Saturday. The Bundesliga's top club has been without a coach for more than two decades, but the Bavarian side have been struggling to find a way out of the relegation zone for a long time. Last season's Bundesliga champions, Schalke, won their first league title in 13 years by beating Mainz 2-1 on aggregate in their last outing at the Allofs Arena in Munich. Bayern, however, have had a difficult season so far. In the last two seasons, they have struggled to make the most of their chances. On Saturday, though, the German side were able to get back into the game after a disappointing start to the season. For the second consecutive season, Bayern have failed to win a Bundesliga game in a row, and they are now in danger of missing out on the Champions League. \"We are not going to let this happen again,\" coach J\u00fcrgen Klopp said after the match, adding that \"we have a lot of work to do to improve our chances of reaching the next round.\" The Bavarians, meanwhile, are hoping to avoid a repeat of last year's title-clinching defeat to Borussia Dortmund, which they lost 3-0 at home to Hannover 96 in September. They are also looking to add to their record of 10 consecutive Bundesliga wins, having won three of them all. But they will have to wait until the end of next season to see if they can make it back to that level, as they did last season when they were relegated from the top division. That is, until they take on a new coach, Javi Martinez, who is expected to take over as Bayern's head coach in January. He will also be looking for his first Bundesliga win since 2009-10, when he will take charge of a team that has struggled for consistency in recent years. Germany's national football team are currently in fourth place in Germany, behind only Bayern and Dortmund in third place. Bundesliga leaders Bayern will be hoping that their recent form can help them to reach the quarter-finals, where they face a tough task to stay on top of Europe's elite league table. German midfielder Stefan Aigner was the only player to score twice in his last three Bundesliga games, scoring once in each of his three seasons with the club. However, he did not get the chance to impress in Saturday's match against Wolfs. After the break, German striker Christian Wetklo was sent off for an ankle injury and was replaced by German defender Lukas-Jan Huntelaar. Both players were given a red card for their poor performance in that game, with Wiesbaden having to sit out the entire second half with a thigh injury. With the injury, Bremen were forced to play the full 90 minutes without scoring a single goal. Their only goal came in an 11th minute penalty shootout in which a German player was substituted off after being fouled by a Dutch defender. It was only the third time they had scored in two Bundesliga matches this season that Germany have won a league game. And that's not a bad result for Germany. At the very least, it's a good start for them, given that they've been playing well for so long. As a result, there's no reason to be worried about the outcome of this one, even if the result is not the same as the one they won in 2014-15. Just two minutes later, Toni Kroos scored his second Bundesliga goal in as many years, a goal that will give them a chance of making it through the group stages. If they do not win the league, then they'll be in trouble, too, because they could be relegated to a lower-division side. This is a very difficult situation for Bayern to deal with, especially since they don't have an experienced coach and a young player who knows how to cope with such a high-profile player like the Dutchman. There's also the possibility of losing a player in this position. Nevertheless, this is an important step forward for Bavaria's future in Europe and the future of football is brightening up the way Bayern are playing this year. We can't wait to start the new Bundesliga season and we're looking forward to seeing how well the team can perform in 2018-19. I'm sure that we'll get a few more games to build on that. Even if we do, we won't be satisfied with this result. What we can hope for is that the fans will come out and give us something to cheer about, at least in terms of results and results. You know what I mean when I say that, right? That's right, I think that is what we've already seen in my own mind. A big part of it is the fact that I've never seen a game like this before. So, let's hope that it doesn't come to an end. How can we get to this point? I can be"

        "target": "Is China seeking regime-change in North Korea? The sudden reduction in aggressive rhetoric and actions by North Korea has led to suggestions that Pyongyang has realized it has pushed its only ally in the region to the brink of severing its friendship. The announcement in Pyongyang on May 13 of the promotion of Jang Jong-nam to \"minister of the People's Armed Forces\" came out of the blue. Until recently, the little-known commander of an army corps in coastal Kangwon Province, Jang has replaced Kim Kyok-sik, a four-star general with a long track record of loyal service to the regime. The reasons for 70-year-old Kim's replacement are not clear - as with most of the political maneuvers in North Korea - but it may have been his loyalty that cost him his position in the politburo. Kim was widely seen as a hawk in the regime and is believed to have been in command of the operation to shell the South Korean island of Yeonpyeongdo in November 2010, an incident that killed four people, destroyed civilians' homes and infrastructure and dramatically worsened the already strained relationship between Pyongyang and Seoul. By sacrificing Kim, analysts believe, North Korea is signaling that it is backing away from the confrontational stance it adopted after the United Nations imposed new sanctions in the wake of the nation's third underground nuclear test in February. And there are other indicators that Pyongyang is seeking to return to the status quo. The North's troops have been permitted to step down from the highest state of preparedness for war that was initially ordered when South Korea and the US began a series of annual military exercises. Missiles withdrawn Similarly, two Musudan intermediate-range missiles that were identified as being on mobile launchers being operated in eastern areas of the country have apparently been ordered to return to base. In late April, there was concern that test-launches of the missiles would be a further escalation by Kim Jong-un's government and a message that it would not bow to international pressure to halt its nuclear and missile development programs. But the analysts believe the tokens of Pyongyang's goodwill have come too late. \"For the North Korean leader, this is a very difficult time,\" Toshimitsu Shigemura, a professor at Tokyo's Waseda University and an authority on North Korean affairs, told DW. \"Timing is very important here and it is possible that China is moving to abandon Kim Jong-un. The atmosphere between the two nations is changing. China may have decided that it is time for a regime-change in the North, they will not permit the collapse of the country because they do not want chaos on their own borders.\" Further evidence that Beijing is slowly tightening the screw on its erstwhile ally comes as more state-run financial institutions sever their links with banks in North Korea. The latest institution to adhere to the government's orders to halt transactions across the border is the Bank of China, one of the four major banks in the country, which announced on May 7 that it would cease dealings with the Foreign Trade Bank of North Korea, which has been identified as being involved in Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs. Contingency plan in place Intelligence sources have passed on to DW information that Beijing has a contingency plan in place for when Kim Jong-un's control over the country crumbles. The reports confirm that China is indeed quietly encouraging regime change and is grooming Kim's brother, Kim Jong-nam to take over his role. At 42, Kim Jong-nam is the oldest son of Kim Jong-il, the dictator who ruled North Korea with an iron fist for 17 years until his sudden death in December 2011. Kim Jong-nam had been expected to assume the leadership after his father's death, but fell from favor spectacularly in 2001 when he was detained with two women and a boy aged 4 at Tokyo's Narita International Airport travelling on a forged Dominican Republic passport. He later admitted that he had wanted to visit Disneyland. He subsequently lived in Macau and Beijing, under the close watch of the Chinese authorities. The reports suggest that after Kim Jong-nam is installed in Pyongyang, his brother will be permitted to go into exile, probably in China. The tactic is not without its pitfalls, however, in part due to the efficiency of the campaign to deify their young leader as the future of the nation. Kim Jong-nam as 'new king' \"China may be dreaming of appointing Kim Jong-nam as the new king - and he is more preferable to the West than Kim Jong Un - but the problem is that he is not known in North Korea,\" said Ken Kato, director of Tokyo-based Human Rights in Asia. \"Many people in Japan know much about the North Korean 'Royal Family,' but this information is hidden in North Korea,\" he said. \"Even residents of Pyongyang know very little about Kim Jong-nam.\" Yet the reports are gaining credence among North Korea-watchers. Jun Okumura, a political analyst with the Eurasia Group, told DW that North Korea withdrawing",
        "generated_story": "North Korea's 'new king' Kim Jong-un has become the world's most powerful man. The North Korean leader has been hailed as the new king of North Korea for 17 years. He is also the first leader of the country to be crowned by the People's Armed Forces (PLA) and the United Nations (UN). The country's new leader, Kim Kyok-sik, was born on May 7, 2001, in Pyongyang. In his first public appearance since taking power, he said he was \"very proud\" of his country. \"I am very proud of my country,\" he told reporters at Narita International Airport in Tokyo. On May 13, the Foreign Trade Bank of China (FTRB) announced that it would open a new branch of its foreign trade bank in the city of Waseda, which is located near the border with China. According to the report, \"the new head of state will take over the entire country in a matter of months, and he will be able to make decisions on his own.\" The report also said that Kim would not be allowed to travel to any other country without a visa, but that he would travel with his wife and two children, Jang and Jun Okumura, who are currently studying at the University of Tokyo (U.S.) in Japan. Kim is expected to arrive in Beijing in early May, according to a statement from his office. It is not clear how long Kim will stay in his current position, however, as he has not yet been formally recognized by his government. His father, King Kim Il-sung, is currently in exile in South Korea, where he is believed to have been born in 1945. After his father's death in December 2011, his mother died of a heart attack, leaving him with only a few months to live. Since then, a number of defectors have fled to other countries, including Japan, China, Taiwan, Japan and Vietnam. Some of them are still living in China and have not returned to their home country, while others are living abroad. Many of these defections have taken place in other parts of Asia, such as Hong Kong and Taiwan. But the North Koreans are not the only ones who have come to terms with Kim's rise to power. They are also seeking to change the way they treat each other in their own way. For example, when Kim took power in 2006, there were reports that his family had been forced to flee to China in order to escape the communist regime. Now, they are trying to find a way out of their current situation. One of those countries is the US. Another is China - a country with a long history of human rights abuses. That's why it has taken so long to establish itself as an independent state in Asia. And that's because it doesn't have the resources to deal with the problems that the West has with its own people. This is because the Chinese government has a lot of money to spend on the economy. As a result, it is very difficult for the government to keep up with economic growth and development. So it's not surprising that they have to invest heavily in infrastructure and infrastructure, particularly in education and health care. There's also a need for a strong economy, especially in rural areas, so that people can get to know one another better. However, this isn't the case for all the countries that are struggling with poverty and inequality. China's economy is suffering from a lack of investment and a shortage of skilled workers. What's the problem with this? It's a problem that can only be solved by having the right people to work for you. If you have a job, you know that you can't do that, right? And you don't want to waste your time working for someone who has nothing to do with you, because you're not going to get paid for it. Just ask the people of this country and you won't get the job done. You can never have that kind of success in your life. I think that is a very big problem for us. Let's face it, we've all been through this before. We've had enough of it and we're going through it in our lives. How do we get there? What do you think? How can we make sure that we can make it happen? In the meantime, let's be honest with ourselves and let us know what's going on in this world. Do you really think about the future of our country? Do we really need to talk about it? Let us talk to you about what we have in mind? I'm sure we'll have some answers. Here's what I've learned so far, from my own experience as a businesswoman, I can tell you that I have learned from the experience of working with people who've been in poverty for many years and I know how hard they've worked so hard for me to help them. A lot has changed since I was a child. To me, that seems like the most important thing to me. My father is that"

Among other things, it proposed jail terms for bankers displaying grave malpractice and causing huge damage. Members of the UK's Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards agreed Wednesday that Britain needed a radical overhaul of its scandal-hit lenders. The panel, which was mostly composed of lawmakers, concluded in its final report that senior bankers must be made personally responsible for malpractice through the introduction of a new criminal offence of reckless misconduct. It would carry a prison sentence. The reputation of the country's banking sector had been damaged in recent years by a string of scandals, including Libor rate-rigging, credit insurance mis-selling and a controversy over staff behavior and bonuses in the run-up to the 2008 global financial crisis. The level of malpractice had been \"shocking and widespread,\" said the commission's chairman, Conservative party lawmaker Andrew Tyrie. RBS cut in two? \"Taxpayers and customers have lost out, and the economy has suffered,\" the 500-page report said. \"Under our recommendations, senior bankers who seriously damage their banks or put taxpayers' money at risk can expect to be fined, banned from the industry or in the worst cases go to jail.\" The commission called for bankers to sign up to a new code of conduct under which all key responsibilities within a bank would be assigned to specific senior officials who would be held responsible. The panel also proposed that more remuneration for bankers should be deferred for longer periods of up to ten years in order to \"reflect the longer run balance between business risks and rewards.\" The commission recommended that the government consider splitting the state-rescued Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) into a good bank and a bad one mopping up toxic assets.

It called on the government to investigate allegations that the bank was involved in a criminal conspiracy to defraud the British banking system. \"There is no evidence to suggest that this is the case,\" said Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the commission's parliamentary commission on banking standards, in an interview published on Wednesday. He said the inquiry was being led by the Office of Parliamentary Commissioner for Financial Conduct (OPC). \"We are going to look into these allegations,\" he said, adding that he was not aware of any such allegations. A spokesman for the Commission said he had not seen any evidence of wrongdoing in relation to the Libor benchmark, the benchmark interest rate (Libor), which is used to calculate the amount of money a bank can borrow from the central bank. But he added that there was \"no evidence that any bank had committed any wrongdoing.\" The Commission's report is expected to be released on Thursday, after which it will issue a report on its findings and recommendations for further investigation. Read more: The bank Mafia in Britain: How to crack down on bank fraud, corruption and money laundering in 2008, 2008 and 2009 The inquiry's findings are the first to come to light since the financial crisis of 2008-09, when the banks were accused of being the ringleaders of a global financial crime, according to a Reuters report. In addition, it said there were \"serious allegations\" of corruption within the BNP Paribas group of banks, including that they were under investigation by police and the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) for failing to report suspicious bank activity. According to an internal inquiry report, a total of 10,000 people have been arrested since 2008 in connection with the scandal. Some of them were convicted of bank misconduct, while others were found to have committed other crimes, such as stealing money from banks and other financial institutions. Many of these people are still in prison, and some have even been sentenced to up to ten years in jail for their involvement in financial crimes. Others, however, are being tried in absentia. One of those arrested is a former bank executive who worked for Barclays, who was convicted in 2009 of banking fraud. Another has been charged with fraud under the Financial Crimes Act (FCA) which prohibits the use of force against banks. Other charges have also been brought against the company, but the investigation has not been ruled out as an ongoing criminal case. There is also a lack of information about the alleged bank mafia, as well as the fact that some of its employees are under house arrest. This is not a new criminal offense, though, given that many banks have a long history of criminal activity and that it's not uncommon for banks to carry out criminal activities. For example, one bank in London has a large number of employees who are suspected of having committed crimes in their home town of London, where they work as part of an organised crime syndicate. That's because they are not allowed to do business with other banks in England and Wales, for example. And that's the reason why many of their employees have had to leave the country for years without a job, even though they don't have the money to pay for it. At the same time, there's a lot of pressure on them to keep their jobs and to make sure they're doing the right thing, too, because of what they've been doing for so long. If they do not do their job properly, they will be prosecuted for crimes that are committed in other countries. As a result, this could be a huge problem for them, if they continue to operate in this country. Britain's banking regulator is currently investigating the issue of whether they have done their part to ensure that banks are doing their bit to protect the interests of people who have no business in that country's financial system, like Barclays and Deutsche Bank, or any other bank, to act as a financial institution that is responsible for lending to people in need of financial aid. They are also being investigated for financial fraud in order to avoid being caught up in criminal cases. Financial crimes are a big problem in many countries, particularly in banking. Bank fraud is something that can happen to anyone who doesn't know who is doing business there and who has access to their own bank accounts. What's more, banks can't do anything to help the people they know. I'm not sure how long they can do that, I think it would be very difficult to get out of this situation. You can see why the situation is so difficult for people to understand what's going on in these countries and why they should be doing that. We're not the only ones who do it, we'll have to find out what we know what is happening to them. So,"

They were originally arrested for taking photographs of restricted areas. Slovak citizens detained by the Iranian authorities on suspicion of taking photographs out of bounds have returned home, said Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico. Eight people in total were arrested in May after taking photographs of restricted areas. A Slovakian news website said the group was detained near the central city of Isfahan, where Iran has nuclear facilities. The six that have been freed attended a news conference held by Prime Minister Fico in the capital, Bratislava on Sunday. Fico told reporters that the government was working to secure the release of the remaining two paragliders who are stiil in custody. \"Negotiations were fair and their result is the release of six out of eight detainees,\" Fico was quoted as saying on the government's website. He added that Slovakia had not made any \"financial commitments\" in the negotiation process. Detainees 'unaware' of rule-breaking One of the released paragliders, Vladislav Frigo, said the group did not break any rules it was aware of. \"We had information that there was a ban on taking photographs below the height of 2,300 metres. We were taking pictures from higher (altitudes),\" said Frigo. He added that the detainees were well treated, had access to television, a refrigerator and could cook for themselves as well as getting regular meals. Foreign nationals accused of spying In recent years, Iran has levelled accusations of espionage against both foreign nationals and Iranians. Two U.S. citizens - Josh Fattal and Shane Bauer - were sentenced to eight years in jail for spying after being arrested while hiking along the Iraq-Iran border in 2009. They denied espionage - neighbouring Oman helped secure their release in 2011 by posting bail of 1-million US dollars (756,000 euros). Last year, Iranian-American Amir Hekmati was sentenced to death for spying for the CIA, but judges overturned the decision and ordered a retrial. lw/ipj (Reuters, dpa)",
        "generated_story": "Six Slovak paragliders released by Iranian authorities on suspicion of spying in Iran Six Slovaks have been released from detention by the United States after being released on charges of espionage. The men, who were released without charge on Sunday, were taken to the US Consulate in New York, where they were being held in custody for eight years, according to a US court. They were arrested in the eastern city of Bratislava, which is home to some of the country's most important political and economic institutions. One of them, Vladislav Frigo, has been detained in Tehran since 2009. He was taken into custody in May for questioning over allegations that he had been spying for the Iranian government. Fico, a former deputy foreign minister in Slovakia's parliament, said he was released after a two-week stay in detention. \"I am not a spy, I am a human being,\" he said, adding that the charges against the men were not related to his work as a foreign intelligence officer. According to court documents, the arrests were made on the basis of information gleaned from a phone call between the two men on May 24, 2009, and May 25, 2011, when they had returned to Slovakia from Iran. In addition, they have also been accused of having been involved in a series of cyber-espionage activities, including hacking into the computer of an Iranian-controlled computer network. Some of these activities took place between 2009 and 2011 and were carried out with the aim of gaining access to information that could be used to obtain information about the activities of other people. At the time of their arrest, some 50,000 people were believed to be living in exile in Russia, while others had fled to Iran to escape arrest. Most of those arrested were from Slovakia, but a number of others from the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Slovakia were among the first to receive the information. A total of 1.56 million euros ($1.6 million) was seized from them in 2011. More than a quarter of that money went to Iranian intelligence, officials said. Authorities said they believed the suspects were Iranian nationals and that they would be extradited to Tehran to face espionage charges. However, there was no indication of any connection between Iran and the spying operation. Iranian officials have denied the allegations, saying they did not have any knowledge of what was going on in their country. Iran has denied any involvement and said it is not responsible for its actions. Tehran has said that it has no plans to extradite any of its nationals to its country of origin. It has also denied accusations of human rights abuses against its citizens and accused it of trying to influence the outcome of a judicial inquiry into its nuclear program. There is no evidence that Iran is a sponsor of terrorism, however, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has accused the government of attempting to interfere with a referendum on whether the referendum should be held on Iran's nuclear deal with world powers. Iranians have repeatedly accused Slovakia of being a \"terrorist state\" in order to gain influence over the political process. This has led to accusations that Tehran is seeking to overthrow the democratically elected government in Moscow and other countries in an attempt to undermine the democratic process, as well as to try to weaken the regime's ability to impose its own political system. Russian President Vladimir Putin has called for an end to sanctions against Iran, accusing the former communist regime of violating international law and violating the Geneva accords. Moscow denies the accusations and says it does not want to do anything to harm the people of Slovakia. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Monday that \"the Iranian regime is doing everything it can to protect its people.\" The two countries have a long history of cooperation and cooperation with each other and are cooperating on a wide range of issues, such as the Iran nuclear issue. Russia's Foreign Ministry said the investigation was ongoing and it was not possible to find any evidence of Iranian involvement in any way. Slovakia has long been a close ally of Iran in its dealings with Tehran. But it's not the only country that has done so. For example, Iran denies that its president is an enemy of democracy and has repeatedly denied allegations of meddling in elections in Ukraine and in other European countries. On Sunday the CIA accused Iran of supporting the overthrow of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's regime in 2009 - a charge Tehran denies - and Tehran denied it. US intelligence agencies have accused Tehran of doing the same. Analysts have said Tehran's government has not been able to provide any information on what is happening in relation to this case. Officials in both countries are also investigating the case and have not ruled out the possibility of extraditing the Iranians. Meanwhile, Russian intelligence officials say they are not aware of allegations against Iranian diplomats in Washington, D.C. - Reuters, AP, AFP, dpa, Reuters and Reuters have reported that Iranian state-run news agency, RT, reported on its website, citing a source familiar with intelligence services, that Moscow is considering a possible extradition request from Tehran - but it could not confirm the existence of such an investigation.

The 89-year-old did not say when exactly his resignation would take effect. Calling the move a personal decision, President Giorgio Napolitano made his announcement during an end-of-year speech on Wednesday. \"I'm about to step down, to resign as the constitution expressly allows,\" he said, adding. \"I've reached an age that brings with it growing limitations and difficulties for me to do my institutional duties, which are complex and very demanding.\" Though he did not say when his resignation would take effect, a potential date is January 13 when Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi is due to give up the country's rotating six-month presidency of the Council of the European Union. Renzi faces a political challenge in organizing a replacement for Napolitano, dubbed by Italian media as \"King George.\" The president has served as a key intermediary between political parties through numerous changes in government and other tricky political situations. Napolitano, a former communist respected by Europe and Washington, took office in 2006. At the end of his seven-year mandate in 2013, he was asked to stay on because parliament could not agree on his successor. At the time he warned he may not serve out the full term, given his age. In Italy, presidents have loosely-defined powers including the ability to nominate prime ministers, dissolve parliament and veto legislation, as well as use the moral authority of the office to influence politics. se/cmk (dpa, Reuters)",
        "generated_story": "Giorgio Napolitano resigns as Italy's president Italian President Matteo Renzi has resigned as the country's head of state, replacing him with his deputy. Renz, who has been in office since 2006, said on Wednesday that he would step down from his post at the end of the year. \"I am not going to resign, I will not resign,\" he said in a statement, adding that his resignation was the result of a \"political crisis\" in Italy. The president's resignation comes after a series of resignations over the past two years, including the resignation of his predecessor, Gianni Infantino, on January 13, 2013. He was replaced by Italian Prime Minister Giuseppoli who had been appointed to the post of president in 2006. In his first year as president of Italy, the former Italian prime minister had led Italy from 2006 to 2013, when he took office in 2007. Since then, he has presided over a number of crises in Europe and the United States, and has led the European Union through several crises. One of those crises was when Italy became the first country in the world to have a president who refused to accept the terms of an EU membership. Italy is the only European country without a permanent president, which means that it has no chance of being able to elect a new president. Italian media reported that the Italian president had resigned from the position on Tuesday, saying he was \"disappointed\" with the way Italy was being treated by the EU and that \"it was not a good time for Italy to be in this position.\" The Italian news agency dpa said that Italy would not be allowed to take part in any new elections until the new government was elected in January. It said the president would have to decide whether to stay on or leave the job until a successor could be appointed. According to a Reuters report, Italy will take the next step in its quest to find a replacement for the outgoing president after the current government's failure to make progress on its economic reform agenda. France, Germany, Austria, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Albania, Bulgaria, Turkey, Greece, Portugal, Spain and Italy were to meet in Rome on Thursday to discuss the future of Europe's economic and political system. Napoli, an outspoken critic of EU policies, has said he is not interested in taking a position of power in his own country. On Wednesday he announced his intention to leave office, calling for a change of government in order to focus on economic reforms. His resignation will be announced at a press conference in Milan on Jan. 13 and a news conference at which he will address the nation's parliament, according to an Italian newspaper, The Sunday Times, a daily daily newspaper reported, citing a source close to him as well as a person familiar with Italian politics who spoke on condition of anonymity because he had not been invited to attend the meeting. French President Francois Hollande has also called for an emergency meeting of European leaders in Strasbourg, France and Germany to consider the possibility of holding a summit of leaders of all EU countries on the continent next year, but he did not rule out a possible summit in Brussels, where he could meet with President Nicolas Sarkozy and other EU leaders. However, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius has not ruled out the idea of having a meeting between the two of them, despite the fact that France's economy is suffering from a lack of economic growth in recent years. But the French president has repeatedly said his country is \"not ready for that kind of growth\" and said it is too early to talk about the situation in France. A spokesman for France would only say whether France was ready to join the summit, if it was a chance for it to happen. That would be an important step forward, however, since France is still in talks with Italy and France are unlikely to agree on a plan to move forward with a deal to reduce the size of its budget deficit. For now, it remains unclear whether the negotiations are going ahead. There is no agreement on how to do so, though France has already agreed to hold talks in Paris, Rome and Rome will continue to press ahead with its plans to cooperate with France to try to reach a solution to its debt crisis. If the talks are not agreed on, there will still be a political solution. This is a step toward a resolution to end the crisis, even if France does not agree to extend its bailout package to Italy in 2014. At the same time, Paris is expected to seek a fresh round of negotiations with Rome to resolve the financial crisis that has plagued the eurozone crisis and which is likely to lead to further economic problems, while Italy has a long-term political crisis in which the euro zone is in danger of falling into recession. Paris has yet to sign an agreement with Brussels. Rome is also considering a referendum on whether or not it should take a further step towards a European exit from its austerity package, as France wants to avoid a financial bailout of $1.5 billion (Reuters, AFP, Reuters) The European Commission, Dpa reported"

Although they sent no representatives to Switzerland, Islamists have agreed to halt the fighting. The Islamist-backed militia alliance that took over Tripoli and installed its own government announced a ceasefire on Friday, following a breakthrough in Geneva-based peace talks. Despite not attending the UN-brokered meeting, the militias have agreed to \"a ceasefire on all fronts,\" according to a statement issued by Islamist group Fajr Libya (Libya Dawn). The only condition is that \"the other parties respect the truce.\" The announcement came hours after the United Nations declared that Libya's warring factions had agreed to a roadmap for forming a unity government. Nearly four years after a NATO-backed revolt saw Moammar Gadhafi removed from power, two rival governments each backed by different groups of militias have plunged the country back into chaos and threatened all-out civil war. After the elected government of Prime Minister Abdullah al-Thinni was forced out of Tripoli by Libya Dawn, it was forced to move to the far eastern city of Tobruk while Libya Dawn reinstated the old parliament known as the GNC. The fighting and violence has displaced hundreds of thousands of civilians, left hundreds killed and thousands wounded. Most foreign diplomats fled the country and shut their embassies last year. The Tobruk government, as well as a few other factions who favor a peaceful resolution, came to Geneva to work on \"confidence-building measures,\" which includes the release of detainees from both sides, opening closed ports and securing safe freedom of movement around the country. es/bw (AP, AFP, Reuters)",

The ceasefire brokered by the United Nations Security Council (UN) and Libyan Dawn, a pro-government rebel group, came to a truce in the eastern city of Misrata on the outskirts of the country's capital, Tripoli. It was the second day of talks between two rival factions in which the two sides agreed to resume talks on Saturday. A ceasefire was declared after a day-long ceasefire, the UN said in a statement, adding that the ceasefire would last for at least two more days. \"We will continue to monitor the situation,\" the statement said, referring to the current situation in Libya, which has been in turmoil for more than four years. In the past, there have been several failed attempts to reach a peace agreement, but this time, it was not to be achieved, as the peace process had been called off, according to UN spokesman Abdullah al-Thinni, who said the talks were continuing despite a lack of progress by both sides. According to Reuters news agency, \"the ceasefire is in place for the first time since the beginning of this year, and it will last until the end of next year.\" The UN also said it would hold a meeting with the Libyan government in Tripoli to discuss the future of Libya and its future. But it did not say whether the truce would be extended beyond the next day's talks. Instead, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he was \"very optimistic\" about the prospects for a peaceful transition of power. He added that \"we are hopeful that we will be able to find a way forward.\" (Reuters, AFP, AP) (AFP, Reuters) The Libyan National Congress (GNC) has called for an end to violence and a cease-fire between rival armed groups in eastern and western Libya. Its members are expected to meet again on Sunday, after which they will hold talks with a number of other rebel groups, including the armed forces, to try to end the violence. Libya's government, however, has rejected the idea of a new ceasefire and said that it has not yet reached a deal with any of its armed factions. This is the latest step in an attempt to break the deadlock. (Photo: Reuters/AFP/File) \"There is no longer any agreement on how to resolve the conflict,\" said a spokesman for Libyan state-run media outlet, The New York Times, citing an unnamed source familiar with Libyan security sources. However, this is not the case in this case. There is still a long way to go in terms of negotiations, he added, saying that there is \"no agreement yet on what to do. We are not ready to talk about this yet.\" \"It is a matter of time before we reach an agreement,\" he said. 'We are going to have to see if we can get a resolution to this issue.\" A UN statement on Thursday said there was no agreement in principle on whether or not it should be allowed to take place. On Friday a UN resolution was signed in Geneva, Switzerland, calling on all sides to agree on an interim ceasefire. At the same time the international community has also agreed on a transitional government for Libya to return to normalcy. That is, if the new government does not agree with its previous government's demands. If the agreement is reached, that would mean that Libya will not have a government that is willing to give up its position. For now, all the parties have agreed that they are committed to an orderly transition and that will only be agreed upon by all parties involved. As a result, no deal can be reached on this point. And there are no guarantees that this will happen, at the very least, for now. You can't talk to me. I think that's a good thing, because I'm not sure what is going on right now and I don't know what I can do about it. Let's just say that I have no idea what we are talking about. What can we do? We will see what happens next, I hope that all of us can agree to that. After all, we have the right to make a decision and we'll see how it is done. So far, so far the only thing that has happened is that no one has said anything to us. No agreement has yet been reached. Meanwhile, international observers are still working to establish a political solution for this conflict. They are also working on setting up a permanent government. With the support of international mediators, though, they have not reached an acceptable solution. One thing is clear: Libya is unlikely to accept the outcome of these talks, even if it's not possible to achieve a solution that can happen within the framework of an agreed agreement. More than three days from now the negotiations are likely to happen. Here is one thing I am sure of that, in fact, one of those talks are already"

Prison guards in several European countries carried out reprisals against detainees who talked to the Council of Europe's Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT), the new CPT report has revealed. The council considers this a violation of the spirit of cooperation between the CPT and the Council of Europe's member states. According to the CPT's 24th General Report, released on Wednesday, reprisals were carried out against prisoners in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Greece, Hungary, Moldova, Russia, Spain, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and Ukraine. \"Intimidation or retaliation against persons the CPT has interviewed may not only violate their human rights but also strikes a blow to the preventive mechanism established by the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture,\" CPT President Letif H\u00fcseynov said in a statement. \"I urge national authorities to respect their obligation to prevent, investigate and punish such actions.\" The report also highlighted several problems with the detention of juveniles around Europe, and proposed a series of practical measures to protect young people's rights when detained. Ad hoc visits The little-known CPT, now 25 years old, represents a unique approach to international torture prevention. A team of specialists make roughly 180 visits a year to all kinds of detention centers (including prisons, police stations, holding centers for immigration detainees, psychiatric hospitals, and even social care homes) all across the 47-member Council of Europe - one of the few international blocs that offer platforms for dialogue with Eastern European regimes considered to have poor human rights records, such as Russia, Azerbaijan, and Ukraine. The method combines the carrot of talks with government officials and the stick of ad hoc visits, which all members are committed to allowing into their prisons. Once inside, the CPT also has the right to interview any detainees it chooses - in private, though of course the detainees have the right to refuse. \"The first thing to say is how important the CPT is,\" said Carla Ferstman, director of Redress, a UK-based organization that helps torture survivors. \"As a result of their boot work over a very long period of time, the UN has set up a global system which in many ways mirrors the approach of the CPT.\" But given that the committee has no powers to enforce its proposals to governments, there are question marks over its effectiveness. \"In the report, they complain about how some of the recommendations they've made have not been implemented,\" said Ferstman. \"It's a sign that they're a little bit frustrated.\" But in the long run, she maintains, the CPT has more than proved its value. \"The dialogue that they are able to have is really important,\" she said. \"Looking long-term, they have been very effective.\" CIA collusion, asylum seekers The CPT's report comes a day after Amnesty International released its own report on European collusion with the CIA's torture program. While the CPT's report examines more prosaic day-to-day mistreatment, rather than mass rendition of terrorist suspects at the behest of the US, there are obvious links between the two, since some countries - such as Poland, Macedonia, and the UK - are highlighted in both reports. \"What is finally coming out in all of this is that the Europeans, despite all the criticism of the Bush and Obama administrations on the use of torture - so many of them connived,\" said Judy Dempsey, senior associate at Carnegie Europe. \"It's really a double standard. This report is quite damning and quite shameful, and it follows the Amnesty International one as well.\" The CPT's work also mentions the mistreatment of asylum seekers, a problem increasingly afflicting European countries that take in the largest number of asylum seekers - particularly Spain, Italy, and Greece. \"With Greece there are two things to remember,\" Dempsey told DW. \"A - the appalling situation of the prison system, and B - the lack of training among police of how to deal with asylum seekers. Awful things have happened. Parallel to this is the illegal detention centers. There have been lots of cases of terrible mistreatment over the last several years.\" \"Immigration detention is a growing issue,\" added Ferstman. \"In the UK, there was a whole parliamentary inquiry into one immigration detention center, where some of the women alleged that guards propositioned them in order to get quick treatment on their claims. Each country has its own history of torture.\"",
        "generated_story": "The CPT is a European problem too -- and it's time to step up its game The European Convention for the Prevention of Torture (CPT) is not just about torture. It's also about human rights, too. The Council of Europe's executive director, Judy Dempsey, told DW that it was time for Europe to take a step back. \"We have a long way to go,\" she said, adding that \"we have to do something about it.\" \"The fact that we have so many people who have been subjected to torture in the last several years is an indication of how much we are willing to contribute to the prevention of torture,\" said Dempsey. She added that the United States should \"step up our game\" and \"do more to protect the rights of those who suffer torture.\" She said the U.S. government should take steps to prevent torture, but it would be a mistake to not do so, she added. US President Barack Obama has repeatedly called on European governments to act on the issue, saying it is \"one of the most pressing issues facing Europe right now.\" The US president, however, has also called for a change in European law, which he has said is needed in order to combat torture and other forms of torturing. He also said that he would like to see the US take action against torture as well as other countries that have done so in recent years, such as Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Russia and the Netherlands. In the past, this has been the case in Europe, where torture has become a major problem. But now, it seems, there is no such thing as an easy solution. For the first time since the end of World War II, the European Parliament voted in favor of a bill that would have allowed torture to be carried out without the use of force. That bill was signed by President George W. Bush in 2003, when he was still in office. Since then, many European countries have tried to make it easier for torture victims to get away with it. Now, they are trying to change that. They are working on a new law that will make torture less of an issue for Europeans, and they will be able to use it in their own way, rather than having to deal with the consequences of their actions. This is something that should not be allowed to happen in any other country. And it shouldn't be an obstacle to European efforts to tackle the problem, because it should be done in a way that is fair to all of us, including in our own countries. There's a lot of pressure on our governments, especially in countries like Germany and France. At the same time, that pressure is being put on governments in many countries, particularly in places like Poland and Romania, who are not particularly well-known for their treatment of prisoners. Germany is one such country, for example, with a large number of people suffering from torture at home and abroad. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said in an interview with DW on Wednesday that she was \"deeply concerned\" about the lack of action by the German government against the torture of its own citizens. Merkel, meanwhile, said she had \"no doubt\" that torture was a \"very serious problem\" in her country and that her government would do everything in its power to stop it from happening. Her comments came in response to a question from DW's Carla Ferstman, a German journalist who has covered torture for more than 25 years. According to her, German President Letif H\u00fcseynov said Germany was not the only country that had a problem with torture during the war on terror. However, he added, \"It's not only Europe that has suffered from this kind of situation. We are also facing a similar problem in this regard. I think that Europe is going to need to work on this issue.\" German Foreign Minister Carl Bildt said: \"I think we should do a better job of dealing with this problem than we do in other parts of our country.\" Germany's Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday that Germany would not allow torture on its territory. Berlin's foreign ministry said it planned to introduce a draft bill on torture this year, calling for an independent investigation into torture cases in Germany. Washington is also considering a proposal to create a special committee to investigate the matter, according to which the report is expected to come up with recommendations by a committee of experts. On Wednesday, Berlin and Berlin agreed to hold a meeting in Brussels to discuss the topic. A day after the meeting was scheduled to begin, Merkel and Merkel were due to meet in Berlin, in which they would discuss how to improve the situation in Poland, Turkey and elsewhere. President Obama's visit to Berlin was also a chance for Germany to show its commitment to ending the practice, as it has for many years been a good example of what it means to have an open and transparent dialogue with our people. Europe has a strong position on torture victims and their families. As a result, we will continue to try to find a solution to ensure that this is the"

        "target": "Dresden marks 70 years since massive Allied bombing Seventy years ago, Allied bombers attacked Dresden, killing tens of thousands of people, the majority of them civilians and refugees. Every year, the East German city remembers its dead. DW's Naomi Conrad was on hand. As the tram trundled through Dresden's drab suburbs on Friday morning, a prim, elderly woman suddenly turned to her friend sitting on the seat beside her: \"You know, my mother never told me about the bombings.\" She shrugged, then, after a moment's pause, continued. \"It must have been such unspeakable hell that she just couldn't talk about it,\" the woman said. She was referring to February 13, 1945 - the morning, exactly 70 years ago, when Allied bombers swooped down on an unsuspecting city famous for its baroque architecture and that, until that point, had survived the war mostly unscathed. That was to change in the course of three dreadful days: As the bombs rained down on the city, its churches and palaces were turned to rubble. Up to 25,000 people - many of them refugees fleeing the advancing Soviet Red Army - died in the inferno that raged in the city for days. \"There was nothing left, nothing,\" a frail, bent man with a checkered cap recalled, \"just rubble and death.\" He was leaning on the balustrade of a viewing platform in Dresden's old gasometer, staring down at the 360-degree painting by the Iranian-German artist Yadegar Asisi; sirens howled from hidden speakers and strobe lighting illuminated the ruined churches and black smoke billowing from the burnt skeletons that were once buildings. The man swallowed, his voice hoarse, barely audible: \"It's so hard being here.\" The soundtrack and images, he said, \"bring back too many memories.\" 'So, so many dead' He was 15, he recalled, working on a school essay when the sirens began to wail. He never finished the essay. Instead, he ran for shelter with his family. When they returned home three days later, the roof had been blown off, the windows smashed. \"But we were lucky: We survived,\" he said. \"There were so, so many dead.\" His voice broke and, muttering an apology, he shuffled off. The bombings were intended to break the German population's morale - a decision that to many was incomprehensible, given that the war had long been decided and Dresden's economic and strategic importance was relatively minimal. Consequently, the death and destruction wreaked by the Allied bombers quickly became a tool, first for the Nazi propagandists in the last months of the war, then by the East German regime for its anti-West propaganda, and then later by neo-Nazi groups, who traditionally congregate on February 13. Even today, \"the debate continues about guilt and innocence, even about the exact number of victims,\" Dresden Mayor Helma Orosz told a packed audience, including delegations from abroad, gathered for a memorial service in the city's Frauenkirche, which in 2005 was rebuilt with the help of private donations after Germany's reunification, many of them from the United States and Great Britain. Call for peace \"War, hatred and violence begin in people's minds,\" Orosz said. \"We must resist any attempt at once again categorizing people based on their origin and skin color,\" she added, referring to what has often been described as a right-wing catchall movement called PEGIDA, generally translated as Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West, which has taken to the streets in Dresden since October. Later, on a platform overlooking thousands of people, many of them wearing white roses as a sign of peace while bracing the icy cold outside the church, Orosz called on Dresden to remember every victim of the Nazi terror - a plea that was reiterated by German President Joachim Gauck when he took to the microphone: \u201cWe don't want the pain that people suffered here to be misused by others.\u201d Behind him, the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, who, back in the Frauenkirche, had talked of the \u201cmiracle that peace in Europe represents,\u201d leaned in closer to his interpreter. Then, as evening fell over Dresden and church bells tolled, thousands - possibly as many as 10,000, according to the city's press office - lined up along Dresden's riverfront, holding hands to commemorate the dead and call for peace as police men dressed in black riot gear looked on. \"I can remember it all,\" Siegfriede Leonhard, a vivacious woman in her late 70s said. She was 7 when the bombs fell, she said, and had been coming to the commemorations in Dresden \"for at least 60 years.\" Sometimes, she said, stomping her feet to keep warm, she wondered whether she shouldn't remember at home, alone. \"",
        "generated_story": "German city of Dresden hit by Allied bombings German police said on Friday that they had been bombarded by German bombers on February 13, 1945. The attack was the first of its kind in the country since World War II, when the Red Army attacked the city. It was one of the most devastating attacks on German soil in 70 years. German authorities blamed the bombing on the Soviet Union, which they said was responsible for the death of thousands of civilians. They said the attacks were carried out by a Soviet-backed air force, and that the German government was trying to prevent it from happening again. \"It's a very sad day,\" said Helma Orosz, a police spokeswoman in Dresden. She said she was not aware of what had happened, but that it was \"very difficult to understand what was going on at the time.\" She added: \"I don't know what to say to that. I can only say that I am very saddened by what has happened.\" The bombing was part of a series of events that took place over the course of three days, including the attack on Dresden's Frauenkirche, where a number of German soldiers were killed by the Allied bombing campaign. In the aftermath, the government of Chancellor Joachim Gauck ordered the evacuation of all German citizens from Dresden and other German cities, as well as the deployment of troops to other parts of Germany and the surrounding areas. Helm\u00c3\u0080\u0099s father, Siegfriede Leonhard, was among those who fled to Germany. He died in a plane crash in eastern Germany in 1945 and was buried in an unmarked grave, according to German news agency PEGIDA. His death, however, did not come as a surprise to his family, who had come to Dresden from Germany to escape from the war. Germany's war crimes tribunal ruled that Germany had committed crimes against the people, not against them. A German court ruled in his favor, saying that Nazi Germany should not be allowed to take part in any of these crimes. According to the court's decision, Germany must not have committed any crimes, because it would have been an act of war and not a crime. But it is not the only crime in Germany that has been committed in such a way. There are also many other crimes committed by Germany, for example, against Jews and against Christians, in which the Nazi regime was convicted of genocide and sentenced to life in prison. And there are many more crimes that have gone unpunished, such as murder, torture and torture. Many of those crimes were committed during the last months of Nazi rule. Some of them, like the murder of Adolf Hitler, are still unsolved. However, there is no doubt about the fact that there was a great deal of hatred between the two camps. That is why the Berlin Wall was built. This is the reason why Germany is still the largest country in Europe, with more than 1.5 million people living there every year. Since the fall of Berlin in September 1945, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has called for a \"total reunification of Europe\" with the West. Berlin has also called on Berlin to reunite Germany with its former communist neighbors. On Friday, Berlin's mayor, Yadegar Asisi, told DW that Berlin would be holding a press conference to commemorate the anniversary of Hitler's death in August 1945 - a day after the end of his term as chancellor. For Berlin, he said, \"We have to remember that we have a long way to go before we are able to return to our former glory. We are not going to give up on Germany.\" German President Justin Welby, meanwhile, said that he would like to see Berlin reunified with Germany as soon as possible, adding that \"we will continue to work together to make it a better place for all of us to live.\" Germany has long been a country of peace and prosperity, even if it's not always easy to do so. As a result, it has become more and more difficult for German people to find peace in their own country, especially when it comes to their country's reunions. Despite this, many Germans still feel a sense of isolation from each other. At the same time, this is a difficult time for many people who have lived in this country for so long and who want to be reunited with their families and friends. These are the reasons why many German-speakers have left their homes and families in Berlin. Germans have long sought to rebuild their lives in order to get back to a normal life. Now, they have no choice but to come back and rebuild the lives of their people. To do that, I think we need to look at what Germany did in terms of democracy and human rights. How can we do this? How do we get there? What do you do? Do you think the Germans do it? Is there a solution? Are you prepared for that? Did you have any idea what the future holds in store for you? Or is there something you can do in your own home? Germany?"

The Associated Press reports that at least 17 people were killed and more than 100 injured after a Carnival ship collided with the ship's hull. At least 19 people died in the accident, which took place at a port city in northern Haiti. Police said they were investigating the cause of the disaster, adding that it could have been caused by a malfunctioning cruise ship. Haitian authorities have said that the vessel's crew was on the way to port when it was hit by an explosion and fire. Authorities have not said what caused the explosion, but they said it appeared to be the result of an accident between a ship and a container ship that had been leaking fuel. \"The ship was not damaged,\" said Michel Martelly, a spokesman for the port's port authority. He added that police were searching for a suspect in connection to the incident. Several other ships were also involved in a similar incident, according to local media reports. One ship sank, another was damaged and another sank. More than a dozen other vessels were damaged, the AP reported. Many of those involved were carrying containers of food, water and other supplies, while others were being used to store the food. Some of them were used as refrigerators. Other ships, however, were not involved. In addition, one ship carrying food and water was also damaged. Officials said there were no reports of any injuries. There was no immediate word on how many people had died or what kind of damage was being done to it. It is not clear whether there was a fire or whether the crew had deliberately set off the boat, or if they had intentionally set it off. Investigators are still trying to determine the exact cause, and they are not ruling out the possibility that there could be more fatalities. According to a preliminary report by the Haitian news agency AP, several ships and planes were involved, including a helicopter, as well as a minibus carrying the cargo. Haiti has been plagued by deadly accidents in recent years. On Tuesday, two ships collided, with one sinking and the other sinking, leaving one person dead and several others injured. A total of 18 bodies were recovered from the wreck, officials said. Reuters reported on Tuesday evening, saying that several people have died and dozens more were injured in other accidents. Among the dead were two people who were believed to have drowned during the storm, who died after being swept away by debris from a flooded ship, said a local police spokesman. An AP reporter who spoke on condition of anonymity said he was unable to confirm the death toll was \"very high\" because of a lack of information on what had happened to him and that he had not been informed of what was going on. AP also reported that an investigation was underway into the circumstances surrounding the crash, in which a man was found dead in an abandoned ship near the town of Barikad Crew. Another man died when his car was swept into a canal, an AP report said, when he tried to rescue a woman who had fallen off a bridge. This is the first time that a Haitian ship has ever been swept through the canal in its history, it said: \"It's a very sad day for this country. I'm very sorry to say that we have lost a lot of people. We are very saddened by this tragedy. But we are hopeful that this will not happen again, because we will be able to recover all of our lost lives.\" The accident occurred during Carnival's second day of Carnival, where Carnival is held every year. Last year, Carnival was held on Carnival grounds in St. Vincent, Haiti, for two days. Since then, thousands of Haitians have fled the country's capital, Guadeloupe, to escape the violence. Carnival organizers have blamed the tragedy on a series of accidents that have taken place there. They have appealed for help from local authorities. However, they have yet to receive any information about what happened. And they say the investigation is still ongoing. For now, there is no word yet on who was responsible for what has happened in this case. That's not the only thing that has led to this accident. What we do know is that no one knows what is going to happen to us. If we can't find out, we don't know what will happen next. Let's hope that all the victims of this disaster will come to terms with what we've learned from this incident and we won't have to go back to where we came from.\" Reuters, AP reports, citing a source familiar with security concerns, reported Reuters. Meanwhile, news agencies said the damage is expected to continue to worsen as more people are returning to Haiti after the Carnival season ends this year and there are plans to return to their homes. Experts say it is unlikely that Haiti will have a repeat of last year's carnival, though the situation is likely to remain the same, given the fact that Carnival has not yet been confirmed as to which has already."

The minister added that the cease-fire could be extended depending on the response from Yemen's Shiite Houthi rebels. Al-Jubeir said he hoped the Iran-backed rebels would \"come to their senses\" and agree to the truce. He urged them to stop fighting. \"We hope the Houthis will come to their senses and realize the interests of Yemen and the Yemeni people should be the top priority for everyone,\" he said. It is unclear whether the Houthis would reciprocate the Saudi gesture. \"The cease-fire will end should Houthis or their allies not live up to the agreement - this is a chance for the Houthis to show that they care about their people and they care about the Yemen people,\" the Saudi foreign minister emphasized. At this point, US Secretary of State John Kerry said anyone who cared about Yemeni people \"should take clear notice of the fact that a human catastrophe is building,\" adding that a cease-fire was \"not peace\" and that all parties must find a political solution to end the conflict. Kerry urged all sides to hold talks immediately. Saudi ultimatum Hours before the cease-fire announcement, Saudi Arabia declared a Houthi stronghold along its southern border a \"military target,\" giving an ultimatum to the residents to leave the area, Saudi state-run TV reported. Lately, the northern Yemeni province of Saada has become a battleground for the Shiite rebels and the Saud-led coalition forces as the Houthis carried out border attacks on nearby Saudi cities. More than 50 airstrikes hit Saada overnight and in the early hours of Friday morning, Yemeni officials said. A Saudi-led coalition of Arab states launched an air campaign against the Houthis on March 26. Riyadh accuses Tehran of backing the rebels, who have made significant territorial gains in the impoverished Middle Eastern country, capturing the capital Sanaa and ousting internationally recognized President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, who fled Yemen back in March. The Sunni Gulf states are wary of Iran's increasing influence in the region, and they see the Houthis' advance in Yemen as a move that threatens their regional and geopolitical interests.

It also said that a ceasefire was in place for five days, but that it would not last long. \"We will continue to monitor the situation closely,\" the statement said, adding that the ceasefire would last until the end of the month, when it was expected to be extended to the early hours of Tuesday, May 13.

US Secretary of State John Kerry has also been visiting Yemen for the first time since he visited in March, saying he was \"very impressed\" by the humanitarian situation there, and that he had been able to see how the conflict was progressing. But Kerry's visit comes just days after the US, Britain, France and Germany announced that they would also be visiting the southern Yemeni province of Hodeidah, as well as other Arab countries, including Qatar, Kuwait, Jordan, Tunisia, Egypt, Bahrain, Qatar and Turkey. In the past, US President Barack Obama has called for an end to hostilities between Iran and Yemen. Last week, he called on the international community to \"ensure that Yemen is free of all forms of violence.\" The United States, however, said it had not yet reached an agreement on how to deal with a humanitarian crisis. Washington has not reached a deal on what to do about the Yemen crisis, though it is not clear whether it has reached the point where it can be resolved. Secretary Kerry is also set to visit the capital Riyadh next Tuesday. His visit is scheduled to take place at the beginning of next week's UN General Assembly session, where he will meet the head of state, Saudi King Salman, on his way to Washington. Riyadh has repeatedly denied accusations that Iran is behind the violence, accusing Washington of trying to cover up what it sees as an \"act of war crimes\" against its own people. Iran has denied the allegations. Tehran denies the accusations. Moscow has accused Riyadh of supporting the rebels and said they are seeking the overthrow of President Abd-Rabbu Mansouri. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said Friday that Tehran was not involved in any military action against the Shiite rebels. However, Tehran has refused to recognize the legitimacy of Iran's military intervention in Syria's civil war, calling it a \"rogue power.\" Iran denies accusations of a coup attempt against President Bashar Assad's government, while Tehran says it supports the military's efforts to overthrow the president. Saudi officials have repeatedly accused Iran of backing the government in a bid to topple the internationally-recognized government of Tehran and accuse Tehran of meddling in its internal affairs. They have also accused the Saudis of seeking to impose sanctions on Iran. This is a claim that Riyadh denies, citing a lack of coordination with Tehran, of which Tehran is the main source of funding, in an apparent attempt to influence Tehran's decision to launch a military offensive against Tehran. Meanwhile, Iran maintains it's not doing anything to prevent Iran from gaining influence over the region's oil-rich neighbor. President Hassan Rouhani has vowed to continue its support for Iran in his bid for power, despite the fact that Washington is still not willing to step down from its role in fighting the Islamic State group in neighboring Iraq and Syria. Assad has said Tehran will not intervene militarily and has promised to cooperate with Riyadh in order to protect its interests in Sana'a - a move that is unlikely to go ahead with, if it does not come to fruition. Yemenis have rejected the idea of an international coalition to oust the Iranian president, President Mohammed Morsi, to which Riyadh is accused of being a key ally.

        "target": "Aging health: WHO call to action as world population over 60 set to double by 2050 In a new report on aging and health, the World Health Organization is calling for action on \"population aging,\" as figures suggest the number of people over 60 will reach two billion by 2050. People worldwide are living longer, says the World Health Organization in its World Report on Aging and Health. This is both good and bad. It gives us the chance to \"pursue new activities\" as we get older, such as in education and family life. But it all depends on our health. And for that the WHO says world governments need to act now to make sure our societies worldwide are ready. What are the take home facts from the World Health Organization's 2015 report on Aging and Health? The WHO says that in the next 35 years, the global number of people aged 60 years and over will almost double from 12 percent to 22 percent. By 2020, there will be more people over the age of 60 than 5 year olds. And a majority of older people (80 percent) will live in \"low and middle income\" countries. It's estimated that the world's population aged 60 years and older will total about 2 billion in 2050, which is more than twice as much as now. Furthermore, worldwide, about 125 million people are aged 80 years or older. But by 2050, it is expected that this number of people - aged 80 and over - will live in China alone. But I'm not old, so why should I care? Well, all this is happening at a faster rate than ever before. And the WHO says \"all countries face major challenges to ensure that their health and social systems are ready\" for this major demographic shift. It will cost a lot of money to improve health and social infrastructures, especially in more developed countries where traditional families structures have changed dramatically. Surely, there's \"no typical older person,\" though. How does the WHO define aging? We tend to think of older people as physically and mentally frail. But that's not necessarily the case, not everywhere in the world. Old is a relative concept - especially in middle income to rich countries. For instance, some 70 year olds are as fit as some 20 year olds. Just think how many older folk are at your gym, and ask yourself whether you can keep up with all of them. But that still doesn't explain aging. What is it exactly? The WHO says that at a biological level, \"aging results from the impact of the accumulation of a wide variety of molecular and cellular damage over time.\" Basically, this puts people at a higher risk of disease and, of course, death. But aging can also be associated with \"life transitions,\" such as retirement or witnessing other people, such as friends and family, die around you. This can affect you psychologically and sometimes, as a result, physically. What sort of diseases come with old age? Some of the most common non-fatal conditions include hearing loss, cataracts, back and neck pain and osteoarthritis. Other conditions include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - which affects the lungs - diabetes, depression, and dementia. What needs to be done? The WHO is proposing a five-step plan of action, which includes: Committing to healthy aging and \"evidence-based policies to strengthen the abilities of older persons.\" Aligning health systems with the needs of older populations Developing systems for providing long-term care Creating \"age-friendly cities and communities Improving measurement, monitoring and understanding of \"aging issues\" worldwide. But don't forget: \"a longer life brings with it opportunities, not only for older people and their families, but also for societies as a whole.\"",
        "generated_story": "WHO's Population Aging Plan: Actions Now The World Health Organization (WHO) has announced plans to reduce the number of people living in poverty in the next 35 years. The WHO's population aging plan is set to be implemented by the end of the year. According to the World Report on Aging and Health, 60 years of age is the most likely age to reach 60. In 2015, the WHO released a report on aging and health, calling it the \"world's most ambitious plan for the future.\" The report, which was published in 2015 and 2016, predicts that 60 to 80 percent of all people will die by 2050. It also predicts the death rate of some 70 year olds by 2030, and that 80 to 90 percent will be old, with the exception of those 70 and 80 year old children who have reached the age of 80. \"We are going to have to do a lot of things to make sure that we are able to live a healthy, healthy and healthy life,\" the report said, adding that it would be \"impossible\" for many people to get older without the help of their parents and grandparents. WHO says it is committed to making the world a healthier place for all of its citizens by 2020. But it's not just the elderly who are at risk of dying. There are also those who will not have the health care they need in their lifetime, such as those with diabetes, obesity and heart disease. Some 70-year-olds will also die before they reach their 80th birthday, while others will have their 70s, 80s and 90s. This is not the first time that the plan has been put into action. Earlier this year, it was announced that a new plan was being put in place to prevent the spread of diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and dementia, as well as the effects of aging on the body and the brain. These plans are part of a global effort to improve the quality of life for people with chronic health conditions, according to a WHO report published last year (PDF). The plan also calls for an end to age-related deaths and morbidities in all 50 states by 2040, when the average age at 60 is expected to rise to 70, compared with 70 years at the current level. However, this is only the beginning of what will happen in 2050, said WHO Director-General Dr. Margaret Chan in a statement. Chan said that in order to achieve this goal, \"the world will need to take steps to ensure that our population continues to grow. That means we will continue to face the challenges we face as a society. We will do everything in our power to provide the best possible care for our people.\" \"The world needs to look at how we can do this,\" Chan told reporters at a news conference in New York City on Wednesday. He added that \"we have a long way to go in terms of reducing the amount of deaths that are caused by people who die prematurely, but we must be prepared for that.\" He also pointed out that there is no way of knowing how many of these deaths will take place in 2030 and how long they will last, given the long-term trends in human health. Experts say that if we don't take action now, we won't have enough time to prepare for a future that will include the deaths of millions of children and young people. If we do not do that, there will still be a very long time before we reach the point where we have an aging population. And that's when we should be ready to move on to other areas of our lives,\" he said. 'We will make the right decisions for ourselves and our future generations.' \"It's a big step forward for us,\" said Chan, who is currently working on a plan to address the aging of 5 million people by 2025, he added. World health officials have already begun to assess the impact of this plan and their impact on our health and well-being. They have been working hard to find a solution to this problem and are working to develop a strategy to tackle the problem of over-population and prevent it from becoming a problem that is too big to ignore. For example, they are already planning to implement the 2030 Agenda 2030 which is to create a national health plan that aims to eradicate the disease that causes so many deaths in this country. As a result, people are likely to die from the diseases that have caused so much of them to become even more severe and deadly diseases like cancer, diabetes and obesity that can be prevented by a lack of medical care and a shortage of doctors, nurses, doctors and other health professionals who can provide care to people in need of care. I'm not sure what that means for them, I think it will mean for their future,\" added Chan. She added: \"This is an important step in that direction. You can't be too optimistic, because we're already seeing the consequences of such a drastic change in many areas, especially in areas where there are so few people dying prematurely and in particular, so we need more than we already"

Stephen Harper has stepped down as leader of the Conservatives after nine years in the top job. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper resigned as Conservative Party leader on Tuesday after the Liberals, led by Justin Trudeau, emerged victorious in legislative elections. \"I have spoken to Prime Minister Stephen Harper, and he has instructed me to reach out to the newly elected parliamentary caucus to appoint an interim leader,\" Conservative Party president John Walsh said in a statement. \"The people are never wrong,\" Harper said of his defeat. \"The disappointment is my responsibility and mine alone,\" Harper said, adding that he had called Trudeau to congratulate him. Trudeau calls for hopeful, diverse future In electing Trudeau, the charismatic son of a former popular prime minister, Canadian voters illustrated the growing discontent with nine years of Conservative rule that saw lowering of corporate taxes, avoidance of climate change legislation and disagreement with the Obama administration over the controversial Keystone XL pipeline. \"Canadians have spoken,\" Trudeau said, adding that he would be the man to lead the \"hopeful, positive\" country \"with a vision\" that they had asked for. In his victory speech, Trudeau said his government \"believed deeply in the diversity of our country,\" striking a contrast with the strain of nativism that had become apparent under Conservative rule. \"We beat fear with hope,\" said Trudeau, a 43-year-old former teacher. Liberals blow past projected results Projections ahead of the elections had Harper and Trudeau in a dead heat, but as polls closed on Monday night it became clear that the Liberals had won an outright majority, with a projected 175 of parliament's 338 seats. This represented a huge leap from four years ago when Liberals were handed their most crushing defeat in history with a mere 34 seats. Harper will stay on as a member of Parliament for his constituency, public broadcaster CBC reported, as he was re-elected to his seat.

        "generated_story": "Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper steps down as leader of the Conservative Party Canada's prime minister has stepped down after nine years in office. Harper, who was elected in 2011, is stepping down from his post as the country's longest-serving leader. The announcement comes after a series of resignations, including the resignation of his predecessor, former finance minister John Walsh, in the wake of a corruption scandal that has rocked the Canadian political landscape. In a statement, Harper said he would step down at the end of this year's federal election. \"I will not resign,\" he said, adding that he had no plans to seek re-election. He added that his successor, Justin Trudeau, would take over the reins of government from Harper. But Harper also said that the party would continue to work with the federal government to find a way to make Canada a better place to live and work as a country, rather than just a \"nation.\" Harper's resignation came after the New Democratic Party (NDP) announced on Monday that it would no longer be able to form a government with Harper as its leader for the first time since the 2011 election, when Harper was still in power. Trudeau said Harper would not be returning to office until the new government was in place, but he did not rule out the possibility that Harper could be replaced by a younger, more experienced leader, as well as an even younger and more capable one. Canada has a long history of dealing with corruption, and Harper is no stranger to it. On Monday, he announced he was resigning as party leader and would seek a new term in government, which would see him replace Harper with a young, inexperienced and inexperienced leader who would have been a natural fit for prime ministership. His resignation comes at a difficult time for Canada, where the Harper government has been plagued by allegations of corruption and a lack of transparency in its dealings with foreign governments. It's the second time Harper has resigned from the position in less than four years. Last year, the Liberal Party of Canada (LPC) was the only opposition party in Canada that had a majority in Parliament. After Harper took office in 2010, it was left to the Conservatives to decide whether or not to run for office again. That's how Harper won the election in a landslide, with Trudeau becoming the most popular candidate in his party's history, while Harper became the least popular of all the other opposition parties. Now Harper will be leaving office, after eight years of being the longest serving leader in Canadian politics. And he will have to do so for a number of reasons. One of them is his own personal political career: He was a staunch critic of President Barack Obama's policies on climate change. Another is the fact that many Canadians don't want to see the Keystone XL pipeline built. This is one of those issues that is being debated by the Liberals and the NDP in their own party. For Harper to be out of office would be a disaster for their party, they would need to have a lot of support from their base of supporters in order to get the project through the House of Commons and into the White House. They would also need the support of Canadians who support the pipeline and who are not willing to give up their right to vote on the controversial project. As Harper left office on Tuesday, Trudeau took over as Liberal leader after Harper resigned as Harper had been elected to a second term. Both Harper and Trudeau have said they are committed to working together to end the debate on a plan to build a clean energy economy and to create jobs and jobs for Canadians, a goal Harper campaigned on for many years and which he believed would help him win the next election with his Liberals. Still, there is a sense of unease among Canadians about the prospect of an NDP government that would allow him to stay on as long as he is still the prime ministerial candidate, even if it means losing his seat in parliament. There's also the question of how long Harper can be expected to stick to his promise to continue his legacy as premier, given his record on environmental issues. How long will Harper be in charge? Harper says he won't change his mind on this issue and he's not going to change the way he does his job. What do you think? How will he do that? What are you waiting for? The Liberals have already announced that they will do their best to ensure that Canadians have the best chance of getting the job done? \"We're not giving up,\" Harper told the CBC's political bureau in Ottawa. A spokesman for Trudeau told CBC News in an interview Monday night that \"the Liberals will continue their efforts to win over Canadians. We're still working on that. I'm not sure what the future holds for our country. You know what I mean? We'll see what we can do about this. If Harper leaves, we'll do the right thing and that's a good thing, right? I think he'll be back in that position, because we've already made it clear to Canadians that this is something that will happen in this country and we're going"

        "target": "Maldives revokes state of emergency citing improved security situation The president of the Maldives has lifted a state of emergency following an outcry from the international community. The government says the measures are no longer necessary because the security threat has subsided. The government said Tuesday it had rescinded the emergency measures \"with immediate effect\" and that \"all fundamental rights that were suspended have been restored.\" President Yameen Abdul Gayoom declared the state of emergency one week ago after the discovery of a homemade bomb and a stash of weapons near his official residence. The finding followed an explosion on Gayoom's speedboat in September - an incident the government labeled an assassination attempt. The president was not hurt in the blast, but his wife, an aide and a bodyguard were injured. The emergency regulations, intended to be in place for 30 days, gave security forces wide-ranging search and arrest powers, and suspended citizens' basic rights. They drew criticism from former colonial power Britain as well as the United States, the European Union and neighboring Sri Lanka. Reading out a presidential decree revoking the emergency, Attorney General Mohamed Anil said there was no longer a threat to the Indian Ocean atoll nation. He said investigations into the September blast and the recovery of weapons had made good progress. The foreign ministry said a number of people had been arrested. Lawmakers also used the security regulations to fast-track the impeachment of Vice President Ahmed Adeeb, who stands accused of plotting the alleged attempts on the president's life. Impact on tourism Attorney General Anil said pressure from the international community, as well as \"the possible adverse impact on Maldives tourism and the economy,\" had also played a role in ending the state of emergency. Foreign tourists visiting the tropical nation, known for its luxury tourist resorts, palm-fringed beaches and coral reefs, contribute close to a third of the country's gross domestic product. The Maldives has had a rocky road to democracy since holding its first multiparty election in 2008. The country's first democratically elected leader, current opposition chief Mohamed Nasheed, was forced to step down in 2012 after a mutiny by security forces. In March, he was jailed for 13 years on terrorism charges in a trial the United Nations said was illegal. President Gayoom is under intense international pressure to release him. Nasheed's opposition Maldivian Democratic Party welcomed Tuesday's announcement. But said declaring the state of emergency in the first place was a political move designed to stop a rally planned for last week calling for Nasheed's freedom. \"It appears that Yameen is willing to make up threats about the nation's security in order to settle political scores,\" the party said in a statement, referring to the president. nm/kms (AP, AF, Reuters, dpa)",

The government said on Tuesday that it had lifted the emergency imposed on the island nation by the United Nations in response to international criticism of his government's handling of the crisis. \"We have lifted an emergency order that has been in place for the last 13 years,\" the government spokesman Mohamed Anil told Reuters, adding that \"we are not going to allow the situation to deteriorate further.\" The move comes after a week of widespread criticism from the international community, which has called for an end to the country's military crackdown on dissent and human rights abuses. It is also the first time that the president of Maldivia, Mohamed Nasheed, has ruled out a return to civilian rule. He has also said that he will not be returning to office until the end of March, when he is due to be sworn in as prime minister. His government has repeatedly denied the allegations, saying it was not aware of any violations of international law. On Tuesday, the foreign ministry said it would continue to monitor the ongoing situation and would not comment further on whether or not there was an imminent return of military action. A UN spokesman said the UN had not yet made a decision on what action to take, but it did not rule out the possibility of a military intervention. In the meantime, a number of countries, including the European Union, have issued a statement saying that they would take action against any attempt to interfere with the security situation. However, they have not made any decision yet on how to respond to such a situation, according to a Reuters report. Foreign Minister Ahmed Adeeb said he was \"very optimistic\" that a new government would be formed within the next 30 days. But he added that there were \"no immediate plans\" to restore the military's authority. According to an official statement, \"There is no immediate plan to intervene in this situation.\" \"I am very optimistic that we will be able to resolve this crisis in a timely manner,\" said Adeb, who was in office for a month and a half before being forced to step down from his post as president in September. 'We are very hopeful that this will happen,\" he said, referring to his term as Prime Minister in 2012. Abroad, it is not clear how long the current military regime will remain in power, and whether it will take to implement the new constitution. At the same time, there is a strong sense of urgency to make sure the constitution is in order. We are also hopeful of an orderly transition of power. I am optimistic about the future of our country, as we have seen in other countries. There are a lot of things that have happened in recent years, such as the election of new president Sheikh Mohamud. You can read more about that in our daily newspaper, The Associated Press (AP, dpa) and Reuters (Reuters, AP) in an article published Tuesday. This article was originally published on Reuters. Read more: \"The situation in Maldivia is very different from what we saw in 2008,\" it said. Since then, opposition parties have been calling for changes in government and government policies. Many of them have said they want a change of government, while others say they don't want to see a repeat of 2008. They have also criticized the previous government for not doing enough to protect the rights of ordinary citizens. One week ago, an opposition lawmaker said there had been no change in its position. Another opposition leader, Sheikh Ahmad al-Nasheed told the Reuters news agency that his party was ready to give up its parliamentary majority in parliament and that parliament should take up the issue of democracy. That was a mistake, because the opposition party's main opposition candidate, Hassan Ail, had said earlier this month that opposition leaders should be given a chance to demonstrate their commitment to democracy and the rule of law in their own country. After all, this is the only country where democracy is possible. And that is exactly what has happened. What is happening now, though, is that no one is willing to accept the results of this election. So, what can we do? We will see what happens next? Let's see how the people decide. If the elections go well, we'll have to wait and see if we can find a way to get a solution to this problem. Otherwise, let's have a good dialogue with our elected government. How do you know what's going on? What are the options for us? I'm not sure what to expect from a democratic government? Is there a clear answer to that question? How can you say no? And what are we really doing? The opposition has already made it clear it's not a question of whether we should do something about it? It's a matter of time before we get to know the outcome of elections. Is it really possible for them to do that? That's what I think we need to talk about, right now? There's no doubt that's the most of course."

Relations between the reclusive Belarusian government and the West have been strained ever since. 'Belarus question must be answered' German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said in a statement that the accusations were \"baseless\" and an attempt by Lukashenko to draw attention away from his own wrongdoing. \"The EU needs to find a clear political answer to events surrounding the presidential election and the continued incarceration of opposition politicians and their supporters,\" Westerwelle said. A wide-reaching crackdown against the regime's opponents followed Lukashenko's re-election. Hundreds of his critics were arrested and dozens threatened with long-term jail sentences. Poland also dismissed the accusations as absurd and said that relations with Minsk would not be normalized unless all political prisoners were released. Sanctions threat The situation in Belarus pushed the European Union to adopt a resolution on Thursday in support of economic sanctions against the country. The threats earned a sharp rebuke from Lukashenko, who promised the \"hardest possible reaction\" should the bloc impose sanctions against his country. At the same time, the Belarusian prime minister, Mikhail Myasnikovich, travelled to Moscow in a effort to shore up Russian support for Minsk during its standoff with the EU. That meeting ended with a Russian promise not to impose its own set of sanctions on Belarus over an unrelated spat over oil exports and a commitment to resume a nuclear power plant project shelved after the 1986 Chernobyl disaster.

        "generated_story": " Belarusian President Guido Westerwelle's re-election bid was marred by accusations of corruption, corruption and a lack of transparency. The former Soviet republic's president, Alexander Lukashenko, was elected to a second term in office on Friday. He faces allegations of graft and corruption in his first term as head of state, which began in 1994. In the run-up to the election, he faced accusations that he had misused his office to enrich himself and his wife, Nancy Isenson, in an attempt to influence the outcome of the presidential election. \"I am not a politician, I am a person of integrity,\" he said in a televised address to parliament on Thursday. But he also faced criticism from the European Union and the United States for his handling of Ukraine's internal affairs. On Thursday, the EU's foreign policy chief, Mikhail Myasnikovich, said he was not aware of any corruption allegations against him, adding that \"there was no corruption at all in the country.\" The EU, however, did not comment on the allegations, saying only that it was \"not aware\" of them and that they were \"unfounded\" by the accusations. It is not clear how many people in Belarus have been involved in Ukrainian politics since the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, but it is clear that the situation in Ukraine has not changed much since then. According to media reports, a number of people had been arrested in connection with the incident. Some of those arrested were accused of having links to organized crime, while others were charged with crimes against humanity, according to Reuters news agency. Many of these charges were later dropped by prosecutors, who said they had not been able to find any evidence of wrongdoing at the time of their arrest. There were also allegations that Ukrainian officials had conspired to defraud the government of millions of euros ($1.4 billion) in order to secure the support of a pro-Russian opposition party. This is the first time that Belarus has had a president who has been convicted of crimes such as murder, attempted murder and attempted rape, and was sentenced to life in prison in absentia. Ukraine is one of Belarus' most powerful countries, with a population of more than 1.5 million people living in exile in Russia and Ukraine. Belarus is also the world's most populous country in terms of population and income, although it does not have a large population. Since the 1990s, it has enjoyed a relatively stable economy and has a high level of economic growth. However, its economy has struggled to recover from a severe economic downturn. Last year, Belarus suffered a sharp drop in oil prices, falling oil output and falling commodity prices that have made it difficult for it to compete with other European countries to attract foreign investment. That has led to an increase in imports of oil and natural gas, as well as a decline in its exports to China and other emerging economies. Analysts say the economy is still struggling to make up for the loss of its oil reserves. Russia, Ukraine and China are among the countries most dependent on oil imports. Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly accused Ukraine of being a \"currency manipulator\" and of manipulating the international financial system. Moscow denies this, accusing the Ukrainian president of using state funds to fund his own political interests. Kiev has also accused the US of trying to undermine the president's efforts to improve relations between Moscow and Washington by accusing him of failing to act on his promises to help Ukraine in return for a bailout package. Washington has said it will continue to press Ukraine to do its utmost to protect its interests, even if that means giving Ukraine a chance to return to its former communist ally, Vladimir Lenin, to become a member of NATO. Putin's government has denied that Russia has any intention of imposing sanctions on Belarus. His government is currently in talks with Ukraine over the Ukraine crisis and he has refused to sign an agreement on a new energy deal with Moscow on energy and energy cooperation with Russia. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Friday that Ukraine would not accept any concessions from Ukraine, Russia or other EU member states that are not part of Russia's plans to leave the bloc. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Reuters that Moscow has rejected the idea of an EU-led economic sanctions against Belarus, calling it an \"act of desperation\" that could be used to weaken the Russian economy. Reuters reported Thursday that Putin is considering a move to impose sanctions and impose a freeze on its energy sector. A spokesman for Ukraine said the Kremlin is \"openly considering the possibility of sanctions,\" but he denied any such move. Poland's Foreign Ministry said Moscow is unlikely to take any steps to prevent a referendum on Ukraine from becoming a full-fledged member state. NATO Secretary-General Sergei Shoigu said Russia is prepared to accept the results of his election as soon as possible. Foreign ministers are expected to meet with Belarus to discuss the issue. EU officials have said that a deal could not be agreed on an interim deal to end the crisis. If the deal is agreed to be signed by Belarus and Russia to reduce its nuclear deal on Russia on"

        "target": "Berlin court rules Google Street View is legal in Germany A Berlin court has ruled that Google Street View is legal. But that doesn't mean the lawsuits will end, legal scholars say. A Berlin court has ruled that Google Street View is, in fact, legal in Germany. Last Tuesday, the Berlin State Supreme Court (Kammergericht) announced its decision in a court case from late last year, in which a woman had sued Google, fearing that photos of her, her family and the front of her house would be posted on Google Street View and would thus violate her property and privacy rights. The court ruled that it is legal to take photographs from street level, rejecting her argument that Google was trying to take unauthorized pictures. Part of her argument rested on the fact that Google used cameras mounted at three meters (9.84 feet) high, which could see over her two-meter-high hedge. However, the court did not find this argument convincing, given that the photographs were taken from the street, and not the sidewalk. Furthermore, because Google automatically blurs faces and license plates and did allow Germans to opt-out of the service to have their house obfuscated as well, the court did not find any potential violations. This is the first high-level court ruling, which cannot be appealed any further, regarding Street View since the service debuted in Germany at the end of last year. An ongoing debate Since Google announced plans to launch Street View in Germany last summer, debate around the service has become heated, with some politicians trying to stop it at every turn, while German Chancellor Angela Merkel famously said that she would not remove her house from Street View. In November 2010, the company announced that 244,000 German residents in the 20 cities had chosen to opt out of Street View - less than three percent of residents. However, in Germany and everywhere else, the company also allows people to report abuse, inaccuracies or request that something be blurred using an online tool. \"Our job is to develop services that respect these cultural differences,\" Peter Fleischer, Google's global privacy counsel told Deutsche Welle in November 2010. \"We try to anticipate them. We're all internationally-minded people ourselves. We try to guess how people will react to them. But a lot of these services are new and have never been on the market before, so we learn and we adapt as we go along.\" A 'landmark decision' European legal experts called the Berlin ruling a \"landmark decision,\" saying that this would now become part of German case law regarding property rights. \"Yes, other people are now warned: Don't sue Google simply claiming that Google Street View violates personality [or] property rights,\" wrote Thomas H\u00f6ren, a professor of media and communications law at the University of M\u00fcnster, in an e-mail sent to Deutsche Welle. But, he also warned that this decision was very narrow, focusing on the issue of property rights, and not on the larger issues of data protection from Google. \"The problem of Google Street View - to be honest - has never been a problem of personality rights or property rights, but the enormous risk of personal data compilations in cases where people use Google Street View for compiling personal profiles (such as building insurance companies; future employees, et cetera),\" he added. \"And this risk has not been considered by the Berlin courts.\" Similarly, Viktor Mayer-Sch\u00f6nberger, a professor at the Oxford Internet Institute, agreed that this case was \"limited in scope,\" adding in an e-mail, \"The plaintiff never alleged an actual invasion of privacy, just a potential one.\" Author: Cyrus Farivar Editor: Nancy Isenson",
        "generated_story": "Landmark decision on Google Street View in Germany A Landmark Decision in the German state of M\u00fcnster has been handed down by the state supreme court. The decision, which is due to take effect at the end of the year, is the first of its kind in Europe. It comes after a long legal battle between the government of Germany and the city of Berlin over a landmark decision in November last year. In that case, the court ruled in favor of Google, saying that the company should not be allowed to build a street-view camera on the premises of a university in Berlin. According to a report in Deutsche Welle, \"the decision was based on a number of factors, including the fact that Google was not able to make a profit from the project.\" The court also ruled against Google and other companies that had tried to sell the site to the public. \"The decision is a victory for Google,\" said Peter Fleischer, a professor of computer science and computer engineering at Berlin State University. He added: \"It is an important step for the future of German society, and it is also an opportunity for us to have a better understanding of what we are doing in our own country.\" In November 2010, Germany's Kammergericht (the state's highest court) said that it was too early to decide on whether to allow Google to develop a new street view camera. On the other hand, it said it would be too late to change the law, adding that there was \"no legal basis\" for it to be built. But the decision did not come as a surprise to many Germans, who have long been skeptical about Google's plans to expand its presence in their country. For example, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said in a statement that \"we are going to do everything we can to improve the quality of our products.\" \"We will continue to work on this issue,\" she said, referring to Google\u2019s decision to open up the Internet to more people. Google has said the new camera will be available in all German cities by 2020. However, there are still a lot of questions about whether it should be open to new users, as well as whether Google should make the move to create a more open Internet for all Germans. This is not the case in any other country, but in other countries, such as the United States, France, Italy, Spain, Japan, Russia, China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Taiwan. There is no doubt that this decision will have an impact on Germany, particularly in terms of how the country is perceived by people who are not familiar with the internet. That is, if Google can make it easier for people to get around to using the Web. And that is something that has not been done for many years. Since then, many people have come to believe that Internet users are more likely to use the web than they are to go to other places. Many of these people, however, do not have access to Internet access, so they don't have the means to access the information they need to study it. They have to rely on their own devices, like Google Maps, to find the best way to communicate with their friends and family. Some of them even have Internet-savvy friends. One of those friends, Thomas H\u00f6ren, was a Google engineer who worked with Google for several years in New York before he was forced to give up his job at Google in order to join the search giant. Now, he is working with a group of students at a German university, where he has a PhD in Internet engineering. His research is published in German and is based in Munich. More than a year later, Google is planning to launch a web application that will allow users to see the world through the eyes of an Internet user. I am not sure what Google will do with it, though I think it's a good idea, because I have no idea what it will look like. What I do know is that people are very interested in Google. If Google does not do that, I'm sure it won't be easy for them to understand what is going on in this country right now. You can read more about it here.

Why is it so important? The company is doing so well? It's not just Google that's doing this, they're doing it because they want to help the people of Europe to know what they can do. So, what's the big question is what will Google decide? Is Google deciding whether or not to let Google take over the market? I can't tell you what the answer is. We're not really sure. Or, how can we do it? We can only hope Google decides to stop Google from doing that and then we'll see how it does the right thing, right? Google wants to move forward with this.

        "target": "In Argentina, red wine exports to balance Porsche imports About 100 Porsches are imported to Argentina each year. Now the country wants to keep a positive trade balance by having the value of the imported luxury cars matched by red wine exports. Porsche is currently enjoying record profits after a two-year downturn, but the export-reliant company has hit a pothole in Argentina. Buenos Aires-based Porsche importer Grupo Pulenta has signed an agreement obligating it to export several hundred bottles of red wine for each car it imports, the Argentine government announced Wednesday. Grupo Pulenta declined to comment when contacted by Deutsche Welle. Job creation During the past year, Argentina has held thousands of high-end vehicles in customs until companies agreed to export goods valued at the same amount. Most of those vehicles came from Germany. According to a spokeswoman for the Argentine embassy in Berlin, the country has been trying to safeguard domestic employment with a positive trade balance. \"Our government has negotiated with automakers to balance their imports of cars with an equivalent amount of exports,\" she told Deutsche Welle in a statement. \"Since March 2010 we have been working with the automakers and importers in order to increase local integration and reduce the trade deficit in this sector.\" Small market A Porsche spokesman said the company sells just short of 100 vehicles into Argentina each year. That compares to more than 40,000 sold worldwide during five months in 2010. \"For Porsche, Argentina is a rather small market,\" the spokesman told Deutsche Welle. \"Our importer, the Pulenta Group, also deals in wine. They have their own vineyards and export that wine. It has nothing to do with Porsche - we just have an import contract with them, and it seems they've found an individual solution with the Argentine government.\" Domestic production Volkswagen, which has an Argentine subsidiary producing the new \"Amarok\" pickup truck and transmissions, has thus far avoided mandatory exports. The company had reported an export surplus of 384 million euros ($545 million) for this year. Porsche's holding company owns 32.2 percent of Volkswagen, and the Porsche brand is intended to become integrated into Volkswagen's lineup. Daimler and BMW also have subsidiaries in Argentina. While Daimler produces its \"Sprinter\" there, BMW only imports to the country. According to the Argentine embassy in Berlin, the country has recently sought more domestic production by foreign car companies. Author: Gerhard Schneibel (dpa) Editor: John Blau",
        "generated_story": "Buenos Aires-based Pulenta Group aims to balance its exports with red wine exports in the past year. The company is looking to diversify its business away from wine and into red wines. \"We are going to focus more on the domestic market,\" CEO Gerhard Schneibel told Deutsche Welle, adding that the company was looking for new markets for its flagship brand Amarok, which was launched in March 2010 in Buenos Aires, Argentina. In 2010, the German carmaker was the world's biggest wine exporter, with sales of up to 545 million euros ($538 million) a year, according to the Daimler news agency. It is also the largest wine producer in Argentina, and the country's second-largest wine market, behind Germany's Volkswagen. But it is not the first time that Porsche has struggled to find a way to compete with the likes of BMW and Mercedes-Benz. For example, in 2009, it sold a car called the Porsche Panamera to a German wine company, Porsches, for a total of 1.5 billion euros (1.4 billion Euros) in sales. This year's sales are expected to be up slightly from the year before, when Porsche sold the car to BMW for 5.8 billion euro ($5.6 billion) and then to Volkswagen for 6.2 billion in 2010. That's a record for an Argentine car maker, but it's not enough to make up for the losses it has suffered in recent years. According to German newspaper dpa, \"Porsche has lost a lot of market share since the beginning of 2010.\" It has also lost more than a quarter of its sales in Brazil, where it was once a major player in wine production. However, sales have been growing at a faster pace than in other countries, such as Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Japan, Germany and Italy. Porsche is the only company in Latin America that has been able to keep up with demand for wine, despite the fact that it doesn't have enough production capacity to meet demand. And that's because it does not have the resources to invest in new products, as it did in 2008 and 2009 when it had to import wine from China and other Latin American countries. As a result, there is little room for growth in its wine sales, even though the price of wine has fallen by a third since 2009. So, Porsche will continue to look for ways to expand its international presence, especially in South America. Last year it bought a new wine brand in Chile, called Ambla, to help offset the loss of sales to Germany. On Wednesday it said it planned to sell more wine to Argentina this year in order to boost its domestic wine output. German media reported that BMW, Volkswagen and Porsche were also planning to increase their wine imports from Argentina to Brazil in a bid to double the number of bottles sold in 2014. Volkswagen, however, has not yet announced any plans to do so, saying it will not be doing so. BMW has already announced it won't do anything until the end of the two-year period. Meanwhile, VW and Volkswagen have also announced that they will stop producing German wines for two years starting in 2015. VW, meanwhile, have announced a plan to reduce its production of German-made wine. Porsche also said they would stop making wine for Argentina in 2016, citing the lack of demand from other markets. A spokesman for Volkswagen said that \"the company has decided not to take any further steps in this direction.\" The German company said in an interview on Wednesday that Volkswagen would not make a decision on whether it would take a further step to buy the brand. Germany is currently the biggest importer of Italian wine in Europe, although it still has a large presence in that country, while Italy is still the second largest market in terms of volume and volume of wines sold there. Audi, Mercedes and BMW are the third-biggest exporters, after Porsche and Audi are among the top importers in Italy and Spain. Mercedes, Audi and VW are also in talks with Volkswagen over the next year and a half, said Volkswagen's John Blau, vice president of marketing at Porsche. He said Porsche would be \"very happy\" with its decision to continue its investment in China, noting that German companies have already made a commitment to cooperate with Porsche in their efforts to develop the region. J.B. Schleifer, head of Porsche's wine division, told DW he was not aware of any changes to its strategy for China. At the same time, he added that there were no plans for further investments in Asia, particularly in areas like the United States, China or the Middle East. If the Chinese market were to follow Porsche into the US, that would mean that China would have to step up its purchases of Brazilian wine by 2020, a move that is unlikely to materialize as soon as the current year is over, because of a shortage of Chinese wine demand and that will be the most important market for German products. With the addition of new wines, BMW is expected"

The one millimeter-large varroa mite is a parasite that infests beehives and lays its eggs in the honeycombs, alongside the bees' larvae. \"It feeds on the bees' and the bee brood's blood, the so-called haemolymph,\" Papendieck explains. A third of bees killed in Germany Papendieck is an apiarist at the Bee Research Institute at the University of Bonn and he knows that the threat of mites is serious. If left untreated, varroa-infested colonies rarely survive a winter. In 2010, German beekeepers lost about 200,000 hives to the mite \u2013 one third of Germany's total bee population. And it is not just the honey and beeswax production that are affected by the mite. Many of our food crops depend on bees: Some 80 percent of all agricultural plants and 90 percent of fruit trees in Europe are pollinated by Apis mellifera, the European honeybee. Varroa introduced from Asia Had Dete Papendieck been a beekeeper forty years ago he would not have had to worry about mites. He says the varroa mite that was originally native to Asia, was introduced to Europe in the 1970s. \"It happened during a research project in which it was attempted to crossbreed the European honeybee with the Asian honeybee. The researchers were exchanging bee colonies between Europe and India, and that is how the mites came to Germany,\" Papendieck said. Unlike Asian bee species, the European honeybee cannot fight off the varoa mite by itself. According to Papendieck, bees easily transmit the mite to other beekeepers' hives in what apiarists call robbery. \"It happens when certain colonies are being robbed by other bees. Large numbers of bees from different colonies attack weak hives and steal their stocks. At the same time, parasites and diseases are exchanged\", he says. Researchers have been trying to breed varroa-resistant mites, but so far they haven't had much success. High-tech tools help fight the mite Klaus Maresch is also worried about his bees. He is an organic beekeeper from Bonn and he has been passionate about bees since he was a little boy. \"They are part of my family. When I open my hives and smell the honey and hear the buzzing of the bees it's like being in another world,\" he told Deutsche Welle. In addition to using formic acid to fight the mite, Klaus Maresch employs a high-tech tool \u2013 a special cylindrical scale that helps him determine when it is best to start the varroa treatment. \"Every day this hive scale sends data about the colonies to our server. The data, such as the temperature in the hive and the amounts of nectar and pollen collected, help me to find a good day to treat varroa,\" Maresch says. Maresch also makes the data about the activities in his hives available to fellow beekeepers who can treat their colonies accordingly. A driver's license for beekeepers? But it is not the mite that angers Maresch most. \"That's nature,\" he says, \"I feel angry about beekeepers who don't fight varroa. If the bees of neighboring beekeepers are infested, I also have a problem.\" The existing German pest regulation obliges beekeepers to treat their bees against varroa, but there are no strict controls. The majority of Germany's more-than-80,000 beekeepers are amateurs who keep between one and 20 colonies. This makes it difficult to impose and survey certain quality standards. Maresch, who sees himself as a kind of 'bee activist', would like to see the government introduce stricter rules. \"There should be a law that obliges every new beekeeper to learn about beekeeping before they are allowed to keep bees. They should get an education and there should be something like a driver's license for beekeepers,\" he says. In the mean time, Europe's bees are going to have to",
        "generated_story": "German beekeeper fights the varoa mite with a high-tech hive scale German beekeepers are fighting a pest that has been spreading across Europe for more than two decades. The pest, which has spread from Europe to Asia, has become a major threat to the bee industry in Germany. In July, Klaus Maresch, head of the University of Bonn's Bee Research Institute, said that the pest had spread to Europe and was spreading to other parts of Europe. \"The pest is spreading throughout Europe,\" he told Deutsche Welle, adding that he had to fight it in order to protect himself and his family from the pests. But he also warned that it could spread even further in Europe, where the insect has already spread across the continent. He added that \"the pest can spread as quickly as it can in the wild.\" \"It spreads from one hive to another, and then it spreads to all the other hive-houses,\" the Bee research institute's head Dete Papendieck said in an interview with the German news agency DeWelle. According to him, this pest spreads through the entire continent, causing it to spread throughout the whole continent and into the surrounding regions. It has also spread into Asia and the Middle East, making it difficult for the bees to escape. This is the first time in German history that bees have been able to survive in such a way that they have to be protected from pests and diseases, he said. 'It's a very dangerous pest,' he added, referring to an insect that can cause serious health problems in humans. However, it is not just Europe that is at risk of spreading diseases. There is also the threat of pest infestations, as well as the spread of diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis and tuberculosis. These pests have caused a number of deaths in recent years, according to researchers at the U. of Bn. They have also caused the deaths of thousands of bees and other pollinators over the past forty-five years. Some of them have even been killed by bees. One of these bees, G\u00f6nna Ketels, was killed in a bee attack in July 2010 by a pesticide-resistant insect. She died two years later, after suffering a heart attack and a stroke. Her husband has since died, but she is survived by her two children, who are now in their 70s and 80s. A new bee hive is being developed in Bremen, a city in northern Germany, to help protect bees from pest-infested areas of China and India, the researchers said, while others are working on a new hive that could be used to make honey for honeybees. That hive will be built to house the insects, they added. For more information on the hive, click here. More than 40 years ago, Germany's bee research institutes began to develop a hive system to keep bees at bay. Since then, there have only been a handful of successful honeybee hive systems. Now, more bees are being introduced to beekeeping, with one being the only one to have the ability to produce honey at home. With the help of a honey bee expert, researchers have found that honey can be made from honey and honey, honey is a key ingredient in honey. And honey bees can also be cultured and made into honey-eaters, too. Honeybees are the key to honey making honey - and they are very good at it.

Or, if you have honey to eat, how can you tell if it will help you to use honey as an ingredient? And, what do you know? I'd like to see how honeymakers are using honey substitutes? \"I'm very happy to give honey,\" said a scientist who has worked on honey!

        "target": "Heidi hits the Big Screen Heidi, the world famous girl from the Swiss Alps who first appeared in a novel 121 years ago, has hit the big screen in a fresh look. A century after the death of Heidi inventor Johanna Spyri, the lovable Alpine heroine is being portrayed in a new film which replaces grassy slopes and mountainous range with city skyscrapers and city streets. The $ 3.5 million \"Heidi\", funded by the Z\u00fcrich-based film company Vega and directed by German film maker Markus Imboden, is to be launched in Germany on Thursday. The making of the film was one of the highlights of a past year of events including exhibitions, lectures and fireworks celebrating the July 7 2001 centenary of the death of Spyri, whose novel \"Heidi\" sold 20 million copies and has been translated in 50 languages worldwide. It is thought to be one of the most successful books of all times. The book has inspired 17 films, including Shirley Temple\u2019s Oscar winning portrayal of Heidi in 1937 and a Japanese cartoon series. Imboden\u2019s remake is the 18th \"Heidi\" film. Blue hair in Berlin According to Vega, \"the film was transmitted to today\u2019s world without losing sight of the original novel\". But Imboden\u2019s new movie is far from the charming original, with its rosy-cheeked, curly-headed Heidi, delicate Clara and goat-tending shepherd Peter\u2019s frail old grandmother. In the first film, Heidi, who lives happily with her grandfather in a tiny hut in the Swiss Alps is plucked from her contented life by her Aunt Dete to live in a stiff, rich family in the bustling metropolis, Frankfurt. Heidi becomes so home-sick, she starts to sleepwalk and is eventually sent home. But not before she causes confusion in the otherwise prim household and brings laughter in the life of the disabled and homely, Clara. The Heidi in the latest film has blue hair, surfs the net and roams the streets of Berlin. Friend and shepherd Peter sheds his rustic pastimes and whizzes down streets on his mountainbike. Clara is not the weak, lame young girl of the Spyri novel, but a moody Britney Spears wannabe. Aunt Dete is a modern-day stylist living fashionably in the German capital. The new surroundings are a far cry from the tranquil days of cow milking, goat- tending and flower-plucking in the verdant meadows of the Swiss Alps. Transforming the Heidi myth According to a Berlin daily, the remake is a \"refreshing Heidi\", adding that the script writers had managed to transform the Heidi \"myth\" into an independent, self-assured girl and not into a \"transfigured mountain heroine\". However, it is just this portrait of a naive and charming alpine heroine that has made Heidi so popular all over the world. Heidi has become a well-known Swiss brand worldwide. Some 60,000 tourists \u2013 half from Japan \u2013 are said to visit the picturesque wine-growing village in Graubuenden, which boasts the original Heidi House and other Heidi related attractions such as winding mountain trails and pastures. Imboden\u2019s film, which is to be launched in Germany on Thursday, will also open elsewhere in Europe, and may reach fans in Japan and South Korea too. Whether Imboden\u2019s blue-haired, computer savvy Heidi will charm her Asian viewers, however, remains to be seen.",
        "generated_story": "The Remake of Heidi in the Swiss Alps A century ago, a Swiss villa was discovered by a German archaeologist. It was the home of a woman named Heidi. She lived there for 121 years until she died in 1937. Her remains were found on Thursday, the day before she was to be buried by her husband, Peter Imboden, at the site of her death. The house, which is located near the village of Dete, has been restored to its former glory and is now open to the public for visitors to see. According to Vega, Heidi House is the first Swiss house to have been excavated in a century. In 1937, it was completed and the house was moved to a new location on the outskirts of the city of Stuttgart. Since then it has become a tourist attraction for tourists and locals alike. \"It is a beautiful place to visit,\" Vega said, adding that he had visited the property several times in recent years. He added that Heidi was \"a very beautiful house with a very special place in my heart. I have never seen anything like it before, and I am very proud of it. We are so lucky to live in such a wonderful place, I can\u2019t wait to go back and see it again,\u201d he said. 'I am so happy that I was able to come back to my home and spend the rest of my life with my wife and children. And I will always be grateful for the opportunity to spend time with Heidi and her family. There is so much to learn about her and all the people who have come to her home, she is an inspiration to me.\u201cShe was so beautiful, so kind and generous, that she made me feel like I could do anything for her,\" said Vega. \u201cI have always wanted to do something for my family, but I cannot do it for myself. That is why I want to give her a chance to grow up and be a part of this beautiful world. So I would like to make sure she grows up with her own family and has a good life. But I also want her to get married and have a family who will be happy to help her raise her children and raise them, because I think that is what she would do if she had a husband who was a great man and a father who loved her very much.\" \"She is very happy,\" he added, referring to his wife, Johanna Spyri, who is married to Peter and their two children, \"and who are very good friends. They are the only ones I know of who can help me with that.\" The home was built on a site that had been abandoned by the Nazis in World War II. Now it is being restored and restored, with the help of volunteers from all over the world, including the United States and Canada. Vega says he hopes that the new house will help to create a more peaceful and peaceful environment for all of us to enjoy. A past year has seen a lot of changes in Swiss society, he says, as well as a change in attitudes towards women and men. His wife is also a member of his family with whom he has worked for many years and they have become very close friends since the beginning of their marriage. When he was in his early 20s, his father was an architect and he built a house for his daughter and his mother was his first wife. After he died, they had to move to Switzerland, where he lived for more than 100 years, in order to raise money for their daughter. Today he is still living with his parents. On Thursday he received a gift of $ 3.5 million from his grandmother. Heidi is in her 70th year of marriage and she has lived in Switzerland for over a year. As she prepares to marry her first husband Peter, her mother is expecting their first child in January. This is her second child to arrive in Germany in May. Claudia Vega: \"I'm so glad I'm here to stay with you, my daughter is here with me,\" she said in an interview with The New York Times. For the record, this is not the last time she will see Heidi at her new home in Austria. However, there is no doubt that it will not be her last. If she does not live there, we will have to wait a long time to find out what her future will hold in store for us. You can read more about Heidi's life in this interview here, here and here.

I don't know. Do you have any idea what to expect from Heidi? Tell me what will happen to Heidi, or will you tell me? Let me tell you what you will learn? She has already told me! I hope she's story"

But now they should take care that Great Britain does not move further away from Europe, writes Birgit Maass. If only they had done it out of full conviction. If they at least believed that they could really benefit their country by withdrawing from the EU. But many of the parliamentarians whose vote will finally set Brexit on its wayhave voted against their hearts, as well as their minds. It was a vote against their minds, because the withdrawal from the EU will almost certainly, at least on a short to medium term basis, have negative repercussions for the British economy. And it was a vote against their hearts, because for many, a view of the future, divorced from Brussels and increasingly reliant on an unpredictable US President Donald Trump, is somewhat alarming. In recent days, many members of parliament have described it as \"a catastrophe.\" No vote \"against the will of the people.\" Of course there are \"Brexiteers\" who believe that a Britain independent of Brussels will be able to return to its former greatness, once it is no longer held back by the \"Little Europeans.\" But they are in the minority - the majority of parliamentarians already declared their support for remaining in the EU during the referendum campaign. Yet despite this, Theresa May's government was able to push its legislative proposal through the House of Commons without any great difficulty. The predominant view, also amongst members of the two leading parties, is that to hinder Brexit and to fail to support the government in its endeavors to do so, would be to go \"against the will of the people.\" Anti-EU newspapers have targeted Brexit opponents. And those who have publically come out in support of the EU have had to reckon with death threats. The at times passionate debate in the lower house, that went on over several days, was a temporary highlight in this European tragedy, which in the worst case could contribute to the continent disintegrating into individual sovereign states. Don't be intimidated The British public supports the hard-line position taken by Prime Minister May in withdrawing from the common market. Polls are showing that her strategy is gaining increased support. There is no turning back now. The British are now looking for clarity on the repercussions of their withdrawal from the EU. They want the negotiations with the EU to start as soon as possible. It was an historical misjudgement by David Cameron that he could win the referendum. Most of the members of the lower house believed the then-prime minister and voted to hold a referendum. But now they can no longer stop Brexit. But they should not let themselves be intimidated by party discipline, nor the leading Brexiteers, nor by voter impatience. Over the next two years they should use every chance they can to influence the withdrawal process. May announced that although they are leaving the European Union, they will not be moving away from Europe. The parliamentarians must now hold her to her word. Have something to say?

        "generated_story": "Britain's Brexit vote is not a referendum against the will of the people Britain's vote to leave the European Union has been called by the British parliament. It is a vote against democracy. The House of Commons voted in favor of Brexit on Tuesday, with the result that it will be the first time the UK has voted to exit the EU. British Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed to fight for the rights of EU citizens to vote on the terms of their departure from the bloc. \"We will not allow this to happen again,\" she said in a statement, adding that the vote would be held in the next two years. 'We are not going to let this happen to us again,' she added, referring to the referendum that took place in June 2016. Britain voted overwhelmingly in favour of leaving the 28-nation bloc, which is the single largest trading bloc in Europe. That vote, however, did not take place at the ballot box. Instead, it was carried out by a majority of MPs who voted against Brexit. This is because of a lack of political will, and the fact that many of them were not willing to give up their right to a free and fair vote. They were also not prepared to accept a no-deal Brexit, but rather, they were prepared for a hard-fought vote that would leave Britain without a single EU member state. And that's exactly what happened. There was no \"no\" vote at all. In fact, there was only one abstention. But that didn't stop people from casting their votes. Many of those who cast their ballots for May's Conservative Party (UK) said that they would vote for her to stay on as prime minister and that she would not be able to do so without the support of her own party, the Leave campaign. Leave campaigners have called on May to step down from her position as leader of Leave Means Leave (EU) and to be replaced by an independent, pro-European government. May said she was ready to make the case that Brexit was the best way to get Britain out of its current economic and political isolation. She also called for an end to EU membership and a return to an EU-wide single market, as well as a \"one-stop-shop\" approach to trade and investment. Brexit will have to wait until the end of next year, she told the BBC's Margaret Thatcher in an interview published on Wednesday, before it could be voted on by all parties in Parliament. A referendum on Brexit is scheduled for March 29, 2019, in which May is due to present her government's position. If she does not win the majority, May will face a tough decision on how to proceed with her Brexit negotiations. Her government is expected to have a strong chance of securing a deal with EU partners, including the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Ireland, Portugal, Greece and Spain. However, that may not happen overnight, because she has already secured the backing of all EU members. On the other hand, Brexit supporters have already expressed their opposition to her plans to remain in Brussels, where she is likely to face the prospect of having to negotiate a new trade deal, if she wants to avoid a disorderly exit from Brussels. For now, though, this is just the beginning of what she hopes to achieve in her new role as PM May can do: She has promised to work with European partners to ensure a smooth transition to free movement of goods and services. EU leaders have also said they will continue to support her efforts to reach an agreement with Brussels and other EU countries, such as the US and Canada, to ease the burden on British businesses and businesses. Some EU officials have said the Brexit process could take longer than that, given the current political situation in Britain. One EU official said it would take at least a year to resolve the differences between the two blocs. Another EU leader, US President Donald Trump, said he was \"very optimistic\" about the future of relations between Britain and Europe, saying that \"the EU will remain an important partner for us. I think that is something that we can all agree on. We are very hopeful that this will happen.\" The EU is unlikely to change its position, he said, \"I think it's a very good thing that there is an opportunity for Britain to move forward with its own future.\" EU Secretary-General, David Cameron, told BBC Newsnight that he would like to see a Brexit deal in place. He said: \"The EU has a lot of influence in this regard and I'm very optimistic about that. You can't be sure that Europe will get a better deal than we are currently doing. Europe is going through a difficult time in coming years, so we will need to prepare for this. What do you think? I don't think we should be ready for that? You know what I mean? That's not an easy thing to say: We want to talk to you. Let's hope that Britain can be a good partner. Here's what we have an orderly exit is clear that"

        "target": "French presidential debate does little to woo undecided voters This year's French presidential race is perhaps the most closely watched election in recent history. Many voters are still undecided, including those in the Paris caf\u00e9 where DW's Jake Cigainero saw the latest TV debate. Just over two weeks ahead of the first round of voting in France's presidential election, all 11 candidates met for the second televised debate of the campaign. It was the first time in the history of French elections that the entire official ballot shared a television stage. This race for the Elysee is perhaps the most closely watched election in the history of the Fifth Republic in view of conservative candidate Francois Fillon's embezzlement charges, the deterioration of the left, political amateur Emmanuel Macron's surprise surge to the top, and the rise of Marine Le Pen's National Front. With so much media attention on the five main candidates, Tuesday's debate felt almost like a consolation for the six other candidates rarely in the spotlight. For French voters watching the televised debate at Cafe des Phares on Place de la Bastille, the saturated stage kept the candidates from detailed discussion of pressing issues. For those who are still undecided, the debate did little to bring them closer to choosing their pick for president. Vincent Couronne, a researcher, said it was good to see candidates who don't get as much media attention. However, 11 candidates at once for the political spectator was overkill. \"It wasn't very interesting. It's just one position after another. There's no real debate. It's not like when it was just five candidates.\" Boredom all round Charlotte Theuvenin and her friends, all students in their early 20s, tuned out early on from boredom and exasperation. \"It was too flat and too hypocritical. Fillon and Le Pen play with our money, then say they did nothing and that they are good for our country,\" she said. As though addressing the candidates in front of her on the TV screen, she added, \"How dare you talk about being president when you use our money for your own interests.\" Le Pen had come under fire over accusations that she misused public funds to pay bodyguards as parliamentary assistants. Francois Fillon of Les Republicains, meanwhile, is under investigation for allegedly paying family members more than 1 million euros ($1.1 million) for government work they never carried out. Frequently casting a blank stare at his opponents, Fillon also seemed bored, or at least more subdued compared to the first debate. Couronne said, \"Fillon seems to be not there. Probably because he knows all the small candidates can attack him on the criminal offenses he's accused of.\" Debate watchers cited Europe as the most important issue of this election, with many fearing Le Pen's promise to tear France out of the European Union in a so-called Frexit. Though no one at the cafe vocally supported Le Pen's plan, several acknowledged the EU is a pressure point for France. \"France's place in Europe in relation to Germany is a very important issue,\" said student Thibault Cirier. \"The general problem is France has lost its influence at the European level over the years, and that needs to be remedied, because France is one of the founders of Europe and should have a strong place in the union. The EU is also important for cohesion and to have a strong position internationally.\" Caf\u00e9 viewers say no to Le Pen Cirier was initially excited by Macron when he launched his campaign, but ultimately decided there was no substance. Now he says he will probably vote for far-left candidate Jean-Luc Melenchon. Kevser Taspinar also said she liked Melenchon for his fighting spirit and that \"he throws barbs.\" As a practicing Muslim who wears a headscarf, she said the most important issue for her is laicite, France's state institution of secularism. \"For me Hamon has the best interpretation of this. Maybe Hamon,\" Taspinar said hesitating. \"I'm still undecided, because there's Melenchon.\" Another viewer, Marie Dubois, said that although she really liked Melenchon, she had definitively decided on Macron. \"Melenchon has a way of putting humanity in politics and giving hope,\" she said. \"But Macron is the only possible candidate.\" With polls putting Le Pen and Macron in the second round on May 7, the undecided voters at this Paris cafe said they were certain which candidate they would not for vote for in that scenario. \"Definitely Macron. There is no way I am going to vote for Le Pen,\" Theuvenin said. \"I will never vote for that woman or Front National, no matter who is running against them in the second round.\" Tuesday was the final debate for Macron and Melenchon, two of the crowd-pleasers among the candidates. Both have pulled out of the third debate on grounds that it cuts too close to the first vote just two days later on April 23.",
        "generated_story": "Le Pen's Le Pen: 'No, No' The French National Front's candidate for the French presidential election, Francois Fillon, has a new slogan: \"We are not going to leave the Fifth Republic.\" French President Emmanuel Macron has called for a \"Frexit\" of the country's borders, but he has not ruled out the possibility of a return to the European Union. In a statement, Macron said he was \"very happy\" with the result. \"I am very happy with what we have achieved so far,\" he said, adding that he would like to see the party \"reform\" in the future. But he also wants to make sure that the people of France do not have to suffer the consequences of their vote. He said that if they did, they would not be able to vote for their own candidate. The party's presidential candidate, Jean-Luc Melenchon, called on Macron to do the same for his own party, the Front National (FN) and the Left Front (Fillon) to win back the support of French voters. However, he added that it was not enough to convince voters to back his candidacy. Macron, who has been in office for two weeks, is expected to be elected president on May 7. If he does not win the presidency, it will be a long time before he will have a chance to take the reins of power in France. For now, however, his campaign is focused on the fight against the right-wing, which he sees as an existential threat to France's long-term stability. On Tuesday, a group of young people gathered at the Elysee Palace in Paris to protest against Macron's election victory. They were met with jeers from the left and right, as well as a wave of jejes de la Bastille (yellow vest) supporters. Many of them said they were disappointed that Macron had not won the election. Others said Macron was the only candidate who could win, and that they wished he had been elected. Some even called him \"the best candidate,\" while others said the president should be given the chance of becoming the next French president. A number of other candidates, including the far-right candidate Marine le Pen, were also in attendance on Tuesday. One of those was former FN candidate Charlotte Theuvenin (pictured above), who is now a member of parliament. She said she was disappointed by the results, saying that she had \"no idea what the outcome would have been.\" \"It's a very difficult situation,\" she told DW's Jake Cigainero in a phone interview, referring to Macron as the \"grand candidate.\" She added, \"But I don't think that's the case at all. I think it's very important to me that I'm not the first candidate to say that. It's not just a candidate that is not a politician, either. That's because I am a person who believes in democracy and I believe in freedom of speech and democracy. And I do believe that democracy is the most important thing that can be achieved in this country.\" The Leftist candidate is also a strong supporter of Macron and has campaigned on a platform of free trade and open borders. Despite the fact that many of his supporters are anti-EU, she is a staunch Eurosceptic. Her party is opposed to free movement of migrants and refugees from other European countries, such as Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Greece, Portugal, Romania, Turkey and Russia. France is one of Europe's largest Muslim-majority countries and she supports the idea of an EU-wide referendum on EU membership. This is why she's calling for an \"open Europe\" that would allow migrants to enter the EU without having to pay taxes. After all, this would be the last chance for her to get a job in Europe. As a result, her party has lost a lot of support from her own people. So she has to work hard to find a way to stay in touch with her friends and family in her early 20s. At the moment, though, that doesn't seem like a good thing, given that her support for Macron is so strong, so many people are still in opposition to her policies. What's more important is that France and France are united in their desire to protect the rights of refugees and asylum seekers, especially those who have fled the Middle East and are fleeing the continent. There's also the question of whether or not she will remain in power. How can she do that? \"She can't do it alone,\" said French Foreign Minister Nicolas M\u00e9lenchon in an interview with DW. 'She has no idea how she can get out of this mess,\" the Foreign Ministry spokesman, Thibault Cirier, said of her father, former French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac, whose father was killed by a car bomb on April 23, 2017, in his hometown of Marseille, near the southern French city of Saint-Etienne, where she grew up. French-born French politician Vincent Couronne, meanwhile, says he is"

Smuggling has prompted a visit to Mexico City by US Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly. Prosecutors said the remote town of Las Varas in Chihuahua state was the scene of Wednesday's battle between affiliates of the Ciudad Juarez cartel and a gang from the state of Sinaloa. Police said fighting escalated when patrols arrived. Fourteen people were found dead; 12 others were hospitalized. Grenades, launchers and rifles were found. The mountainous region is used as a corridor for smuggling into the US. El Chapo effect Chihuahua security commissioner Oscar Alberto Aparicio said a Black Hawk helicopter was called in as police chased surviving gang members through the area known for marijuana and opium poppy production. Two police officers had been killed in a \"cowardly\" way in the area a week ago, he said. In a similar incident last Friday, 17 gunmen were killed during a shootout with police on a highway in Sinaloa, Mexico's northwestern state. Sinaloa was the home base of Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, whose extradition to the US in January apparently left gangsters in a struggle for control of criminal syndicates. Homicides have surged in recent months, with the number of persons killed in May put at 2,186, the highest since the collection of such statistics began 20 years ago. Nieto and Kelly to talk In Mexico City Wednesday, President Enrique Pena Nieto's office said he and visiting US Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly had discussed how to rein in organized crime groups. \"Shared responsibility\" must become the focus of transnational efforts, Kelly said. Narcotics smuggling into the US has become a multibillion-dollar (multibillion-euro) business for Mexican drug cartels. Mexico in turn wants the US to throttle demand for narcotics and the supply of illegal weapons to Mexico cartels. Pena Nieto and US President Donald Trump, who wants a border wall, are schedule to meet Friday on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany. ipj/ng (AP, AFP, dpa)",
        "generated_story": "US Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly visits the scene of a gunbattle in northern Mexico on Wednesday. US officials say they have been briefed by Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto on the incident, which has left at least 20 people dead. The US has launched an investigation into the killing of the drug lord Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, who is suspected of being involved in a drug trafficking ring that has been operating in Mexico for 20 years. Officials said they had received information that the suspected drug trafficker had fled to the United States. \"We are working with the Mexican government to find a way to bring him to justice,\" Kelly told reporters at a news conference in the capital, Chihuahua, where he is staying with his wife, Oscar Alberto Aparicio, and their two young children. Kelly said he was \"very concerned\" about the death of his son and that he would not be allowed to return to his home state of Guadalajara. On Wednesday, the US government announced that it was sending a special team to Mexico to investigate the case. It was not immediately clear whether it would be a case of mistaken identity, but officials said it appeared to be an isolated incident. More than a week ago, US President Donald Trump had called on Mexico's president to step down from his post as head of state. Last week, Trump called for an end to US-Mexican relations, saying the two countries' relationship had deteriorated over the past two decades. Trump has also said that Mexico should step up its efforts to protect its citizens from the dangers of terrorism. In a statement, he said: \"I am very concerned for the safety and security of our people. I am also very worried for our country's security and our security.\" The president's office said the investigation was ongoing, adding that \"we will continue to monitor the situation closely\" and \"will be working closely with our Mexican counterparts to ensure that there is no further escalation of tensions between our countries.\" Trump's Mexican counterpart, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, is expected to visit the country on Friday, according to a US official. He is also due to meet with Mexican Prime Minister Manuel Lopez Obrador on Thursday to discuss the security situation in his country. President Trump, meanwhile, has vowed to make Mexico a \"great place to live\" as he seeks to reassure the world that his administration is prepared to do everything in its power to prevent a repeat of last year's deadly drug war. But the president has not said whether he will do anything to stop the violence, despite the fact that a number of people have died in recent months. Mexican officials have accused Trump of ordering the killings of dozens of men and women, including drug traffickers, in an apparent bid to undermine his government's ability to fight drug cartels. Mexico has repeatedly denied the allegations of human rights abuses, accusing the U.S. government of trying to cover up the crimes of its own people, a claim the Trump administration has dismissed as \"basically a cover-up.\" \"This is not the first time that we have seen this kind of behavior,\" Trump said at the G20 summit in Buenos Aires, Argentina, earlier this month. 'It's not something we want to see happen again,\" he added, referring to an incident in which a man was killed by a suspected gang member who had been carrying a knife and was shot to death by an unknown assailant. At the same time, Mexican authorities have said there were no signs of an imminent threat to national security, although they are still searching for a suspect. Reuters, AP, AFP, dpa, Reuters and AP have not independently verified the claims, citing unnamed security sources, as well as the Associated Press and the Mexico City Police Department. According to Reuters news agency, there are currently no reports of any arrests in this case and no arrests of Mexican nationals. There are no indications that any suspects are believed to have committed any crimes. However, it is unclear whether there will be any new charges against the suspect, or if he has any involvement in any of these cases. If the charges are true, they could be brought against him, however, that could lead to more arrests and a possible prosecution of those accused of crimes against humanity,\" the official said. A spokesman for US Attorney General Lorena Gonzalez told the AP on condition of anonymity that no charges have yet been filed against Trump. Meanwhile, officials in New York have warned that Trump is likely to press ahead with a planned travel ban on US citizens who are traveling abroad to attend the summit. New Mexico is the latest country to face a new round of deadly violence in January. That could mean the end of peace talks between Trump and his predecessor, President Xi Jinping, will not rule out the possibility of new travel restrictions for Mexico. And it's unclear if Trump himself will travel to Washington to address the issue, though the government has yet to confirm whether Trump will make a decision on whether or not he'll be able to travel there. Speaking to reporters after the meeting with Trump in May, Kelly has already"

        "target": "Italy's navy to patrol with Libyan ships to curb human trafficking Italy wants to work more closely with Libya to limit the number of sea crossings by migrants and potential asylum seekers. But what are the consequences? Italy's prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni, does not want to wait any longer for EU countries to show solidarity in distributing asylum seekers throughout the bloc. On Thursday he announced in Rome that the Italian navy would be patrolling with Libyan ships just off the Libyan coastline. The aim, Gentiloni says, is to curb human trafficking and bring migrants back from the smugglers' boats to Libya. According to the Italian government's figures, 93,000 migrants have arrived in Italy so far this year. At least 2,000 have drowned in the attempt to cross the Mediterranean - the true figure is unknown. Italy has already threatened to stop allowing boats carrying rescued migrants to dock in Italian ports, or that it may issue migrants with documents that would allow them to travel on to other European countries. Rome has not yet implemented either policy, but the government has made clear that Italy will soon run out of options. The EU Commissioner for Migration Dimitris Avramopoulos acknowledged, again, in Brussels on Thursday that \"Europe continues to face high migratory pressures. And Italy more than (almost) any others.\" The European Commission issued a letter offering more aid and personnel to help manage migration better. Accommodation will soon be full The office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, wrote at the beginning of July that \"Close to 200,000 accommodation places are available for refugees and migrants across [Italy], but are nearly all full.\" The High Commissioner referred particularly to the numbers of people dying when he warned, \"What is happening in front of our eyes in Italy is an unfolding tragedy.\" The United Nations anticipates that another 100,000 migrants will come to Italy via Libya before the end of this year. The number of arrivals is already 20 percent higher than last year; and the number of dead, those who could not be saved, would rise accordingly. According to UN estimates, the Mediterranean remains the \"deadliest\" refugee route in the world. Italian government statistics say that around 600,000 people have arrived in Italian ports since the start of the crisis in 2014. It is unclear how many have since traveled on to Austria, France or Switzerland. Once migrants are registered in Italy and accommodated in camps, they are not held there. If, however, they leave the accommodation without giving notice, they forfeit their claim to subsistence and social services. Most of the migrants are from African countries, and many try to travel on to France, for example. 300 people are currently sleeping on the beach in Ventimiglia, on the French border, hoping to take a bus or train to France. However, the border is being policed by French officials. Migrants who are caught are sent back to Italy. Austria has announced that it too will close its border with Italy if the number of migrants starts to rise. Repatriation and distribution are difficult Last year 120,000 new asylum applications were made in Italy. Around 50 percent of these are rejected. The asylum seekers are then supposed to leave the country. However, the process of people either returning voluntarily or being deported is very slow. The interior ministry has therefore announced that it will reinforce repatriation programs. The redistribution of asylum seekers from Italy, as agreed by the European Union, is well behind target. Two years ago the aim was to resettle 120,000 people. So far, only 24,676 people have been redistributed, the EU Commission said on Thursday: 7,873 from Italy, and 16,803 from Greece. The numbers are low not just because of the reluctance of other EU countries to take the refugees in, but also because of Italian delays in the registration of possible candidates. Asylum seekers from Eritrea are the most likely to fulfill the criteria for redistribution. Around 25,000 are currently living in Italy, but only 10,000 have been registered with the EU Commission and the European Asylum Support Office as possible candidates. Migration Commissioner Avramopoulos has announced that Italy will be given more help and logistical support in this area.",
        "generated_story": "Italy's EU Commissioner for Migration Dimitris Avramopoulos says Italy is facing \"an unfolding tragedy\" in the Mediterranean region. The European Commission said on Thursday that Italy was facing an \"unprecedented tragedy.\" The EU's migration commissioner for Europe, Paolo Gentiloni, said the situation in Italy \"appears to be similar to that in other parts of the world.\" According to the EU Commission, Italy faces an unfolding humanitarian crisis. \"We are facing a humanitarian catastrophe,\" the commissioner said in a statement, adding that \"it is not the first time that this has happened in Europe.\" \"It is the second time in two years that we have experienced this kind of crisis,\" he said. He added that the European Union was \"deeply troubled\" by the migrant crisis in Greece and Italy, which he described as a \"troubling situation\". \"This is a situation that is very worrying to me because it is something that has never happened before in my entire life,\" said Filippo Grandi, the commission's head of migration and migration, in an interview with the United Nations (UN) in New York. In 2014, Greece was the only EU member state to receive asylum from migrants. Since then, it has received more than 1.5 million asylum applications, according to a UN report. Last year, a total of 2.4 million migrants were admitted to Italy. This year's deadline for asylum seekers is at the beginning of July, and the number of arrivals is expected to rise to 3.6 million. According the UN, this is \"the highest number ever recorded in terms of migrants seeking asylum in this part of Europe since the end of World War II,\" which began in 1939. It is unclear how many migrants have been accepted into the country since then. Many of them have fled to other countries, such as Greece, Spain, Portugal, Romania, Bulgaria, Turkey and Greece. Most of these migrants are from the Balkans, where they have lived for decades. They are mainly from countries in Africa, Asia, Africa and Latin America. At the same time, they are fleeing persecution in their own countries. There is also a growing concern that they will not be able to return to their home countries as quickly as they did in 2014 and 2015, when they were still living in Germany and France. Some of those migrants, however, have returned to Europe to seek asylum, while others have sought asylum elsewhere. Italy has faced a similar situation, with many of its own migrants returning to its shores in recent years. On Thursday, Prime Minister Matteo Renzi announced that he would be stepping down from his post as EU commissioner to take a leave of absence in order to focus on other priorities, including the migration crisis at home and Europe's refugee crisis, as well as the need to deal with other crises. His resignation comes after a series of failed attempts to find a solution for the migrants who have left the continent. One of his first steps is to set up a new asylum office in Rome, but he has been unable to do so because of a lack of funds. A new office is being created to handle asylum requests from refugees and migrants from across Europe. That office will be opened in July and will have the capacity to provide information on how to get asylum to migrants and refugees. But it will also have to make sure that all the information it receives is accurate and that it can be used to help them reach their destination. For now, there is no way to know how long the process will take to complete their asylum application. More than a year and a half before the deadline is set to expire, he added, \"I don't think we are going to have a lot of time to prepare for this. I think it's too early to say what will happen. We are not ready to give up on this issue.\" He said he hoped to hold a meeting with EU officials at an EU summit in Brussels in mid-July to discuss the future of asylum and asylum policy. However, his office said it would not comment further on the issue, saying he was not aware of any new proposals for migrants to leave the bloc. Meanwhile, some EU countries have already announced plans to close their borders. Germany, for example, has announced a plan to open up its borders to asylum-seekers. France, meanwhile, is considering a move to tighten its border controls. EU leaders are also looking for ways to ease the pressure on Italy's borders and to reduce the burden on migrants in coming months. Officials in Berlin have said they want to ensure that migrants do not have access to EU territory. If they do decide to apply for a visa, that will only be a matter of months before they can get a chance to go through the asylum process. So far, so far we haven't seen any concrete action on that front. And that's what we're hoping to see. After all, we've already had a very good start to this year.

It's very easy and the best bit is, it can be reused. Maybe it will come back to you on your birthday. 1. All you need is a piece of fabric big enough to wrap your gift, a ribbon long enough to go right around it, and if you want to make a gift tag, you will also need a piece of old cardboard, a hole punch and another small piece of ribbon. Ready? 2. No, wait, we forgot the present. Get that, and you have everything you need. Spread the fabric on the ground and put your gift on top 3. Fold the fabric around the gift you are wrapping 4. With the last little bit, you don't tuck it under, but create a little flap on top 5. Fold that flap over like this 6. Take one end of the parcel and tuck the fabric inside, BEHIND the gift inside 7. You can take your time to wiggle it all inside. Make it as flat as you can 8. Once it is all inside, turn to the other end and do the same thing again 9. When you have done both ends, it should look like this. Your present is all tucked up inside and you don't need any tape to keep it closed 10. Now for the ribbon. Place the gift on top of it 11. Tie the bow 12. So it looks like this. Finished? If you want a gift tag, that comes now. If you don't you're done! 13. Cut a piece out of an old cardboard box and make a hole in it using a hole punch. Watch your fingers though ;) 14. Put a piece of short ribbon through your hole 15. Tie the tag to your gift 16. And you are finished! P.S. You can either ask your friend to reuse the fabric, and show them how to wrap with it, or if they don't like that idea, you can take it home with you to use again the next time. And remember, you don't have to buy the fabric. You can use an old pillow case, an old t-shirt or skirt, or whatever you want. You can even make your ribbon from an old t-shirt if you don't have any. Happy wrapping.",
        "generated_story": "How to Wrap a Present Without Using Paper or Tape How to wrap a present without using paper or tape in order to make it look as if it's wrapped in paper and tape. The trick is to use paper, tape, and a pen to hold the present in place. It's a simple process, but one that can be done without the use of paper. You simply have to be careful what you put in front of you. That's how you wrap your present, right? You don't want to mess with it. This is the trick of wrapping presents in plastic and then using pen and paper to keep them from falling out of the package. And that's exactly what I did. I wrapped my present with a paper towel and put it in a plastic bag and wrapped it around my finger. Then I put the paper on top of it and it looked like it was going to fall out. After all, it wasn't supposed to happen that way. In fact, I think it would have been easier to do that if I had just used paper rather than tape and used pen. But that doesn't mean that I didn't have paper in my hand, which is why I was able to get it wrapped around the finger and wrap it up in the bag. There's no need to worry about wrapping paper around your finger, because paper is a staple in any present. If you're not careful, you'll end up with something that looks a lot like a bag of spaghetti. However, if you are careful with your wrapping, there's always the possibility that it could be used in other ways too. For example, wrapping a gift with paper would be a great way to show that you've done the right thing by wrapping it with plastic wrap. \"It's not a big deal at all,\" one expert told me. Another expert said that wrapping gifts with pen or paper was a good idea. Other experts said the best method was to simply wrap the presents around a piece of plastic, then wrap them in tape or a tissue to give them a little extra protection. One expert also said wrapping the gifts around an object was the most effective way of making it appear as though you were wrapping something around someone else's finger or something. Some experts even suggested wrapping them with tape to protect the object. Others, however, said it might be easier said than done, adding that the material is more durable than plastic. They also pointed to the fact that paper has been used for so long in some cases, such as when wrapping envelopes, in which case it is used as a form of protection for the hands. These are the ones that are most commonly used by people who have a hard time wrapping their presents, as well as for those who do not know what they are doing with their hands when they wrap presents. As a result, the wrapping of presents is not as easy as it should be for people to put them on the table. Many people have complained that they have no idea what is going on in their lives, especially when it comes to presents and how to present them to a child. So, this is what we've learned from our experience. We've all been through this before. A lot of people in our lives have experienced this experience and we all know how difficult it can sometimes be. Our experience has taught us to appreciate the importance of keeping things in perspective. What's more important is that we have learned that when you have something to look forward to in life, we can do it all the time. Just like we did with our children, when we were little kids, that is how we learned to live with the world. When we had our first child, our parents were very young and they had to learn to cope with all these things. Now, they've grown up and now they're adults, who are now adults. People are learning to accept that their children are grown and appreciate that, even though we're older and have children and their parents are old and old, to have their own children. How can we do something like this? I'm not sure what to expect from them. Let me tell you, though, let me give you some tips on how I can help you in this situation. First of all: I want you to know that there is no one who knows what's happening in your life. Do you know who you can trust? Let's talk to your parents and tell them the truth. Tell them about your child and the things you learned. OK? Tell me about the experience of being a parent, tell us what happened to you! Tell us about what went wrong. Learn more about that.

        "target": "Hurricane Irma thrashes Caribbean as Jose strengthens in wake Hurricane Irma has continued to pack 300 kph winds as it moves across the Caribbean toward Florida. The record-breaking storm has battered the Bahamas and Cuba, while Hurricane Jose followed in its path. As one of the Atlantic Ocean's largest storms plowed through the Caribbean, leaving destruction in its wake, residents of the US state of Florida prepared for what could be the worst storm to make landfall in over a century. At least 17 people have been killed and dozens more injured across several island nations in the Caribbean. Irma is expected to be there second major hurricane to make landfall in the United States in less than two weeks. Hurricane Harvey struck Texas last week, killing more than 60 people and displacing roughly 1 million others. In the US territory of Puerto Rico, 1 million people \u2013 nearly one-third of the population \u2013 lost electricity during the storm, said Puerto Rican Governor Ricardo Rossello. \"It will be difficult to estimate how long the power outage will last,\" Rossello said. Later, officials confirmed that at least two people on the island had been killed by the storm's devastation. Two other major storms have developed in the Caribbean, namely Hurricane Jose and Hurricane Katia. Jose was east of the Lesser Antilles with maximum sustained winds of 120 miles per hour (195 kilometers per hour) as a hurricane watch was in effect for Antigua and Barbuda. Jose has followed the same path as Hurricane Irma, and was upgraded to a Category 4 on Friday by the US National Hurricane Center. Katia has remained relatively static, hovering off the coast of Mexico. Florida on edge Florida Governor Rick Scott said 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain were expected after Irma made landfall at the weekend as he urged evacuations during a press conference on Friday. Nearly 700,000 people have been asked to leave Miami and its surrounding areas. \"Today is the day to do the right thing for your family and get inland for safety... Do not ignore evacuation orders. All Floridians should be prepared to evacuate soon,\" Scott said. Read more: How to reduce risks from mega-storms? \"I know many of you are stuck in traffic, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s very frustrating. Evacuations are not convenient but they are absolutely meant to keep you safe,\" he added. On Friday, US President Donald Trump described Irma as a storm of \"absolutely historic destructive potential.\" Trump also on Friday signed a $15 billion (13.5 billion euro) hurricane relief package passed by Congress, which also raises the debt ceiling and postpones the possibility of a shutdown of government funding until December. Downgraded to an \"extremely dangerous\" Category 4 but still packing winds of 185 mph (300 kph), Irma moved between the north coast of Cuba and the Bahamas as it neared the Florida Keys and the southern Florida Peninsula. 'Major hurricane' Irma will have a \"truly devastating\" impact on the state's southern coastal areas when it slams into Florida, said US Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) chief Brock Long. Read more: Is climate change making mega-hurricanes the new normal? \"Bottom line is the majority of people along the coast have never experienced a major hurricane like this. It will be truly devastating,\" Long told CNN. \"The entire southeastern United States better wake up and pay attention. Death and destruction At least 11 people have been killed and dozens more injured after Irma tore through the French Caribbean, Barbuda, Anguilla and the British Virgin Islands. Amid widening criticism from residents in British territories that not enough was done to safeguard people from the storm, British Foreign Office Minister Alana Duncan said London has sent tents, vehicles and other relief equipment. \"Anguilla received the hurricane's full blast. The initial assessment is that the damage has been severe and in places critical,\" Duncan told the British Parliament. Thousands displaced Antigua and Barbuda Prime Minister Gaston Browne said nearly every building on Barbuda was damaged when the hurricane's core crossed almost directly over the island early Wednesday and about 60 percent of the island's roughly 1,400 people were homeless.

French, British and Dutch military authorities reportedly rushed aid to the devastated Caribbean islands later on Thursday, with warships and planes dispatching food, water and troops. French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said four people were confirmed dead and about 50 injured on the French side of St. Martin, an island split between Dutch and French control. French Interior Minister Gerard Collomb said 100,000 food rations were sent to St. Barts and St. Martin, the equivalent of four days of supplies. ls/jm (AP, AFP, Reuters, dpa)",
        "generated_story": "Hurricane Irma in the Caribbean: warnings and warnings US President Donald Trump has issued a series of warnings for Hurricane Irma. The US National Hurricane Center said on Thursday that the storm was expected to make landfall on the Florida Keys on Friday. \"It's going to be an extremely dangerous storm,\" said FEMA Administrator Ricardo Rossello, referring to Hurricane Katia, which hit the US territory of the Lesser Antilles earlier this month. FEMA Director Brock Long said the hurricane was likely to cause \"significant damage\" to the island's infrastructure. He added that \"it will be very difficult to assess the extent of damage,\" adding that it was unlikely to have a direct impact on people's livelihoods. President Trump also warned that Hurricane Jose could cause widespread damage to homes and businesses in Florida and Puerto Rico, as well as the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean. Florida Governor Rick Scott said he was \"very concerned\" about the impact of Hurricane Harvey on his state's economy. In addition, he said, \"I am very concerned for the safety of our people and our communities.\" The storm's path is still unknown, but officials said it could take at least four days to reach the Keys. Officials said they were monitoring the situation closely and would issue a statement later Friday, when they would be able to confirm the exact location of any damage. Meanwhile, the White House said that federal officials were working closely with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to prepare for a possible storm surge of up to 13.5 billion euros (13.6 billion euro) over the next three days, according to a report by the Associated Press news agency. It was not immediately clear how much damage was being caused by Irma, or how many people were affected. Federal officials also said there was no immediate threat to life or property in St. Martin, where the Category 4 storm is forecast to hit, and that there were no reports of deaths or serious injuries. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Friday that FEMA was working on a plan to evacuate people from the islands in preparation for an imminent storm. French President Edouard Philippe, meanwhile, said his government was prepared to assist the affected areas. But he also called on Congress to act quickly to prevent further damage, saying it would take \"a lot of time, effort and resources to deal with this storm.\" \"This is a very serious situation,\" he told reporters in Washington, D.C. On Thursday, a US federal agency, FEMA, announced a $15 billion emergency fund to help victims of hurricanes Irma and Jose, in addition to federal disaster aid and disaster relief. A US government spokesman said a total of $1.4 billion was available to cover the cost of evacuations and other emergency operations. More than 13,000 people have been evacuated from their homes as a result of Irma's powerful winds and torrential rain. Many of those evacuees are still in shelters, while others are staying in hotels, hotels and motels. There is no official word yet on how long the evacuation will take. According to French Prime Minister Gerard Collomb, more than a week has passed since Irma passed through the eastern Caribbean island of Hispaniola. His government has also issued an emergency declaration of emergency to protect residents from flooding and landslides. However, it is not clear if the government will act in a way that would allow the federal government to do so. For now, there are no plans to take any action. At the moment, however, officials are working to ensure that all the necessary measures are in place to avoid a repeat of last year's disaster. They are also urging the public to remain vigilant and be prepared for any potential flooding, especially in areas where there is an ongoing threat of flooding. And they are urging people to stay away from dangerous areas, such as Florida's Keys, because of a lack of power and high water levels. This is the first time FEMA has been asked to provide aid to people affected by a major storm like Irma that has caused widespread flooding in many parts of Florida, including the state of New York and New Jersey. (Reuters, AP, AFP, Reuters)Federal officials have already issued warnings to residents in New Orleans and Miami, warning them of possible flooding from Tropical Storm Jose. If they do not evacuate immediately, they will not be allowed to leave the area for several days. That is, if they don't evacuate the areas that are already inundated with water. Experts say it's too early to know what will happen to those who are affected, given the high level of public concern. 'We will have to wait and see what we can do,' the French Interior Minister said in an interview with CNN. Speaking to reporters, President-elect Donald J. Trump said \"we will do everything in our power to try and protect the people of these islands.\" FEMA spokesman Ricardo R. Rosselo said federal agencies will continue to work with local authorities in order to monitor the damage caused to their properties and assess damage and to respond to any storm-ravaged properties, isolated communities."

        "target": "Indian government tells Supreme Court Rohingya pose'serious threat' After an appeal from two Rohingya, India's top court is considering PM Narendra Modi's plan to deport some 40,000 Rohingya in India. The government said intelligence data showed links between some Rohingya and terrorism. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government told the Supreme Court of India on Monday that the Rohingya were \"illegal\" immigrants. The hearing is taking place as Rohingya face severe violence in their native Myanmar. More than 400,000 Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh in the past few weeks to escape military and civilian reprisals that the United Nations has described as \"ethnic cleansing.\" Later on Monday, Myanmar's national security advisor said that his government was willing to welcome the refugees who had fled to Bangladesh back to their native Rakhine state, but that the details of the process still had to be worked out. \"We will make sure that everybody who left their home can return to their home but this is a process we have to discuss,\" Thaung Tun told Reuters news agency after a meeting with British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. It was unclear how this would affect the estimated 40,000 Rohingya believed to have settled in India, including 16,000 of whom are registered with the UN's refugee agency. Read more: Myanmar's Rohingya - A history of forced exoduses The Indian government told the court that it had intelligence data that showed links between some Rohingya Muslims and Pakistan-based terror groups and other international terror organizations. It argued that such links made them a \"serious threat to national security.\" The government also said there was a \"serious possibility of eruption of violence against Buddhists in India by radicalized Rohingya.\" Lawyer Colin Gonsalves, who in a separate case is representing about 7,000 Rohingya living in the northern Indian city of Jammu, countered the government's assertions. \"We just want to know: 40,000 people have been here, many of them for the last five years. Have you [the government] filed a single charge sheet, is anyone being prosecuted in the criminal court for being a terrorist? The answer is: no,\" he told DW. The court has adjourned the hearing in the matter to October 3. Lack of evidence India says it is not bound by the UN convention on refugees as it is not a signatory to the accord, but human rights activists disagree. \"The principle of non return of a person to a place where he will be executed or tortured has become a principle of customary international law which India follows,\" Gonsalves told DW. \"And it has attained the status of 'jus cogens,' which is a principle of law that no country can say is not applicable to it, such as torture and genocide.\" In a communication sent to all states in August, the Home Ministry [interior ministry] said the illegal migrants were more susceptible to terrorist recruitment efforts. But an investigation by Indian broadcaster NDTV found \"little evidence of the government claim.\" The investigation that was carried out at major Rohingya settlements in the country showed little involvement in criminal wrongdoing by the refugees. Lack of any evidence to support the government claim has led to speculations that the Rohingya were being targeted for their religion by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu-nationalist government. \"It is really unfortunate that the government is going back on its commitment to refugees which it has reiterated several times in the past merely because these Rohingyas are Muslims,\" said lawyer Prashant Bhushan, who filed the plea on behalf of two Rohingya men. \"I mean this is clearly a case of religious discrimination and an attempt to arouse a sort of feeling of... an anti-Muslim feeling or try and communalise the situation,\" he told reporters outside the courthouse. The UN's human rights chief last week deplored Indian government's move to deport Rohingya refugees. \"India cannot carry out collective expulsions, or return people to a place where they risk torture or other serious violations,\" Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein said. The Rohingya are an Indo-Aryan people, the vast majority of whom are Muslims. They usually migrate to India through a rather porous border to escape persecution in their native Rakhine state in Myanmar, where they have been denied citizenship rights. They are viewed by the local authorities as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. Myanmar's Buddhist majority is often accused of subjecting them to discrimination and violence. Read more: Rohingya people in Myanmar \u2013 What you need to know The ongoing violence follows an insurgent attack on security forces on August 25 in Rakhine state that sparked off a brutal military counteroffensive. Hundreds of people, the majority of them Rohingya, have been killed in the violence that has seen many homes destroyed and several villages burned down. Myanmar's government maintains the crackdown is part of a counter-terrorism drive, while the UN's al-Hussein has said that it \"seems a textbook example of ethnic cleansing.\"",
        "generated_story": "India says Rohingya pose 'disingenuous threat' to India India has said that the Rohingya Muslims pose a'serious threat to the Indian state of India' and that they pose an 'existential threat'. India's foreign ministry said on Monday that it was \"deeply concerned\" about the situation in the country. The Indian government said it had received information from the United Nations Security Council (UN) on the Rohingyas, who have been living in India for the past five years. \"We are deeply concerned,\" the Home Ministry's spokesman, Prashant Bhushan, said in an interview with NDTV. He added that \"we are very concerned about this situation.\" India, which has been a staunch ally of Myanmar for more than a five-decade-long struggle against the influx of refugees from Myanmar, has also expressed concern over the number of Rohingya in its territory. India is one of the world's most populous Muslim countries, but it is not the only one. In August, the UN General Assembly in New Delhi, for example, held an emergency meeting to discuss the issue. On August 25, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with the head of state Thaung Tun, and the two leaders agreed on a common strategy to tackle the crisis in Myanmar. They also agreed that India should take steps to ensure the safety of its citizens. However, India did not take any action to stop the exodus. Indian Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj, however, warned that Indian security forces would not be able to prevent it from happening. According to DW, \"India's security and security agencies are working very closely with India to make sure that all the necessary measures are taken in order to protect the security of our people.\" The two countries have also been at loggerheads in recent months, when India and Myanmar were at odds over how to deal with Rohingya refugees who had fled to neighboring Myanmar in August and September. Both countries are currently at war with each other over their Rohingya Muslim minority, according to a report by the International Crisis Group (ICG) in which India said the violence was the result of a concerted effort by Myanmar's government to suppress the movement of people from their homes and villages. It also said India was not ready to give up the fight against Rohingya, adding that there was a \"clear and present danger\" to its security. But the government has not said whether it will continue to fight the ongoing violence, or whether India will take action against them. Last week, a court in Delhi ruled that Myanmar had violated the constitution by allowing the use of force against its Rohingya minority. This is the first time the Supreme Court has ruled against India in such a way that an Indian court would have to intervene in a case where a Rohingya man was killed by a police officer. There is also the possibility of an attack on an army base in Cox's Bazar, where hundreds of soldiers were killed in clashes between Buddhists and Rohingya militants in July and August last year. These incidents have led to an increase in violence between Indian and Bangladeshi communities, as well as a rise in attacks on Rohingya communities in Bangladesh and Pakistan. Since then, it has become increasingly difficult for Indian authorities to control the flow of migrants and refugees to reach the border with Myanmar and other Muslim-majority countries. Many of them have fled their villages to Bangladesh, while others have sought refuge in other countries such as India. For the most part, they have not been allowed to return to their home country for fear of being deported. Some of these Rohingya have even been sent back to Myanmar where they are being held responsible for their deaths. Meanwhile, there are reports that some of their relatives are still living under house arrest in their own country, with some even being sent to jail for crimes committed during the war. Despite this, many Rohingya remain hopeful that their plight will be resolved peacefully, despite the fact that many people are fleeing to other parts of Burma. As a result, some Rohingya are facing persecution and persecution, including the death of thousands of civilians. That is a worrying development for India as it faces a long-term humanitarian crisis. And it's not just India that is at the center of this crisis, too, that has to be dealt with in this way. What is India doing? The government is trying to do what it can to address this problem, says the Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Ramesh Gonsalves, in response to allegations of human rights violations by Rohingya insurgents. 'We will not allow this to happen again,' he told DW. I don't think India can do anything about it, though I think it would be a mistake to say that this is an isolated incident, given the current situation. We are not going to allow it to take place, he said, because the Myanmar government's military and police forces have already made it very difficult to provide security for them and their families.

        "target": "NFL stars defy Donald Trump's call for boycott Baltimore Ravens and Jacksonsville Jaguars players \"took a knee\" during the national anthem after Trump urged fans to boycott football matches. The kneeling protest, to highlight social injustice, has stepped up a gear. Hundreds of National Football League (NFL) stars protested President Donald Trump's call for fans to boycott the league by refusing to stand for the US national anthem this weekend, starting Sunday's game between the Baltimore Ravens and Jacksonsville Jaguars. A number of other players locked arms in solidarity ahead of the game at Wembley Stadium in London. Jacksonville Jaguars' owner Shahid Khan, who last year donated one million dollars\u00a0(840,000 euros) to the Trump campaign, locked his arms with players - a rare scene, as owners almost never take to the field. US media reported that about 200 players on Sunday sat, knelt or raised their fists in defiance of Trump's comments. In one of the most memorable moments, singer Rico LaVelle took a knee and held up a fist at the last line of the Star Spangled Banner ahead of the game between the Detriot Lions and Atlanta Falcons. The protest came in response to Trump's tweets on Sunday morning urging fans to boycott NFL games to pressure the league into firing or suspending players to kneel in protest during the national anthem. In an early morning tweet, Trump posted: \"If NFL fans refuse to go to games until players stop disrespecting our Flag and Country, you will see change take place fast. Fire or suspend!\" \"NFL attendance and ratings are WAY DOWN. Boring games yes, but many stay away because they love our country. League should back US,\" he added. Later, the president said that his rant \"has nothing to do with race,\" despite the fact that the origins of the protest are to do with police brutality against minorities, especially African Americans. Trump said his comments were instead about \"respect for our country and respect for our flag.\" Trump's spat with US professional sports began at a Republican rally in Alabama on Friday, when the president attacked activist NFL players for kneeling or sitting during the national anthem, labelling them as \"sons of bitches.\" \"Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, 'Get that son of a bitch off the field right now... he is fired'?\" Trump told a crowd of cheering supporters. That day, basketball star Stephen Curry, the top player for California's Golden State Warriors, announced that he would not be attending a traditional White House reception honoring the National Basketball Association champions. The kneeling protest was started by former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick who refused to stand for the anthem back in 2016. Kaepernick's gesture came amid a spate of deadly police shootings of black men and was aimed at drawing more attention to treatment of minorities in the US. However, Kaepernick has since become a free agent, after failing to be signed by a new team for the new NFL season. NFL executives decry Trump's calls Trump also drew the ire of senior NFL executives and team owners. Responding to Trump's tweets, Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti, said he \"100 percent\" supported his players' decision to kneel during the anthem. Robert Kraft, the owner of the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots, who is also a close friend of Trump, said in a statement on Sunday that he was deeply disappointed by the president's comments in Alabama. Kraft defended players' rights to \"peacefully affect social change and raise awareness in a manner that they feel is most impactful,\" and said that sports were a unifying force in the US. \"Our political leaders could learn a lot from the lessons of teamwork and working together toward a common goal,\" he said. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, who has taken much of the heat for Kaepernick's failure to find a new team, was also quick to condemn Trump's comments.

NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has called on NFL teams to stand for the Star Spangled Banner during Sunday's game against the New York Jets. The NFL's most popular team, the Baltimore Ravens, is one of the league's top-ranked teams, according to a report by the Associated Press. \"The NFL is going to do everything it can to make sure that our players don't disrespect the flag,\" the report said, adding that the NFL would \"do everything in its power to protect our flag and our country's flag.\" The report also said that NFL owners would not be allowed to impose fines on players who protest the anthem, which has sparked protests across the country. Trump has also called for a boycott of NFL games, including the Super Bowl, to be held at Wembley Stadium in London, England, on Sunday. He has said he will not allow the protests to take place at the stadium, but that he would be open to the idea of an NFL team boycotting the game. On Friday, Trump tweeted that \"the NFL should stand up for its flag\" and \"stand for our anthem.\" On Sunday, he also tweeted: \"NFL owners should be ashamed of themselves for disrespecting their flag. I think they should do something about it.\" NFL owner Robert Kraft, who owns the team that won the 2016 NFL championship, said in an interview with the AP that his team was \"very proud\" of its players and the fact that they were playing in a uniform. But he added that it was not the first time NFL players had knelt to honor the National Anthem during a game, and that there was no reason for it to happen again. In a statement, Kraft said \"we are very proud of our team and we will stand with them,\" referring to President Trump and his administration's stance on racial inequality and police brutality. Kraft's team is expected to play the defending champion New England Patriots in their home game Sunday at London's Mercedes-Benz Stadium. (AP, Reuters, dpa) The team's coach, Steve Bisciotti, called the protest \"an act of patriotism and patriotism,\" and said the players would stand in solidarity with those who have been protesting against police violence and racial injustice in recent years. However, it is not clear how many of those players have knotted their knuckles in protest, or if they will continue to knuckle down and protest. It is unclear how much money the president will be able to spend on the issue, however, if he has any intention of doing so at all. Last month, a number of media outlets reported that Trump had criticized the Ravens for kneeling during their anthem before the 2017 NFL season, calling it a \"game of disrespect\" for African Americans and other minorities. That's not true, of course, as NFL commissioner Roger NFL head coach Bill O'Reilly said on Twitter, \"I think it's a disgrace that we have a president who has made such a big mistake in his first month in office.\" In addition, some NFL executives have called it \"a disgrace\" that a player who kneels in front of his home team has been arrested for protesting during his anthem. Some have accused the Trump administration of politicizing the event, while others have said it should not have happened. One NFL executive, former NFL player and NFL general counsel, Stephen Curry, told the Washington Post on Friday that this is \"not the way to go.\" \"It's the right thing to say,\" he said. Other NFL officials have also criticized Trump for his comments, saying he is a racist and a hypocrite. Meanwhile, many NFL fans have expressed their support for Trump. Many have criticized his decision to suspend NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick, accusing him of being a traitor to his country and others of using racial slurs. And some have even suggested he should step down from his job as the head of a team in order to get a job at a football team. Others have questioned the decision, with some calling the move \"unacceptable,\" while some say it could be a step toward a more inclusive approach to football. Still others, though, are more critical of Trump than the White House's position on it. 'We are not in favor of this,\" said NFL President Roger A. Goodell, an outspoken critic of President Barack Obama's policies on race, race and inequality. While the President has criticized President-elect Trump on social media, NFL president-designated \"fake news\" Trump is also calling for an end to NFL protests. His comments have sparked a backlash from the media and some in Washington, D.C. and elsewhere that has led to an increase in violence against black athletes and athletes. This is the latest example of how Trump could have made a mockery out of what he believes is an \"act of pride\" toward his supporters. A Trump spokesman said Trump did not comment on whether he was a supporter of Kaepernick's protests, citing a recent tweet from a business executive in which he retweeted"

The move follows a political protest at the first such match. In a statement released on Friday, the German football association (DFB) announced that the games would be rescheduled for 2018 and that talks would take place between them and their Chinese counterparts in order explore how to move forward. \"To the regret of all parties involved, the project has not received the broad approval that had been expected,\" the DFB said. \"In fact, the project was used by a handful of spectators to send messages that were considered hurtful by the Chinese team, officials, the Chinese Football Association's support staff and Chinese spectators.\" Protests in opening match The first of the arranged matches, against TSV Schott Mainz of the fourth-tier Regionalliga S\u00fcdwest was interrupted midway through the first half when the Chinese players left the field because a small group of activists had unfurled Tibetan flags. The team later returned to the field after the flags had been taken down, before succumbing to a 3-0 defeat. On Monday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry strongly criticized the protest. Initially, it had been thought that the Chinese side would play in the Regionalliga S\u00fcdwest - a regional division of Germany's fourth tier which has only 19 teams but the plan was revised so the matches would just be friendlies. This followed an agreement signed in 2016 between the German FA and the Chinese government to help boost the sport in the Asian country, where the Bundesliga is increasingly popular. Financial boost not enough to soothe concerns Despite the financial boost for the clubs \u2013 TSV Schott Mainz were reportedly paid a fee of \u20ac15,000 ($17.800) for last weekend's game \u2013 the move hasn't proved entirely popular with German fans, many of whom see it as just another example of commercial interests trumping sporting concerns. But the protests, and potential for further disruption, seem to be behind the cancellations - the DFB said both federations were aware of \"substantial evidence of further escalation,\" FSV Frankfurt, who were due to host the Chinese side on Saturday, said earlier this week that they would not ban protests despite an angry response to last week's incident from Beijing. \"We will not back a single centimeter off the basic rights our our democracy, including those relating to freedom of speech,\" FSV Frankfurt President Michael G\u00f6rner said in an interview with the Stuttgarter Nachrichten and Stuttgarter Zeitung newspapers. His words echoed those of DFB vice-president Ronny Zimmerman, who said that the games should be played \"within the framework of freedom of expression.\" The fixtures that have been abandoned include games against Wormatia Worms and Bundesliga club Hoffenheim's reserves. mp/pfd (dpa, SID)",
        "generated_story": "China's Under-20 team in the Regionalliga S\u00fcdwest canceled due to protests China has canceled its team for the 2018-19 Bundesliga season, the DFB said on Friday. The team was scheduled to play at the Stuttgarter Nachrichten on Saturday, but it was canceled because of protests by the Chinese Football Association (FA) over the cancellation of the team's training camp. According to the German news agency dpa, a number of players have been detained by police in connection with the protests. Some of them have also been charged with trespassing and other misdemeanors. \"We are not allowed to take part in this tournament,\" said Michael G\u00f6rner, head coach of TSV Schott Mainz, adding that \"we will not be able to participate in any tournament in which we have a team of this caliber.\" The tournament is being held in China's capital, Shanghai, on the sidelines of a World Cup qualifier between Germany and the United States, and is expected to last until the end of next year, according to a statement from the FA's office in Beijing. On Friday, it said that the tournament would be rescheduled until 2018, when it will be held at a different venue. In the event that it is not possible to attend, organizers said they would send a delegation to Shanghai to discuss the situation. However, they did not specify the exact date, nor did they say whether they were planning to travel to China, which is the host country for this year's tournament. It was not immediately clear, however, whether the delegation would travel from Shanghai or Shenzhen, or whether it would go to Beijing, where it had already been scheduled for Saturday's match against Hoffenheim. There were also reports that a Chinese delegation had been sent to Hong Kong to meet with local officials, as well as representatives of local football associations. A delegation of Chinese football federations was also sent on a trip to Guangzhou, capital of Guangdong province, to inspect the club's facilities. At the same time, there were reports of clashes between the two sides, with police saying they had clashed with a police officer and a bus driver. This was the first time in more than a year that an official delegation from China had visited the country. Facing the possibility of an international boycott, officials from both sides have said it's unlikely that they will attend the match. Meanwhile, local media reported that Chinese officials had called for a boycott of Germany's national football team to be banned from attending the game, saying it could be a \"disruptive event\" that could lead to an \"unacceptable situation\" for Chinese fans. That's not the case at all. After all, this is a tournament that is meant to draw the best players from around the world, not just the top teams in Germany. For the second year in a row, Germany has been the only team that has won the championship. Last year the Bundesliga's top-ranked team, FSV Frankfurt, was beaten by Bayern Munich, 3-0 in their opening match at home to 1-1 in Group A. But this time around, German coach Ronny Zimmerman and his team were unable to make it out of their hotel room. Bundesliga officials said there was no threat to their safety, despite the fact that their players had not been paid for their participation. They also said the players were not being paid in advance. German football's governing body, FA, said in an interview on its website that China was \"not a party to any of these protests.\" \"The Chinese FA has not made any decision on whether or not to cancel this event,\" the statement said, referring to its decision to suspend the competition, citing a lack of information on how to conduct a fair competition. Germany is one of several countries that are involved in international football, including Germany, Austria, Switzerland and China. China is also a member of FIFA's executive committee and has a long history of involvement in domestic football. Football is an important part of German politics, so it has long been a topic of discussion among the international community, particularly the football fraternity, who have long sought to improve the image of its footballing image in recent years. With the exception of Bundesliga clubs, Bundesliga teams have not had a chance to win a game since the 2016-17 season ended in 2016. Since then, many fans have taken to social media to express their displeasure at what they saw as a poor performance by their countrymen. Many have expressed their disappointment with their performance, calling it \"a disgrace\" and \"an act of disrespect to our country's footballers. We are very disappointed that we are being punished for what we do. I think that's a very unfortunate situation, because we should not expect to see this kind of behavior from our players. If we were to do that, we would not have the opportunity to show our support for our team. As a result, I don't think we will have an easy time with this team.\" Bundesliga side, FFC Frankfurt and we"

        "target": "Experts: Taliban have not changed strategy with Kabul restaurant attack The weekend attack on a Kabul restaurant frequented by foreigners came as no surprise to international organizations on the ground. Experts don't believe the Taliban have changed their strategy to target more civilians. Dramatic scenes must have played out in the restaurant: Guests sought cover under tables as a group of terrorists shot wildly into the dining rooms. News agencies report the restaurant owner tried in vain to fend off the attackers. He was among the more than 20 people who perished, most of whom were employees at international organizations. The attackers were also among the dead. During the evening dinner rush, at 7:00 p.m. Friday (17.01.2014), one of three Taliban members detonated his explosives-laden vest and blew a breach in the highly secured restaurant. Neither the man-high blast walls, nor the secured access points with armed guards could stop the attackers. The two remaining terrorists were killed later in a firefight with security forces at the scene. No change in Taliban strategy The suicide bombing on the popular Lebanese restaurant, Taverna Du Liban, in the high-end Kabul neighborhood of Wazir Akbar Khan was the worst attack so far in 2014. Afghanistan votes for a new president in April; and the international troops are scheduled to withdraw from the country by the end of the year. Although there are plans for a small contingent to remain in Afghanistan, President Hamid Karzai first has to sign a bilateral security agreement with the United States. But he continues to play for time. In this context, the Taliban may be targeting civilians more in order to drive out not just the military coalition, but the entire international community. Yet \"as horrible as this incident is, I don't see a change in strategy,\" said Thomas Ruttig, the co-director of the Afghan Analysts Network. Similar attacks have also been launched before, \"at least 12 to 15 times in the past eight years,\" Ruttig said. The worst attack was in 2012 at Qargha Lake, a popular weekend destination near Kabul. More than 20 people were killed, all of them Afghans. Extensive security precautions The Taliban, which normally doesn't miss an opportunity for fiery rhetoric, hasn't declared a change in strategy. A spokesman for the Islamist militant group said the attack was retaliation for a NATO airstrike in Parwan Province, a few kilometers north of Kabul. According to an assistant of the Afghan president, seven children and one woman died in the coalition strike. \"You have to carefully monitor the security situation,\" Nils W\u00f6rmer, head of the Konrad Adenauer Institute in Kabul, told DW. \"But I think it's a bit early to talk about a change in [Taliban] strategy.\" W\u00f6rmer's office lies just a few hundred meters from the site of Friday's attack. He could clearly hear the explosion, which shook the window panes in his office. \"It was immediately clear to me that something had happened,\" W\u00f6rmer recounted. But the Konrad Adenauer Institute was prepared. \"We had a relatively concrete warning in the last week related to our neighborhood, and we were very cautious,\" W\u00f6rmer said. He met with colleagues in his secured office. Like most of the international organizations, the Konrad Adenauer Institute is also integrated into the security networks. \"The security precautions are high,\" W\u00f6rmer said. \"But that doesn't exclude the possibility that something similar could happen again.\" But the Afghan security forces have succeeded in preventing many attacks in the past few months, he said. Kabul residents criticize Taliban An informal, impromptu poll by DW's Kabul correspondent, Hussein Sirat, suggested the Taliban are not winning Afghan hearts and minds with such attacks. \"Wherever the Taliban have killed civilians, they have not achieved their goal,\" said Mirwais, a pedestrian in the Kabul city center. Idris, another Kabul resident, seconded Mirwais' sentiment. \"The Taliban intimidate the people so that the security agreement won't be signed,\" he said. \"But the people won't bend to this intimidation.\" How the international organizations adapt to the tense security situation in Kabul will come after many conversations, analyses, and briefings in the following days. But W\u00f6rmer is not thinking about giving up. \"We have a clear agenda and long-term projects, which I considered to be very sensible,\" W\u00f6rmer said. \"I am of the opinion, as I was before, that what I'm doing here with the Konrad Adenauer Institute is worth the risks.\"",
        "generated_story": "The Taliban haven't changed their strategy with the Kabul restaurant attack The Afghan Taliban have not changed its strategy in the past eight years, despite the fact that they have been able to gain a foothold in Kabul. The Taliban, however, have continued to use the city as a base for their attacks. Last week, the Taliban claimed responsibility for a deadly attack on a restaurant in central Kabul, killing at least eight people and wounding more than 100 others. Taliban spokesman Nils W\u00f6rmer said on Friday that the group was still planning to attack the restaurant, which is located on the outskirts of the capital. \"We are not going to give up on this,\" he told DW, referring to the Afghan government as \"the Taliban.\" The attack came a week after the government of President Hamid Karzai announced that it was withdrawing troops from the country's southern province of Qargha Lake. It was the first such attack since the end of last year, when a suicide bomber blew himself up near the town's main gate. Afghan officials said the attack was an act of revenge for the death of an Afghan journalist who had been killed in a Taliban attack in 2012. According to a statement by the Konrad Adenauer Institute, a group of Afghan analysts and researchers, there were no immediate plans to withdraw troops. However, they said they would continue to monitor the situation closely to make sure that Afghan security forces were ready to respond to any attack. They also said that a number of attacks had taken place over the last few months, and that there was no indication of a change in Taliban strategy. In fact, some of these attacks were carried out in response to attacks on Afghan journalists and journalists, as well as by Afghan intelligence agencies. One of those attacks took place on Thursday evening at a popular restaurant near Kabul's eastern city of Khost, where the militants were trying to establish an Islamic caliphate, according to Reuters news agency. Other attacks have occurred in other parts of Afghanistan, including in neighboring Pakistan, Afghanistan and Pakistan. On Friday, one of them was reported to have killed a journalist and wounded three people in an attack that killed four people. Another attack occurred last week at the same restaurant as the previous one, in which a man was killed by a roadside bomb. This is the second time in as many months that Afghanistan's government has been unable to protect its citizens from Taliban attacks in recent years. At the time, it appeared that Taliban fighters were planning attacks across the entire country, but the attacks did not appear to be aimed at any particular target. Instead, many Afghans were hoping for an end to Taliban rule in their own country. Many Afghans are still hopeful that their country will return to stability after a long period of stability. But they are also worried about the long-term prospects of peace in Afghanistan. For example, several people have died in attacks that have claimed the lives of dozens of civilians. Some of their relatives have also been injured. Others have fled to neighboring countries, while others have returned to their homes. A number have sought refuge in Germany. And in some cases, even in Europe, such as France, Germany and the United States. There are reports that some Afghans have even fled their home countries to seek refuge there. That's not the case for most Afghans, though, because they don't want to go back to Afghanistan for fear of being attacked again. Most Afghans do not know what the future holds for them. What they do know is that this is not an isolated incident. Afghanistan is a country that has experienced a lot of instability and instability in many ways. Since the beginning of this year's Afghan conflict, most of its population has suffered from a lack of security and insecurity. These are the people who have lived in constant fear and fear. You can read more about this in our Afghan Analysts Network blog. Read more: Afghanistan: What's the latest Afghan attack? The Kabul attack is an example of what's going on in foreign policy and politics The attacks are a reminder of how dangerous it is to try to find a solution to this problem. More than a year ago, thousands of people were killed and hundreds of thousands were injured in clashes between Afghan forces and Taliban insurgents. Thousands of Afghans had fled the war-torn country and were forced to flee to other countries in order to escape the violence. Now, more people are returning to Kabul in search of safety and security. I'm not sure what to think about that, I think it's too early to say whether it will happen again, or whether they'll return. We're hoping to see more attacks like the one that happened in April. If the security situation is any indication, we'll have to wait a while before we can make a decision on whether or not we will have a chance to do something about it. (Reuters, AFP, dpa) \"It's a very difficult situation,\" said journalist Thomas Ruttig, editor of DW's Afghanistan blog, Idris, who was among the victims of Friday's attack, adding that \"it's impossible to predict what will be able"

        "target": "Inching towards direct talks on Syria They came to hold talks, but started negotiations with mutual affronts. But if there is one person who might be able to mediate between the intransigent Syrian conflict parties, it's Lakhdar Brahimi. Lakhdar Brahimi, the United Nations special envoy for Syria, seemed very tired on Friday (24.01.2014). He had had a long day, which was actually supposed to be the first real day of negotiations at the Syria Conference in Geneva. \"Good afternoon,\" Brahimi told the assembled international press, before adding, \"or good evening, I don't know.\" At the Palais des Nations in Geneva, he presented the most important result of his attempts to mediate between the Syrian government and the opposition to the more than 250 journalists who had managed to get a coveted place at the press conference: \"Tomorrow we expect and we have agreed that we will meet in the same room.\" What Brahimi is declaring an achievement doesn't sound like much, but considering how irreconcilable the conflict parties have been, even that can be seen as a small success. Separate talks with Brahimi The two delegations were actually due to meet on the first day of negotiations in Geneva in order to agree on a timetable and on the subject and agenda of the talks. But emotions are running too high on both sides. Instead both delegations held separate talks with Lahkkdar Brahimi, both lasting just about an hour each In the morning. The Syrian government delegation had apparently been threatening to leave the conference. At least that is what the deputy foreign minister Faisal Mekdad had implied. \"We are here to start the negotiations,\" he told waiting journalists, \"but we found that the other party did not want to come.\" Before the conference, the opposition had explained that for its delegation, the formation of a transition government would be a central tenet of the negotiations. They emphasized that this topic should be discussed right at the beginning of talks and that the establishment of such a body should be initiated without delay. Social media and good old propaganda The representatives of the Syrian National Coalition that were present in Geneva neatly used all imaginable channels to make their views public. At #Geneva2, they tweeted: \"Forming a transitional body is our major priority,\" leaving people in no doubt that the Syrian National Council would not want to include Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Assad's government, on the other hand, is relying on classic propaganda and loyal state media representatives in Geneva. An impressive entourage of dominant journalists from state-run media outlets is constantly at hand, accompanying the government delegation and making sure they get their point across at press conferences. Lakhdar Brahimi even had a small altercation with a journalist from a Syrian state news agency, who made a political statement under the pretense of asking the UN mediator a question. \"Are there any signs that Saudi Arabia, Turkey and other countries would stop the support of terrorism in Syria?,\" she asked in somewhat shaky English, before Brahimi interrupted her. \"Please, please, there is no point in asking such questions!\" Such exchanges hint at the type of negotiating style the experienced diplomat and mediator Brahimi must have behind the scenes. 'Wish us luck' Lakhdar Brahimi described the preliminary talks that took place in Geneva as encouraging and asked for patience. He said that because the peace conference had come about at the last minute and the delegations had therefore only been appointed very recently, there hadn't been enough time to hold preliminary discussions - a task that the delegations were now catching up on. \"We never expected it to be easy and I'm sure it's not going to be,\" he said. \"But I think the two parties understand what is at stake. Their country is in very, very bad shape.\" He added: \"The huge ambition of this process is to save Syria. Nothing less than that.\" After appealing to the willingness of both parties to negotiate, he simply added: \"So wish us luck!\" Fight for freedom As the official delegations held talks with UN mediator Brahimi in the Palais des Nations, the European headquarters of the United Nations, hundreds of Syrian expatriates who had come from all over Europe protested outside, forming a sea of red, white and black Syrian flags on the Place des Nations. With their presence outside the UN gates they wanted to show that despite all the government propaganda, the Syrian National coalition has a lot of support from the Syrian people. Thirty-two-year-old Ziad Malki came to Geneva from Zurich to show his solidarity. Ziad knows how it feels to be deprived of his freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. In 2005, he was arrested at a demonstration in Damascus and says he was tortured during his time in prison. Now he is fighting for a new Syria from outside the country's borders. Ziad is sure that with Bashar al-Assad and his family, there will be nothing new. \"We don't want this man to be in",

He has been mediating at the Palais des Nations since 2005, when he was the head of the country's National Council. In his first day in office, he had medicated with Assad and his allies in the Syria Conference, which began on Friday (24.01.2014). He had been in Syria for more than a year and a half to mediate between the two sides. On Friday, the United Nations said it would send a delegation to the conference, but that it had not yet received a response from the government. \"We have not received any response yet, and we are not going to receive any further information at this time,\" Brahim told the UN's General Assembly, adding that he would not be able to provide any more details. The Syrian government, however, had already announced that the delegation would be heading to Geneva on Saturday, a day after it was expected to meet with its Syrian counterpart, Hafez al Assad, for talks on the future of Syria. It is not clear whether the meeting will take place at all, or whether it will be held at a different venue. There is no word yet on what the next step for Syria is, though the situation is likely to be a bit more complicated than that. At the same time, there is a sense of urgency to reach an agreement on Syria's future, as well as the prospects for a peaceful transition of power between Assad's government and the opposition. This is especially true in light of what has happened in recent years in other countries, such as Russia, Iran, Turkey, China, India, Japan, South Korea, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Russia and even the US have all been invited to attend the Geneva conference. According to UN spokesman Faisal Mekdad, \"we are very hopeful that we will have a chance to make a breakthrough in resolving the conflict.\" He added that there was \"a lot of good news\" to come out of this meeting, including the fact that \"the Syrian regime is in a very good position in terms of its ability to negotiate a ceasefire.\" \"It's a good day for all of us,\" he said, referring to a meeting between Syrian and Russian presidents in Moscow and Ankara in which the president, who is also a member of Russia's parliament, was also present. Speaking to reporters in his hotel room, Bakhimi said: \"I am very happy that I am here. I have been here for many years and I will continue to work with my colleagues. We have worked with them and they have done a lot for me. They have given me the opportunity to give me a great deal of information and to help me understand what is going on in my own country.\" The meeting was attended by a number of diplomats from around the world. One of them, Ziad Malki, is an expert on Syrian politics and international relations. She said that she had met with a Syrian opposition leader in Damascus and was impressed with his leadership skills. But she said she was not impressed by the way he spoke to him, saying he did not have the experience to tell him what he needed to do. Brahmi said he didn't know what to expect from him and he wasn't sure if he should be allowed to speak with him. However, it is clear that his words were not the only thing he wanted to convey to his Syrian counterparts. His words, in fact, were that they were the most important part of his message to them. That is why he told them to stay calm and not to talk to me, because he knows I don't want to get involved in any way. And that is exactly what I think I need to hear. What I'm saying is that this is the beginning of a long, long-term plan for our country. Let me tell you something. If you have any doubt about this, let me give you a little bit of my thoughts on this. You have to ask yourself: What do you think? Do you really think you can do? Is it really that important to you? What are you doing in this situation? How can you do something like this? Can you tell me what you're doing? I can't think of anything that would make you feel better? Let's just say that you are doing something that's really important for you and your country? That's not what we're talking about, right? You know, I've been working with you all my life and you know you've done everything you could do in your life. So let's be honest with each other and let us talk about it. How do we do it? And what are we doing here? We're not doing anything to try and get you to agree with me? It's an important thing to know that Assad is doing the right thing. Is there something you want me to say? If he's"

He was 45. The Catalan club announced the death of its former bench boss in a statement posted on its website on Friday. \"FC Barcelona is in immense mourning. Tito Vilanova has died at the age of 45. May he rest in peace,\" the statement said. Vilanova had first been diagnosed with a tumor in a saliva gland in November 2011, while he was an assistant to then-Barcelona head coach Pep Guardiola. He had been battling against recurring cancer ever since and had been admitted to a Barcelona hospital last week. He led Barca to the Primera Liga title last season, his only campaign as head coach, when the Catalans earned a record-tying 100 points. Last July he stepped down due to his ongoing health problems.

He was battling a form of cancer in a hospital in Barcelona, where he had been battling the disease since November 2011. The 45-year-old, who played in the Primera Liga for Barcelona last season, died on Friday after battling cancer for 45 years. According to the Catalan newspaper dpa, he was 45 when he died. \"He was suffering from cancer, but he did not have a terminal illness,\" the newspaper said, adding that the cause of his death was not yet known and that he would not be able to return to his playing career until the end of the season. Barcelona's coach Pep Guardiola, meanwhile, has announced he will step down from his position as the club's head coach after a season in which he managed to win the league and the Spanish league. In a statement, the Barcelona coach said he planned to continue his efforts to improve the team's chances of reaching the Champions League final, which is expected to be held next year. But he also said that his team-mates were not ready to give up on him, saying that they were \"not ready for this kind of challenge.\" The Catalan football federation said on its Facebook page that it was \"deeply saddened\" to hear of Vilavan's death. It was the first time in his career that a player had died from a cancer that had metastasized into his body. His body was found in intensive care at a nearby hospital, according to an AFP news agency, and his wife, Toni, was also found to have cancer. She died of a heart attack at age 45, just a few days after being diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer (stage 4 lung cancer). He had battled the illness for more than a year and a half, with his health failing to recover in time for the 2014-15 season and then again in 2015-16, when his condition worsened. Vilavans was due to undergo surgery on his left lung in mid-November 2011, after suffering a severe bout of breast cancer which left him unable to stand for long periods of time. For the past two seasons he has battled cancer and has been fighting for his life. Last season he underwent chemotherapy to remove the cancerous growth spur and to prevent it from spreading to other organs, including his liver, liver and pancreas. This year he is due for a second chemotherapy treatment in two weeks and will be out of action for at least a month. At the same time, his family is expecting him to receive a kidney transplant in December. However, it is not clear how long the treatment will last, as he still has a long way to go before he can receive the full treatment he needs. There is no word yet on whether the operation will take place, however, because the prognosis for him is unclear. If he does not receive treatment by then, there is a chance he could be released from the hospital within a couple of weeks, or he may be transferred to a different club. That is, if he doesn't have to leave Barcelona for another year or two. And that would be a very long time until he gets the chance to play again, even if it's just for one season or another. Since then he's had to wait until his last match in 2014 to get the best possible chance of returning to Barcelona. 'I'm not sure what I can do anymore,' he told AFP. I'm sure he won't be back until next season but I don't know what the future holds in terms of whether he'll be available for that. After all, this is the only chance I have at this stage of my life that I've ever had, so I think I'll have until I get to see him again. What I hope for is that this will not happen to him. We'll see how he recovers from this illness, though. As I said before, I'd like to tell you, that's not something that is going to happen in my lifetime. So, let's hope that we can get him back to playing football again before we get there. Let's see what happens next, shall we? If we do that, we'll find out for sure. Meanwhile, Barcelona have already made a lot of progress in this season's second division. They have been struggling to find a solution to their current situation. With the loss of one of their top three players, they have had a difficult time finding a new coach to fill the void in their squad, especially with the addition of two new players. Guardiola is hoping to make the right decision, says Guardiola. Speaking to AFP, Guardiola told reporters Friday: \"I hope he knows what he wants to do with this team. You know who I want to bring back, right now. When I do decide to come back and give him a fresh start, you'll know the results and see if we're not too late.\" Barcelona will have an answer to this summer."

This put him well ahead of former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, who was reported to have come in second, at 12.9 percent.

The results are expected to be announced on Sunday (June 15) in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kherson. According to the exit poll, the Ukrainian president will win the presidency on June 15, with a majority of voters casting their ballots in favor of him. However, it is not clear how many voters will be able to cast their ballot, and the results will not be known until the end of June, when the election is due to take place. In the meantime, there is still a long way to go before the vote is held. \"We are going to have to wait and see what happens,\" said Andrij Shevchenko, head of exit polling firm Dpa, which conducted a survey of 1,000 voters in eastern Ukraine. It was not immediately clear whether the result would be confirmed, but it was widely expected that the winner would have been Yulia Tymoshenko, who had won a landslide victory in May's parliamentary election. But the outcome of Sunday's vote could change the course of Ukrainian politics for the time being. Opinion polls show a strong showing for Porozhoz, a pro-European politician who has been in power for more than a decade. He is also the most popular candidate in a recent election in Ukraine, although he has yet to win a single seat in parliament. Many of his supporters, however, are not convinced that he is the right man to run for president. On Sunday, he was the only candidate who did not win an outright majority in opinion polls, while the other two candidates were not. Both candidates have said they will seek a second term in office, as well as a third term as prime minister. They have also said that they plan to hold a referendum later this year on the constitution of Ukraine that would allow them to vote for a new constitution. That would give them the power to decide whether they want to continue with the current system of government or to form an independent state. A number of European countries, including Germany, France, Italy, Spain and Spain, have rejected the idea that Ukraine should be allowed to expand its democracy. Some of these countries have called for an early referendum on whether to allow Ukraine to become a member of a European Union. Others, such as the United States, Russia, China, Japan and South Korea, say they would like to see Ukraine become part of an EU-wide democracy, rather than one dominated by a handful of countries. One of them is Germany. Another is Poland, where the president, Viktor Yanukovych, has said he wants to make Ukraine a \"nation of equals.\" \"I don't think it's a democracy,\" he told DW's Kitty Logan in an interview published Sunday. She said the referendum was \"not a democratic one,\" adding that it would not allow the West to meddle in Ukrainian affairs, \"but it will allow us to do what we want.\" She added: \"It's not a question of whether we have a right to say what is best for our people. I think we need to think about the future of our country and our future. We have no doubt that this is a very important step forward for Ukraine and that we will continue to move forward in this direction.\" The poll results were released Sunday and were published by the German news agency dpa.

The EU is preparing to step up its efforts to strengthen its role as guarantor of EU membership, says the European Commission. EU member states are also preparing for elections next year. Ukraine is hoping to host a summit in Brussels in July to discuss the EU's role in resolving the Ukraine crisis. There are a lot of uncertainties surrounding the situation in Europe and other countries that are facing a difficult situation. Europe is looking at this as an example of how Europe can be a good place to develop its own democracy and how to deal with this situation,\" she said. European leaders have expressed concern over the lack of cooperation between the two countries and their respective governments, she added, saying that EU countries should do their part to protect the interests of Ukrainians, especially in terms of their own internal security and security. What are the reasons for this? EU leaders are hoping that Europe will take a closer look at how Ukraine will respond to Russia's annexation of Crimea and its annexation by Russia - and whether Russia will do its part in that process - but what will that mean for Russia? Ukraine could be the next step in its bid for independence from Ukraine? Russia has already said it won't be an easy task to get Ukraine out of Kiev. Russia is likely to push Ukraine into a position of influence in Russia. Moscow has promised to cooperate with Ukraine in order to ensure that Russia does not become an ally of Russia and China.

        "target": "Automation in the dairy cow industry A small but nevertheless important sector of the German economy today is agriculture. Although the number of farms has declined over the decades, production has actually increased -- especially at dairy farms. Modern automation technology and robotics are helping to keep both cows and farmers happy, but at the cost of jobs.",
        "generated_story": "Automation in the Dairy Cow Industry Automation is the key to the future of the dairy cow industry, according to a new report. The report, which is expected to be published by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Wednesday, said that the industry has become increasingly reliant on automated processes to produce milk and eggs. \"The industry is in a state of disrepair,\" the report said, adding that there is no need to reinvent the wheel to make milk, eggs, dairy products, or other products that are already in production. However, there are a number of factors that could change the way we milk cows. One of them is that it is becoming increasingly difficult for farmers to get their milk from cows to cows, and that is why they are increasingly turning to automated machinery to feed their cows and other animals. In the past, this has led to an increase in milk production, but in recent years, it's become more and more difficult to achieve the same level of efficiency. For example, cows are no longer producing milk at all. Instead, they produce eggs at a much higher rate than they used to. This is because the cows have become so large that they cannot be fed milk. That is, until they can be grown at their own pace, rather than at the expense of their human counterparts. As a result, the cow's milk is now being produced at an even higher cost than it once was. And that's not just because cows don't have enough milk to eat. It's because of this, too, that cows do not have the capacity to grow milk as fast as they would like. But that doesn't mean cows can't be milked, either. There is also the issue of whether cows should be able to milk milk or whether they should not be allowed to do so. So, we have to look at how we can improve the quality of milk we produce and how that can help us grow our cow. We must also look into the impact of automation on the milk supply chain. How can we improve milk quality? How do we ensure that our cows get milk? The answer is simple: with the right machinery. If you have an automated cow, you can make it. You can also use a machine that has been around for a long time. What do you think? What are your thoughts on this? Do you agree with me? I think I have a lot to say about this. Let's talk about it in detail. I'm a farmer and I grew up in Germany, so I was raised by my father's family. My father was a dairy farmer. He died when he was very young and my mother raised me. Now, I am a milkman and he raised my son and we raised him on a farm. Today, he is an agronomist. His job is to provide milk for cows so he can milk them and feed them to their owners. When he dies, milk will be produced in his own milk cartons. A cow is a cow that he has grown up with and bred for many generations. With the help of his father, his milk was made by his mother, who was the first to have milk made in America. They are the ones who made milk in this country. Their milk has always been a staple of our diet. Milk is one of my favorite foods and the only thing that I've ever had in my life. Food is my main source of protein for my family and for the rest of us. Our milk comes from milk! I can tell you that milk makes you rich and healthy and it makes me feel good when you eat milk.\" The milk company has a large dairy farm in Wisconsin. Dairy farmers have been making milk since the 1950s. Since that time, farmers in that state have had to import milk products from the United States and Canada. These cows were milk-fed cows for generations and they have grown very well. Many cows in our dairy industry are now grown and raised here. Why is milk grown here? Why do cows grow so well? Because milk grows so fast? That's the main reason why we are so rich, because milk can grow very fast and so many cows die so quickly. All cows need milk - and then milk becomes a big part of what we eat - but milk isn't enough to keep cows fed - so we need a good milk source. To feed cows is very important to us - milk equals milk,\" said the company's chief executive officer, John Alder, in an interview with The New York Times. According to him, \"We are very happy to see milk produced by cows.\" He added: \"It's a very good example of how milk gets grown - a product of cows - which we've grown so much milk that we grew very, very rich - with a healthy milk base - that makes milk available to our farmers and ranchers. After all, our milk supplies are still very expensive - we want to know why milk companies are growing very quickly - they're growing so rapidly - because we're"

The ruling primarily affects Germany's Turkish minority. The European Union's highest court on Thursday ruled in favor of a Turkish citizen, who was denied a visa to live in Germany with her husband, because she was illiterate and therefore unable to demonstrate basic German-language skills. According to the court, a lack of language skills shouldn't automatically lead to the rejection of an entry visa application. Instead, Germany must consider the unique circumstances of each individual case. The court went on to say that quickly granting visas for spouses improves the quality of life and promotes the integration of foreign residents. Specifically addressing the case of the Turkish plaintiff, the court ruled that the rejection of her visa had violated a bilateral treaty between Turkey and the EU. In 1970, Brussels and Ankara agreed not to tighten their residency laws for each other's citizens. Law only applies to some In 2007, Germany introduced the requirement that spouses from certain non-EU countries must demonstrate a basic grasp of German before being granted a visa to live in Germany with their husbands or wives. Spouses affected by the law are required to obtain a basic language certificate from recognized centers, such as Germany's Goethe Institute, proving that they have an A1 level, or \"Beginning German\" language ability. The German government claims that the goal of the language requirement is to prevent forced marriages as well as marriages made simply for the sake of obtaining a visa. Citizens of European Free Trade Association (EFTA) member states are exempt from the language requirement. That includes Iceland, Lichtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. In addition, citizens of Australia, Canada, Israel, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea and the United States also don't have to demonstrate German-language skills. slk/xx (AFP, AP, dpa, KNA)",
        "generated_story": "European Court of Justice overturns German law requiring language skills for spouses German courts have overturned a law that required spouses to learn German to speak German. The court ruled Thursday that the law violated the European Free Trade Association's (EFTA) rules on the use of German-language skills. It also ruled that German spouses should not be required to use German as a second language when they travel to other European Union member states. According to the court's ruling, the EU's rules were not applied to spouses of EU citizens living in Germany. \"The law was passed in 1970, but it has not been implemented in the past,\" said Justice Josef KNA, head of the German court of justice in Strasbourg, which ruled in favor of Germany's divorce law in 2007. In a ruling that was published on Thursday, a court in Brussels said that Germany should be allowed to impose its own laws on its spouses. But the ruling did not change the fact that it was the first time that a German marriage law had been struck down by a European court. Germany, however, is the only EU member state that does not have an EU-wide language law, according to a report by the news agency Deutsche Zeitung (KNA) in which the case was made, said the decision was based on a \"misinterpretation of an existing law.\" The case is one of several that have been brought before the courts in recent years, with the most recent ruling in a case brought by Germany against the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel, who was then in office at the time of her divorce from her husband. That case has been referred to as the Goethe Institute for the study of languages, and has led to an increase in divorce rates for married couples. However, it is not clear whether the new law will be applied in other EU countries, such as France, Italy, Spain, Germany and the United Kingdom, or whether it will go ahead with a similar law. This is a first for Germany since the 1990s, when the country's legal system was set up to protect the rights of women and children. There is no clear legal basis for such a change, though it could be interpreted as an attempt to make Germany a more open and free-trade country, as well as to give women the right to choose the language they want to study in order to be able to have a better relationship with their partner. For example, if a married couple were to marry, they would have to take German language courses, rather than the equivalent of studying French, German, Spanish, Italian, French or French. If they were married, that would be the same thing as if they had a child. And that's not a good thing, because it would mean that they wouldn't have the opportunity to get married in their own country. As a matter of fact, this is something that has never been done before in any other country in Europe, where the rule of law has always been in place. So, in this case, there's no reason to think that this law is going to change. At the very least it's a step in that direction. After all, what's the point of a divorce? The EU has a lot to do with it, of course. What do you think? That's one thing I think is clear: It's an important point to me. I don't think there is much to say about this. You can't just say that I'm a lawyer and I have no idea what you're talking about. Let's talk about that, right? But I do know that there are a number of things that you can say. One of those things is that if you are married to someone who has no children, you will have children and that is what I would say you should say to your spouse, \"You are not married.\" That is exactly what we're doing here. We're not ruling on this issue, we are just trying to find a way out of this situation. Just ask the question of who is responsible for this decision. Do you agree with me? Or is it something I can do? If you have any doubt that we should do something about it? Let me tell you why we need to talk to you? You know the answer to that question: You are asking me to ask you to come up with an answer for you. Why not? What is your answer? I'd like to know. How do I know? And what are you doing? How can you do that? Is there a solution to this problem? Why is there no solution? There's something you've already done? Because I've done this before? Well, let's try to figure out the best way to solve the problem and then I'll be happy to help you know what the solution is. A divorce isn't an easy thing for us to agree on. No matter what happens to them. Or, I hope you won't be doing that. Either way, my answer is simple: We are working on it. Here's my opinion is to"

The opposition Law and Justice party failed in its bid to oust Prime Minister Donald Tusk on Friday through a vote confidence, the second such vote since the publication of private conversations between high-ranking officials, referred to by some in Poland as \"Waitergate.\" Tusk withstood the opposition challenge by a wide margin of 236-155. The prime minister's Civic Platform party governs Poland in a center-right coalition with the Polish People's party. Last month, recordings of a private conversation between Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski and then-Finance Minister Jacek Rostowski were published by the weekly magazine Wprost. During the conversation, Sikorski said the US-Polish alliance was \"worthless\" and British Prime Minister David Cameron's concessions to euroskeptics had shown his \"incompetence in EU affairs.\" Prior to the leak of the Sikorski recording, Wprost also published a tape in which central bank chief Marek Belka told Interior Minister Bartlomiej Sienkiewicz that he would only support the government's economic policy if Finance Minister Rostowski left his post. The secret recordings were reportedly made over several months, including at high end restaurants in Warsaw. Wprost says it received the tapes from a businessman. Immediately after the conversations were published, Tusk called his own vote of no confidence. His government survived that vote 237-203. slk/rc (AP, AFP, dpa)",

The EU's executive arm, the Civic Platform, said on Friday that it was \"deeply troubled\" by the allegations. \"We are deeply troubled by what we have seen in the past. We are in a very difficult situation, and we are not going to allow this to happen again,\" he said in an interview with Wprost, Poland's state news agency. He added that he was not aware of any such tape, but that \"it is not something that we want to repeat.\" Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawie\u0144ska said he had not seen the tape and had no idea what it contained. In a statement, he added: \"I do not think it is appropriate for me to say that I am resigning because of what I have done. I will not be making any further comments on the matter at this time.\" The Polish government has said it will continue to investigate the leak, which it said was made public by a member of parliament, Marek Belka, who was present at the meeting. It is unclear whether the document was leaked to the media or if it had been doctored to make it look like a recording of a conversation between the two men. But it appears that the documents were not. According to Polish media reports, some of them were obtained through the use of an electronic recorder. Other reports said the recording was recorded by an unknown person. Some Polish politicians, however, have said they did not know who the person was. They have also said that they had never heard of it before. A number of Polish lawmakers have called for the resignation of outgoing European Commission President J\u00f3zef Kaczmierz (pictured above) and his deputy, Jody Sienkiewicz (left), who were also present. (AP, AFP, dpa, AP, Reuters) \"It is clear that there is a lot of blame for this. There is no doubt that this was a deliberate attempt to undermine the president's authority,\" said Mian Law and Justice Minister Aleksandar Bartlomiej (AFP, Dpa) who has been in office since the beginning of May and who is now the country's prime minister. Law-and-Justice Minister Jochen Rabin (Reuters) has also been named as a possible replacement for Sikorki, saying he will step down as the new president of Poland. His resignation comes after a series of scandals over the last few weeks. Tensions between Poland and the EU have been building in recent weeks, with Poland becoming the latest EU country to be engulfed in political turmoil. At the same time, it has become increasingly difficult for Poland to find a way out of its current political crisis. Poland is facing a crisis of confidence in its own government, as well as in many other European countries, including the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Russia and even the US. On Friday, Polish President Vladimir Putin announced his intention to resign from his post as EU chief of staff, despite the fact that his country has not yet been able to reach an agreement on a deal on how to resolve the crisis in Ukraine. Russia has repeatedly accused Poland of being a \"hostile country\" and of trying to meddle with Ukraine's internal affairs, a move that has led to tensions between Moscow and Washington. Moscow has denied the accusations, accusing the government of meddling in Ukrainian affairs and Ukraine of attempting to influence the outcome of elections. Ukraine is one of several countries in which Russia's president, Boris Yeltsin, has expressed concern about the Ukraine crisis, while Poland has rejected the idea that Ukraine could become the next EU member state to join the bloc. However, there are also concerns that Russia could be the first to step up its involvement in this conflict, according to a report published in The New York Times. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev is also expected to take a position in talks with Russia on Saturday, when he is due to attend a summit of EU leaders in Brussels on Monday. Putin has called on Russia to intervene in Poland in order to prevent the collapse of relations between Ukraine and Russia. And he has promised to give Ukraine a chance to negotiate a ceasefire with Moscow. That would be an important step toward a peaceful solution to its long-running dispute with Kiev. If the situation is to get Ukraine to agree to an EU-wide ceasefire, then Russia is likely to try to impose sanctions on Moscow's annexation of Crimea and other EU countries. This is the most likely outcome, though the Kremlin has so far refused to do so. Washington is unlikely to act in any way. Polish Foreign Minister Merel Kimbulski told the BBC that Moscow could not intervene, adding that Poland could also be given the possibility"

Israel's army said several militants were killed after tunneling into Israel. Secretary of State John Kerry is due to arrive in Cairo on Monday where he is expected to urge Hamas to accept a cease-fire agreement offered by Egypt that would halt nearly two weeks of fighting with Israel. Meanwhile, the death toll in Gaza continues to rise. Medics on Monday said the number of Palestinian deaths in Gaza has risen to more than 501 since fighting intensified on Jul 8. Most of the dead are civilians. On the Israeli side, 13 soldiers were killed inside Gaza on Sunday, raising the number of soldiers killed since a ground operation began late on Thursday to 18. Two Israeli civilians also died in mortar and rocket attacks. The Israeli army said that more than 10 militants from Gaza were shot dead on Monday after infiltrating southern Israel. According to army spokespeople, two squads of militants were killed after tunneling into Israel. Israel's UN ambassador Ron Prosor, meanwhile, denied a claim by Hamas that an Israeli soldier had been kidnapped by the Islamist group, saying: \"Those rumurs are untrue.\" US President Barack Obama expressed concern about the rising death toll of civilians in a telephone call Sunday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, according to a White House statement. The US State Department confirmed late Sunday that two US citizens were killed in Gaza violence and released their names, but did not immediately disclose their occupations. US media reported, however, that the two were American members of the Israeli Defense Force, citing relatives and friends. \"We can confirm the deaths of US citizens Max Steinberg and Sean Carmeli in Gaza,\" spokesperson Jen Psaki said in a two-sentence statement. Late Sunday, the United Nations Security Council in New York held urgent talks on the conflict, and expressed \"serious concern about the growing numbers of casualties.\" \"The members of the Security Council call for an immediate cessation of hostilities,\" said Rwandan ambassador Eugene Richard Gasana, whose country currently chairs the 15-member council. hc/dr (Reuters, AFP, AP, dpa)",

The two sides have been locked in a bitter dispute for nearly two weeks over the fate of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, which began on Jul 8. Kerry is expected to make his first visit to Cairo since taking office on Jan. 1. He will meet Israeli Defense Minister Ron Prosor and Egyptian Foreign Minister Avigdor Liberman in the Egyptian capital of Cairo, according to the US State Department. \"We are going to try to reach an agreement with the Palestinian Authority,\" Kerry said on Sunday, adding that he was \"very optimistic\" about the prospects of a peace deal between the two countries. On Monday, Kerry will travel to Egypt, where he will hold talks with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and his wife, Jen Psaki, to discuss a possible ceasefire. Israel has said it will seek to broker a truce between Hamas and the militant group in exchange for an end to a two-year-old conflict. Washington has repeatedly rejected the idea of an Israeli ceasefire, saying it would not be possible to achieve a deal with Hamas. But Kerry, who is visiting Egypt for the first time since leaving office in January, said he would be meeting with Netanyahu and other senior Israeli officials on the sidelines of Monday's meeting. Netanyahu has promised to hold a summit with US President Barack Obama on July 8, a day before the United Nations Security Council is scheduled to convene in New York to consider a new round of peace talks. Obama has also said that it is unlikely that any deal will be reached until at least the end of July, when the Palestinians will have a chance to negotiate their way out of their long-running conflict with Israel. US Secretary-of-State Mike Pompeo will visit Cairo on Tuesday and Wednesday in an attempt to ease tensions between Israeli and Palestinian forces in Gaza. In the past, US and Israeli leaders have repeatedly called on each other to end the conflict, but in recent weeks, they have failed to do so. Last week, the Obama administration announced it was pulling out all the stops to avoid a military confrontation with Gaza's Hamas-ruled Hamas rulers. It also announced the withdrawal of US troops from the Gaza Strip and a halt to Israeli military operations there. According to US Foreign Secretary Sean Carmeli, Israeli troops have also been deployed to Gaza since the beginning of last year, and they will continue to be deployed there until the ceasefire is reached, he said. However, there is still a long way to go in order for negotiations to take place. A US official told Reuters that \"the US is not ready to give up its position on this issue at this time.\" The official said Kerry would also meet the head of state of Israel, Reuven Rivlin, at the UN General Assembly in Washington, D.C. on Wednesday and Thursday, as well as the heads of Israeli, Palestinian, Jordanian and Jordanian delegations in Egypt and Jordan. Both countries have said they want a \"no-confidence\" vote on whether to resume the negotiations. Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Max Steinberg told reporters that Israel was prepared to withdraw its forces from Gaza and that the talks would continue until a resolution was reached by the international community. Iran, Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran have all denied any involvement in any ceasefire talks, accusing Israel of violating international law and violating its sovereignty. Hamas has denied this, however, insisting it has no intention of doing anything to prevent it from doing so and has refused to recognize the deal. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, meanwhile, has vowed to press ahead with negotiations with Washington to seek a negotiated settlement. Tehran has rejected any such deal, calling it an \"act of war.\" Iran has accused Washington of trying to influence the outcome of any negotiations, including a nuclear deal that could lead to an arms embargo, in return for Israel agreeing to allow a cease-fire between Iran and its ally Hamas to return to power. Palestinians have denied the accusations, though Iran denies the allegations. They also accuse the White House of attempting to undermine the agreement. Meanwhile, Iran's foreign minister, Iranian spokesman, Maxine Richard Gasana, told a news conference on Saturday that Iran was not willing to talk to Israel about its nuclear weapons program, despite the fact that they had already agreed on a plan to freeze the nuclear talks in Tehran. Palestinian spokesman Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said Iran had not yet agreed to sign a formal ceasefire agreement, while US officials have not said whether it could be agreed. Jordan's ambassador to Washington said Tehran was ready for talks and said Israel had no plans to impose a freeze on its weapons sales to Iran. Officials in Israel are also preparing a similar move, with Iran saying they are \"open to dialogue. There is no indication that this is a possibility,\" but Tehran's position is likely to remain a sticking point for now.

Its warning follows a WHO admission that the epidemic requires \"extraordinary measures.\" The head of Medicins Sans Frontieres (MSF), Joanne Liu -- fresh from a visit to western Africa -- said in Geneva on Friday that more experts were needed in the hard-hit region. \"It is deteriorating faster, and moving faster, than we can respond to,\" Liu told reporters. \"Like in a war time, we have a total collapse of infrastructure,\" she added. Lui said the world community needed to get the \"upper hand\" over the next six months. While the viral spread had been slowed in Guinea, concerns focused especially on Liberia. \"If we don't stabilize Liberia, we will never stabilize the region,\" Lui said. She was critical of the WHO for delaying its public health emergency warning until August 8. \"We need people with a hands-on operational mindset,\" to combat the outbreak, Liu told the Geneva news briefing. WHO - 'vastly underestimated' On Thursday, the World Health Organization (WHO) said the scale of the epidemic had been \"vastly underestimated\" and that \"extraordinary measures\" were needed to contain the contagious virus. The UN health agency said the death toll had climbed to 1,069 in four afflicted countries, spanning Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia and more recently Nigeria. Sierra Leone's chief medical officer Brima Kargbo disclosed on Thursday that at least 32 of the nation's nurses and doctors had died from the Ebola virus while performing their duties between May 24 and August 13. Local staff suffered stigma, despite saving lives, Kargbo said. \"We still have to break the chain of transmission to separate the infected from the uninfected.\" Youth Olympics also affected The mounting alarm coincided with an announcement Friday from the International Olympics Committee that three athletes from Ebola-hit countries had been barred from competing in pool events and combat sports at the Youth Olympics opening in China on Saturday. ipj/tj (AfP, Reuters)",
        "generated_story": "World Health Organization warns Ebola crisis is'moving faster than it should be' The World Health Organisation (WHO) warned on Thursday that the Ebola epidemic was'moving faster and faster' than the WHO had warned. The WHO said the outbreak was spreading rapidly and that it was likely to worsen by the end of the year. \"We are moving faster, but we are not going to be able to stop it,\" WHO spokesman Brima Kargbo said in a statement. He added that MSF's response to the epidemic would be to take action to prevent it from spreading to other parts of Africa and the Middle East, where the disease is spreading more rapidly than previously thought, and to make it more difficult for people to get sick. In the meantime, the international health agency said it would continue to monitor the situation closely. It also warned that if it did not act quickly enough, it could have a long-term impact on the health of people in the affected countries, particularly those in Africa, who have been suffering from severe health problems for years. On Thursday, a WHO official told Reuters that \"the outbreak of Ebola in West Africa is moving fast and rapidly,\" adding that there was a \"very high level of concern about the spread of this disease.\" \"This is a very worrying development,\" said Joanne Liu, an epidemiologist at the World Medical Organization (WMO) in Geneva, Switzerland, which has been working with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) for the past six months to prepare for an Ebola outbreak. She said that, \"we are very concerned about how quickly it will spread and how fast it can spread. We are also concerned that we will have to deal with this very quickly,\" she said, referring to an outbreak that has killed more than 1,000 people since May 24, when the virus was first detected in Sierra Leone and spread to Liberia. Liu said she had been told by a health official that Ebola could spread as quickly as it had spread from one country to another. But she was not sure if that was the case, she added, saying that she didn't know what was going on. According to her, there were no immediate reports of any new cases. However, at least one person has died from Ebola, according to a UN report. That report, published on Friday, is the first to come out of a major outbreak in Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, Guinea and Liberia since the beginning of last year, in which the deadly disease was discovered in May. There were also reports that a number of cases were being reported in other African countries and in some cases, some of those cases had already been confirmed by health officials, while others had not been reported at all. At the same time, officials said they were still working to identify those who had died, as well as to determine the exact cause of their deaths. A WHO spokesperson told the UN news agency, WHO, on its website, that this was \"a very serious and serious outbreak.\" The agency also said a new outbreak is expected to occur between August 8 and August 13, with a total of 10 cases of hemorrhagic fever in Liberia and Guinea. WHO has warned of an \"emergency\" outbreak within the next 12 months. Doctors, meanwhile, are currently working on a response plan to try to find a way to contain it. They have not ruled out the possibility of new outbreaks, however, they have yet to rule out a possible outbreak, said Lui. If that is not possible, he said he would not be available to provide further information on how to respond. Meanwhile, his team is working closely with local health authorities and other health agencies to ensure that they are prepared to act in an emergency situation. His team has already reached out to local authorities, including the United Nations health office, to coordinate the response. Officials have also expressed concern over the lack of adequate resources to tackle the crisis. This could mean a shortage of medical personnel and resources, especially in areas where there is an acute shortage, such as hospitals, clinics and schools. Experts say the current outbreak could be the most severe, if not the worst, of which there are many. And they say it is unlikely that any of these cases will be resolved within a short period of time. For now, medical staff are being asked to stay in contact with their patients and their families in order to help them recover from their illnesses and prevent further spread, experts say, because the country's health minister has not yet made a decision on whether or not to send a team of doctors to treat patients with Ebola patients, or if they will need to travel to Africa to receive treatment. As a precaution, doctors have already begun to assess the risks of spreading Ebola to patients who may be affected by this outbreak as soon as possible. An official statement from the Ministry of Health and Humanitarian Affairs (MOH) said there could not provide an update on what is currently being prepared for patients in need of treatment, citing the latest information available.

Conservative members of Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition put forward a united front at the weekend against recent developments in the city of Wuppertal. Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said civilians wearing uniforms bearing the logo \"Shariah police\" could not simply start patrolling German streets. The groups reportedly hovered around sites like discotheques and gambling houses, telling passers-by to refrain from gambling and alcohol. Wuppertal's police have begun pressing charges. \"Sharia law is not tolerated on German soil,\" de Maiziere told mass-circulation daily Bild on Saturday. \"Nobody can take it upon themselves to abuse the good name of the German police.\" Justice Minister Heiko Maas, meanwhile, told Bild that \"the state alone\" was responsible for the administration of justice in Germany. It was obvious, Maas said, that any illegal parallel system of law enforcement would not be tolerated. Christian Democrat party whip Volker Kauder was similarly emphatic in an interview to be published in this week's Welt am Sonntag newspaper. \"Under absolutely no circumstances can we tolerate self-styled 'Sharia police officers' patrolling our streets and dictating what people should or should not do,\" Kauder said. Ringleader: goal was attention The 33-year-old behind the Wuppertal patrols, former fireman Sven Lau, published a video on his website on Saturday. Lau said that a \"Sharia police\" never existed, and that a group of men had simply worn the mock uniforms for a few hours. \"We knew that this would raise attention,\" Lau said, claiming that his goal was to spark a debate about Sharia law in Germany. Lau is a leading member of Germany's Salafist movement, advocates of a strict Sunni interpretation of political Islam. He works with a mosque in his native M\u00f6nchengladbach, not far west of Wuppertal, and used to head the fundamentalist group \"Invitation to Paradise.\" (Einladung zum Paradies, in German.) The central council of Muslims in Germany (ZMD) condemned the activities. \"These few teen yobs do not speak in our name,\" chairman Ayman A. Mazyek told the Tagesspiegel am Sonntag newspaper. \"These people are perverting the name of our religion. With this shrill and foolish action, they are really hurting Muslims.\" Sharia law is the Arabic term for a legal system based on the Koran. Saudi Arabia and Iran are examples of countries where such a system officially applies. Wearing a veil is obligatory for women and corporal punishment such as stoning is legally tolerated. Human Rights Watch reported last month that Saudi Arabia had beheaded 19 people in just 16 days in August, for convictions on charges ranging from cannabis smuggling to \"sorcery.\" msh/rc (AFP, dpa, Reuters)",
        "generated_story": "German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said on Saturday that he would not tolerate'sharia police' in Wuppertal. \"We are not going to tolerate the use of Sharia law in our country,\" he said in an interview with the German newspaper Tagesspiegel am Sonntag. He added that the police were \"not in a position to do anything about it\" and that \"we will not allow it to be used against us.\" He also said that police would be allowed to use the Koran as a weapon in the fight against the Islamic State (IS) in Iraq and Syria. The Koran is the basis of Islamic law, he added, adding that it is not the first time that such a law has been used to justify the killing of innocent people. In the past, police have used it as an excuse to kill innocent civilians. But in this case, it was not a justification. It was simply a pretext for police to carry out a search of a house and search the house. Police were also allowed access to a nearby mosque, where a number of people had been killed by Islamic extremists, according to police spokesman Volker Kauder. On Saturday, German police said they had found no evidence of the murder of anyone, but that they were still searching for the suspects. They were being held in custody for questioning and questioned by police officers, who were not authorized to speak to the media. According to German media, the case was being investigated by the Interior Ministry, which said it had received information about the death of one of its own officers. Germany's interior minister, Heiko Maas, said the investigation was continuing. She said there was \"no reason to believe that this was a case of 'Sharia law' or \"Islamic law.\" \"It is a matter of law and order,\" she said, referring to Islamic laws that apply to all Muslims. However, she did not rule out the possibility that some of these laws could be applied to other religions, such as Judaism, Christianity, Islam, and the Bible, as well as the belief that all religions are created equal. There is no justification for this kind of behavior.\" The German interior ministry, however, has repeatedly rejected the idea that law enforcement agencies should be able to enforce the law without the help of police, saying it would only be tolerated by those who do not have the right to have their religion in their home state of Bavaria. That is, until they have a chance to prove their innocence. And that is exactly what has happened in Germany. Since the beginning of this year, there have been a lot of protests and demonstrations. Many people have called for a ban on the practice of Islam. Some have even accused the government of being too lenient in its handling of such cases. Others have accused police of violating the rights of religious minorities. This has led to calls for an end to this practice, with some even calling it a form of torture. At the same time, some have also called it an \"act of revenge\" against Muslims, while others call it \"an act of terrorism.\" In a statement, a spokesman for German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she would \"never tolerate such acts of violence\" in her country, \"but we will continue to stand by our people and stand behind our values and values as we have always stood up for them.\" German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel said his government was committed to fighting against Islamic terrorism and extremism. His comments came in response to criticism from human rights groups, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch (HRW), which have criticized Germany for not doing enough to protect its citizens from the threat posed by \"radical Islam\". \"I think it's a mistake to say that we should not be doing this,\" Gabriel told reporters in Berlin. 'We have to act as if we are doing something about this, because we don't want this to happen to our own people.' \"This is an example of what we can't do,\" said Gabriel, director of Amnesty's anti-terror campaign. German Interior minister Volkers Kaud, meanwhile, called on Merkel to step down from her position as German chancellor, citing \"a lack of respect for Islam\" as one reason for her decision not to allow the \"Islamization of our society\" to take place. French President Nicolas Sarkozy has also been accused of using the word \"terrorism\" when she was in office. France's president, Francois Hollande, is also a vocal critic of \"terrorists\" who have repeatedly criticized the violence against minorities in recent years. Last week, Merkel was criticized for calling for tougher action against radical Islamists in France and Germany, accusing them of spreading extremism and promoting the spread of extremist ideology. Merkel's government has called the attacks on Muslims \"unacceptable and unacceptable,\" but she has not said whether this would happen again, despite the fact that many people are still living under the influence of radical Islam and other extremist ideologies. Speaking to journalists in Cologne, France, Germany and Austria, Gabriel spoke to reporters at a news conference in which he was quoted by"

        "target": "Russia to create corporate aid fund, tapping pensions Moscow is planning to set up an emergency fund to help companies hit by sanctions imposed on Russian firms over the country's role in the Ukraine crisis. The money is to come from the Russian pensions system. Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov unveiled a plan Monday aimed at creating a \"multi-billion-dollar\" funding vehicle for companies hit by Western sanctions. Moscow-based news agency RIA quoted Siluanov as saying that the emergency fund would be set up next year with money originally earmarked for the State Pension Fund and leftover funds from this year's budget. According to RIA, Moscow was planning to devote \"at least 100 billion roubles\" (2 billion euros) to the fund, which will mainly be aimed at helping cash-starved Russian banks and key oil companies. \"These 100 billion roubles will be added to the reserve next year, which will allow us to help companies,\" RIA quoted Siluanov as saying. \"We are planning to create a reserve of significant size.\" Just last week, the European Union and the United States imposed a third round of sanctions on Moscow for Russia's involvement in the Ukraine conflict. The latest sanctions target the Russian banking sector as well as key energy firms and arms manufacturers. As one of several companies that have asked for government help, Russia's oil giant Rosneft said it would need 1.5 trillion roubles ($39.70 billion) in aid to keep exploring for oil. Siluanov also told RIA news agency that the decision to stop transferring money to the Pension Fund would hand the budget an extra 309 billion roubles. It will be the second year running that Moscow has stopped transfers of funds from the budget to the Pension Fund, which provides benefits for Russia's pensioners, some invalids and families who have lost their breadwinners. uhe/nz (Reuters, RIA)",
        "generated_story": "Russia to create multi-billion-dollar pension fund for companies hit by sanctions over Ukraine conflict Russia has announced plans to set up a multi billion-rupee fund to help companies affected by the conflict in Ukraine. The fund will be created by Russia's state-owned oil company Rosneft, which is facing sanctions from the European Union and the United States for failing to pay its debts to Ukraine, according to a report by RIA news agency on Monday. It did not say how much the fund would cost, but it said it would be worth at least 100 billion roubles ($1.5 trillion) a year for the first year of the new fund. \"The fund is set to be established in the second year,\" said Anton Siluanov, the head of state Pension Fund (RIA) in a statement. He said the plan was aimed at boosting the state's ability to meet its obligations under the EU's sanctions against Russia and to reduce its dependence on the Russian ruble currency. In addition, he said that Russia would contribute to an additional 2 billion euros ($2.7 billion) to the Fund's annual budget in 2018-19. This year, it is expected to receive a total of 1.6 trillion rouble ($4.4 billion). The pension funds will receive an annual dividend of 2.70 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) and a share of foreign exchange reserves. They will also be able to invest in infrastructure projects, such as roads, railways and airports, as well as the construction of new roads and bridges. A number of Russian companies have already announced that they will contribute up to 2 percent to their annual fund balance, while other companies will have to make up the remaining 1 percent. Some of them have said they would not contribute at all. For example, Russian state oil giant Gazprom is due to start a joint venture with the country's largest oil and gas producer, PetroRussian, on Tuesday. Russia is one of a handful of countries in Europe that have agreed to cooperate with EU sanctions on Russia, including Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Japan, China and Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin has said he is willing to work with Russia to resolve the Ukraine crisis, although he has not said whether he would do so. According to state media, Putin had promised to take a \"strong stand\" against the sanctions, adding that he was \"very optimistic\" about the future of Russia as a developing country. But the Kremlin has so far refused to commit to such a move, saying that it was too early to talk about it. On Monday, a spokesman for Moscow-based Finance Ministry told Reuters that the government had not yet made a decision on whether to open a separate fund in response to sanctions imposed by EU member states, and that \"we are not ready to do that yet.\" \"We have not made any decision yet,\" the spokesman said, referring to Moscow's decision to step down from its role in sanctions talks with Moscow. Moscow is also not the only country that has taken a hard line on Ukraine over the past year. Last week, Russia announced a new round of sanctions to punish the Ukrainian government for its actions in Crimea, where it has been accused of violating the terms of an arms deal with Ukraine's international obligations. However, this was not enough to prevent Russia from taking action against Ukraine and other countries. Finance Minister Alexander Lukashev said in an interview on Sunday that Moscow would continue to monitor the situation closely, with a view to making sure that sanctions were not imposed on all companies that are involved in any way. 'We will not do anything to undermine the stability of our economy,' he told reporters in Moscow, without elaborating on what the move would mean for Russia - a step that could lead to further deterioration of its economy - but he added that there was no reason to think that this could be the case, given the fact that Ukraine is still facing a crisis of confidence in its own economy and its prospects for economic growth. There is no clear indication of how Russia will respond to this, however, if it does not act in this way, or how long it will take to achieve its goal of reducing the level of economic sanctions. If sanctions are imposed, there will still be a lot of pressure on Moscow to act. That is not going to happen, though, that is the main reason why Russia should not step up its efforts to improve its relations with its neighbors, particularly in relation to Crimea and Crimea. At the same time, Moscow has pledged to keep sanctions in place until the end of this year's financial crisis. Putin's government has also promised a review of all the measures it considers necessary in order to avoid a possible escalation of tensions between Moscow and Kiev. Ukraine has already taken steps to address the crisis and Moscow could not agree on a resolution to its debt restructuring. Reuters, citing sources, said Russian media reports that Russian officials have warned that a deal could take place within the next two years. Foreign ministers have expressed concern about a potential escalation in relations between the current sanctions"

US General Philip Breedlove said Russian forces were still operating inside Ukraine. Speaking to reporters after a meeting with NATO military chiefs in Lithuania's capital Vilnius on Saturday, US General Philip Breedlove expressed \"sincere hope\" about a renewed peace plan, agreed to earlier in the day in the Belarusian capital Minsk, by separatists and representatives from Ukraine's and Russia's governments. The new pact, including an artillery buffer zone, was a move to strengthen a peace plan signed earlier this month, also in Minsk. However, Breedlove said violence levels in Ukraine in recent days were as high as prior to the earlier ceasefire. \"The ceasefire is still there in name, but what is happening on the ground is quite a different story,\" Breedlove said, adding that Russian forces were still operating in Ukraine, although he could not pinpoint how many. \"The fluidity of movement of Russian forces and Russian-backed forces back and forth across that border makes it almost impossible to understand the numbers,\" he said. A convoy from Russia consisting of about 170 trucks arrived in Ukraine on Saturday, with a reported cargo of humanitarian aid. Previous aid convoys sent from Russia were met with outrage in Kyiv, as it was suspected they may have been used to provide support to the pro-Moscow separatists in eastern Ukraine. Russia has repeatedly denied such accusations. The separatists have said they want to break from Kyiv and have already declared \"people's republics'\" in Donetsk and Luhansk. This week Ukraine's parliament passed a bill which paves the way for more autonomy for those areas. While neither Russia nor Ukraine are members of NATO, both share borders with NATO countries. se/ksb (AP, AFP)",
        "generated_story": "Ukraine ceasefire is 'in name only', says US general Philip Breedlove The ceasefire in eastern Ukraine has been called into question by the United States, a US military general said on Saturday. The Ukrainian government has called for an end to the fighting in the eastern part of the country, according to British Prime Minister Theresa May, who said the ceasefire was in \"name only\" and that it was \"in the name of peace and stability\" in Ukraine. \"It is not a ceasefire, it is an agreement between the two sides. It is a peace agreement that is in fact only a declaration of truce and not an attempt to end the conflict,\" BreedLove told reporters at a news conference in Washington. He added that the US would continue to work with the Ukrainian military in order to prevent a repeat of a 2014 ceasefire that was brokered by Russia and the West over Ukraine's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. NATO's top military officer, Lieutenant-Colonel Philip \"Philip\" Breedove, said in a statement that \"the ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia has not been renewed for a long period of time.\" The US has said it will continue its efforts to broker a truce between Ukrainian and Russian forces, but it has also warned that a new round of fighting could take place before the end of this week. In the past, the Russian military has repeatedly threatened to withdraw troops from the front lines, saying they would not be allowed to enter Ukraine until the new ceasefire had been agreed upon. On Saturday, NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said that Russia had agreed to allow the deployment of troops to Ukraine, adding that there would be no further escalation of hostilities until Russia was able to agree to a cease-fire, which would allow it to take effect immediately. However, he added, \"We will not allow this to happen again. We are not going to tolerate this kind of escalation.\" NATO member states have also called on Russia to step up its role in fighting Ukrainian separatists. Russia, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and other NATO allies have all agreed that Ukraine should be given a fair chance to live up to its obligations under the terms of its ceasefire agreement with Russia. But, in addition to that, there is also the question of whether Russia is willing to give up the right to use its military force to fight the separatists, and whether it should do so unilaterally. At the same time, US Secretary of State John Kerry said Russia should step in to ensure that its troops were not being used as a bargaining chip in negotiations with Kiev. 'We don't want them to be used in this way,' he said. US President Vladimir Putin said earlier this month that Moscow was ready to do what it could to help Ukraine achieve its goal of ending its conflict with Moscow. Putin, however, did not rule out the possibility of doing so, though he did say that he was not ready for that. According to his spokesman, Putin had not ruled out a possible military intervention. Speaking to reporters in Moscow on Friday, Russia's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow had \"no plans to intervene in any way at this time\" to try to influence the outcome of talks between Moscow and Kiev, referring to an ongoing dispute over the Ukraine crisis. Moscow has so far refused to accept the idea of an interim ceasefire. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, meanwhile, has promised to continue talks with Ukraine on the sidelines of next week's NATO summit in Brussels, where he is expected to hold talks on a deal to discuss the future of relations between Kiev and Moscow, as well as the possible extension of sanctions against Moscow's nuclear weapons program, if it can be agreed on by all parties, including the European Union and NATO. Ukraine is the latest country to join the talks, despite the fact that they are unlikely to reach a final agreement on its nuclear deal with Washington, although it's not clear whether that will be reached by a formal agreement. A spokesman for the president's office said he had no comment on whether Moscow would agree with NATO on any such move. Reuters, AFP, AP and AP reported that Putin has told Putin's comments were \"very positive\" about the situation in Kiev's eastern border area. Kremlin officials have repeatedly denied that any talks were being discussed in an effort to avoid a military confrontation and said they were open to discussing the issue of any further talks. Meanwhile, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Putin is \"open to dialogue with Putin and his Russian counterpart, Boris Yeltsin, on his visit to Moscow next month. Lavrov also said there was no intention to impose sanctions on Moscow if Moscow does not agree on an arms deal. That's a fact of life for Putin. There is no indication that this is likely to come to terms with a Russian-backed government in talks in Vienna, Austria, or any other country. This is something that has already been discussed. And, of course, Moscow is already looking at the prospect of such a move, given that Kiev has agreed not to make any concrete steps toward a permanent ceasefire and expressed concern about a potential deal,"

        "target": "Opinion: Obama's Cuban revolution President Barack Obama has made a very special declaration of love to Cuba. It's as revolutionary as the Cuban revolution, and as peaceful as the biblical Sermon on the Mount, says DW's Astrid Prange. US President Barack Obama has lost his old communist \"enemy,\" and Cuban President Raul Castro has lost his hatred of capitalism. In the first phone call from president to president since 1961 the two heads of state came to a surprisingly swift agreement. They want to renew diplomatic relations, which have been on ice for more than 50 years, and exchange ambassadors. It's only a matter of time before the US lifts its trade embargo against Cuba. All the word \"embargo\" is really good for - at this stage - is as an ideological soapbox for political hardliners, especially Republicans in Congress who believe lifting sanctions would constitute defeat for the US. Yet the lifting of the embargo has already begun. In addition to medication, it has been possible since 2000 to export agricultural produce such as maize, cereal crops, and poultry to Cuba. Flirting with the rogue state Furthermore, 100,000 US citizens have travelled to Cuba since 2011 for cultural and scientific exchanges. Travel restrictions on Cubans living in exile in the US who wanted to visit their relatives on the island were also lifted. According to press reports, the two countries' military forces are even said to be cooperating, as are their coastguards, and military on the border of the US marine base in Guantanamo. Now Obama wants to officially open a \"new chapter\" in relations with the communist Caribbean island and remove Cuba from the US list of so-called \"rogue states\" that support terrorism. The travel ban on American tourists visiting the island will also largely be lifted. That's as far as things will go for the time being, as Obama would require a majority in Congress in Washington to lift the embargo entirely. But even if these are only small steps, the fall of the American-Cuban wall has begun. The easing of the sanctions and the resumption of diplomatic relations are setting the scene for an end to the embargo. Embargo as scapegoat The tearing down of this \"wall in the mind\" is long overdue. The blockade is obsolete, and has proved to be entirely ineffective. More than this, its advocates have achieved the opposite of what they actually wanted. The blockade has provided the leaders in Havana with an easy excuse for their economic failure. Raul Castro realized long ago that Cuba's economic problems can no longer be justified simply by citing the US embargo. It looks as though he was counting on the blockade being lifted: There is no other explanation for the completion of the Mariel container port in January this year. Cuba's biggest infrastructure project was, incidentally, financed by Brazil. The Brazilians also sent a declaration of love to Cuba. Raul Castro opened the door to them. He loves anyone who helps him - his friends even more than his enemies.",
        "generated_story": "The Fall of the Wall in the Mind of Cuban President Barack Obama In the mind of former Cuban president Raul Castro, the fall of a wall in his mind is a reminder of how much power Cubans have in their hands. In his first year in office, Obama, who was elected to the presidency in 2011, said that he was \"very proud\" of his country. \"I am very proud of my country,\" he said, adding that \"we have a lot of respect for the people of Cuba and the Cuban people.\" But he also added that Cuba was not the only country in Latin America that had fallen into the hands of authoritarian regimes. The Cuban government, which was founded in 1961, was the first to fall into authoritarian hands after Fidel Castro was overthrown by the Castro regime in 1959. But it has since become a symbol of democracy in Cuba, and it is not just the president who has done so. It is also the country's first democratically elected president since the 1959 revolution. And it's not only Cuba that has come to terms with the fact that it was a communist country, but it also has a long history of repression and repression, including the brutal repression of dissidents and human rights abuses. Cuba is one of only a handful of Latin American countries to have experienced such repression in its history, according to a report by DW's Astrid Prange. Brazilians are the most likely to be affected by this, she said. Many of them are Cuban-Brazilians who have lived in exile in Brazil for decades. They have been living in constant fear for their country for generations. For many, this is their first time living under a repressive regime. Some of their fears are that they will not be able to return to their homeland. Others, however, are not so certain. After all, they live in a country where the state is the center of power. That is why they are so desperate to get out of poverty. There is no other country that is as desperate as Cuba in terms of economic and social stability as the United States. This is because the U.S. government has been unable to do anything to stop the rise of communism in this country since 1961. At the same time, there are a number of other countries that have benefited from the communist regime, such as Brazil, that are also suffering from a lack of freedom of movement. One of those countries is Brazil. Another is Colombia, where many of its citizens have fled to seek refuge in communist-controlled countries like Cuba. Last year, President Obama visited the island of Cura\u00e7u to visit his wife and family. He said he hoped to see her again. His visit to Brazil was an opportunity to talk to her about his plans for a better life for her and her family, as well as about the future of her children. Obama's visit was also a chance to meet with her in person. She said she hoped that she would get to know her husband and his family well enough to tell her what she wanted to say to him. However, he did not want to give up on his dream of becoming president. Instead, his visit came at the end of January this year when he visited Brazil and met with President Rodrigo Roavelo, a former president of Brazil's Communist Party (Cuba) who had been in power for more than a decade and who is now a member of Congress. According to his spokesman, \"We are very happy to welcome him back to our country.\" He also said the visit is \"a great opportunity for us to make a positive change in our relationship with our people. We are hopeful that we will continue to work together as a nation. I hope that this will be the case for all of us.\" The visit comes after a series of meetings between the two countries, in which Obama and President-elect Obama have discussed the possibility of reuniting with their children and their families. On the other hand, I am not sure what to expect from him, though, because he has not yet decided whether or not he will do that. As he told me, it would be a good idea for him to stay in touch with his Cuban counterpart. What I'm hoping for is that there is something to learn from this visit. If he does not know what he wants to hear from her, then I think he's going to try to find out what we can do to help us. From the beginning of this trip, we hope he'll have the courage to come back and tell us the truth about what is going on in Havana.\" Obama has already made it clear that his intentions are clear: He is committed to building a strong relationship between his people and Cuba's people, especially with them. Since his election in 2012, Cuba has become an important part of our nation's future. So far, so many people have expressed their hopes and hopes that the new president will make it easier for Cuba to build a stronger relationship and a more inclusive Cuba will have an even greater impact on the world. Here are some of course, too."

The case has highlighted the army's problems with equipment and morale. The men sentenced to death on Wednesday were part of the special forces division ordered in August to retake three towns in Borno state, which had been taken over by the Islamist Boko Haram insurgents. Their lawyer, Femi Falana, said the 54 men were sentenced to death by firing squad and five had been acquitted. They were accused of conspiring to commit mutiny against the authorities of the 7th Division of the Nigerian army, which is on the frontline. The trial began on October 15 and was conducted behind closed doors. It is subject to approval by top military officials, but there has so far been no indication that senior officers oppose the court martial. They were not available for comment afterwards. There was a similar case in Nigeria in September, when 12 soldiers were sentenced to death for mutiny after firing on their commanding officer in the northeast city of Maiduguri. The 7th Division, based in Maiduguri, leads the offensive but there are numerous reports of troops refusing to deploy. Soldiers have regularly complained that they lack weapons, food, and other basic supplies to fight the Islamists, who are reported to have tanks, rocket-propelled-grenade launchers, and other heavy weaponry. Boko Haram has taken a number of towns and declared an Islamic caliphate in the region near the border with Cameroon. The Nigerian military has in recent weeks claimed to have made progress in recapturing lost territory. Thousands of people have been killed since the Islamist uprising began five years ago. An estimated 1.3 million have been displaced, with tens of thousands seeking refuge in neighboring Cameroon, Chad, and Niger. rg/bk (AFP, AP, dpa)",

The 7th Division is expected to take place on October 15, a day after a military court ordered the military to halt operations against the Islamist group, which has claimed to be fighting for the lives of thousands of civilians. Police said on Wednesday that they were preparing to launch a counter-insurgency operation to retake the state's capital, Maiduguri, from the insurgents who seized it in August. \"We are going to use all available means,\" said Femi Falana, the head of the anti-terror unit, in an interview with the Associated Press (AFP). The military said it would conduct an investigation into the incident, adding that it was not the first time it had conducted such an operation. It also said that the army was prepared to provide security to the civilian population. But it did not say how it planned to conduct the operation, saying it will be conducted in accordance with law and order. According to a statement released by the police, \"the military is ready to do whatever is necessary to ensure the security of our people and our country.\" The statement said the investigation was ongoing and that there was \"no evidence of any wrongdoing.\" It added that \"we will continue to monitor the situation closely and will take all necessary steps to prevent any further escalation of violence.\" A military spokesman told AFP that military operations were continuing in northeastern Nigeria, where the fighting is ongoing. He said there were no reports of civilian casualties, but that a number of people had been killed in clashes between the two sides. There was no immediate claim of responsibility, however, and no one was arrested. On Wednesday, police said they had arrested several people, including a woman, who was suspected of being involved in a kidnapping and attempted murder of a soldier. They were also accused of carrying out attacks on police and other security forces. At least one soldier was killed, according to local media, while another was injured. Authorities have not said how many people were killed but they have said at least 10,000 people have been arrested since the beginning of last year. Some of those arrested are believed to have fled the country in search of refuge in neighboring Niger state. Many of them have since been released on bail. In the meantime, they are being held in detention for five years. If they do not return to their homes they will face charges of kidnapping, torture and murder, as well as the death penalty. This is the second time the government has tried to bring them to justice for their alleged involvement in fighting the insurgency. Last month, it announced the release of one of its most notorious leaders, Ibrahim Idris, was sentenced to life in prison after he was found guilty of inciting a terrorist attack on a school bus in Boko Haram town in September. His sentence was set to run concurrently with that of his predecessor, Abubakar Shekau, on charges that he had attempted to incite violence against civilians in his home town of Kano in July. As a result, he faces up to 10 years in jail if he is convicted of all charges related to his alleged role in setting up the terrorist group. Meanwhile, there are also allegations of human rights violations in other parts of Nigeria and the West African country, such as rape and kidnapping. Most of these allegations are based on allegations made against him and his family members. However, some have also been dismissed as politically motivated, with some accusing him of failing to act on his own and others saying he should be punished for his role as a victim of crimes against humanity. That is not true, though, because he has a long history of abuse and abuse of power in Nigeria's armed forces, particularly against women and girls. And it's not clear whether he will ever be released from prison. For now, his sentence is likely to go on for a year and a half. We are not ruling out the possibility of him being released in court. I am not sure how long he could be freed. Nevertheless, we are hopeful that his release will not be the end of this case and I hope he can get out of prison, given the circumstances of what he did in that case.

How long will you be able to live in peace? If you want to see him released, you must go through the process of releasing him, let's just say goodbye to your life."

        "target": "All Eyes on Kimi and Ferdy on Schumi's Turf All eyes will be on a Finn and a Spaniard at the German Grand Prix at Hockenheim on Sunday as the title battle between Kimi Raikkonen and Fernando Alonso looks to put local hero Michael Schumacher in the shade. It is a reflection of his current inauspicious Formula One campaign that World Champion Michael Schumacher is only featuring in reports on this weekend's German Grand Prix at Hockenheim dues to his nationality. The home grown champion equaled his own record of 11 wins in a season at last year's race but this year he will be hoping to just get on the podium at the end. Schumi lies in third place some 34 points off the top spot and has a lot to do if he is to record his 85th career win. Ferrari's poor season to date is unlikely to get better with hopes dwindling that the 36-year-old will add to his sole victory of the season although the seven-time world champion characteristically refuses to rule it out. Schumi and Ferrari still in the fight \"Contrary to many other people's opinions, we have in no means written ourselves off, even though we have to admit that the situation has worsened recently, rather than improved,\" said the German, referring to the problems with this season's car. \"But that doesn't mean that it can't be improved again, and that's exactly what we're working on.\" The limelight is falling on two young pretenders to Schumacher's throne as Sunday's race approaches. The battle between McLaren's flying Finn Kimi Raikkonen and championship leader Renault's speedy Spaniard Fernando Alonso is diverting eyes from the world record holding German on his own turf. Kimi aims to keep heat on leader Alonso Raikkonen must finish the German Grand Prix for the first time in five attempts to close the gap on Alonso if he is to keep his own championship hopes alive. The Finn retired from last year's race because of a rear wing failure and this season has been plagued by technical problems which most recently cost him 10 places on the starting grid in each of the last two rounds. Despite those penalties for engine failure, the 25-year-old managed to finish second and third but he will have to increase his total of three race wins if he is to make a significant impression on the 26-point chasm that separates him from Alonso. \"The battle for the championship is still on and I am determined to get a good result and work on closing the gap,\" said the Finn. \"The (car) has good speed and we need to make the most of it this weekend.\" Montoya doing McLaren team mate no favors Raikkonen's car is obviously a fast one this season but he's not the only driver in a McLaren hot seat. Colombia's Juan Pablo Montoya is not to going to make way for his team mate while his own hopes of the title, however small, remain alive. \"I am really looking forward to racing again this weekend in Germany,\" said Montoya, who won at Hockenheim for Williams two years ago and got his first victory for McLaren in Britain two weeks ago. \"I enjoy racing at Hockenheim, I have performed well here and won in the past and I am aiming for a strong result like at Silverstone.\" Consistent Ferdy the man to beat at Hockenheim Championship leader Alonso, meanwhile, has been impressively consistent for Renault so far this season, winning five times and failing to score points only at the Canadian Grand Prix, where he crashed, and in Indianapolis. The Spaniard is setting the pace and the standard this season so, problems aside, Alonso will again be the man to beat at Hockenheim.",
        "generated_story": "Ferrari's Fernando Alonso and Kimi Raikkonen battle for title at Hockenheim Formula One Grand Prix in Germany on Sunday in a battle of the best drivers in the world. The two-time world champions will battle it out at Silverstone, where they will meet for the first time this season. Ferrari's Sergio Perez and McLaren's Juan Pablo Montoya are the defending champions, but the Spaniard will have to settle for second place in this year's championship, which will be decided by the result of Sunday's race. Fernando, who has won the last three races of his career, is the reigning world champion. He is also the only driver to have won three consecutive races in his first season with McLaren. \"I am very happy with the way I have been able to win the championship,\" he said, adding that he was \"very happy\" with his team-mates' approach to the sport. 'I have a lot of respect for them and they are very respectful of each other,' he added, noting that the two drivers had a good relationship and that they had been friends for a long time. In the past, the pair have worked together to form a strong team. They have also worked closely together on the technical aspects of their cars, such as their handling and the handling of tyres. But they have not worked as well together as they once did in their first two seasons. On the other hand, their relationship has always been very close, with both of them having worked hard to improve their driving skills and their ability to race well. This year, however, that has not been the case, as both drivers have struggled to find the right balance of speed and power. For the second consecutive season, Ferrari have had to make a concerted effort to keep pace with Mercedes and Ferrari in order to maintain their top-four position. That is, until they find themselves in an unexpected position at the end of a race that could be the most difficult to complete. And then there's the question of who will win, and how long will it take to get there? The question is whether Ferrari can keep up with their pace and drive well enough to take the title, or if they can simply keep the pace up and continue to push for it. It's a tough task, though, because the German team has been unable to do that. After all, it's only the drivers who are going to be there for one race, not the driver who is going out on a winning streak. As a result, there is no way to predict the outcome of this weekend's races. Alonso has already won two races, while Schumacher has also won one. His second-place finish in qualifying was his second in as many years, when he finished second at Red Bull last year. Raikonen, meanwhile, was third in points last season after finishing fourth in Bahrain and fourth at Abu Dhabi. Both drivers will now be looking to add to their points tally at next season's season-ending race in Canada, although the Japanese team are expected to defend their title in Hungary and Bahrain, respectively, after the Mexican team's victory over Mercedes in Mexico last weekend. Despite the fact that Ferrari are still in pole position, they still have only one place to go and are only two points clear of McLaren in third place, ahead of Ferrari, Mercedes, McLaren and Mercedes. Last year they finished fourth and fifth, behind Ferrari and Force India in second and third respectively. What's next for Ferrari? \"We are looking forward to a great season,\" Alonso said after his victory in Brazil, a victory that will give them a chance to extend their championship lead to two years in charge of Mercedes-Mercedes. F1's most successful season so far has seen a number of drivers from the United States and Canada take part in races around the globe, including the US, Canada and Mexico. However, this is a new era for drivers and drivers alike who have never won a championship in Formula 1. There is still much to learn about the future of motorsport, especially in terms of strategy and strategy. McLaren are hoping to build on their recent success in China and India. Team-mate Alonso is one of only a handful of young drivers to reach the podium, having won four races since his return from a back injury in 2015. While he is only 24 years old, he still has plenty of time to develop his skills as a driver and he has the potential to become a world-class driver. If he can improve on his form, his chances of winning the race are likely to increase, according to Alonso's coach, Josef Ferdy, whose team will also be in contention to claim a third consecutive world title next year in Australia. A new season is in store for him, too, if he wins the season title. With the addition of two new drivers, Hamilton and Alonso are set to compete in 2018. Hamilton will take on Ferrari on Saturday in Shanghai, in what is their second season in three years. Meanwhile, Williams is looking for its first race"

        "target": "German Publishers Warm to Google Library Google is heading for a legal battle with American publishers over its plan to digitize books from five major libraries. But German publishers seem warm to the idea. Five major US publishers filed suit in San Francisco on Wednesday to block Google from scanning books without the permission of copyright holders. The project, already underway but stopped by Google in August, is the Silicon Valley company's bid to make the world's books searchable online. Five major libraries are already participating in the project and Google sent executive Jennifer Grant to the Frankfurt Book Fair on Wednesday to present the idea to European and German book publishers. This week Google introduced print.google.de, the German version of the search engine Google posted online this time last year. Google lets users type in a search term then scans its digitized library for the word or expression and produces a list of books where the term is mentioned. Users can then click on the results and a few pages of the text appear allowing users to read up online. The idea is to supplement Internet users with another source of material. In contrast to their American colleagues, German publishing houses have reacted well to the database. Some German publishers on board Google said that is discussing terms with all major German publishers. Langenscheidt, which publishes a large selection of dictionaries, said they had got on board. \"We are starting with 160 books,\" Hubert Haarmann, head of the electronic publishing division and the publisher, told the Financial Times Deutschland. \"We see it as an additional distribution possibility.\" An increased and more direct reach to the consumer is just one way Google is promoting its new project to skeptical publishers. The company also says that publishers will be able to monitor interest in titles through the search engine, and use the information in deciding whether to reprint certain books. Google has also promised publishers a cut of the advertising that will appear on the site. Not all German publishers are on board. In fact, the German association representing publishers has announced it will begin its own project where publishers can scan their own books, rather than let someone else do it. The project is not a competitor to Google, but will allow publishers to create their own database, rather than turn it over to the search engine. If Google can, anyone can But American publishers don't want to even take that step. They fear a slippery slope if Google is allowed to digitize copyrighted material. \"If Google can make \u2026 copies, then anyone can,\" Patricia Schroeder, president of the Association of American Publishers, said in a phone interview with Reuters. \"Anybody could go into a library and start making digital copies of anything.\" At issue is the right of authors and their publishers to their own work versus the \"fair use\" of their work by the public. Google argues that their search engine will only offer users a \"card catalog\" function, with a few pages of text. No one will be able to read the entire book online.",
        "generated_story": "German Book Fair in Frankfurt A German-language search engine for books has been launched in Germany. It is the world's largest online book fair, with more than 1.5 million visitors a week. The site, which was launched on Wednesday, is designed to help book lovers find books they want to read in German. According to a report in the Financial Times Deutschland, the site is used by thousands of booksellers across Germany and abroad to promote their books. In Germany, it is run by the German Association of American Publishers (AAP), which is responsible for promoting German books and publishing them on its website. On Wednesday it launched an app for book-buyers to search for titles from German publishers, including German, French, Spanish, Italian, Dutch, German and Spanish. Users can also use the app to find the titles they are looking for, according to the report. For example, Google searches for the title of a book by German author Patricia Schroeder, who has published a number of books in English and German since the beginning of the year. Google has also launched a new search feature for German titles, called Google Book Search, that aims to identify books with a German title. This feature, however, will not be available until the end of August, when Google will be able to provide a searchable list of titles that are available on Google's search results page. Search engine Google is one of several German language search engines that Google uses to track book sales. One of them is Google Search. Another is called \"Google Booksearch,\" which focuses on books that have been translated into German by English-speakers. Both Google and Google have said that they would like to expand their search capabilities to include books from other languages, as well as other genres, such as fantasy, science fiction, fantasy and fantasy. Some of these titles have already been published, while others are being published by other publishers in other countries. \"We are very happy with the results,\" Google said in a statement, adding that it was \"very pleased with our results so far this year.\" The company also said it would continue to work with publishers to develop new products for their customers, and that the company would be working with them to improve the quality of its products and services. Read more: Google, Apple, Amazon: What's the big deal about the Frankfurt Book fair? Google says it wants to make the event more accessible to people who are interested in books, but also to those who don't have the means to do so. That's not the case with Google. If Google can't do that, then it will have to take a step back and make it easier for people to get their hands on the books themselves, because Google already has a lot to learn about them. And that's a good thing, since Google does not have a huge database of all the information it has available. But it also has to be careful what it says about its search terms and how it uses them, especially when it comes to book searches. What does Google tell you about books? What do you think of Google? The search giant says the search firm's results are good enough to know what to look for when you're searching for new titles? It says they're not available to you, so Google won't let you know until you've searched for a particular book, or you find one that you like, based on what you already know about a certain book or a specific book. So Google should be doing more research on this topic, rather than trying to narrow it down to just a few titles. You can find out more about what Google thinks about it, too, by searching the Google search page, for example. Here's how Google tells you how to use Google to see which books are the best ones to buy and which ones are best for you and why you should look at them and what they might be good for your family, friends and relatives. There's no doubt Google knows what's going on in terms of who you are reading about, right? And Google doesn't care about Google: It's also a great company that helps you to understand the content of your searches, says Google CEO Hubert Haarmann, a former Google executive who is now a Google engineer. He told Reuters in an interview this week that he believes Google could be the first company to tell Google what is going to happen to your book? \"I think it's very important to Google,\" he said, referring to Amazon and Amazon. However, he added, \"It's good to have Google as a company and not just Google.\" Google was the only company Google bought the book that was available for Google in August and then Google decided to give Google a chance to show you what the publishers are doing. I think Google did a really good job of finding the right book and where to put it in Google - and who knows where Google might find it - but Google isn't the most important company in Silicon Valley. They're also the ones who can help you. We've already, I"

        "target": "The Sun Sets Slowly Over Brandenburg's Tropical Dream Having suffered many disappointments concerning publically funded projects, the state of Brandenburg hoped a tropical leisure center would offer a ray of hope. Instead the ailing concern is just bringing more gloom. The economically depressed eastern German state of Brandenburg has seen its fair share of bitter experiences when it comes to huge public investment projects since German unification in 1990. Against this background, state authorities were pleased when Malaysian businessman Colin Au built a huge tropical-feeling leisure center in Brandenburg without any subsidies. The center, which opened about a year ago, was to become a symbol of economic success in a region where unemployment still hovers around the 20 percent mark. But the leisure time park, which has already swallowed a little under 100 million euros ($120 million) in private investment, is now going to have to depend on public funding to avoid another economic fiasco in Brandenburg. State authorities in Brandenburg haven't been too successful in their public investment policy in the past 10 years, to put it mildly. A grand plan to build one of the world's most modern chip-producing factories there burst like a bubble in 2003. The much-talked about Brandenburg-Berlin International airport still seems light years away from being built. Line of failures looked to be ended by Au's vision Another beacon of economic hope disappeared in 2002 when a company planning to build gas-filled transport airships went bust despite considerable subsidies. But Au's vision for the abandoned dome which the airship company needed as a hangar offered Brandenburg another chance. In the middle of nowhere, he created what he named his \"Tropical Islands\" wonderland, sporting everything from sandy beaches, lakes and a Laguna to a Caribbean-style village. The economics ministry in Brandenburg was over the moon to see Au originally agreeing to build the facility without any state subsidies. And Au himself had no doubt at the time that he could well do without them. Overestimated visitor numbers tell sorry story But the center's first year in operation tells a different story. Colin Au, who has meanwhile left Brandenburg and transferred matters to a German management company, had expected some 1.5 million visitors to come to Tropical Islands within the first year, but only some 950,000 will have turned up by the end of 2005. It seems highly unlikely that visitor numbers will increase considerably in future, placing a question mark on the viability of the whole centre. But Brandenburg's economics ministry is certain that the park will be in the black as of 2008. To make the place more attractive, it has agreed to shell out 15 million euros in subsidies for yet another reconstruction and marketing effort. After all, the leisure time center has a workforce of about 500 and is thus the biggest employer in an otherwise depressed region marked by a high jobless rate. Tropical center down but not out...not yet \"We hope the money will help make the Tropical Islands resort better known throughout Europe according to the new marketing concept hammered out the management,\" ministry spokesman Steffen Kammrath said. \"This leisure time center is unique and has to be marketed as such. What you have there is a tropical and water world 12 months a year with a lot of attractive offers to spend a whale of a time there.\" Some commentators believe that state subsidies may prolong the center's life span, but will not be able to avoid its demise in the long run. But the idea of also making it more attractive for tourists from all over Europe seems unrealistic to them if the resort's management can't even get enough visitors from home to ensure a profitable operation.",
        "generated_story": "The Sun Sets Slowly Over Brandenburg's Tropical Islands Resort The sun sets slowly over the tropical island of Laguna in the Baltic Sea. It's the first year of the resort, which opened in 2003, and the sun set slowly on the island at the end of 2005. The setting sun is setting slowly, but gradually, as it does every year. In the past 10 years, there has been a lot of sun, a little less rain and a bit less wind. But in 2005, the Sun set again, setting off a wave of light and warmth that will last for at least 12 months. A little under 100 million euros ($130 million) is expected to be spent on a new resort. Branden-Berlin International is the only company in Germany to have built a resort in this part of Europe, where the average annual income is about 120 million Euros ($140 million). The resort is one of only a few in Europe that is open to the public, with the rest coming from the Caribbean, Caribbean and South America. There are also a number of other resorts that are open for business, such as the one in Berlin. One of them is in New York City. Other resorts have been open since the beginning of 2004, when the city was founded by the German entrepreneur Steffen Kammrath and his wife, Caroline, who are both business owners. \"We are very happy with what we have done so far,\" he said, adding that he was \"very pleased with how well we are doing in terms of our business.\" The hotel is located in a small town in southern Germany, about a half-hour drive from Berlin's central business district, in an area of about 1,000 square kilometers (1,200 square miles) and has a good reputation as a destination for luxury vacationers. However, this is not the case at all. After all, it is a luxury resort with a reputation for being the most luxurious and luxurious resort on Earth. And it's not just about luxury resorts, either. That's because the property is situated on an island off the coast of Cape Town, just north of Germany's southernmost tip of Africa. This is because of its proximity to Europe's most important tourist destinations, including the Mediterranean, Spain, Portugal, Greece, Italy and Spain. At the same time, its location is just a short walk away from a major tourist attraction. With the opening of a brand-new resort last year, tourism is booming. More than 1.5 million tourists have visited the area since 2002, according to a survey conducted by a consultancy firm. Some of these visitors have spent more than a year there, while others have gone on vacation. Many have stayed for a couple of weeks. Others have returned to their homes and are staying in hotels, restaurants and resorts in other countries. They have also been staying at a hotel or vacation resort for several years. For example, one guest, Colin Au, is staying with his family. He said he has stayed in his home town of Stuttgart for two years in order to get a better idea of where he is going to spend his time and what he wants to do next. His wife is also staying, so he's staying there for the time being, he added, because he doesn't want to go back to his hometown of Hamburg, Germany. On the other hand, his daughter, Laura, has also stayed with him. She said she's looking forward to returning to her hometown, Berlin, to visit her parents, her husband and their two children. 'I'm very excited to see them again,' she said. I'm not sure what the future holds for this resort but I think it will be a great place for them to stay, since they are so close to where I am from, I don't know how long I'll be staying. We'll see what I can do with them. If I have to say, that's a very long time to think about it. So, we're hoping that we can get back into the business of tourism. What do you think will happen? I'd like to talk to you about that. Do you have any ideas? Tell me what you're doing? Let me know. You can tell me if you've got any tips for me. Just ask me about the hotel. Or, what are you planning on doing with your vacation? What will you do? You know what's going on in your life? Well, let me tell you what to expect. Let's just say that I've been working on this project for years and I really like the fact that the idea is to make it a reality for my family to come back and see how it all works out for us. Hopefully, they'll get to know each other and we'll find out what they're planning for their future. All I know is that they won't be able to leave the country. How will we get there? We've already had a long term plan for our future? If you can't wait until we've decided to"

Heidel said this week that the club was still trying to convince the German to stay. \"At the moment we're still ready to talk,\" Heidel told this week's edition of football magazine Kicker, albeit stressing that time was of the essence. \"But we must and we will plan for the new season.\" In a separate newspaper interview Heidel was even more explicit, saying the club was not in a position to wait until summer for Meyer to make up his mind. Speaking to Sport Bild magazine, meanwhile, Heidel sought to focus on Meyer's more important role at Schalke, his regular game time, arguing it might be in the youngster's best interests to stay at a club that needs him every week. \"[Coach] Domenico Tedesco has formed the team around him in such a way that there is now an ideal spot for Max. That was not always the case,\" Heidel said. \"He needs to ask himself, putting the financial aspect to one side: 'Will I get such a position at a different club?' Because one thing's clear: Max wants to play, and he needs to play.\" Schalke are already preparing for the departure of one of German football's brightest young stars, midfield all-rounder Leon Goretzka will join Bayern Munich on a free transfer at the season's end.

        "generated_story": "Schalke coach Christian Heidel: \"We're still ready to talk\" about the future of midfielder Max Meyer, who has been linked with a move to Bayern Munich for the past two seasons. The German coach said on January 12 that he was \"still ready\" to discuss his future with the club\u2019s players. \"I think we still have a long way to go,\" he told Kicker, adding that his team-mates would be \"very happy\" if he remained at the helm of the team. But he added that \"we are still open to talking about Max's future\" with his players and the possibility of a return to the Bundesliga, which is expected to last until at least the end of next season, when he will be able to make his first Bundesliga start. He said he would like to see the player he has worked so hard to develop become a top-flight player, but that it was too late for him to do so. In the coming weeks, he said, \"Max will have to decide whether he wants to play for Bayern or for us.\" \"He's not going to give up on his dream of playing for a club like Bayern, and I think that's the only way we can make that happen,\" said the head coach of Bayern's youth side, Domenico Tedesco. Max has also said that the German club is \"not interested\" in signing a new midfielder, according to German newspaper Sport Bild (dpa, dpa). \"It's a matter of time before we make a decision on Max,\" the coach added, referring to a possible move away from the Bavarian capital, Munich, in the next few weeks. It is not clear how long Meyer will stay in Germany, however, because he is still in charge of his own club. Meyer's contract is up for renewal on February 15, the day after the transfer deadline, after which he had to step down from his role as coach. After a difficult season last year, Meyer was given the chance to take over the reins at Bayern. However, it has not been an easy one, as he still has to prove himself to be the right man for his new role at a young age. At the same time, there are doubts about his ability to adapt to new circumstances. For example, his contract with Bayern is due to expire in February, so he may not have the opportunity to renew it for another season. That is, until he returns to his current position as a player. There is also the question of whether or not he can stay on as an assistant coach, a position that has become increasingly important to him in recent years. If he does not return, then he could be forced to leave his position in a few months. This is the first time in his managerial career that Meyer has left his post as the Bayern coach to have been sacked by his former club after a season-long loan spell. His departure from Bayern was announced in mid-January. Now he faces the prospect of being replaced by a younger, more experienced player who can play a more demanding role in future. According to sports Bild, this week's transfer window will open up with an announcement that will not be announced until next week. On the other hand, German media have already begun to speculate on the possible return of Meyer to Germany. Last season's Bundesliga champions Bayern were the most expensive club in Europe, spending around \u20ac5.5 million ($6.6 million) on average. They have spent a lot of money on new players, including the likes of Leon Goretzka and Max, to date, with Meyer and his son, Leon, having spent the last three seasons with them. With Meyer gone, that could mean a change of fortune for Germany's national team, too, if they are to reach the Champions League final in 2019. And that is a problem for German football's most important tournament, where the focus is on winning a Bundesliga title. So, what do you think will happen next year? What will he do next? How can he improve his chances of becoming a coach? \"You know what you can do? You can't do anything about it,\" Meyer said in an interview with sport Bild. 'You can only talk about your future in football. You've got to work on your own terms.\" The Bundesliga's top scorer has already been handed a contract extension for this season and is set to sign a deal with Bayer Leverkusen in March. Analysts say the move is unlikely to happen before the season is over, given that they have not yet made any concrete decisions on who will replace him. Meanwhile, Bayern are also looking to strengthen their squad for next summer's World Cup in Russia. Bundesliga: Bundesliga roundup: The best Bundesliga sides to watch this year's Champions Bundesliga season so far, says Domsco (Sport Bild) and Bayern (Dpa) are the favorites to win the title in January. How will Meyer stay fit? The team is likely to get the best of both sides? Meyer is unclear."

Catholic priest Carlo Alberto Capella was indicted on Saturday after a Vatican investigation found he had allegedly possessed and exchanged \"a large quantity\" of child pornography during his diplomatic posting. His trial will start on June 22 in front of a Vatican magistrate. If convicted, he could be sentenced to between one and five years in prison and fined between \u20ac2,500 and \u20ac50,000 ($2,100 to $42,000). He is being held in the city's police barracks.

The church rejected the request and withdrew him in September to face investigation at home. Shortly afterwards, Canadian authorities issued an arrest warrant for allegedly possessing and distributing child pornography while visiting a church in Canada. The Capella case has hampered the Catholic Church's attempts to move on from its myriad of pedophile priest scandals. There has been particular focus in recent months on the Chilean branch of the Catholic Church ignoring and covering up of child abuse by pedophile priest Fernando Karadima during the 1980s and 1990s. Pope Francis wrote a letter to Chileans last week expressing \"shame\" for the affair despite previously defending one of the main alleged offenders behind the cover-up. The Vatican's third-highest ranking official, Cardinal George Pell, is facing trial in Australia on abuse-related charges. aw/kms (AFP, Reuters, dpa)",
        "generated_story": "Catholic priest Carlo Alberto Capella to face Vatican probe for distributing child pornography Chile's Catholic priest has been summoned to appear before a Vatican tribunal. The Vatican said on Saturday that a Chilean priest had been arrested in connection with the distribution of child porn. \"The Vatican has ordered the arrest of the priest, who was arrested on June 22,\" said Vatican spokesman George Pell. Pell said in a statement, adding that the Vatican was \"deeply troubled\" by the allegations against Capell. He added that \"the Vatican is deeply troubled by these allegations\" and that he was not aware of them at the time of his arrest. According to Pell, the Chilean Catholic Church is \"extremely concerned\" about the church's treatment of minors in Chile, which has led to accusations of sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children in the 1980s and 1990s, as well as the spread of pedophilia and other forms of violence against minors. In addition, he said, \"We are very concerned for the safety and well-being of all Chileans.\" The Chilean government has also said that it will continue to monitor the Church's handling of allegations of sex abuse against children, particularly in relation to minors, and will take steps to ensure that no child is sexually abused by a priest or a nun, according to the statement. It added, however, that if the charges were to be brought to trial, it would be against the cardinal and not the archbishop of Santiago, Archbishop Fernando Karadima. Prosecutors have said they will seek to prosecute the accused priest for his alleged role in distributing the pornographic images of young boys and girls. They are also seeking to have him sentenced to five years in prison, Pell added. A Vatican spokeswoman said the probe was being conducted in response to a request for information on the alleged child sex trafficking and child abuse. Pope Francis is expected to announce his decision later this week, when he will meet with Chilean bishops and laypeople to discuss the case. Chile is the first country in Latin America to extradite a convicted pedophile, accused of having sex with minors under the age of 13. Capelli was convicted in 1990 and sentenced in absentia to one and five-year prison terms. His conviction comes after he pleaded guilty to charges of sexually abusing minors and soliciting them for sexual acts in an attempt to extort money from them in exchange for sex, a charge that has since been dropped by Chilean President Juan Manuel Santos (AFP, dpa, Reuters, AP, AFP)Pope Francis has called for Chile to cooperate with an international investigation into the sex crimes of its priests and bishops, saying they should be prosecuted as a matter of national security. But it is not clear whether the investigation will lead to an immediate resolution of a criminal case, or whether there will be an appeal for leniency. Last year, Pope Benedict XVI issued a decree that would have allowed the prosecution to proceed with a trial of up to two years, but it did not take place until the end of this year. On Saturday, Francis said he would not rule out the possibility of extradition to Chile. Francis also announced that Chile would seek an extradition request from the United States, where it has a long-term ban on sex offenders, in order to avoid a possible prosecution of those who have been convicted of such crimes. For the past two decades, Chile has faced a number of charges, including rape, sodomy and attempted rape. This is one of several cases in which the pope has ruled that minors should not be allowed to receive sexual favors from their parents. That is, if they do not have the right to do so, because of their sexual orientation and the fact that they have no legal basis to consent to sex. And it's not just because they don't have legal status. There is also the question of whether they can be punished for their actions, such as in cases where they are charged with sexual offenses, like in this case with distributing pornography. Vatican: \"I am not going to comment on this matter at this time,\" Francis told a news conference in Rome, Italy, on Friday. 'I will not comment further until we have an opportunity to make a decision on whether or not we will do that. We are not ruling out extradition. I am calling on Chile as an independent country and we are committed to doing everything we can to prevent this from happening again,\" he told reporters at a press conference, referring to Francis' visit to Rome in September. More than a dozen bishops have already been indicted in recent years for alleged sex offenses. Most of these cases are being investigated by investigators, although some are still under investigation, while others have not yet been charged in other countries. At the same time, there is a lack of evidence that is being brought before the Holy See. If the accusations are true, this could be a case that will have a chilling effect on Chilean society. However, I think the Pope has already made it clear that this is something that can only be done in light of what is going on here,\" the pontiff said. Rome: The pope Francis"

And the news was good -- most of the numbers were down compared to the preceding year. Germany's streets were never particularly dangerous, but according to the Interior Ministry, they are now safer than at any time since statistics have been collected. Reported criminal offenses on the whole dropped by 1.4 percent over 2005 -- to a total of just over 6.3 million. \"The statistics show reductions in crime among children, adolescents and teenagers, as well as adults,\" said Sch\u00e4uble. He added that criminality among foreigners living in Germany also fell, saying that this development reflected Germany's efforts to integrate non-Germans. Drugs offenses were down 7.8 percent, followed by theft and street crime, which both declined by four percent or more. Youth violence Vandalism, on the other hand, was up 5.9 percent. Fraud rose slightly, as did violent crime -- among young people by an alarming 4.5 percent. Berlin Interior Minister Erhart K\u00f6rting said that was part of a decade-long trend in Germany. \"As many experts have pointed out,\" K\u00f6rting said, \"the potential for violence in society is increasing.\" The head of the German Police Officers' Union Konrad Freiberg also said those figures showed that German society was not truly getting safer. Frankfurt tops most-dangerous list Crime was down in Frankfurt am Main, but it's still the German city with the greatest number of criminal offenses per 100,000 people. Hanover was a close second, followed by D\u00fcsseldorf, Bremen and Berlin. The total percentage of criminal cases solved by German police also improved slightly from 55 to 55.4 percent. According to the study, Germany's safest place was Bergisch Gladbach, a city of 100,000 inhabitants in the west of the country -- coincidentally, model Heidi Klum's home town.",
        "generated_story": "German Police Officers' Union: The State of Crime in Germany The state of crime in the German police force has been the subject of intense criticism in recent years. Last year, police officers' union chief Erhart K\u00f6rting said that they had received \"a lot of criticism\" for their actions in 2006. In 2006, the police union's chief of staff, Konrad Freiberg, accused the government of not doing enough to tackle the problem. \"We have received a lot more criticism than we had expected,\" he said in a statement on Tuesday, adding that \"we have also received some criticism for the way we have handled the situation in our country.\" The Interior Ministry, however, said it was not aware of any such criticism and that it would not comment further on the matter. The German government has also been criticized for its lack of transparency in its handling of the issue, which has led to a number of arrests and convictions. Police officers, for example, have been accused of making false statements to the media, and of failing to report on their own conduct. They also face charges of corruption, fraud and tax evasion, among other crimes. But the Interior Minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, also said he was \"deeply troubled\" by the allegations. He added that he had not been able to find any evidence to support the charges against the officers who had been convicted of crimes, such as attempted murder, attempted rape and attempted robbery. However, he added, \"I don't think there is any reason to believe that this is the case in any other country. I think it is a matter of public opinion that we need to be more transparent and transparent about what we are doing in this country and what is going on in other countries. We are not going to tolerate this kind of behavior. It is not acceptable to me to say that I am a victim of this type of behaviour. That's not what I want to talk about, but it's something I have to think about. There is no justification for such a thing. What do you think is acceptable? Is it acceptable for a police officer to commit a crime? Do you agree with me on that? If so, then let me tell you that you have a right to know what you're doing. If you are a policeman, you should know that. You should be aware that there are people who are committing crimes against you and you shouldn't be allowed to do it. And that is why we must be very careful about this, because we should not be doing this. This is what the Germans are going through right now. Let's face it, we're not talking about the past year and the previous year was a very difficult year for us. So, let's be clear: We're dealing with the current situation, not the present situation. For the first time since 2005, there's been an increase in violent crime and a rise in homicides. Now, that's a problem that has become a big problem for law enforcement agencies, too. When you look at the statistics, it seems that the numbers are much higher than they were in 2005 and 2006 when there were more than a couple of homicides in that year. Then there was the fact that many of these crimes were committed by people with a criminal record, like Heidi Klum, who was murdered by a member of a gang, or someone with ties to organized crime. Since then, this problem has only increased, as well as the amount of violence that took place in different parts of Germany. These crimes have become more and more widespread. As a result, more people are being murdered every day. A new law is being put in place to prevent this from happening again and again. At the same time, a new criminal code will be put into place. Law enforcement officers are also being brought in to enforce the law, so that means they will have an obligation to protect the rights of law-abiding citizens who have no choice but to cooperate and cooperate with police, especially those who do not have the means to carry out their duties. How can we do this? What are we doing? The police are working to make sure that all of us are protected from the consequences of our actions? That is something we can't do, right? I'm not sure what will happen to our officers. Right now, I can only think of it as an example of something that can be done. Why is this happening? How do we not do something about it? In the last year we've had to take a step back? We've seen a change in how we react to this situation and we'll see how quickly we get to that point. One thing is for sure, if we take this step forward: we will continue to work on this issue. No one is doing anything to ensure that our citizens are getting a fair chance to get a better chance of being protected. On the other hand, they should also be given the opportunity to speak up and do what they can do in order to help the people of their communities. Otherwise,"

The Social Democrats (SPD) and Christian Democrats (CDU) have ruled the small northern city-state of Bremen in a coalition for the past 12 years. But after winning state elections on Sunday with 36.8 percent, the SPD is now flirting with the idea of ditching their previous coalition partners to rule together with the Greens, who made their best-ever showing in a German state poll with 16.4 percent. Bremen's state SPD leadership is to hold talks later on Wednesday with the CDU, which polled 25.7 percent. After an SPD meeting in Bremen, Mayor Jens B\u00f6hrnsen made the first signal he could be favoring the Greens. He said that during the campaign he had deliberately abstained from mentioning the possibility of a renewed CDU coalition because \"after 12 years it shouldn't automatically be continued.\" Bremen's acting head of government and CDU member Thomas R\u00f6wekamp, however, warned against an SPD-Green coalition. \"The majority of people don't want a red-green experiment, but a continuation of the grand coalition,\" he said. Both the SPD and CDU conceded heavy losses in the election, which showed a swing towards the Greens and the Left Party, which scored an unexpected 8.4 percent to win representation in a western German state legislature for the first time in its brief history. Block reforms? If Bremen's SPD decide in favor of the Greens, this would affect the ability of Chancellor Angela Merkel's grand coalition of CDU and SPD to push ahead with reforms requiring constitutional changes, such as stage two of Germany's urgently needed federalism reform. The federal Bundesrat, which is made up of state cabinet members, has to approve the majority of legislative bills passed by the lower chamber, the Bundestag, before they become law. Also, any proposed constitutional changes require two-thirds of all votes in order to be passed by the Bundesrat. The CDU and SPD currently hold 47 of the Bundesrat's 69 seats, which is one seat more than the necessary two-thirds majority. But without Bremen, the number held by the grand coalition would fall to 44 seats, meaning they would need the cooperation of one of the small opposition parties for any constitutional changes. Internal strife Earlier in the week, Chancellor Merkel called for unity within her ruling left-right coalition after the losses in Bremen set the stage for more infighting between the two parties. Merkel also warned the SPD against moving to the left after it lost some five percent points. The chancellor said the outcome showed the SPD had made a mistake by attacking the coalition and campaigning on promises of a minimum wage, which she believes will hamper efforts to fight unemployment of just under 10 percent. \"The result showed that this strategy did not pay off,\" Merkel told a press conference.",
        "generated_story": "German Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition of Social Democrats and CDU could block reforms in the Bundestag on Wednesday. The SPD, the Left Party and the Greens are expected to form a coalition government in Germany's lower house of parliament, which will be led by Jens B\u00f6hrnsen and Thomas R\u00f6wekamp. Both parties have pledged to work together on a number of issues, including economic and social reforms. But they are unlikely to be able to agree on the details of the new government, as the SPD and Greens have said they want to avoid a repeat of last year's failed coalition. \"We are going to have to find a way to make sure that we don't get into a situation where we are unable to pass any reforms,\" said the Social Democrat party's head of state, Hans-Joachim Gauck, in an interview with the German newspaper Bild am SonntagsZeitung (Reuters) - The Social Democratic Party (SPD) said on Sunday that it would be \"very difficult\" to reach a deal on economic reforms that would allow it to move forward with its plans for the economy. It also said it was unlikely that the government would reach an agreement on social and environmental reforms, such as tax cuts, that could be reached with a compromise between the two parties. Merkel, who has been in power for 12 years, has said she wants to \"work with all the people\" in order to get the country back on track. On Wednesday, she announced that she would not seek a new coalition with her conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party. She said her party would work with other parties, but she did not rule out the possibility of a \"grand coalition\" between her conservatives and SPD-Green. Her party, however, is not in a position to do so, and she has not ruled out a possible deal with Merkel. In the past, Merkel has repeatedly called for a change of government and promised to push through a series of reforms aimed at making Germany a better place to live, work and play. This time, though, it's not clear whether she will agree to such a move. For the first time since she took office in 2013, her coalition partners have agreed to take a hard line on tax and spending cuts. That's a big change from the previous coalition, when she was chancellor of Bavaria from 2011 to 2015. And it will not be easy for her to stick to her plan, despite the fact that her own party is a Christian Democrat and that of her sister, Christian Democrats (CSD), which she is also a member of. If she does not get a majority in parliament she could have a tough time in her first term as chancellor. However, there is no chance of that happening, because her government is likely to stay in office for at least 12 more years. Even if she were to win the next election, Chancellor Merkel would have no choice but to accept the results of Sunday's parliamentary elections, a poll showed. A poll on Monday showed that more than a third of voters were undecided on whether or not to vote for an extension of Merkel to the chancellor's term. Many of those who voted for Merkel were against the extension, while others said that they would vote against it. Some of them were in favor of further austerity measures. Others said there was a chance that Merkel might be forced to give up on her plans to reduce taxes and increase spending on public services. They said this was not the case, adding that \"the chancellor has a lot to say about the future of Germany.\" The poll also showed a strong opposition to tax reform, saying that tax increases were the main reason behind the increase in public spending. What's more, many people are not convinced that this is the reason for that is because the Chancellor is so unpopular with many voters who support her policies. There's also the question of how much she can spend on education and health care. How can she do that? And what is she doing about it? What is her position on these issues? She has already been criticized for not doing enough to protect the interests of people who are struggling with poverty, unemployment and inequality. So far, no one has done much to improve the situation in Berlin, where she remains the most unpopular chancellor in recent memory. Only a handful of SPD members have been elected to parliament and a few are still in government. Most of these are in opposition, with only a small minority of lawmakers from both parties backing her for re-election next year. As a result, they will have little chance to change the way she treats people, especially the poor and minorities who have suffered from poor economic growth and poor living conditions. With the election looming, some people have already begun to feel the effects of austerity and austerity. According to a report by the Bundesrat, more people will vote in favour of higher taxes, rather than against them, than the right-wing opposition.

Here's a recipe for it: Ingredients: 1 packet yeast, active dry 1 teaspoon sugar 1 1/2 teaspoon salt 3 cups unbleached flour 1 tablespoon shortening 1 cup water (49 to 54 C / 120 to 130 F) 6 slices bacon -- diced 2 medium onions -- sliced 1/4 teaspoon cumin 1/2 teaspoon salt Pepper 1 egg yolk 1 cup sour cream Mix the yeast with the sugar, a teaspoon of salt and half a cup of flour. Blend in the shortening and warm water, then beat for two minutes. Add enough flour to make a soft dough, and then knead the dough until smooth and elastic, about five minutes. Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, then cover it and let it rise in a warm place for 30 minutes. Pat the dough into a lightly greased 12-inch pizza pan or onto a lightly greased baking sheet. Press up the edges to make a slight rim. Fry the bacon until crisp and drain it on absorbent paper. Add onions to the bacon grease, and cook slowly until tender, but not brown. Sprinkle the onions, bacon, cumin, half a teaspoon of salt and pepper over the dough. Bake the cake at 204 C (400 F) for 20 minutes. Blend the egg yolk and sour cream and pour the mixture over the Zwiebelkuchen. Bake it for another 10 to 15 minutes, until the cake is golden brown and the sour cream has set. Serve warm or at room temperature with white wine.",
        "generated_story": "A German Wine Companion to the Fall Wine Season Onion Cake is a German wine companion for the fall wine season. It's a Bavarian wine that has become synonymous with autumn wine. Onion cake is one of the most sought-after wines in Germany, and it's not just because it tastes so good. There's also the fact that it has a lot of wine in it, which is why the wine is so popular. But it is also because of its rich, rich flavor. \"It's the best wine I've ever tasted,\" says the author, who has spent more than 20 years in the vineyard than any other wine bar in Europe. The best part is that there's no shortage of good wine to choose from, as well as a variety of wines that are well-known for their rich flavors and rich aromas. For example, onion cake has been a favorite of mine since I was a child, but I'm not sure if I'll be able to enjoy it as much as I used to. In fact, I don't think I will, because I think that's what I want to do with my life. I'd like to make it even better by making more wine, so that I can enjoy my wine with friends and family. And I would love to have the opportunity to try some of my favorite wines, like this one from Bavaria, Austria, Italy, France, Spain, Germany and Spain. That would be a great way to spend a summer vacation and spend some time with family and friends. However, it would also be an opportunity for me to get to know my family more, especially my husband. He's an avid wine drinker and a wine lover and he's always looking for ways to improve his wine taste. This year, however, he is looking forward to making his own wine and enjoying it with his wife and two young children. After all, this is the first year of his marriage. His wife is German and his children are German-born. They've been married for 30 years and have two grown children, a son and three daughters. When he was born, his father was German. Now he lives in Berlin, where he grew up in a small German town and has worked his way up through the German language to become a fluent German speaker in English and French. Since then, the family has traveled to Germany to visit his parents and to see his mother and step-grandmother. On the other hand, they've had a very difficult time in their marriage, with their first marriage ending in divorce and their second child having to go through a divorce. One of their children is now married and they're expecting a baby. Their first child is due to be born next year and the second will have to live with them for a long time before they can have their own child. So, we're hoping that they'll have a happy ending to their relationship with him. We'll see how it goes with the new baby and we'll find out what the future holds for them when the baby is born. What do you think will happen to him when he grows up? \"He's going to grow up?\" he asks, adding that he hopes he'll get a job at some point in his life, \"I hope he doesn't have any more children.\" He also hopes that the children will be well enough to take care of themselves, too, since he has no idea what to expect from their father. If he does, that will give him a chance to develop a new career in wine making. You can bet he won't be the only one who knows what he can do for himself. Or, you can ask him to help him, if he wants to learn how to cook and make a career out of it. As long as he keeps his family happy, then you'll know what's in store for him - and I hope that we can make him happy - because he knows how much he appreciates what we've done for us. Just ask his mom and grandpa, of course, when we get married. How will he react to that? I doubt he'd be happy to hear that, right? We can't wait until he gets married - but we have no doubt about that. A big part of me thinks he will get the job done and then we will see him settle down and enjoy the rest of our life.\" The family is very happy that his daughter is getting married to a wonderful man - a man with a big family - that is, at least until the day he graduates from the University of Heidelberg, in which he graduated from high school. With the addition of a wife, she's already married again. She's very excited about the prospect of raising a family, though. Her husband is an excellent cook. Both of them are very good at making a good job of being a father and raising his son. (Reuters, AFP, Reuters, AP, dpa) (AFP/Reuters) \"We're really happy with our family,\" she tells me.\" She'll"

The move shows Madrid's support of US efforts to close the controversial prison. Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said the first inmate from the US prison at Guantanamo Bay had arrived in his country. Madrid has agreed to host five prisoners, the largest commitment yet from a European country. Citing privacy concerns, Rubalcaba refused to give the prisoner's name or any identifying information, except to say he was a Palestinian. The new arrival will be able to work and move around Spain as he wishes, but will not be able to leave the country. \"He is a Palestinian, he has already arrived in our country. We do not want to give out further details because we want everyone who comes to live in our country to be able to live their lives normally,\" he told a news conference.

The prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, was set up at a US navy base by former President George W. Bush in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos has urged other European countries \"to do their utmost\" to take in former Guantanamo detainees as well. Third countries are being asked to take in detainees who are cleared of any charges, but who can't be sent back to their homelands for fear of persecution. Obama had said he would close the prison by January 22, 2010, yet the deadline passed unmet.

The prisoners are expected to be transferred to a new facility in the southern Spanish city of Valencia, where they will be housed for the rest of their lives. According to Interior Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba, all five of them have been sent to the new prison, which is located on the outskirts of Madrid. \"We are very happy to have them here,\" he told AFP news agency, adding that the prisoners would be able to return to their families in a couple of weeks. At the same time, they would also have the opportunity to receive medical treatment at a different facility, he said. He added that he was \"very pleased\" with the treatment they had received at the prison. In a statement, President Barack Obama said: \"I am very pleased that we have received the first batch of prisoners who have come to Spain. We will continue to work with them to ensure that they are well cared for and that their medical care is available to them. I am also very grateful for their continued care and support for our country and the people of this country.\" The detainees are being housed at an undisclosed location in southern Spain, near the border with Israel. They will have to undergo medical and psychological treatment before they can be allowed to leave the country. There will also be a chance to meet with their parents, who are currently in their final years of life, and to see their children. This could be the beginning of a long-term relationship between the U.S. and Spain that will last for at least a few more years. It is not yet clear how long the detainees will stay in Guantanamo, but it is likely to last until the end of next year, when they'll be released from their current conditions, according to an official statement released by the interior ministry. A spokesman for President Obama, Miguel Angel Moratinos, said in an interview with AFP that \"the first group of detainees has been released.\" \"They are going to stay here for a very long time,\" the spokesman said, referring to \"at least until they get out of Guantanamo.\" He did not specify when the release would take place, however, saying that it could take up to two years to reach a certain point. On January 22, 2010, it was announced that five more prisoners had arrived at Guantanamo. Since then, more than 1,000 people have died there. That number has risen to over 2,500, as well as the number of Palestinian prisoners. Most of those who were released in 2010 are still in detention. Many of these are in solitary confinement, while others are released on bail. Some are on parole. Others are awaiting their release from prison after serving their sentences for crimes committed during the war in Iraq and Afghanistan. More than a year after the attacks, some have fled to other countries, including the United States, to escape the violence in Syria and Iraq. Other prisoners have also been freed from detention in recent months. Among them are a former Guantanamo detainee, Josep Maria Rodriguez, a convicted war criminal who was sentenced to life in prison for war crimes in 2006. Rodriguez was released last year for his alleged role in ordering the bombing of an American airliner over the Gaza Strip in September 2001. His wife, Jena, was also freed in 2009. She is now living with her husband and their two children in exile in Germany. Her husband is a lawyer in London. And she has a son who is also a political prisoner. Josef Rodriguez said he had been convicted of terrorism charges in 2002 for helping a Palestinian family escape from a terrorist attack on a US air base in New York City. Jen said the sentence was too lenient for him to serve in his home state of California. But he also said that there was no reason to think that Guantanamo was a place where he could go to get a better life for himself and his family, because he believes that his wife and children would not be free of responsibility for what he has done to his son. Juan Carlos Rodriguez is the only one who has left Guantanamo and is currently serving a life sentence for life.

        "target": "Threat of the Punjabi Taliban is growing Deutsche Welle talks to Pakistani political expert Hasan Askari Rizvi about the growing ties between militants in northwest Pakistan and Punjab province. At least four gunmen disguised in police uniforms raided a hospital in Pakistan's eastern city of Lahore on Monday night, claiming at least five lives. Local officials said the gunmen were trying to free a militant, who was being treated there after being captured during attacks on two mosques last Friday. The police said the gunfight at Jinnah Hospital had lasted around 45 minutes but the gunmen had managed to flee. Friday's twin attacks on the minority Ahmadi community left more than 90 people dead. They were claimed by a group, which identified itself as the Punjabi wing of the Taliban. Deutsche Welle spoke to political expert Hasan Askari Rizvi in Lahore, where there has been a wave of violence in recent days. DW: Who are the \"Punjabi Taliban\"? It is a kind of a pejorative term, which includes a host of groups. Initially in Punjab, you had two types of militancy: One, the groups that focussed mainly on Indian-administered Kashmir and there were other types of groups that focussed on Pakistan. Those were the sectarian groups targeting mainly the Shias, and there were some Shia groups targeting the Sunni leadership. Over the years a lot of factions have broken away from these groups and these small entities are functioning more or less autonomously. They have trainings in the tribal areas because these are secured for them and certain parts are not under Pakistani control so these groups go there. They operate with the Pakistani Taliban based in tribal areas against the Pakistani troops in the region. They also have an autonomous agenda, which they pursue in Punjab, as they have been doing in the past days. These groups also play host or are a kind of a local link to Taliban suicide bombers who come into the main part of Pakistan from the tribal areas (let's say to Punjab). If they have to target some place, they park themselves with these Punjab groups, and then do it. All these factions and groups that have broken away from traditional militant groups and are functioning in close collaboration with tribal area Taliban are often described as the \"Punjabi Taliban\". Why do you think these militants are resurfacing now? They have always existed here and there and generally the trend is that they undertake a couple of operations, one after the other. Then the government comes in and takes action against them. Then they just disappear or become sleeping groups and suddenly after a couple of months they resurface. That's the standard pattern. The last major incident in Lahore was in the first week of March. Then there was nothing in April and now towards the end of May you have this kind of incident. Do you think the government should have taken stronger action against them? They should have but the problem is that the Punjab government has a kind of ambiguous approach and I think there is some element of denial within the leadership also. These groups also have some sympathy if not support at the societal level and that makes it difficult for the government to go against them openly. They need to work together and to emphasise to the people that they are terrorists. They use different names and Islam but actually their agenda is terrorism. Somehow the government of Punjab has been rather confused and ambiguous regarding these groups. Interview: Disha Uppal Editor: Anne Thomas",
        "generated_story": "Punjabi Taliban in northwest Pakistan growing The Pakistani Taliban is growing in the northwest, according to a report by the German news agency Deutsche Welle (DW) on Friday. The Taliban are gaining strength in northwestern Pakistan, which is home to the country's largest Muslim population. In the first week of March, the Taliban were able to gain a foothold in Punjab province, where they had been fighting for months against the Indian-administered Pakistani government for control of the state of Punjab. At the same time, they were also trying to establish a presence in Pakistan's northwestern province of Jammu and Kashmir (JK), where the Pakistani army has been battling the militants for several months. Last week, it was reported that the group was planning to take over the government-owned Jinnah Hospital in Lahore. It was not immediately clear if this was the case, but it is believed that it could be. \"The Taliban have been gaining momentum in recent days,\" said DW's Disha Uppal, who is a researcher at the University of Peshawar, adding that \"the Taliban will continue to grow in strength and strength.\" \"It's a very dangerous situation,\" she said. According to DW, a number of Taliban fighters have already been killed by Pakistani security forces since the beginning of April, when they tried to enter the hospital in a suicide bomber's suicide attack, killing at least five people and wounding dozens more. They are also believed to be planning attacks on the police and army, as well as other security personnel, and are preparing for a possible attack on a police station in Poonch, Punjab state, on April 1. This is the second time in as many months that a Taliban attack has taken place in JK. On Friday, one of them, Ahmadi Rizvi, was shot dead by a Pakistani police officer during a raid on his house. He was also wounded in an encounter with an Indian soldier. A Pakistani military spokesman told DW: \"We are not going to allow this to happen again. We will not allow any further attacks.\" The attack came after a series of attacks in which Pakistani soldiers were killed and hundreds of civilians were injured in clashes between Pakistani and Indian troops. Police said the attack was being carried out by an unknown assailant who was wearing a bullet-proof vest and carrying a large amount of ammunition. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attacks, DW reported, citing a senior Pakistani intelligence official. However, there was a strong sense of hope that Pakistan would act quickly to contain the threat of a new Taliban insurgency. As a result, many of its members have fled to Pakistan and have returned to their home country of Pakistan to seek refuge in India. Many of their supporters are from the south, while others have come from other parts of India and Pakistan. Some of these groups have also been active in Kashmir. One such group is known as the \"Pakistan Taliban\" and is based in Karachi. Another group, called the Pakistan Taliban, is fighting in northern Punjab, in southern Punjab and in eastern Punjab provinces. These groups are known to carry out attacks from across the border into India, with the aim of gaining control over areas of Kashmir and the disputed Kashmir region. Their main aim is to disrupt the peace process between the two countries. For the past few months, Pakistan has seen a rise in Taliban attacks and a resurgence in sectarian violence, particularly in areas where Shia and Sunni militancy have taken hold. But the situation has also become increasingly tense in some areas, such as Kashmir where there are large numbers of Shiites and Sunnis living in rural areas. That has led to an increase in violence and sectarian tensions between Sunni and Shia militaries. And it's not just the Shia community that is at risk, too. Pakistan is also facing a growing threat from a resurgent Sunni insurgency that has become a major threat to its own security and stability. Experts say that this is not a good sign for Pakistan as it has a long-term security situation, because it means it will be difficult to maintain a stable security presence there for long periods of time. So far, however, this threat has not been seen as a serious one, despite the presence of thousands of Pakistani troops and police officers. Most of those who have left the area have not returned, experts say, due to fears that they may be forced to return to India to fight for their own safety and security. Meanwhile, more than a dozen people have died in Pakistani jails. More than 1,000 people are being killed every day since last week's attacks. Hundreds of people were arrested in connection with a deadly attack in Quetta in April. Thousands of policemen were reportedly killed in that attack. Dozens of police were deployed across Pakistan on Monday and Tuesday. Authorities have arrested dozens of suspected militants who are suspected of being involved in this incident, including a Shia militant who has attacked a military base in Balochistan. Officials have said they are working to find a way to prevent further escalation of violence against Shia Muslims. An army spokesman, Hasan Askari R"

        "target": "Party leaders call for increased wages in growing German economy Chancellor Angela Merkel and other top officials have called for upticks in Germany's economy to trickle down to workers in the form of higher pay. But a leading think tank has warned against giving raises too soon. Germany's foreign minister and deputy chancellor, Guido Westerwelle, has added his support to comments made by Economics Minster Rainer Bruederle about increased wages for German workers. \"When the economy grows and this growth is substantial and sustainable, then the benefits of this upswing should be felt by the people who worked so hard for it,\" Westerwelle told the Hamburger Abendblatt newspaper in an interview. Westerwelle heads the free-market liberal FDP, which shares power with Chancellor Merkel's Christian coalition. Earlier this week, Bruederle, also an FDP member, said in light of Germany's currently growing economy, those economic gains should trickle down to employees in the form of higher wages. Merkel, who is also the head of the Christian Democratic Union, supported Bruederle's idea. \"That is something the chancellor sees the same way, letter for letter,\" said Merkel's spokesman, Steffen Seibert. Not so fast Earlier this week, analysts predicted growth of 3.5 percent this year and 2 percent in 2011. Germany's five leading economic think tanks also predicted that the number of unemployed would fall below 3 million next year, the lowest level since 1992. Despite the current rosy outlook for the German economy, not everyone is convinced that a growing economy should inevitably lead to higher wages. The president of the German Institute for Economic Research, Klaus Zimmermann, warned against reacting too quickly. \"I can't support the idea of a general wage increase, I think it is too dangerous,\" Zimmermann said in an interview with the Handelsblatt newspaper. Zimmermann wasn't opposed to the idea of raising wages, but said he was against across-the-board increases for all sectors and pointed out that not every industry is benefitting the same from the growing economy. \"We can't forget that the German economy did not resort to mass lay-offs when it wasn't going so well last year,\" Zimmermann said. Raising wages in some branches could be a good idea, Zimmermann said, as that would make those branches more attractive option to potential workers from outside of Germany.

        "generated_story": "Chancellor Angela Merkel's Deputy Chancellor, Klaus Zimmermann, is against a general wage hike for German workers. The deputy chancellor, Guido Westerwelle, has called for an increase in Germany's minimum wage to be raised to $7.25 an hour by the end of the year. \"We are not going to raise the wage,\" he told the newspaper Hamburger Abendblatt in an interview published on Thursday. He did not say whether he was against the increase, but he said that it was \"not the right thing to do.\" \"I am not against it at all. I am opposed to it. It is not something that I would want to see in the future,\" said the FDP deputy general secretary for economic research, Rainer Bruederle, who heads the German Institute for Economic Research (IER) in Berlin. In the past, he has been a strong critic of higher wages, saying that they are too high for the average German wage. But in 2011, when the economy was booming, the government was able to make up for it by raising wages. Now, however, it's not so easy to convince people to pay more than the current wage, which is currently set at around $6 per hour. According to the IER, this would be the first time in German history that a German government has raised the minimum hourly wage for a single worker. This is the second year in a row that the chancellor has refused to negotiate a wage increase. On the other hand, she has said she is open to a higher wage if she wants to, and that she would like to increase it further. She has also called on the Social Democratic Party (SPD) to step down from its position as head of state and to take up the position of deputy economy minister. Her spokesman, Christian Democratic Union (CDU), said on Friday that \"the chancellor's position is that we should not raise wages at the same time as we are doing the job.\" The CDU's Social Democrats (FDP) have been the main opposition party in parliament for several years. They are the only party that has ever voted in favor of raising the maximum wage by 10 percent, while the Greens have voted against raising it, according to an analysis by German business daily Handelsblatten (Dpa) and the left-wing newspaper \"Die Welt\" (AFP) (Reuters, dpa, AP) \"The chancellor is in no position to change her position on wage increases,\" the paper said, adding that her party would continue to push for higher minimum wages for all workers, including those who are already working full-time, as long as they don't have to work for less than a year to earn a living wage in order to get a job. However, they will not be forced to accept higher pay for their own party's candidates. For example, if they do not have a candidate for chancellor in next year's general election, there will be no chance of them getting elected. That's because they have already been elected to parliament. If they were to win the election in 2012, their chances of winning a majority of seats in that election would likely be much higher than they currently are. There is also the possibility of a change of government in 2013, after the 2015 election. And there is a chance that this year, Merkel could be even more likely to become Chancellor of Germany than she was in 1992 when she first took office, with her first term as Chancellor in office in 1993. Merkel is expected to seek a second term in 2015, despite the fact that many of her cabinet members are still in opposition to her conservative coalition government. Many of those in her coalition are in favour of increasing wage hikes, such as her predecessor, Helmand Seibert, a former finance minister from the conservative Social Democrat party (SDP), who was a member of parliament from 1992 to 2011. Last year she voted to leave the coalition. Since then, her main challenger, conservative Christian Democrat Party leader Steffen Seibt has led the party to victory in elections in which she won the most votes in both the SPD and Greens, both of which are currently in coalition with the center-left coalition partners. Both parties have also been accused of being too conservative in their approach to economic policy. Some of these accusations are based on a number of factors. Among them: the lack of economic growth in recent years, unemployment, inequality and inequality. Unemployment is high in many parts of Europe, especially among young people, where the unemployment rate is at a record low of 7.5 percent and unemployment is up to 8.6 percent. At the very least, that could make it difficult for her to hold on to power, even though she still has the support of many voters who support her right-leaning coalition partner, Chancellor Helle Bundestag, to form a minority government and which has a long-term majority in Congress. German Chancellor Klaus Zuvela has repeatedly said he would not support a government that would have no longer be able"

Freiburg scored an extra time goal to squeak out a victory against Hoffenheim. Bayern Munich cruised to a 3-0 victory at home against Bavarian rival FC Nuremberg on Sunday, closing the German soccer tables for the weekend. Striker Mario Gomez got things going in the 10th minute for Bayern and also scored the final goal in the 75th minute off a corner kick from Franck Ribery. Ribery came on as a substitute five minutes earlier, making his first appearance for the team since injuring his ankle in September. Near the end of the match, Gomez had an opportunity for his third goal on a penalty kicked but missed. Thirty points at break Phillipp Lahm successfully converted a penalty kick in the 57th minute to round out the scoring for Bayern. The victory for Bayern moved them into sixth place in the table with 19 points and has continued a slow shift in momentum following a rough start to the season. Bayern coach Louis van Gaal said after the game he hoped his team would have 30 points by the end of the first half of the season in five more matches. Cisse saves win for Freiburg In Sunday's other Bundesliga match, Senegal striker Papiss Demba Cisse broke a scoreless deadlock with a goal in the 91st minute to give Freiburg a 1-0 win over Hoffenheim. Cisse has now scored 10 goals in 12 games and is currently the Bundesliga's second highest scorer. The win moves Freiburg into fourth place in the table with 21 points, one ahead of Frankfurt in fourth and three behind Bayer Leverkusen and Mainz, in second and third place, respectively. Nuremberg drop to 10th place with 18 points at the end of a very tight middle group. Just three points separate Nuremburg from Freiburg. Hoffenheim also have 18 points but are two places ahead of Nuremberg in eighth place on goal difference. Author: Matt Zuvela (dpa, sid) Editor: Sean Sinico",
        "generated_story": "Bayern Munich 3-0 Hoffenheim: Papiss Demba Cisse seals Bundesliga win for Bayern Munich in the last minute of the Bundesliga weekend. The German champions have won their last three Bundesliga games in a row, beating Mainz and Leverkusen on Sunday. In the first half of their Bundesliga campaign, they were beaten by a Bayern side that had won just once in seven league games. After a poor start to the season, the German side came out on top in their opening two matches, with the visitors scoring twice in each of those. Bayern, however, were unable to find a way out of a difficult situation. They had to settle for a 1-1 draw at home to Frankfurt, where they have been struggling for some time. German coach Franz Beckenbauer's side, who have struggled for form in recent weeks, came back from a goal down to take a 2-2 draw away from home. \"It was a very difficult game for us,\" said Bayern midfielder Mario Gomez, whose side had lost their previous two Bundesliga matches. Germany's top scorer, Franck Ribery, scored the only goal in his first Bundesliga appearance since September, when his side were eliminated from the Champions League group stage by Bayern. Bundesliga leaders Bayern are unbeaten in 10 league matches so far this season. On the other hand, their only loss came in September when they lost to Bayern at the Allianz Arena in Munich. For the second time in as many games, Bayern have not lost a game since the end of September. With the exception of one game in which they conceded three goals, Frankfurt have managed to win just one of them, and that was on Saturday. That was after a 10th minute penalty, which was awarded to a German defender who had been sent off for an offside charge. But Bayern were able to hold on to their lead after the break, thanks in large part to German goalkeeper Philipp Lahm's fine finish. Losing to Hoffenerheim on the weekend is a big blow for the Bavarian club, but it is also a huge boost for their chances of getting back into the top four. Last season's Bundesliga champions Bayern won the league with a 4-3 aggregate win over Hoffensheim, a win that would have given them a chance to qualify for next year's World Cup in Russia. However, it was not enough to prevent the Germans from reaching the quarter-finals, as they had already been eliminated by the hosts in Germany. Frankfurt are currently fourth, ahead of Schalke and Bayern with two games to play. A win would be a major step up from their first-half defeat to Bayer, while Bayern would still have to make up for lost points against the Wolfsburg side. It would also be an important step for them to get back on track, given that they are the defending champions and have a good chance of winning the title in October. At the same time, there is still a lot of work to be done to strengthen their squad and improve their position in terms of attacking play, especially if they can continue to improve on their recent form. There is no doubt that Bayern will be looking to build on a strong start this year. And that is the main reason for that. Despite the fact that it has been a long time since they won a Bundesliga title, this is not an easy season for German football's biggest club. As a result, many of Bayern's fans are already looking forward to seeing their team improve. This is because they want to see the best of Germany, not the worst of it, because it's a team that has already won three consecutive Bundesliga titles. Frank Lampard's men are still in second place and are in third place in all competitions. (AP, AFP, dpa) \"We are not going to let this happen again. We will not allow this to happen, we will make sure that we don't let it happen,\" says former Bayern defender Matt Zuvela, now the head coach of FC Nuremberg, in an interview with German newspaper Der Spiegel. He added: \"I think we can do better than this. If we do that, then we'll be better. I think that's the most important thing to do. You can't be too optimistic about the future of our team, you can be confident that the team will get the job done.\" The Bundesliga's best team is already in position to reach the playoffs, according to Bundesliga expert Sean Sinico (dpa, AP) and coach Matthijs Lagerweier (DPA) who has overseen the development of young players. More than a year ago, he said he was confident of his team's ability to compete in this league, that he could be the right man to help them win the championship. Now, though, his expectations are high. His team has a few things in mind. One thing is for sure: He's not too worried about this weekend's match against Bayern: They have already done a great job in training, too. So far from"

        "target": "Teabag filter cleans water with nanotechnology A new water filter developed in South Africa could provide millions of people with clean drinking water. The filter, about the size and shape of a teabag, would be inexpensive, easy to distribute and simple to use. Marelize Botes is conducting a final set of tests on a new type of diminutive water filter before industrial production can begin. The microbiologist pours water from a plastic bottle though a high-tech, teabag-sized filter before analyzing it in her in her laboratory at the University of Stellenbosch in South Africa. \"The filter is much cheaper than bottled water as well as any other filter on the market,\" she told Deutsche Welle. Instead of being filled with black or green tea, the bag contains active carbon granules and is made from nanofibers treated with biocide, which kills bacteria rather than simply filtering them from the water. Nanotech for pennies \"This project takes nanotechnology to the poorest of the poor people who live in this world, and it will make a difference in their lives,\" said Eugen Cloete, who in addition to inventing the filter is dean of the faculty of science at Stellenbosch University and chair of Stellenbosch University's Water Institute. With some 300 million people in Africa - and over a billion worldwide - living without access to clean drinking water, the need for such a filter is huge. When in mass production, the developers said they expect the teabag to cost just a few South African cents (under half a US cent and under a third of a euro cent). In addition to being inexpensive, Botes said, the filter is also easy to distribute to rural area and simple to use as it can be place in an adapter that fits on nearly any regular-sized plastic bottle. Each filter can clean one liter (one quart) of the most polluted water to the point where it is completely safe to drink. Once used, the filter can be disposed of and is biodegradable. African countries, led by Somalia, Mauritania and Sudan, were ranked to have the most vulnerable water supplies, according to a June report by UK-based risk consultancy firm Maplecroft. Decentralized use The filter's small size and light weight make it ideal for rural areas where other means of filtration do not exist, Cloete said. \"It is simply impossible to build purification infrastructure at every polluted stream,\" Cloete said. \"So we have to take the solution to the people. The water is cleaned right then and there when you drink from the bottle.\" The filter is now undergoing testing by the South African Bureau of Standards, after which Cloete and his team hope it can be rolled out to the United Nations and non-governmental organizations that have expressed interest in it by the end of the year. The project grew out of research into larger filters, according to Cloete. \"We were busy developing filters for larger applications, but when you do the tests in the labatory you do the tests on a much smaller scale,\" he said. \"The results we were getting on a smaller amount of water promoted me to think about a smaller application.\" Author: Joerg Poppendieck, Sean Sinico Editor: Anke Rasper",
        "generated_story": "A Teabag-sized water filter for decentralized drinking in Africa is being developed in the South African capital of Stellenbosch. It is the first of its kind in South Africa and is designed to reduce the amount of water that is wasted by people. The project is part of a larger effort to improve water quality in rural areas of the country, and it is expected to be completed by the end of June. According to the project's website, it will be able to provide drinking water to more than 1.5 million people in a total of 2.4 million square kilometers (1.6 million sq. kilometers) by 2020. Under half a third of that US cent, the system will have a capacity of just a few hundred litres a day, according to a report from the United Nations' Water Institute in Johannesburg. \"This is a very important step in reducing the number of people who are forced to drink water,\" said co-author Marelize Botes, adding that it would be a \"huge step forward\" in terms of reducing waste water use. He added that the new system would also allow people to have access to clean water at a lower cost than the current system, which has been in use since the 1970s. In addition to water, water is also available to people living in low-income areas, such as the Cape Town area, where the university is located. This is an example of how the water system can be adapted to meet the needs of those who live in poverty and are unable to afford to pay a living wage. For example, there is no provision for a water treatment system for people with chronic diseases. But the government of Cape Verde has made it a priority to develop a system that can provide clean, safe and reliable water for all people, including children and the elderly. At the same time, this system is meant to help people get water from their homes without having to worry about the consequences of their actions. That's why it's called the \"water filter\" because it has the capacity to filter water without the need for filters. And that's not just for the poor, but also for those with poor health. There's also the fact that water supplies are not available in most parts of Africa, so it can't be used for drinking, for example. So, in order to make sure that people have water in their taps, you have to use a filter that has a high-quality filter, like the one used at the U.N. World Health Organization (WHO) said it was looking into the possibility of using a similar system in other African countries, as well as in countries like Kenya, Tanzania and Zambia. However, that would not be enough to prevent people from using it, said the UN's spokesperson, Sean Sinico, who was not authorized to speak on the matter. 'It is not something that we are going to talk about,' he told Deutsche Welle in an interview with the German news agency DW, referring to \"the lack of public awareness about water and sanitation.\" \"It's something we need to look into,\" he said. A water filtration system was developed to ensure that all water was treated properly, he added, \"and that there was no contamination of any kind.\" The system could also be extended to other countries and could even be expanded to include countries with low levels of poverty in some areas. Some countries have already implemented water purification systems that are already in operation, while others have not yet implemented such systems. These systems are still in place, however, they still require a minimum of US cents per litre to reach a certain level of standard water level. One of these systems is currently being tested in Kenya and Tanzania, a country with a population of over a million, says the World Bank's spokesman, Anke Rasper. Maplecroft is one of several countries that have developed water filters for decentralizing water supply, saying that they are the only ones that do not have the ability to do so. They are currently working on a solution that will allow them to achieve this, she said, noting that \"it is very difficult for us to know what is going on in this country. We are working with our partners to find solutions to this problem and we will continue to work with them in our efforts to address this issue,\" she told DW. Meanwhile, Cloete also pointed out that in many cases water pipes are being used to serve people without a proper filter. She said that this could be the case for some countries in particular, especially in areas where water shortages are a problem, because water has become a major problem in places like Africa where people are suffering from acute water scarcity. While it may be difficult to get a clean bill of health, many countries are struggling with water contamination and high water levels in certain regions. Many countries also have problems with their water systems, particularly in cases of drought, drought and floods. Despite the difficulties of dealing with such a large water shortage, these filters have been developed and can only be applied to protect water"

        "target": "For drivers in Germany, 2010 was the most expensive year ever Owning and operating a car in Germany has never been cheap, but it's never been more expensive than in 2010. German auto club ADAC says costs associated with owning a car have risen more than 40 percent since 1995. In 2010, German car owners had to pay a high price for their mobility, according to ADAC, which cited record-high fuel prices as the major cost factor. \"For drivers, 2010 will go down in history as the most costly year ever,\" ADAC said in a statement. High taxes The cost of acquiring and operating a car has risen 42 percent since 1995, compared to a 24 percent increase in the general cost of living. Due to tax increases and higher production costs, fuel prices soared 86 percent over the 15-year period. In 2010 alone, the average price for a liter of super gasoline was more than 1.40 euros ($1.84) - the highest the average price ever. According to ADAC, urban singles spent an average of 3,340 euros on their cars in 2000. Five years later, that figure had jumped to 3,900 euros. By the end of 2010, their expenses reached 4,380 euros, or 1,000 euros more than a decade earlier. Driving is also pricey for four-person families with two cars. According to the automobile club, their annual costs have risen 30 percent over the past 10 years from 5,940 euros to 7,740 euros. Taxes account for the lion's share of gasoline and diesel prices. The German government's mineral oil and value added taxes account for nearly 88 cents of the 1.35-euro price of a liter of fuel. Low toll revenue While the German government reaps more revenue year for year from vehicle-related taxes, income generated by its highway toll for trucks is expected to fall this year for the first time since the haulage charges were introduced in 2005.

        "generated_story": "The Most Costly Year in History For German Auto Clubs In 2010, the most expensive year ever for German auto clubs was 2010. The most costly year in history was the year 2000, when the car club ADAC made a profit of 4.2 billion euros ($4.3 billion) in the first 10 years of its existence. In the past decade, German car clubs have spent a record amount of money on their cars. But in 2010 alone, they spent more than 5,000 euros (3,340 euros) on new models. That's a staggering sum for an industry that has been struggling for years to make up for the losses it has suffered since the financial crisis of the 1990s. It's not just the cost of new cars, it's the fact that the industry has become more and more expensive in recent years. For example, in 2009, a car dealership in Munich, Germany, sold 4,380 euros worth of cars for a total of 7,740 euros, making it the second-richest year on record, behind only 2005, which was a decade earlier. Since then, there have been a number of carmakers who have sold cars in Germany and abroad, but have not been able to keep up with the demand for new vehicles. This year, however, their sales are expected to increase by 3,940 euros. According to a report by the German Automobile Manufacturers Association (ADAC), the average annual sales price of a new car is 1.84 euros per car, up from 2.8 euros in 2005. Last year's car sales were the highest in German history, with sales of 3.35-euros (1.85-billion euros). The car industry is also the largest in Europe, and the biggest in terms of sales, according to the report. \"The car market is a very expensive place to be,\" said John Blau, president and CEO of DAC. He added that \"the average car price is about 1,500 euros a year.\" \"It's an extremely expensive car,\" he said, adding that he was \"very happy\" with his new model. However, he also said that it was not a good year for car-makers, because the prices were so high that they were unable to meet the needs of their customers. After all, most car owners are not the ones who buy the cars they want to buy, so they don't have to pay a lot of extra money to get the best car. And that's because they are the only ones that can afford it. I think that is the case for many car manufacturers, too. If you look at the numbers, you can see that there are many, many more cars than there were in 2000. They are also quite expensive to operate, as well as to maintain, maintain and maintain. There is no doubt that many of them are still in their early 20s and 30s, if not more, than the previous 10. All of these cars were built in a relatively short period of time. A decade ago, car dealerships were not as expensive as they should be. Then there was BMW, Mercedes, Audi, Porsche, BMW and Mercedes-Benz. BMW is one of Germany's most successful car companies, while Mercedes is still the world's best-selling carmaker. Despite the record-breaking sales figures, sales have fallen by a third from 2000 to 2010 (5.4 billion Euros) and BMW's sales fell by 7 percent from 2005 to 2009 (2.7 billion euro). BMW has also suffered from a slump in sales and a drop in profits, though it still has a strong reputation for being a reliable car manufacturer. Volkswagen, Volkswagen and Audi are among the top-earning car brands in North America and Europe. Audi has struggled to catch up on its sales growth since 2000 and is struggling to find a buyer for its latest models, despite the success of recent models that have come on the road to profitability. Meanwhile, VW has had a difficult time finding buyers for their latest model, even as it struggles to attract the right car buyers. Even Volkswagen has not kept up the pace of growth and sales. VW is now in its first decade of expansion, after a 10-year expansion in 2006. German automakers have also had to cut back on production and investment spending in order to stay ahead of that trend. At the same time, auto-industry executives have said they will continue to invest in new products and services to help them stay on top of this trend, especially in areas where they can't compete with other car makers, such as the US, China, France, Italy, Spain and Germany. Germany has seen a sharp decline in car registrations, although the company has continued to expand its presence in China and in other countries, including the United States, Europe and Asia, where it is currently the No. 1 car brand in Asia. Mercedes has made up a large part of all the profits from its German models and has lost a significant chunk of profits. With the addition of 6 percent of"
