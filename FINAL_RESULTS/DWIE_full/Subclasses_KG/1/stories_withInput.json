        "target": "Myanmar Junta Announces Amnesty The junta in Myanmar, also known as Burma, announced an amnesty for more than 7,000 prisoners on Friday, including a few political detainees. The amnesty came on the 21st anniversary of the brutal crackdown of a student-led pro-democracy movement in 1988 and the subsequent seizure of power by the current junta. Journalists were invited to Yangon\u2019s notorious Insein prison on Friday as the authorities released the first batch of prisoners. At least 600 inmates were freed as part of an amnesty for over 7,000 inmates nationwide. Among those released in Yangon were two journalists and 25 political prisoners -- rights groups say this is only 1 percent of the total number of political prisoners held by the military regime. Maung Zarni, a research fellow at the London School of Economics, was \u201chappy for the prisoners who were part of the release\u201d. \u201cThis is a very positive personal development and I am happy they have been released but we need to understand that the junta is using the prisoners\u2019 release as a public relations exercise. It is the 21st anniversary of the military coup so they are using this as a way to pacify political discontent in the country.\u201d Amnesty comes ahead of next year\u2019s polls Myanmar's director general of prisons, Zaw Win, said that the prisoners had been freed so they could take part in next year's polls. In recent months, rights activists, pro-democracy activists and Western countries have cast doubt on the credibility of the planned elections as many key political activists are still in detention. This includes pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who recently began a new 18-month period of house arrest after being found guilty of violating her house arrest order in a widely condemned trial. \u201cThe whole Suu kyi trial is rather unlawful,\u201d said Zarni. \u201cBecause the country does not have an independent judiciary, the judges are just puppets who dance to the tune of the top leadership.\u201d Junta is holding on tightly In 1990, Suu Kyi\u2019s National League for Democracy won Myanmar\u2019s last general election by a landslide. But the junta never recognised the results and has since tightened its control over the country. The 2008 constitution, which was drafted and approved by the military generals, which guarantees the army 25 percent of parliamentary seats, is yet another sign of its desire to consolidate power. \u201cThe military is going to be in power for a long time,\u201d warns Zarni, \u201cbecause they have got control of all the political and economic institutions in the country as well as the entire state of Burma. So with or without elections, this is likely to remain the same.\u201d New Democratic Party formed Meanwhile, a new political party has been formed in Myanmar. The Democratic Party is headed by Mya Than Than Nu, who is the daughter of the country\u2019s first democratically-elected prime minister, U Nu. The party has proposed a power-sharing deal with the military, which would give 40 percent of power to politicians and 60 percent to the military rulers. Harn Yawnghwe, the director of the Brussels-based Euro-Burma Office, doubts the new party stands a chance: \u201cIt is possible that they they would be able to get some votes. But it is not likely, even if they were able to contest the elections freely, that they will be able to form a new government because the military is not prepared to let any party rule.\u201d Democrats should exploit elections He thinks the only way out for the democratic forces in Myanmar is to use the upcoming elections wisely and \u201cto take part in them even if they are against them. I think we have to look at the elections as a process which will lead to democracy -- maybe in few more years.\u201d The National League for Democracy has indicated that it will not take part in the polls unless all Myanmar\u2019s political prisoners, including Suu Kyi, are released. Suu Kyi\u2019s lawyers have filed an appeal against the extension of her house arrest and the court is expected to give a ruling on October 2. But few are hopeful that the junta will amnesty her anytime soon. Author: Disha Uppal Editor: Anne Thomas",
        "generated_story": "Myanmar's New Junta Aung San Suu Kyi is the new leader of the Myanmar Democratic Party (DPR) and the country's new military junta. U Nu, who was arrested in 1988, was sentenced to five years in prison. He was released on bail on October 2. The new government, which has been in power since 1990, is expected to take power in the next few months. It is not clear how long it will be able to hold on to power, but it is likely to be a long time before it has a chance to do so. I am not sure what will happen to my political opponents. They will have to wait and see. If they do not, they will not be allowed to return to their home country, where they have been imprisoned since 1988. Insein prison is one of Myanmar's most dangerous places to live, according to a report by the European Union's Euro-Burma Office (EEO) which is based in Brussels. According to the report, a number of political prisoners are being held in isolation, and some of them have even been convicted of crimes such as murder, rape, torture and attempted murder. Some of these prisoners have also been tortured to death, while others have had their sentences reduced to one year or two years. Many of those who are still in jail have fled to neighboring Myanmar, leaving behind their families, friends, relatives and relatives. There is also the possibility that they could be deported to other countries. This is a possibility, however, because the current government has not yet made a decision on whether or not to release them. \"We are not going to let them go,\" said Harn Yawnghwe, an analyst at the London School of Economics, adding that it would be \"very difficult\" for the government to find a way out of such a situation. On the other hand, there is no doubt that the situation in Myanmar is very different from what it was in 1990 when the military took power. That is, if they were to come back to Myanmar and take charge of their own country. But that is unlikely to happen, as it's not the case in any other country where there are so many people who want to see their country reintegrated into the international community. Ruling party leader Zaw Win has said his party will continue to fight for democracy and human rights. However, he has also said that he would not rule out the idea of returning to his home state of Naypyidaw. His party, the National League for Democracy (NLD), is still seeking to form a government with the help of a new constitution and a constitution that would allow the people to vote for a president who would take over from the former military government. A draft constitution was passed by parliament last year and is currently being drafted into law. Under the constitution, Myanmar has the right to set up an electoral commission to decide who is eligible to run for prime minister and who can be elected to that post. At the same time, it also has to make sure that all political parties have a strong voice in parliament and that candidates are given the opportunity to stand up for what they believe is right and legitimate rights, including the rights of women and minorities. For the first time in decades, I think I can say that my government is doing everything it can to ensure that I have the support of my people, not just the ruling party. And I believe that this is something that can only be achieved through the rule of law and not through a military coup. So far, that's exactly what has happened in my country in recent years, at least. Mya Than Than Nu's party has made it clear that she has no intention of leaving. She has promised to continue the process of re-organizing the party's ranks in order to achieve that goal."

        "target": "US duo shares Nobel Prize for Economics US researcher Elinor Ostrom is the first woman to win the Nobel prize for economics since it was created in 1968. She will share the prestigious award with US compatriot Oliver Williamson. The jury from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said the Americans' research had shown how \"economic analysis can shed light on most forms of social organization.\" Ostrom, a professor at Indiana University, was honored for her \"analysis of economic governance,\" especially in relation to the management of common property or property under common control. The political scientist's work challenges the widely accepted belief that common property is poorly managed and should be either regulated by central authorities or privatized, it added. She carried out numerous studies showing how self-organization and local-level management work to keep common resources viable. Her studies included both natural resources, such as forests, and artificial structures, for example police forces. Ostrom told Swedish television that she felt \"great surprise and appreciation\" and was \"in shock\" about being the first woman to win the prize. The pros and cons of big firms In his work, co-prizewinner Oliver Williamson, of University of California, Berkeley, examines why large corporations tend to arise - and why they do not - based on the cost and complexity of transactions, according to the Nobel committee. \"He has taught us to regard markets, firms, associations, agencies, and even households from the perspective of their contribution to the resolution of conflict,\" the jury said. Williamson authored 'The Economic Institutions of Capitalism' in 1975, a landmark text of the 'new institutional economics' movement that questioned the idea of firms as simple profit-making machines. Last but not least The Nobel prize for economics is the only Nobel award that was not created by the will of Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel in 1896. It was actually founded by the Swedish central bank, the Sverige Riksbank, to celebrate its tri-centenary a year earlier. It was awarded for the first time in 1969 under its official name: the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel. But although it was the last \"Nobel prize\" to be created and the last to be announced each year, the prize is not a poor relation in monetary terms. Winners of the awards for peace, literature, medicine, physiology, chemistry and physics all receive 10 million Swedish crowns (969,000 euros). A good year for women This year was a record year for women laureates. German-Romanian writer Herta Mueller won the Nobel Prize for Literature. Australian-American Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider of the United States were awarded the prize for medicine. And Ada Yonath of Israel was one of three scientists recognized for her work in chemistry. Americans more or less swept the board this year. Nine of the 11 laureates were US citizens. The most prominent of those was US President Barack Obama, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for his \"extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples.\" jg/AFP/dpa/Reuters Editor: Sam Edmonds",
        "generated_story": "The Nobel Prize for Economic Sciences has been awarded to the first woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize. Elinor Ostrom won the prize in 1968 for her work in economics. The prize was presented to her by the Swedish central bank, Sverige Riksbank, in a ceremony held at the Stockholm University in the summer of 1969. She received the award for the most important work of her lifetime, \"The Economic Institutions of Capitalism\" (EITC), the country's most prestigious economic research institute. It is the second time that a woman has won a Nobel prize for economic studies, after the winner of the 1968 Nobel Literature Prize, Elina Ostr, who won in 1967. \"It's a great honor to receive this award,\" she said, adding that it was \"the first time I've ever received such a prestigious prize.\" \"I think it's very important that we recognize the importance of economic institutions in our society,\" said the Norwegian Nobel laureate, Ada Yonath, a professor of economics at Indiana University. In the 1970s, she was one of only a handful of Nobel laureates to be awarded the prestigious award, which was given in memory of Alfred Nobel. Since then, Nobel prizes have been handed out to women who have worked in economic fields for more than a century. Nobel winners have also received numerous awards for their work, including the best economist award in history, the economics prize, and the literature prize. One of them, Carol Greider, was named the world's first female economist. Her work was published in The New York Times in 1970, when she earned a $1.5 million prize from the University of California, Berkeley, as well as the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (AIDA). In addition to being a first-time winner, her prize is also a second-place honor, with a total of 10 million euros ($11.6 million) in prize money, according to Thomson Reuters. Other prizes include the \"Nobel Prize in Economic Literature,\" which is awarded annually to a person who has made a significant contribution to society through his or her writings and works. This year's prize will be given to an American author who was born in Sweden and has lived in Germany since the 1950s. Oliver Williamson, an economist and author, won for his work on economic theory, economics and social theory. He was the only person to have won both the English and German Nobel Prizes in his lifetime. His work has earned him a number of other honors, among them the honorary doctorate in political science and economics from Indiana and Indiana universities. On the other hand, he was also the author of several books on the subject of social and economic issues, such as social justice, economic inequality and gender inequality. Many of his works were translated into English, German, French, Italian, Spanish, Russian, Romanian, Hungarian and Romanian. They were published by Oxford University, where he is currently teaching a course on social issues. Williamson's work is based on his own life experiences and his experiences as a journalist and researcher in Israel and Germany. When his wife died in 1975, his father was a teacher and he taught him how to read and write. After his death in 1989, Williamson became an economics professor at Purdue University and later became a political scientist at IU."

        "target": "'One in three' unaware they are HIV-positive The number of people living with HIV/AIDS in the European Union and neighboring countries has increased by nearly a third, with one in three unaware they have the virus, the EU Commission warned Monday. In a document on combating AIDS, the Commission said that as of 2007, around 2.2 million people carried the virus in the EU and nearby countries, an increase of 700,000 from 2001. According to Commission figures, around 730,000 of these live within the EU's 27 member states. France, Italy, Spain and Portugal have relatively high infection rates - ranging from 0.4 percent to 0.5 percent. In the Baltic country of Estonia, the infection rate stands at around 1.3 percent. In neighboring Ukraine, around 1.6 percent of the population has been diagnosed with HIV, while in Russia around 1.1 percent are HIV positive. The Commission warned that now was not the time for Europe to drop its guard on preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS, adding that in some neighboring countries the number of people carrying the virus had doubled. EU Health Commissioner Androulla Vassiliou said political momentum in the fight against HIV/AIDS needed to be maintained, adding that people must \"take responsibility for themselves and their partners by talking about and practicing safe sex and going for HIV testing.\" A cure for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has yet to be found more than a quarter century after it was brought to public attention. However, efficient treatments exist to slow the evolution of the virus. dfm/AFP Editor: Chuck Penfold",
        "generated_story": "One in three people living with HIV/AIDS in the EU and neighboring countries are unaware they are HIV-positive The European Commission's head of health and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Androulla Vassiliou, has warned that the number of people infected with the virus could rise to 1 in 3 by the end of the year. \"We need to do something about it,\" he said on Monday, adding that he was \"very concerned about the fact that we are not aware of this fact.\" The Commission, which oversees the European Union, said it was working to ensure that all cases of HIV and AIDS are treated with appropriate treatment. It also said that a third of those infected do not know they have HIV, and that it is not possible to prevent them from contracting the disease. The EU's health commissioner said in a statement that \"we are working very hard to make sure that this does not happen again.\" In addition, the Commission said there was a \"serious lack of awareness\" among EU citizens about their HIV status. According to the commission, a quarter of all people who have tested positive for HIV have been told that their status has not changed since 2001, when they were still living in their home country of Estonia. This is the first time in more than a decade that HIV has been detected in an individual's body. In the past, HIV was found to be the most common form of AIDS in Europe, but now it has spread to other countries, such as Spain, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Italy. HIV is a deadly virus that can be spread through the blood and the immune system and can cause the spread of a disease that is resistant to all forms of treatment, including chemotherapy and immunotherapy. There is also a risk of infection with hepatitis B and hepatitis C, according to a recent study by researchers at the University of Tartu in Estonia, who found that about one in five people had contracted HIV in 2001. That's the second-most-common HIV infection in all of Europe. But it's not the only one. One in four people with AIDS live in countries where there is no vaccine for it. A third (1 in 10) have died from AIDS, while the rest have contracted it from other causes. These figures are based on tests carried out by health authorities in several European countries. They are the result of tests conducted by European Health Commissioner Dr. Chuck Penfold and his team of doctors at a hospital in Tallinn, Estonia's largest city, where the test results were inconclusive, were not available for comment Monday (AFP, AFP, dfm/AFP Editor)"

        "target": "Switzerland Calls on Private Security Firms for Euro 2008 In addition to enlisting foreign police during Euro 2008, Switzerland will also be bringing in private security personnel from Germany, reported a Swiss newspaper. \"We have to turn to about 500 private security personnel from Germany,\" Urs Stadler, spokesman for a security firm consortium told the Monday, May 26, edition of Swiss newspaper Tages Anzeiger. \"Most of them were already in operation during the World Cup two years ago, and have relevant experience,\" added Stadler from Prisec, a consortium made up of the companies Protectas and Securitas. The spokesman said more help was needed, but could not give exact numbers \"due to pending assignments.\" Recent soccer violence raises concern Swiss media has been questioning the security preparations for Euro 2008 after a spate of violence at recent games. In the latest incident, seats were ripped out and a goal post wrenched from the ground after St. Gallen faced the prospect of relegation following a 2-0 defeat to Bellinzona on May 20. St. Gallen was the third incident in a month that saw violent clashes with police who twice resorted to rubber bullets and tear gas. While Switzerland is seen as a low risk country in terms of hooliganism, violence has been on the increase in recent years and estimates claim there are around 400 hooligans and 600 sympathizers. Swiss Sports Minister Samuel Schmid said that hooliganism cannot be ruled out, reported German news agency DPA. But he expressed his belief that extra measures such as more policing, restrictions on alcohol -- which he has called \"a catalyst for violence\" -- and video surveillance will help keep trouble at bay. Private firms to boost European police The private security companies will be responsible for patrolling the stadiums and their surroundings, as well as the public viewing areas, team hotels and trainings areas. An international police force will manage the rest. Switzerland has committed some 31,200 police officers and soldiers. Another 1,700 police will be sent from Germany, which will have the authority to make arrests. France will offer the third largest contingent with 750 officers and Croatia, Poland, Sweden, Greece, Russia and Spain will also send reinforcements.",
        "generated_story": "Private firms to help prepare for Euro 2008 The Swiss government has announced plans to provide security for the upcoming World Cup in the country's biggest sporting event. The announcement came on the eve of the tournament's opening ceremony in St. Gallen, Switzerland, on May 20. According to the Swiss news agency DPA, a number of private firms have been working on security plans for this year's tournament. Among them is Tages Anzeiger, which is a private firm that provides security services for sports teams in Switzerland and Germany. It is also working with the German sports ministry to ensure that security measures are in place to protect the sport. \"We are going to do everything we can to make sure that we have adequate security,\" said Urs Stadler, the minister of sport and sport, in a statement. He added that \"we are working closely with our German counterparts in Germany and the Czech Republic, and we will continue to cooperate with them in their efforts to secure their sport,\" he said, adding that it was \"very important that they have a strong security system.\" The German team, known as the \"Pisec team,\" has been training for three months in Bellinzona and is expected to be ready by the end of May. In addition to providing security, it will also be working in cooperation with other sports companies, such as Germany, Poland, Spain, France, Italy and Spain. For the first time in its history, Pisec is working directly with sports authorities in order to prevent the spread of false information, according to a report from the sports agency Deutsche Telekom (DTPA) on Monday. This is the second time that the company has worked with a Swiss sports company in recent years. Last year, they were able to work together with their Swiss counterparts, who had worked for them for several years at the same time. Since then, however, their cooperation has not been as strong as in previous years, when they had to rely on their own companies for security. That's because the companies themselves are not Swiss. They are Swiss, but they do not have Swiss passports. And they don't have any Swiss or German passports, so they cannot be used to travel to other countries. But they are also Swiss citizens who have no Swiss passport. So they will not be allowed to use the passport, as they would be required to have one from their home country. However, that doesn't mean they can't use their passports to get around Switzerland. If they want to take part in this tournament, there will be a lot of security precautions. There is no need to worry about the security of Swiss sporting teams, for example, because they already have the passports of their athletes and their families. At the moment, this is not an issue that can be covered by Swiss law. Just ask the government, of course, if you are a member of a sports organization. Otherwise, you will have to wait and see what happens to your passport and your bank card. You will never know what will happen to you. I'm not sure what's going on in your life. What's the best way to find out? I think it's a good idea to try and get a better idea of what you can expect from a country like Switzerland's sports team. Let's just say that there's not much to say about it. We're not talking about that right now. All we're saying is that you should be very careful and be aware of your surroundings. Do you think you'll find something that's really important? If you do, do you really need a passport? You can get one for yourself? And if not, then you're in for a very good reason."

        "target": "German Minister Urges Peace in Georgia's Separatist Regions German Foreign Minister Steinmeier has called for an end to the \"spiral of violence\" between the Georgian government in Tbilisi and its Russian-backed rebel regions and presented a three-stage plan to break the deadlock. Steinmeier issued the plea as he began a tour of the region to sponsor a new peace plan aimed at calming the simmering tensions over Georgia's separatist regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. \"This is my appeal to break out of the spiral of violence. A lack of dialogue is not an option for the future,\" he said after meeting with his Georgian counterpart Eka Tkeshelashvili. Steinmeier, who chairs the so-called Group of Friends of the United Nations' Secretary on Georgia, is proposing a three-phase peace plan based on a mutual declaration of non-violence and repatriation of about 25,000 ethnic Georgians expelled from Abkhazia in the 1990s. Negotiations over the status of the two rebel regions, which have enjoyed de facto autonomy since the end of a civil war in 1994, was reserved for the final phase of negotiations. Tkeshelashvili said, \"The plan has great potential for success,\" but added that the most difficult thing would be to convince Russia. Peace talks remain distant The threat of armed conflict in the region last month has given urgency to international pressure for renewed peace talks, but Tbilisi, Moscow and the Russian-backed regions remain far apart on the basic premises for restarting peace talks. Officials in Tbilisi oppose a treaty on the non-use of force without guarantees on the return of refugees and the withdrawal of Russian peacekeeping forces base in the region. Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was skeptical of peace efforts Thursday. \"Signing of a treaty on the return of Georgian refugees to Abkhazia is unreal now, because such a return requires a calm situation,\" Lavrov was quoted as saying by news agency RIA-Novosti. \"We think that signing a treaty on the non-use of force without any preconditions is an absolutely unavoidable first step,\" he added. Experts see little hope for Steinmeier's plan Analysts do not expect anything conclusive from Steinmeier's trip, pointing to intransigence on the part of the Abkhaz President Sergei Bagapsh, who said he would \"not consider the plan.\" \"We are not going to discuss Abkhazia's status with anyone. We are building an independent, democratic state,\" Bagapsh was quoted by Georgian news agencies as saying. Speaking to journalists ahead of the meetings Thursday, Steinmeier admitted: \"We don't have any illusions about simple answers, but we cannot stand by without acting on this conflict. That would be irresponsible.\" From Tbilisi, the German minister is to travel to the Black Sea city of Batumi for talks with Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili and then to Abkhazia on Friday before ending his three-day tour in Moscow. Most citizens of the breakaway republics have been issued Russian passports and over 2,500 Russian peacekeeping troops patrol the region under a UN ceasefire agreement. In opposition to Georgia's bid to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Russia moved to strengthen diplomatic ties with the breakaway regions sharply aggravating tensions with the Georgian leadership in recent months.",
        "generated_story": "NATO Secretary-General Frank-Walter Steinmeier has set up a new peace plan for Georgia and Abkhazia. The new plan is expected to be unveiled on Friday. It will be signed by the heads of state of the two former Soviet republics, Eka Tkeshelashvili and Sergei Bagapsh, as well as Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. According to the draft, the plan would be based on an agreement between Russia and Georgia, which was signed in 1994, and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), which is based in the Russian-Georgian region of South Ossetia, with the aim of creating a \"peace zone\" for the region. \"We are going to build a peace zone that will protect the interests of all Georgians,\" the document said. But it did not specify whether it would include Russia or Georgia as a guarantor of a future state. In the meantime, it was not clear whether the new deal would involve Russia, Georgia or the United States as guarantors of future territorial integrity. On Thursday, a meeting between Russian and Georgian foreign ministers was scheduled to take place in Tbilisi, but the meeting was postponed until Friday, according to RIA-Novosti, citing a lack of information on the situation in Georgia. At the same time, Russian President Vladimir Putin said he was \"very concerned\" about the possibility of Georgia becoming a part of Russia's future. He also said that Russia would not be involved in any negotiations with Georgia over the future of its territory. However, he added, \"Russia is not a party to any of this.\" \"It is a political party,\" he said, adding that he would like to see the Georgian government \"to be able to work in a peaceful way\" and that the country would \"not have to rely on any kind of military intervention.\" The UN Security Council on Thursday adopted a resolution calling for an end to Georgia's armed conflict with Russia. That resolution, however, was rejected by a vote of no confidence from the UN's 193-member bloc. Russia has repeatedly rejected the proposal, saying that it does not have the right to impose its own conditions on Georgia in order to protect its interests. This is the first time that a UN resolution has been adopted in such a way that an international body has to agree to a deal on how to deal with a conflict that could potentially lead to an escalation of hostilities between Moscow and Moscow. Moscow has said it will not accept the idea that Georgia should be allowed to continue its military occupation of territory it claims as an independent state, despite the fact that its armed forces have been fighting for more than two decades. A new UN-backed peace process has also been put in place to try to resolve the conflict between the three countries, including the ongoing territorial dispute between its two ethnic groups, in an attempt to prevent the return of Russian troops to their former territories. For the second time this year, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has called on Russia to help Georgia to return to its former self-proclaimed \"statehood\" in return for a ceasefire and a cease-fire. Last week, Russia announced a plan to withdraw its troops from its southern neighbor, Abkazian, after which it agreed to give up its weapons of mass destruction in exchange for its support for separatist rebels. Since then, Moscow's role has become increasingly clear: it is no longer an option to intervene militarily against the separatists, even if it means the withdrawal of Georgian troops, if they are not fully committed to fighting the separatist forces in their own country."

        "target": "Bayern's Klinsmann Praises, Hoeness Attacks Hoffenheim The Bundesliga's two top teams don't play until Friday, but the mind games are already underway. Bayern's coach Juergen Klinsmann says Hoffenheim are legitimate contenders, but commercial manager Uli Hoeness disagrees. When the Bundesliga scheduled Bayern's home match against Hoffenheim in the league's unloved Friday night slot, they probably didn't imagine that it would turn out to be the match of the first half of the season. Indeed, few experts or fans thought that Hoffenheim, a first-division debutante located in a southern German village with 3,000 inhabitants, would give mighty Munich a run for its money. But it's the first week of December, and Hoffenheim top the table by three points. They also have a much better goal difference than their second-placed rivals -- and that has drawn praise from Bayern's coach, Juergen Klinsmann. \"I have the highest estimation of Hoffenheim because they've built the squad very ambitiously, rationally and with very good players,\" Klinsmann told DPA news agency. \"They can be proud of that.\" Klinsmann said he thought that the club could establish itself among the top three or four sides in Germany in the years to come and qualify for international competition next season. He also had words of praise for Hoffenheim's software billionaire patron, Dietmar Hopp, whose money has funded the club's ascent. \"There's nothing negative about it,\" Klinsmann said. \"He used to play for the club, is a soccer man through and through and helped the team get on its feet.\" Some fans have criticized Hopp and Hoffenheim for paying inflating salaries and luring talent away from other clubs instead of developing homegrown players. In fact, Hoffenheim's official salary budget is about average for the Bundesliga. Hoeness sounds his horn But while Bayern's coach was praising his opponents to the skies, Munich's commercial manager Uli Hoeness has been trying to play with their heads. On the heels of Bayern's convincing win over Leverkusen last weekend, Hoeness is back to taunting rivals. \"The performance we showed in the second half against Leverkusen will be enough against Hoffenheim,\" Hoeness told the German soccer magazine kicker. Hoeness also dropped a none-too-thinly-veiled hint that Hoffenheim's personnel expenditures were far higher than the officially released figures and scoffed at the idea that strategy would determine the outcome of Friday's match. \"Games are decided by the better players, not by tactics,\" Hoeness said. \"And of course, we've got better players than Hoffenheim.\" But that particular verbal attack may represent some wishful thinking of the manager's part. Hoffenheim coach Ralf Rangnick is one of only two current Bundesliga skippers with a winning record against Munich. Rangnick, whose team cruised past Bielefeld last weekend to keep Bayern three points back, reacted to Hoeness' remarks with a shrug. \"We're preparing for Munich exactly the same way we did against Bielefeld,\" Rangnick said. In any case, soccer fans in Germany know what they'll be doing Friday evening -- finding a bar with cable sports television to watch a top match that no one, before the start of the season, would have considered possible.",
        "generated_story": "Hoffenheim's Commercial Manager Reacts to the First Half of the Bundesliga Season HOFFENHAM's commercial manager Ralf Rangnick has opened up about the first half of Bundesliga play. \"We are very happy with the way we have been playing this season. We have had a lot of success so far, and we will continue to do so in the second half,\" he said in an interview with German magazine DPA on Friday night. Hoeness said he was \"very pleased\" with his team-mates' performances in their first two matches, which saw them win two Bundesliga matches in a row and draw one with Leverkusen. He also said that he would be looking forward to a strong start to next season's Bundesliga campaign. The Bundesliga's first-half has been a bit of a rollercoaster ride, with several teams struggling to find their footing, as well as a number of injuries and suspensions. But the team is on course to make up for that in December, when they face Bayern Munich and Hoffenerheim at the Allianz Arena. On Friday, the German club announced that they would not be renewing their contract until the end of December. In addition, they will be re-evaluating their squad for the January transfer window. They will also have to decide whether they want to renew the contract of their former coach Dietmar Hopp, who was sacked by the club last month for failing to deliver on his promise to improve on the form of his predecessor, Juergen Klinsmann, in his first season as head coach. After a difficult first few months in charge, Jupp Heynckes has taken a step back from his role as the head of Bayern's marketing department. His first match was against Hoffengheim, a club he had been linked with for a long time. At the same time, he has also been working on a new commercial strategy for his new club, Hoffenhheim. That means he'll be able to focus more on promoting his players, rather than trying to sell them off to other teams. For now, though, it's just a matter of time before he is ready to take over as coach, but he's not going to give up on that. If he does, then he will have a chance to prove himself to be the best coach in Germany, because he knows he can be a good coach and that's what he wants to achieve. And that is exactly what we are looking for, right now. It's the right time for him to get back to his old team, too. With the new season starting in earnest, there's no reason to doubt his ability to stay in Munich, where he spent the past two seasons as an assistant coach at Bayern. There's also the possibility of him making a return to Munich in January. However, that doesn't mean he won't have the opportunity to continue his current role, either. Last month, his contract was renewed for another year, after he took over from former Bayern coach Uli H\u00f6ness. Since then, however, Bayern have struggled to keep up with their top-flight form and have lost several key players in recent seasons. This season has seen a drop in form, especially in quality, according to Bundesliga statisticians. Bundesliga statistics show that Bayern are the only team to have more than 100 percent possession in all competitions, compared to their Bundesliga record of 1.5 percent in 2016-17. Bayern, for example, are second-best in Bundesliga, while Hoffensheim are third with 10th with 13 points, behind Bayern with five points. Hoffeneheim have won their last two games and are fourth with seven points from three games. Bayer Munich are fifth with three matches to go, although they have only one point from their opening four games, so they are still a point behind Hoffenheimer in second place."

The European Commission's decision to launch the rule of law procedure on Warsaw puts the EU's executive institution at-risk of taking sides, Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Konrad Szymanski told reporters in the European Parliament. \"I have the impression that the [European] Commission risks taking a role as a side in a political dispute inside Poland,\" Szymanski noted. On Wednesday, European Commission Vice President Frans Timmermans - a former Dutch foreign minister - announced the move, marking the first time the EU has used the mechanism. Timmermans said that the move was aimed at entering \"into a dialogue with the Polish authorities, to clarify the facts in an objective way and help find solutions if necessary.\" He added that the procedure is focused on seeking answers regarding the new right-wing Polish government's actions not to apply two judgments by the country's constitutional court, and the reasons behind the president and vice-president's terms were shortened. Preserving rule of law However, Poland's deputy foreign minister said that the European Commission was informed of the reasons behind the government's actions. \"We would insist that the questions are phrased precisely because we have provided much information to the Commission in recent days and we are not entirely clear as to what the Commission is still not clear about,\" Szymanski noted to reporters at the European Parliament. New media laws, giving the government the power to hire and fire senior figures at state broadcasters, were also called into question by Timmermans. The controversial legislation prompted mass pro-democracy protesters in the European country. \"The rule of law is one of the EU's fundamental values. Making sure the rule of law is preserved throughout the Union is a key part of the European Commission's responsibilities,\" Timmermans wrote on his official Facebook page. The Rule of Law Framework was created two years ago as a response to criticism that the 28-nation bloc had not adequately responded to possibly-authoritarian moves taken by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban during his tenure. ls/jil (Reuters, AFP, dpa)",
        "generated_story": "The European Commission risks taking sides in a political dispute in Poland, says its deputy foreign minister Frans Timmermans. The EU Commission has warned Poland that it should not side with the country's Prime Minister, Konrad Szymanski, in the ongoing dispute over the rule of law. \"We have to be careful not to take sides,\" the Deputy Foreign Minister said on Wednesday, adding that the EU should be cautious in its handling of the dispute. He said the Commission should take a \"strong stand\" against the government of Viktor Orban, who has been in power for more than two decades. In the past, the commission has taken a strong stand against Hungary, Poland's prime minister, and the European Parliament. But in this case, it is not clear whether the two countries have a common position on the matter. On the other hand, there is no doubt that Poland has a right to a free and fair vote in parliament, which will decide whether to ratify a new constitution or not. That would be the first step in an attempt to resolve the current political crisis in Europe. It is also unclear how much Poland will be able to contribute to the new constitutional framework. If it does not agree to it, then it will not be a good thing for Poland. For now, however, Hungary is the only EU member state that is willing to do so, according to its Foreign Ministry. Hungary and Poland have been at loggerheads for months over a draft law that would make it easier for the former communist state to form an independent political bloc. Poland and Hungary have repeatedly rejected the draft bill, saying it would not allow them to impose their own laws without the consent of a majority of its citizens. This has led to an international outcry, with some European politicians calling for a vote of no confidence and others saying they would vote against it. Opinion polls show that opinion polls have shown that voters are more likely to back the pro-Orban government than the opposition. However, a number of Polish politicians have said they are not ready to give up their positions. They have also said that they do not want to see a change in government. And they have not ruled out the possibility that a referendum on constitutional reform could be held in early 2019, but they also say they don't see any chance of that happening at all. According to one poll, around 70 percent of voters in Hungary are in favor of an EU-wide referendum. Another poll showed that around one-third of all voters support the ruling party's right-wing coalition, as well as a quarter of those who oppose the proposed constitutional reforms. Other pollsters, including the Dutch, have questioned the credibility of Hungary's government and said it was too early to say whether it had a chance to make a decision on how to proceed. Some of them have called for an early election, while others say it's too soon to know for sure. Meanwhile, others, such as the Netherlands, Germany, France, Italy, Spain and Spain have all expressed concern about the Polish government's position. Many of these countries, for example, say that if the referendum is held next year, they will have no choice but to go ahead with an election. Others, though, think that this is unlikely to happen at the same time. There is a growing sense of unease among the population in many parts of Europe, especially among young people who have grown up in rural areas, where the political situation has become increasingly tense. At least one Dutch politician said he was concerned about a possible split in his own country."

        "target": "Turkey, Greece seek NATO mission in Aegean, says German official Germany, Greece and Turkey will ask NATO to approve a maritime surveillance mission in the Aegean to combat illegal people smugglers. Greece had previously voiced reservations about the proposal. The proposed mission to be discussed at a NATO defense ministers meeting in Brussels on Thursday comes days after German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutolgu said they would raise the issue of refugees with the Alliance. According to a Reuters report citing a senior German official, initially reticent Greece has now given the green light for the operation, which could see NATO assets deployed in the Aegean in a mostly intelligence and reconnaissance role. Under the proposal, which would need to be approved by Alliance members, NATO maritime assets would provide information to national coastguards and the EU border agency Frontex to combat illegal smugglers using rickety boats to bring migrants to Europe. Turkey would then take back the refugees, as envisioned as part of a 3 billion-euro ($3.2 billion) EU-Turkey deal agreed to last year. According to German sources, the mission would not be similar to the NATO mission in the Mediterranean intercepting migrant boats making the dangerous run from Libya to Italy. However, NATO ships could intervene in emergency situations to save passengers. \"It is not NATO's remit to push back or stop refugee boats,\" the official told Reuters. The mission would use assets from the Alliance's standing naval group, a permanent reaction force deployed in the Mediterranean. The naval group's current flagship is the German combat support ship \"Bonn.\" Denmark has already said it would provide additional ships to the mission, according to the official. However, it is unclear whether NATO members will approve the mission which may fall outside the bounds of the Alliance's mandate. Complicating matters is a long-running maritime dispute between Greece and Turkey over sovereignty in the Aegean, where the two NATO members' jets regularly engage in dogfights. Turkey has taken in more than 2.5 million Syrian refugees, and is a major transit point for migrants from Asia and Africa. More than a million migrants and refugees reached Europe last year, many making the dangerous boat journey from Turkey to Greece by boat. So far this year, more than 340 have perished in the cold waters trying to reach Europe. cw/msh (AFP, dpa, Reuters)",
        "generated_story": "NATO ships in Aegean to combat smugglers Frontex ships have been deployed in the Mediterranean Sea to fight illegal smugglers. The ships, which are based in Germany and Denmark, are expected to arrive on Thursday, with the aim of stopping the flow of migrants and refugees from Syria and Iraq to Europe. \"The ships are being used to transport migrants,\" German Prime Minister Ahmet Davutolgu told a news conference in Bonn, Germany. He said the ships were being deployed to help the smugglers, who had been trying to smuggle migrants into Europe for several months. They are also being sent to Turkey, where they will be met by the Turkish military, according to a statement from the German Defense Ministry. Turkey has said it will send a ship to Greece and Italy, but it is not clear if the ship will arrive in Greece or Italy. Germany, however, has already sent a patrol ship, the NATO-led Alliance of Mediterranean States (ALL-Europe) ship. It is also due to dock at the Greek port of Boulogne in northern Greece. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she was \"very concerned\" about the situation in Syria, adding that it would be \"difficult\" for the EU to deal with such a large influx of refugees and migrants. She also said that Turkey would not be allowed to take part in any sort of joint operation with Greece, Italy or Turkey. NATO has also sent ships to Cyprus, Cyprus and Turkey to try to prevent the spread of illegal migrants, she said. According to German news agency dpa, \"Turkey will not allow any migrants to enter Europe without a visa.\" Germany's defense ministry said its ships would stay in Turkey until the end of the year, when they would return to their home countries. In the meantime, Turkey will continue to cooperate with EU member states in their efforts to tackle illegal migration and the smuggling of people from other countries, it added. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said his country would continue its cooperation with European countries in its fight against the Syrian rebels. However, he did not rule out the possibility of a joint military operation between Turkey and Syria. 'We are going to do everything we can to make sure that we are able to keep our borders open,' he said, referring to the European Union's border agency. Ankara, meanwhile, is working on a plan to send troops to Syria as part of an EU-wide effort to stop illegal immigration. EU officials said they were working closely with Turkey on the issue, saying it was important to ensure that the country's borders remained open and that its borders were secure. But they also stressed the need for cooperation between the two countries to work together in a way that would ensure the safety of its citizens and their families. For example, they added that Germany would send its own troops, as well as other EU members, to meet with Turkish troops in Europe, in order to protect the interests of Turkish and Greek citizens. This would also be the first time that a Turkish ship would have to be used in an attempt to reach Europe's southern Mediterranean coast. That would require the cooperation of EU states, including Denmark and Sweden, and would mean the deployment of more than 3 billion euros ($3.2 billion) of troops and equipment. There is no guarantee that this will happen, though, because of Turkey's role in NATO's operations in eastern Mediterranean waters. At the same time, there is a strong possibility that EU countries will also send their own ships and vessels to join the operation. European states have also been asked to provide logistical support to Turkish ships."

        "target": "Opinion: The pope's impossible mission in Mexico Pope Francis's trip to Mexico is a dangerous mission - a diplomatic as well as political balancing act, one that brings with it enormous expectations. Francis won't be able to meet them, says DW's Astrid Prange. Dead prisoners, disappearing students, refugees shot dead and murdered priests. Mexico has lived through one violent episode after the other. The mood in the nation is explosive. And now this: just a day before the pope is set to arrive, more than 50 people died in the largest prison revolt in the country's history. What meaning does the pope's presence hold on such an occasion? Only one thing is certain: Francis won't be able to resolve the problems of the world's second largest Catholic nation in just a five-day trip. The unrealistic demands placed on him are not something he can fill. Yet the pope carries with him an important message: you don't have to love your enemies but you do need to speak with them. And he's living the example himself by meeting with the Russian Orthodox Patriarch Kirill on a stopover in Cuba on his way to Mexico. Cuba all over again It's sensational! Bannings and mutual ex-communications are ancient history. Nearly a millennium after the split, the head of the Roman Catholic Church and the head of the Russian Orthodox Church are speaking to each other. It's not as if the two will become friends - their positions are far too different. Yet their centuries-old enmity feels out of place and in view of the massive worldwide persecution of Christians, almost unchristian. And both of these church leaders know this. In Mexico, efforts to stem the polarizing forces at play in society have not been successful. The extreme differences between rich and poor are dividing Mexican society. President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto has prioritized economic growth over dialogue with his critics - a group which includes students as well as teachers and union members who regularly protest against government policies. They demand an end to lawlessness and corruption. The presumed murder of 43 teaching students in Iguala in September 2014, a crime which remains unsolved, stands as a symbol of the lawlessness sweeping Mexico. The recent mutiny in a Monterrey jail serves as further proof of the country's shortcomings in regard to human rights and the rule of law. With a visit to Ciudad Juarez and the largest prison in Mexico, Francis will only make that deficiency more transparent. Even the pope of peace has enemies. The route he's chosen to take on his travels through the country has displeased the staunchly Catholic president. A meeting with the relatives of the Iguala victims is therefore hush-hush and participation in a holy mass remains secret. Considering the tense situation in the country, it's still possible that the pope's route will change once again. The church in the pillory Even within his own church, Francis has met with opposition. A meeting he requested with victims from the church's abuse scandal will not take place - a bitter disappointment for many former seminarians who were abused by Marcial Maciel, the founder of the Legion of Christ, and members of his order. It's just one example of how impunity continues even within the church itself. None of the perpetrators have yet to answer for their crimes in court. It appears as though the pope has accomplished more on the world stage than he has brought on reforms to the Vatican. Despite the revolutionary coming together of Cuba and the US and the revolutionary meeting with Patriarch Kirill, the revolution in Rome has yet to materialize. Do you have something to say? Add your comments below. The thread to this editorial closes in 24 hours.",
        "generated_story": "Pope's impossible mission in Mexico Pope Francis' mission to Mexico has been described as \"impossible\" by many as an impossible task. The pope's trip to the Mexican capital, Ciudad Juarez, was described by some as the most difficult in the history of the country's Catholic Church. \"It is impossible for a pope to travel to a country where there are so many different religions, cultures and religions,\" said Astrid Prange, a journalist for DW. She added that the pope had \"no idea how difficult it would be\" for him to make the trip, adding that he had no idea what was going on in his own country. But he did, and he made it clear that it was impossible. He said he was \"not going to be able to do it alone.\" \"I am not going anywhere,\" he said. In fact, I think the only way I can think of to get there is to go to Rome, where I have been living for the past two years. I don't think I will ever get a chance to see Rome again, but I am very hopeful that I won't have to. It's a very difficult mission for any pope, especially one who is not a Roman Catholic. And it's not the first time I've had to deal with this kind of situation. When I visited Mexico in September 2014, President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, who was then in office at the time, visited the city of Iguala.

However, the Pope did not take the opportunity to visit the capital. Instead, his trip was more of an attempt to reach out to other countries, such as Cuba, Cuba and Cuba. On the other hand, there's the fact that many of these countries are not as Christian as Mexico is. That's why I'm so worried about the possibility of a visit from the US President, Donald Trump, as well as other Latin American leaders, including former Mexican President Juan Manuel Barroso and his wife, Rosalie Kirill."

President Obama vowed to nominate a successor 'in due time,' despite political opposition. The 79-year old justice died in his sleep, presumably of natural causes, local media reported on Saturday. Scalia was visiting Texas for a hunting trip, and his body was discovered after he failed to appear for breakfast in the resort where he was staying. US President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama extended \"their deepest condolences to Justice Scalia's family,\" White House deputy spokesman Eric Schultz said. Texas Governor Greg Abbott described the conservative justice as a \"man of God, a patriot and an unwavering defender of the written Constitution and the rule of law.\" \"He was the solid rock who turned away so many attempts to depart from and distort the Constitution. His fierce loyalty to the Constitution set an unmatched example, not just for judges and lawyers, but for all Americans,\" Abbot said. Battle for the empty seat His passing is likely to open a new political front between President Barack Obama and the Republican Party, as Scalia's replacement could shift the composition of the court towards a more liberal persuasion. Several Republican lawmakers have already urged Obama to leave the decision to the next president who will be voted in later this year. \"The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court justice,\" Senate Republican majority leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement, referring to the upcoming November general election. \"Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president,\" McConnell concluded. President Obama, however, said he would fulfill his constitutional duty and nominate Scalia's successor \"in due time.\" \"These are responsibilities I take seriously, and so should everyone. They are bigger than any one party,\" he said. Decades of controversy Scalia joined the Supreme Court in 1986, becoming the first Italian-American to serve in the top judicial body. He was nominated by US President Ronald Reagan. Throughout his long carrier, Scalia voted in favor of privacy and protecting defendants' rights, but also against legalizing abortion, same-sex marriage and gun control. He also drew public attention for his theatrical flair and sharpness of tongue, as well as his alleged unwillingness to compromise. In June last year, the nine-person Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage with a five-to-four vote. Scalia, who was in the minority, commented he would \"hide my head in a bag\" if his own name were associated with the decision. He also said that the majority opinion was \"couched in a style that is as pretentious as its content is egotistic.\" dj/jm (AP, Reuters, AFP, dpa)",
        "generated_story": "Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia dies in sleep in Texas The US Supreme Court has ruled that the death of a conservative justice of the highest court in the United States is a \"natural death\" for Americans. The court's decision came after a series of appeals by conservative justices, including the late Justice Anthony Kennedy, who died in his sleep on Saturday. Scalia's death was the latest in a string of high-profile cases in recent years to have been ruled unconstitutional by the US supreme court. In one case, the justices ruled in favor of President Ronald Reagan in 1986, overturning the constitutionality of his death. On the other hand, President Barack Obama has said he will appeal the decision to a lower court, which is expected to take up the issue of whether to uphold the Constitution. \"I think it's a natural death,\" Obama said at a news conference in Austin, Texas, where he was traveling with his wife, Michelle Obama, and their son, Greg Abbott, to attend a memorial service for Scalia at the Texas state capitol. He had been serving as a federal judge for more than a decade when he died, according to the conservative-leaning Texas Republican Party (RJC) and the state's attorney general (SPLC) Eric Schultz, a Republican, said in an interview with the Dallas Morning News that Scalia had died \"from a heart attack.\" \"He was a very sick man,\" he said, adding that he had suffered from the effects of alcohol and drug abuse and was unable to sleep for a long time,\" Schultz said. Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said his party would continue to work to ensure that justice Scalia would be able to serve his term. Democrats, meanwhile, have vowed to continue their efforts to repeal the 1986 death penalty and replace it with a constitutional amendment that would make it easier for judges to rule in their favor. Republicans, however, are not ready to give up on the idea. They say they will continue working to make sure justice serves the American people. But they also say that they are prepared to do whatever it takes to get justice for the people of Texas and other states who have suffered the loss of their constitutional rights to life and liberty. 'We are going to keep fighting for justice in this country,' McConnell added."

After successfully weathering the Great Recession, Commerzbank's board of directors appears to want to signal a continuation in its growth trend with Martin Zielke's appointment as the new CEO as of May 1. Outgoing head Martin Blessing announced last year he would not renew his contract. Zielke had previously been put in charge of implementing reforms in the company's private banking sector following the recession. His restructuring measures attracted 800,000 new customers to the bank and changed the image of the 146-year-old financial institution. The 53-year-old has an illustrious career across several German financial institutions to look back on, having started at the teller of a local branch in 1983. Zielke's crowning achievement The beleaguered German financial institution recorded a profit of more than a billion euros (more than $1.1 billion) last year. It was the first time in five years that Commerzbank had made such profitable gains, which it said would translate into paid dividends for shareholders. A good portion of the yields were achieved by a restructuring and expansion drive of Commerzbank's private banking arm under Zielke's leadership. However, some of that money will go to the German government, as it had to step in and rescue the bank in 2009 to the tune of 18 billion euros ($25 billion at the time) by chiefly acquiring more than 15 percent of the shares, effectively nationalizing part of Commerzbank's operations. ss/jlw (dpa, Reuters)",

Martin \"Martin\" Blessing will be the first CEO in the country's history to take the helm of a major bank, according to a person familiar with the matter. \"I am very excited,\" the person told Reuters, adding that he would be able to continue to lead the bank until the end of 2009, when he will step down as CEO and become head of its board of directors. In his first job, Martin had been the CEO since 1983. Now, he is looking to fill the role of CEO, which he has held for the past three years. His appointment was announced on April 1, after the resignation of his predecessor and predecessor, the former chief financial officer Martin Mollke, who was also named CEO of Germany's largest bank. Blessing will assume the position of chief operating officer at the start of next year's annual general meeting in Frankfurt, Germany. A number of key executives have already been named to the post, including the new Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Martin B Blessing is also expected to become the next CFO in a move that will give him the opportunity to strengthen his team's financial and operational capabilities. Mullke will also be tasked with overseeing the firm's expansion into new markets, as well as its ability to invest in new technologies, such as artificial intelligence and robotics, and to develop new products and services that can be used to improve the efficiency and efficiency of financial operations. 'The Great Recession' The German economy has suffered a severe downturn since the financial crisis began in 1983, with unemployment reaching a record high of 18.5 percent in 2009 and unemployment at an 18-year low of 6.6 percent. Zilke has said he wants to focus on the business of banking and finance, rather than on his current role as chairman, CEO or chief investment officer (CEO). \"We are going to do everything we can to make sure that we are doing the right thing,\" he said in an interview with Deutsche Telekom (dpa, Reuters) and Deutsche Bank (Dpa) last month."

        "target": "A quarter of deaths caused by environmental degradation, says UN A new United Nations report warns that pollution and global warming are causing millions more deaths than conflicts. The UN's environment agency has called for an urgent roll-back on harmful substances and fossil fuels. In its report \"Healthy Environment, Health People,\" the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), the World Health Organization and several other environment organizations said that, in 2012, an estimated 12.6 million deaths were attributable to deteriorating environment conditions. The largest numbers of deaths took place in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific regions, followed by sub-Saharan Africa, where around a quarter of deaths were likely caused byair pollution, chemicals, climate change and a lack of access to sanitation. \"By depleting the ecological infrastructure of our planet and increasing our pollution footprint, we incur an ever-growing cost in terms of human health and well-being,\" said UNEP Executive Director Achim Steiner. He added that humanity's life support systems had been compromised by globalization and powerful economic interests. The report was released during UN climate talks in the German city of Bonn which are drawing up rules pertaining to the Paris agreement, which seeks to lower carbon emissions. The document suggested that several drivers were responsible for the threat to human health, including ecosystem disruption, climate change, inequality, unhealthy and wasteful lifestyles, along with unsustainable consumption and production. Worsening effects UNEP estimated that an extra 250,000 deaths could occur each year between 2030 and 2050 as a result of climate change, leading to malnutrition, malaria, diarrhea and heat stress. Between them air pollution and a lack of access to clean water and sanitation cause almost 8 million premature deaths each year. Environmental impacts are responsible for the deaths of more than one quarter of all children under the age of five, the report states. UNEP called for governments to act to remove harmful substances from working environments, reduce the use of carbon fuels and rely instead on renewable energy, and change lifestyles to allow a more sustainable use of the world's resources. The report also called for a bigger investment to protect the planet's natural ecosystem. UNEP predicted a further increase in emerging zoonotic diseases (spread between animals and humans), and called on developing countries, in particular, to prioritize prevention methods. \"Never before have so many animals been kept by so many people - and never before have so many opportunities existed for pathogens to pass through the biophysical environment and wild animals to livestock and people,\" the report warned.",
        "generated_story": "A quarter of deaths due to climate change are linked to environmental degradation, UNEP says. The United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) has released a report on the number of climate-related deaths caused by greenhouse gas emissions in the world's most populous country, the United States. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) report, more than 1.5 million people die every year from the effects of greenhouse gases. This is the third year in a row that the organization has been unable to identify the causes of the deaths. In 2012, it said that one-quarter of all deaths from greenhouse-gas emissions had been attributed to human-caused emissions, compared to one quarter for the previous year. \"We are at a tipping point,\" said Achim Steiner, who heads the UN Environment Programme, which oversees the Paris Agreement on Environment and Pollution (EPEP). \"It's not just the climate that's causing this. It's the people who are causing it,\" he said, adding that it's also the health and well-being of people across the globe. He added that about one in five people in developing countries are affected by the impacts of global warming, including in Southeast Asia, Africa, South Asia and the Western Pacific, where the global temperature is expected to rise by 2 degrees Celsius (3 degrees Fahrenheit) by 2030. That's a significant increase from a year ago, when the WHO said it would be the first time the temperature had risen to 2.6 degrees C (4.4 degrees F) in 20 years. But the report also says that in 2030, there will be an increase of 1,000 deaths per year, up from 2,500 in 2012. These figures are based on a study conducted in 2011-2012, and are not necessarily representative of WHO's findings. However, they do suggest that many of these deaths are related to a lack of awareness and awareness about the dangers of environmental pollution. For example, one study found that 80 percent of those who die from global-warming emissions come from human activities. Another study showed that over a third of world-wide deaths would occur in sub-Saharan Africa by 2035, according to WHO. Other studies have shown that human health is at an all-time low, with the highest mortality rate in Africa (7.7 percent) and Asia (5.3 percent). The report said the most alarming trend is that people are becoming more aware of what is going on in their own countries, such as in China, India, Japan and South Korea (2.2 percent), and even the Middle East (1.8 percent to 3 percent more likely to die in 2050). In addition, almost half of countries in Asia are already living in extreme poverty, while the rest are in poverty. One study, however, found there is no way to predict how many people will die by 2050. Experts say that this is a worrying trend, as the country's population is already suffering from high levels of malnutrition and obesity. And it is not only the poor who suffer from poor health, but also those living with chronic diseases, like malaria and tuberculosis, that are the ones most at risk of dying from environmental diseases. So, in order to prevent this from happening, we need to make sure that we have a plan in place to protect our people. We have to be prepared for this, too, because we are going to need a comprehensive plan to ensure that our children are able to live a healthy, healthy and healthy life. If we don't have this plan, what will we do with it? We will not have the resources to implement it. I think we will need the tools to do that. There are a lot of things we can do to prepare for a future where we won't see this kind of situation. What is needed is to have an environment that is safe for people to eat, drink and work in."

        "target": "Opinion: Yet another crisis for Merkel A summery turquoise blazer and fresh makeup could not hide the fact that Angela Merkel was \"not amused.\" Now she is needed as a champion in the fight against populist forces, DW's Kay-Alexander Scholz writes. Britain-EU divorce proceedings will probably last about two years. Until then, the status quo must be maintained, German Chancellor Angela Merkel emphasized in her press statement. If she is no longer chancellor after the upcoming parliamentary elections in 2017, then others will have to live with the consequences of Brexit. But that is not what she is actually thinking. It is not coincidental that foreign ministers and government leaders are visiting Berlin in the coming days. They want to discuss how things will continue. Berlin, under Merkel's chancellorship, has become a center of power outside of Brussels. Difficult international politics The Brexit decision has disrupted Europe's equilibrium. Germany has lost an important ally on European issues related to economic growth and budgetary discipline. Now, France presumably will be the next to raise its voice against Maastricht Treaty criteria. If the Netherlands and Denmark also decide to leave the EU, Germany will become isolated, as Eastern Europe is not as tight with Germany as it once was. Poland now plays a key role for the Balkan nations and the Visegrad Group (Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic and Slovakia). And Poland is still annoyed about Merkel's refugee policy. What about Germany's populists? They're giddy with glee as they feel that their anti-establishment policies have been validated. They are teaching potential AfD (Alternative for Germany) voters a lesson: \"Here, have a look: it's possible. There is always an alternative. Vote for us!\" Those are exactly the words that protest voters want to hear. Germany's AfD has forged ties with other right-wing parties in Vienna, Paris, The Hague and London. They are all pursuing a \"European\" plan to gain power. The recent Austrian presidential election was significant, as the populist candidate lost by a very narrow margin; in fact, the final election results are still undecided as they are being contested. The Brexit vote was also triggered by populist powers. Domestically difficult Many populists believe that the stronger populism becomes - no matter where - the more advantages there would be for individual parties of their persuasion. Many would also like to see Donald Trump as US president. That is how AfD may become even stronger in Germany, which also means that political majorities would fluctuate even more. Will there be enough seats after the next election for a Christian Democrat and Green coalition, or will yet another grand coalition made up of Christian Democrats and Social Democrats be formed? Can Angela Merkel change course? Can she counter the trend with a new political model in Europe and Germany? Or do we stand on the edge of a new era, a \"political revolution,\" as the AfD calls it? Until now, Europe has survived attacks on its currency (euro crisis), the principle of peaceful coexistence (Crimea crisis) and its open borders policy (refugee crisis). Merkel deserves credit for defending these values, despite mistakes that have been made along the way. The outcome of the Brexit crisis is, however, still open. Have something to say? Add your comments below.",
        "generated_story": "Germany's Alternative for Germany (AfD) and the EU's Brexit Crisis German Chancellor Angela Merkel has warned that the European Union is facing a \"Brexit crisis\" in the wake of the US presidential election. The AfD, a political party founded by former US President George W. Bush, is a far cry from the anti-establishment party, which has been in power for more than a decade. It is the party that has the most influence in Europe, but it is also the one that is most opposed to Donald Trump. In the past few years, it has become increasingly clear that Germany is not going to be able to get out of Europe without a deal. That is, if it can be reached in time for the next election, when it will be decided whether or not to take part in an EU referendum. But it's not just Germany that's facing the prospect of a no-deal Brexit. There are a number of other European countries, including the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Austria, Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, Slovenia, Romania, Ukraine, and even the Czech Republic. Many of these countries have already voted to leave the bloc, while others have voted in favor of leaving. Some of them, like Germany's Social Democrats (SPD), have also voted against a referendum on EU membership. Others, such as the Greens and Greens, have said they will vote against it. Meanwhile, some other parties have called for a vote of no confidence in Merkel and her government, as well as a European exit from NATO. Other parties, however, say they are not ready to give up on the idea of Germany becoming a free European state. For example, they say that they would like to see Germany become a member of NATO and that it would be a good place to live and work as an independent country. However, there are also many other countries that want to remain part of EU. Germany has a long way to go in order to make sure that its citizens don't have to suffer the consequences of their country's departure from Europe's single market. This is one of those countries where there is no way of knowing what will happen to the people who live there. \"We have a lot to learn from Germany,\" Merkel said in a statement, adding that she was \"very happy\" with the outcome of last year's EU summit in Brussels. She also said that \"we will continue to work with our European partners to ensure that we have the best possible future for our people.\" The German government has also been working on a plan to create a new EU-wide customs union, called the Maastricht Treaty (MTA), which would allow EU citizens to join the Schengen zone without having to travel to other EU member states. These plans have been put in place by the Chancellor's office in Berlin, where the German parliament has already approved the MTA. According to Scholz, this would mean that German citizens would no longer be allowed to vote for any candidate in any EU election next year. And it could mean the end of Merkel's term as Chancellor. After all, she would have no choice but to accept the terms of her term in office. If she did not, Merkel would still be in charge of European affairs. Merkel, who is currently in her first year as chancellor, would not be the first German chancellor to step down from her post as head of state in 2017. Her government would also be responsible for setting up the new European Commission. On the other hand, her predecessor, Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel, has said she will not accept any changes to EU rules on migration, migration or immigration."

        "generated_story": "Lockdown lifted after active shooter at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland A lockdown has been lifted at the US military base at Camp Springs outside Washington, D.C. The lockdown was lifted on Thursday after an active-shooter incident at a military facility near the Maryland-Ohio border. Officials said the incident took place around 9 am local time and that no one was injured. \"The situation is under control,\" Vice President Joe Biden said on Twitter, adding that the situation was \"under control.\" The incident occurred in the area of the Malcolm Grow Medical Facility, which is located on the southern edge of Maryland's southern border with Ohio. It is unclear how many people were injured, but it is believed that at least one person was taken to a nearby hospital for treatment of a gunshot wound to the head. Obama, Biden and Biden are expected to attend the event. President Barack Obama said Thursday that he was not aware of any active shooters at his base but that there was no indication that any of them had entered the facility. However, he said he had been briefed on what was going on by the military. He also said there were no plans to make any further comment on whether or not there would be any additional restrictions on military personnel leaving the base. In a statement, the White House said that \"we do not wish to comment further on this incident.\" Obama called for calm after the shooting, saying it was an \"isolated incident\" that could have led to an escalation of tensions between the United States and its allies. But he did not rule out the possibility that an attack could take place. On Thursday, President Obama tweeted: \"We will not tolerate this kind of situation. We are not going to allow this to happen again. I am not a fan of this type of violence.\" He added that it would not be appropriate for the president to be involved in such an incident, as he has said repeatedly in recent days. There is no word yet on how long the lockdown will be in place, however, and it could be extended to include the day after Christmas. This is not the first time that a shooting has taken place in our country's capital. That's because we are in a country where we have a lot of people who don't want to live in fear of what could happen to their families, friends, or their loved ones. At the same time, Obama also called on Congress to step in to protect the country from such a situation, calling for a \"total shutdown of all military activities.\" \"This is an isolated incident,\" Obama told reporters in an interview with the Associated Press."

        "target": "Rethinking the term 'honor killing' The murder of 28-year-old Samia Shahid comes less than two weeks after Qandeel Baloch was killed by her brother. The media was quick to report them as \"honor killings.\" We have to rethink that term, writes Gouri Sharma. When news broke that Samia Shahid, a British-Pakistani woman, had been found dead while visiting relatives in Pakistan at the end of July, mainstream media outlets were quick to report it as an honor killing. It was the second time in two weeks that the media had reported a killing of a woman this way - the first being the murder of Pakistani social media star Qandeel Baloch. There are strong similarities between the cases. Both were murdered in places where they would have felt they were at their safest - in their family homes. It's likely they knew their killers - in Baloch's case, her brother has admitted to strangling her, and Shahid's father and cousin have already been questioned. And as more reports emerge about Shahid's death, it's clear that both were killed because they didn't behave in a way deemed acceptable in a conservative, patriarchal society. 'Deeply offensive' term The debate around terminology in \"honor killings\" isn't new, and after Baloch's murder there were members of the media - such as ABC Australia journalist Juanita Phillips - who decided against using the term, calling it \"deeply offensive\" and referring to it as a \"family killing\" instead. And there are outlets, like the Guardian, that already use inverted commas with the word honor. But some commentators argue that more needs to happen if media consumers are to gain a better understanding of the problem. \"I think an important step for the media would be to refuse to give weight to the term 'honor crimes,'\" said UK-based freelance journalist Shehnaz Khan. \"While it is imperative to highlight that these crimes and murders stem from the roots of misogyny and therefore a false sense of 'honor,' there is absolutely nothing but'shame' within them, as murder is nothing but dishonorable.\" \"The word 'honor' can sometimes carry an almost positive connotation that we are inclined to automatically accept just because it's not happening to us, when the reality is, this a huge problem affecting thousands of girls and women across the world,\" she added. Naming the issue But this isn't a view shared by all journalists. Ruby Hamad, a writer at Australia's Daily Life newspaper, said that the first step in dealing with the issue is naming it. \"There are some deeply patriarchal societies that still limit women's freedom according to old tribal concepts of honor, where, unfairly, the behavior of women reflect on their entire family,\" Hamad said. \"By naming these 'honor killings,' we are acknowledging the role that this misogynistic concept of honor plays, not only in the murders themselves but in these entire societies, and how it entraps both men and women.\" Through the eyes of the perpetrator? There are other issues with the term though. Some have argued that by framing it as such, media outlets are showing the crime through the eyes of the perpetrator - and not through the victim - as they should. And with such cases regularly hitting the headlines, framing is important. The United Nations estimates that around 5,000 women - predominantly from Asia and the Middle East - are killed annually in honor-related crimes, a figure that women's advocacy groups say is closer to 20,000 worldwide. This raises an important cultural element for the media to consider - how far does the term play into cultural stereotypes? \"When honor is considered the most important thing in life, then all family members become expendable,\" Hamad said. \"The collective outweighs the rights of the individual. Does this feed into cultural stereotypes? Perhaps. But that doesn't mean we should pretend that this cultural context isn't there.\" Looking for answers - and alternatives There have been many alternatives put forward by women's advocacy groups, including hate crime, misogynistic murder, femicide and shame killings. But which one should we pick? Al Jazeera for one has decided which one they won't use. \"We are always updating our style guidelines to convey a deeper and more authentic understanding of world affairs. Recent events in Pakistan ignited a healthy debate in Al Jazeera on the term 'honor killings' in particular. Our editors are currently studying alternatives to the term, but'misogynistic murder' is not one of them,\" said an Al Jazeera spokesperson. Terminology in the media matters, and for murders as complex as these, it's the media's responsibility to find a name that better fits the crime. Only then will it become easier to work towards a solution.",
        "generated_story": "Rethinking Honor Killings: An Ethical Perspective The case of a Pakistani journalist who was killed by a British soldier in the Middle East in July is the latest in a series of high-profile cases to be investigated by the International Criminal Court (ICC) and the United Nations (UN) for its role in human rights violations. In July, an Australian journalist, Samia Shahid, was murdered by British soldiers in Pakistan. Shehnaz Khan was the first victim of the attack, which took place during the month of July. According to her Facebook page, she was shot to death by Pakistani soldiers, who were trying to kill her. Her body was found on July 24, a day after she had been killed. The incident sparked outrage across the world, with many people calling for the ICC to investigate the killing. Many people have called for an independent inquiry into the case, but it's not clear if it will lead to a thorough investigation. \"I think it would be a mistake to think that the perpetrators of these murders were innocent,\" said Shahida, adding that she believed the murder was politically motivated and that it was an act of revenge against the British government. However, the investigation is still ongoing, and there are still questions about the motives behind the killings, according to the BBC's Juanita Phillips. As well as the motive, it is also unclear whether or not the perpetrator was involved in any wrongdoing, or whether he or she acted in self-defence. It is unclear, for example, whether the Pakistani soldier who killed her was responsible for her own death or if he was a member of an international terrorist organization. But the fact remains that a number of people were killed in connection with the incident, including her husband, Qandeel Baloch, whose family had fled to Pakistan from the UK after being shot by an unknown assailant. This is not to say that there is no connection between the two murders. There are many factors at play in this case. One of them is that they are connected to an alleged terrorist group, Al Jazeera (Al Jazeera), which is based in London. Another factor, however, is how the victim's family was targeted. They were targeted for revenge for their involvement in an incident in which they were accused of being involved with a group of terrorists. That is why the UN has called on the Pakistan government to take action against those responsible, saying they should be held accountable for what happened to their family members. Other factors include the death of one of their relatives. For instance, there were reports that their son had committed suicide in his home country of Pakistan at the age of 16. And there was speculation that he had also committed a murder in Afghanistan, where his family lived for a long time. These are the factors that led to his death. Some of those who have been targeted include his mother, his father and his brother-in-law. Others, such as his sister, her mother and a friend, have also been victims of similar attacks in other countries. All of this has been said to have happened in recent years, when the Taliban were still in power in some parts of Afghanistan and Pakistan and were planning to establish a caliphate there. At the time of her death, this was not an issue that was being discussed in many media outlets. Now, that is something that has come to light. People are being asked to look at this issue and ask themselves, \"What is going on in their own country? Is this really the right thing to do?\" They are also asking themselves if they have a right to know what is wrong with their country and who is responsible? The UN is calling on them to act in such a way that this is a good way to prevent this from happening again. So, what do we do? What are we doing about it? I think we need to make sure that we are doing something about this, right now? We are going to try and find out what we can do to change the way we treat people's lives."

        "target": "A Brief History of the Seaside Holiday These days, millions take seaside holidays for granted as one of life's pleasures. But 200 years ago, a dip in the sea was more a test of courage. Hardly anyone could swim. As late as the 18th century, many Europeans still thought of the sea as the realm of Satan: storm-tossed and inhabited by terrifying monsters. \"Unlike the mountains, the coasts were terra incognita as a holiday spot,\" says Manfred B\u00e4tje, director of the Bade-Museum on the North Sea island of Norderney. Anyone who set foot in the water was \"stepping into the unknown\". Brighton showed the way That only began to change after the British aristocracy discovered the healing power of salt water. As early as 1780, Brighton, England's biggest and oldest seaside resort, was a bustling spa. Philosopher and physicist Georg Christoph Lichtenberg (1742-1799) of G\u00f6ttingen gave Germans the starting signal with his 1793 essay \"Why doesn't Germany have any large public seaside resorts?\" In it, he called for the creation of a resort in Cuxhaven on the North Sea. He received support from the most notable German physician of the time, the Prussian king's court physician, Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland. But things turned out somewhat differently. Germany's first seaside resort was indeed built in September, 1793, but in Heiligendamm on the Baltic Sea. Four years later, permission was granted for construction of Germany's first resort on the North Sea, on Norderney. \"For the first bathing season on July and August of 1800, only around 250 guests turned up. Now, the nearly 6000 residents host a good 530,000 bathers annually, plus around 230,000 day-trippers,\" B\u00e4tje reels off the figures. Romanticist inspiration In the 19th century, the landscapes of Caspar David Friedrich, such as his famous Chalk Cliffs on R\u00fcgen (1818), gave seaside holidays added impetus. From then on, the sea was no longer a voracious beast. From the shore, the cultivated, modern European contemplated the vast melancholy of the deep. \"The calm sea became an embodiment of unspecified yearning, the waves an expression of vitality and dynamism,\" soliloquizes museum director B\u00e4tje. But the journey to the sea long remained an arduous, time-consuming one. It took the mail coach a good thirty hours to cover the distance from Hamburg to the North Frisian town of Aurich over bumpy, muddy roads. The express cab from Bremen only took about 16 hours to reach the East Frisian town of Norden - including six changes of horses along the way. \"It wasn't comfortable,\" explains B\u00e4tje. Not until the introduction of seaside tourist steamers out of Hamburg and Bremen to the islands and the expansion of the railways did the journey become easier. Strict bathing rules At first, it was primarily the well-to-do bourgeois and nobility who were able to afford a seaside holiday. Victorian-era society is known for its extreme prudishness, and the beach was not exempt. Bathing machines were essentially changing cabins on wheels that could be rolled into the surf. The sexes were kept strictly separated. Wet swimsuits could not be allowed to cling, thus revealing the body's contours. Women sported baggy flannel garments with bloomers underneath that swiftly became waterlogged to where the bather was risking her life. Hardly anyone really knew how to swim anyway. \"Most bathers wouldn't stay in the water any more than two minutes, often just seconds at a time. The English had a rule: 'Three dips and out',\" quips archivist Manfred B\u00e4tje, whose Bade-Museum is housed in a building for a former wave pool, just a few steps from Norderney's Weststrand, where, during the summer months, vacationers sunbathe in wicker beach chairs and on blankets, cooled by a salty sea breeze. Sunbathing first came in style early in the 20th century, and the first true swimsuits were produced in the United States. \"Starting in 1919, today's bathing culture gradually began to take shape,\" B\u00e4tje looks back. At the same time, ideals of beauty were in flux - such as the attitude towards tan skin, which had long been regarded as a mark of farmers and manual laborers. B\u00e4tje: \"People were still cultivating their genteel pallors.\" Water, Waves, Wellness Today, the sun worshipers are the devout masses, and seaside holidays are their pilgrimages. The North Sea resorts alone count some 12.9 million overnight stays annually. Health is once again a primary concern: sea air, sea water, sea salts and the algaes and mud used in",
        "generated_story": "A Brief History of the Seaside Holiday in Germany The Bade-Museum in Bremen, Germany, has published a brief history about the seaside holiday in the 19th century. It begins with Caspar David Friedrich, a German-born archaeologist who grew up on the Chalk Cliffs in North Frisian. He was born in 1818 in Norderney, near the German border with England. His father was a ship's captain, and his mother was the first German woman to be born there. The museum's curator, Manfred B\u00e4tje, said he was \"very impressed\" by the exhibition. \"I think it's a very interesting exhibition,\" he said, adding that he would like to see more of his father's work in this area. Basing his museum in Hamburg, the museum also has a large collection of artifacts from the 1780s and 18th-century, including a series of paintings of Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland, who died in 1799. These include a picture of a man in a boat, which he took to the North Sea, as well as a drawing of an old ship. In addition, there are a number of photographs from his time in England, where he spent many years studying the history of Europe and the Middle Ages. Some of these pictures are of him, but others are from a different time period. One of them shows him in his early 20s, when he traveled to Germany to study at the University of Cologne. Other pictures show him walking along the coast of Germany. Another picture shows a young man on a raft, with his head resting on his hands, looking out over the sea. This is the picture that was taken during the summer of 1790, just before he died. A few years later, he returned to his native Germany and was able to visit his family in Cuxhaven. At the same time, his wife and two children were visiting him. They had been staying at his parents' house for a few days, before they went to bed. There were also a couple of people who were staying with him at a nearby inn. After the ship sank, they had to leave the house and go back to their home in order to get a better view of their surroundings. That's when they decided to take a look around the country and see what they could find in their own home. What they found there were a lot of interesting things to look at. For one thing, it was very clear that they didn't want to go to a country where they were not allowed to have a child. But they did have the opportunity to spend time with their children. And that's something they wanted to do, too, because they knew they would never have to travel to another country again. So they took a trip to Europe. Now they are back home and they're going to try to find a way to make a new life for themselves. If they can't find one, then they'll be back at their old home, or at least a place to stay for the next few months, until they get back. I think they will be looking for someone who can help them find their way back into the family. You can also find them on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, Snapchat, Facebook and Instagram. On the other hand, you can check out the pictures of all the museums that have been opened since the beginning of this year's year, in which they've been open for several years. Many of those museums are located in Berlin, Cologne, Hamburg and Hamburg. More than 1,000 people have visited the city since then, most of whom are German citizens, according to one museum director, Christian Sell (epd), who has worked there for more than a decade."

The 71-year old can now leave the country for medical treatment. Brazilian judge Juliana Leal de Melo - who serves on a court overseeing amateur and professional sports - authorized the release of Hickey's passport upon payment of 1.5 million real ($435,000) bail. Hickey could now have medical treatment, the Rio state court system said in a statement. Reported to have a heart condition, Hickey was arrested three months ago during the Rio de Janeiro Olympics on ticket scalping charges. He is awaiting trial, though has not been imprisoned. Hickey has denied any wrongdoing. He is one of 10 people facing charges of ticket scalping, conspiracy and ambush marketing related to the Olympics. Hickey said he would fight \"each and every one\u201d of the Rio Games ticket-touting charges he faces. Hickey, who was also the head of the Olympic Council of Ireland, was released from custody last month, but must remain in Brazil until the case is heard. \"For clarity, I am not under house arrest as, like with so many things with this case, has been misreported by the media,\u201d Hickey said in a statement on Monday. Hickey was arrested on 10 August at a luxury beachfront hotel during the games. The authorities told Reuters last week that they believe the ring had operated for around eight years and was preparing for other Olympic events such as the 2020 Tokyo Games. jbh/bw (AP, AFP)",

The president of the EOC said he was freed after a two-week jail term. \"We are very pleased with the release of our president,\" he said in a statement, adding that he would be returning to Ireland in the coming days. He also said that his country's Olympic council would continue to work with him to ensure that Ireland's athletes are able to compete at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, which are due to take place in 2020 in Tokyo, Japan. In the meantime, he added, \"we will continue our efforts to make sure that we have the best athletes in our country.\" \"I am very happy that I have been released,\" the president said, according to Irish news agency Reuters. 'We have a lot of work ahead of us, and we are going to do very well for our athletes and our people. We will work very hard to get them to the next level of their sport.\" The release comes a day after an appeal by the Brazilian president, Juliana Leal de Melo, was rejected by a court in Dublin. It was the first time that a judge had been granted bail for an athlete who had not been convicted of a crime. A trial date has not yet been set for the case, but it is expected that the judge will be sentenced to two years in prison. Prosecutors have said they will seek to extradite the defendant to a European court, where he will face charges of fraud and money laundering, as well as other charges related to his role in organizing the Rio Olympics and the 2016 Tokyo Olympic Games.

        "target": "Reports: Merkel to run for fourth term as German chancellor German Chancellor Angela Merkel has confirmed that she will stand for the chancellery in the 2017 election, German media reports. The Christian Democrat Leader (CDU) first took office in 2005. After months of speculation, German Chancellor Angela Merkel reportedly told her fellow Christian Democrats (CDU) in Berlin on Sunday that she is prepared to lead the party into next year's election. An official statement is expected from Merkel at 7 p.m. local time (1800 UTC) on Sunday. The 62-year-old has faced a number of difficulties in recent months, from criticism over her handling of the migration crisis to falling support amid a rise in right-wing populist sentiment. Since taking office in 2005, however, Merkel has also been praised for navigating Europe's largest economy through the financial and eurozone crises. According to an Emnid survey published in the German newspaper \"Bild am Sonntag\" 55 percent of Germans are in favor of Merkel remaining head of the German government for another four years. Thirty-nine percent said they were against her re-election. Sign of stability Should she be elected next September, another full four-year term would put Merkel on a par with her mentor Helmut Kohl who set the post-war record and presided over the Fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. In light of the UK's shock vote to leave the European Union in June and Donald Trump's election last week as US president, Merkel's re-election is likely to be welcomed in many capitals as a sign of stability. During his final visit to Berlin this week, US President Barack Obama said that if he were able to, he would vote for his longtime partner and friend. In an interview with German magazine \"Spiegel\" and broadcaster \"ARD,\" Obama said: \"She has great credibility, and she is willing to fight for those values in a way that is very, very important.\" \"I'm glad that she's there and I think the German people should appreciate her. Certainly, I've appreciated her as a partner.\" Winning back votes With the less that a year until Germany heads to the polls, Merkel's CDU is now turning its efforts to wooing back disenchanted voters who have left the conservative camp to support the right-wing populists, Alternative for Germany (AfD). Formed as a Euro-sceptic party in 2013, the AfD won 4.7 percent of the popular vote in the last federal elections in 2013, just falling short of the 5 percent threshold required to enter the Bundestag - Germany's lower house of parliament. After benefiting from the rise in europsceptic, anti-immigration sentiment, seemingly sweeping across western Europe, the party now holds seats in nine of Germany's 16 states.",
        "generated_story": "German Chancellor Angela Merkel's bid for re-election comes amid growing anti-establishment sentiment Germany's Chancellor Helmut Kohl has announced his intention to run for a second term in office in the next parliament. He is expected to seek a third term as Chancellor of Germany. The chancellor's announcement comes as the country prepares to elect a new president in a snap election on Sunday. Chancellor Merkel has said she will not seek another term, but that she would not rule out the possibility of a change of government. \"I am not going to give up,\" she said in an interview with the German newspaper Bild am Sonntag, which was published Sunday, referring to the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the rise of Donald Trump's US-backed Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. Merkel, however, has not ruled out a possible run-off against Trump, who is seen as a potential candidate for the presidency. In a statement, Merkel said her party would seek to \"re-energize\" the party's position in parliament, adding that it would be \"very difficult\" to form a coalition government without the support of other parties, including the Christian Democrat Party (CDU), which is seeking a fourth term. Germany has been a major battleground in Europe since the 1990s, when it was divided between the US and Britain. It is the first time that the two countries have been able to reach a consensus on the future of democracy and democracy in their respective countries, and that is why it is so important to have a strong and stable government in place in Germany, as well as in other European countries like the United States, Britain, France, the Netherlands, Germany and even the UK. But it's not just Germany that Merkel is hoping for. She is also hoping to win over voters in her own country, a country that has a long-term political history and a deep political and economic commitment to democracy. That's why she is running for chancellor, despite the fact that many of her supporters believe she should not be allowed to take office until the end of next year. This year's election will be a referendum on whether or not Germany should leave the European Union (EU) and join the bloc. There are a number of candidates who have said they want to stay in power. One of them is Merkel. Another is US President Trump (pictured above), who has called on her to step down from her post as German Chancellor in order to focus on Europe's future. Both Merkel and Trump have called for an end to EU membership talks, while the other is likely to be held at the same time. They have also said that they will continue to work with Merkel to ensure that Germany remains a safe and prosperous country for future generations. However, they are not ready to accept the idea of an EU without an open Europe. For now, there is no clear path to a post-World War II Europe, where the EU is still in crisis. And there are still a lot of questions about how Germany will respond to this. On the one hand, it seems that there will still be an opportunity to make Germany a better place for its citizens to live and work in, rather than a place where they can live in poverty and unemployment. At the very least, that could be the case for many Germans who don't have the means to leave their homes, or who are unable to afford a car. Meanwhile, some of those who do have access to an apartment in Berlin will have to travel to other cities to get there. These are the people who can afford to rent a room, for example, to avoid paying rent. Others, such as Merkel herself, have expressed concern about the prospect of having to return to her home country."

        "target": "France's conservatives: Combating the National Front with a swing to the right A staunch conservative is joining the race for the French presidency. Republican candidate Francois Fillon could turn into a big problem for right-wing extremist Marine Le Pen's National Front. France's Republicans are moving to the right: by choosing Francois Fillon, voters nominated a presidential candidate who has a reputation as a staunch conservative. The former prime minister has already announced that he intends to refocus politics with the traditional family in mind. Fillon takes a dim view of homosexual couples adopting children. He wants to introduce a cap on the number of refugees allowed into France, he intends to make it harder for foreign nationals to access the social welfare system, and he wants to put Muslim communities and mosques under government control. In addition, Fillon advocates a renationalization of school curricula. Fillon makes gains in FN territory Fillon's agenda could turn out to be a problem for the \"National Front\" (FN). The 62-year-old appeals to similar sentiments as the right-wing party's base: concern about foreign domination and loss of identity, fear of terrorism and crime. \"For a long time, FN was the only political force that addressed those fears,\" said Henrik Uterwedde of the German-French Institute (dfi) in Ludwigsburg. \"Now a politician has arrived on the scene who addresses those fears using a different language and makes them a political offer.\" In rural, Catholic France especially, where traditions still matter a great deal, the avowed Catholic Fillon strikes a chord with his proposals pertaining to family and society policies. He receives support from traditional Catholic groups who, for years, have been able to mobilize crowds for demonstrations against gay marriage. During the intraparty election campaign, Fillon predominantly traveled to France's villages and small towns - regions which FN leader Marine Le Pen had labeled the \"forgotten France,\" regarding herself as their foremost lobbyist. \"Fillon has made gains in an environment that is also canvassed by Le Pen,\" Andreas Jung, Chairman of the Bundestag's German-French parliamentary group, told German broadcaster rbb-Inforadio. \"He does not represent the lofty levels of Parisian politics, but rather provincial entrenchment. Fillon is committed to traditional values, like the family. Therefore, he may not only be capable of defeating Le Pen, but also of taking the lead during the first ballot.\" 'Most dangerous candidate for FN' Consequently, the FN camp is less than enthusiastic about the conservative's candidacy. \"Because of Fillon, we now have a strategy problem,\" Marion Marechal Le Pen, the FN leader's niece, recently told journalists. \"He is the most dangerous candidate for the National Front.\" Pollsters' findings appear to support that statement. Recent surveys establish Fillon as the current favorite in the French presidential election scheduled for next May. However, Fillon's election is not a foregone conclusion. By denouncing the conservative candidate as a member of the establishment, FN tries to win over those who are frustrated with politics and politicians in general. There is persistent opposition against his economic-liberal plans in particular. Fillon wants to abolish the 35-hour working week and raise the retirement age to 65 years. In addition, he wants to cut 500,000 jobs in the public sector and reform industrial law. Fillon is known as an admirer of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. \"Issues pertaining to liberal economic policy have always been heavily contested in France,\" said Uterwedde. \"Fillon's adversaries have already taken up their positions, criticizing what, in France, is called 'ultra-liberalism.'\" That was one of the nastiest words in French politics, he added. An offer for the left Fillon wants to raise VAT by 2 percent. This would predominantly hurt low-income households. Exactly that clientele, however, is wooed by FN with a program that is regarded as rather left-wing. The right-wing extremists are on a clear anti-globalization course, intending to seal off the French economy against foreign countries and exit from the European Union. The party is already trying to present Fillon as a symbol of anarchic, ultra-liberal capitalism. \"Francois Fillon will even go beyond EU demands for austerity and liberalism,\" David Rachline, Marine Le Pen's election campaign manager, wrote on Twitter. According to current polls, it is very likely that Fillon will have to face Marine Le Pen in a runoff election in May. The main hazard for the Republican candidate: his economic-liberal course could deter left-wing voters from choosing the conservative in order to avert Le Pen. \"Francois Fillon will have to start making offers, also to those voters who are closer to the center and more moderate,\" said France expert Uterwedde. \"And he will, prior to the runoff election at the latest, have to make offers to left-wing voters - without changing his original course.\"",
        "generated_story": "French presidential candidate Francois Fillon is the most dangerous candidate for France's presidential election The French president has been accused of being a \"dangerous candidate\" for the country's political future. The right-wing National Front (FN) candidate, Marine Le Pen, is one of the more dangerous candidates in the French presidential race, according to German-French Institute researcher Henrik Uterwedde, who has studied French politics for more than a decade. \"Fillon has a lot of baggage,\" he told DW, adding that he had \"a lot to say about the current situation in France.\" \"I think he's a dangerous person, and I don't want to be a danger to the people of France, but I think we should be very careful about what we say to each other and to our own people,\" said the author of a new book, \"The French Revolution,\" which was published last year in Germany's edition of The New York Times. He also said he was \"very worried\" about Fillion's chances of winning the presidency, which he hopes will be decided by a vote of no confidence in his own party's candidate. But he is not the only one who could be dangerous, he said. In Germany, where the FN is currently leading in opinion polls, the party is expected to make a strong showing in a crucial election year. It is also expected that the far-right Front National will win a large number of seats in parliament, including the Bundestag and the lower house of parliament. That would be the first time that a major party candidate has won a parliamentary election in Europe since Margaret Thatcher's death in 1979. And it's not just the left-leaning FN that is at the forefront of French political discourse. There are other candidates, too, such as the Socialists and Republicans, as well as candidates for Chancellor Angela Merkel and Prime Minister Manuel Valls. However, there are also those who are more likely to run for president. For example, former German Chancellor Josef Inforadio and former French President Nicolas Sarkozy, both of whom have been in power for a long time, are the two most likely candidates to win the election. They are both candidates who have a good chance of becoming the next president of Europe's largest country, France. Both of them, in fact, have had a very good run in recent years. So far, though, they have not been able to convince voters that their candidate is a threat to their country. On the other hand, their chances are very slim. If they do win, it is likely that they will have to face a tough fight, because they are not going to have the votes of their own voters. At the same time they could face an uphill battle in an election that could see them lose the popular vote if they fail to secure the support of voters in their respective regions. This is especially true if the candidates are facing a serious challenge from the right. Many of these candidates have already been defeated by the Republicans and their allies in other European countries, while others have faced a similar challenge. Some have even been forced to give up their positions in order to stay in office. Others, however, do not have an easy path to victory. One candidate in particular has already made it clear that she will not be allowed to leave office until the end of this year, when she is due to take the oath of office in May. Another candidate who faces an uncertain future is former Chancellor Nicolas Maduro."

        "target": "No more'veggie sausages?' Minister wants ban on meat names for plant-based foods Terms like \"vegan sausage\" and \"vegetarian schnitzel\" confuse consumers and need to be replaced, according to German Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt. He wants new names for plant-based dishes. Germans shouldn't be biting into a \"vegan sausage\" or cutting a slice of \"vegetarian schnitzel,\" German Minister for Food and Agriculture Christian Schmidt told the daily \"Bild\" newspaper on Wednesday, adding that names traditionally used for meat-based dishes should not be applied to plant-based foods. \"I don't want anyone to pretend that these pseudo-meat dishes are actual meat dishes,\" Schmidt said. The minister said manufacturers should come up with distinct names for plant-based meat-substitutes. Schmidt also said meat was part of a healthy and balanced diet and belonged on the menu in schools and kindergartens. Soy? Steak? Soy-steak? Schmidt's statements echo demands from the German Farmers Association and German Butchers Association. Both lobbying groups have asked for a ban on terms such as \"vegetarian ham\" or \"soy steak.\" Schmidt's call for plant-based foods to have their own name was also made in October in the state of Lower Saxony, a state with many large livestock farms. The German Vegetarian Association, however, argued against the proposal. A spokesperson for the organization said that \"names that are used for animal-based products should without a doubt also be legal to use for vegetarian substitute products.\" More meatless 'whatever-you-want-to-call-thems' The market for vegetarian and vegan dishes has grown steadily in the past few years in Germany, partly at the expense of the meat industry. According to a research paper by the Institute for the Study of Trade (IfH), revenue for vegetarian and vegan products in Germany was 454 million euros ($474 million) in 2015 and grew by more than 100 percent between 2010 and 2015. In the same time period, the demand for meat products fell by almost 10 percent. mb/sms (dpa, epd)",
        "generated_story": "German Minister for Food and Agriculture Christian Schmidt: No more'vegetarian sausages' and no more \"vegatarian schnitzel' German Agriculture Minister Christian Schmid has announced that he will no longer be minister for food and agriculture in the next few months. According to the Institute for the Study of Trade (ISSET) in Lower Saxony, the ministry of agriculture and trade has decided that it will not be able to continue to provide \"pre-packaged meat\" to German farmers. \"We are not going to give up meat,\" the institute said in a statement on Wednesday, adding that \"we will continue our efforts to improve the quality of the meat we produce.\" The institute, which is based at the University of Mainz in Germany, said it would continue its research on the subject of meat and vegetables. It also said that the Ministry of Agriculture and Trade had decided not to make any further investments in meat, vegetables and dairy products. The Institute said the government had also decided to take steps to reduce the number of greenhouse gas emissions, and that this would be the first time it had done so since 2010, when the German Vegetarian Association (German Farmers Association) was founded. Schmidt, who is also the agriculture minister, told German newspaper Bild that his ministry would \"continue to invest in research and development of new technologies and new products.\" Schmidt said he was \"very pleased\" with the results of a study conducted by the IISET, a German think tank, that showed that Germany's meat industry was growing at a faster rate than it was in 2010. But he added that there was no need to increase the production capacity of German meat products, as the industry had been growing rapidly in recent years. In addition, he said, \"I am very pleased that we have made the decision to stop making meat-based products,\" referring to meat that has been used as a staple in German cuisine for centuries. However, there is still a long way to go in terms of how much meat is produced and how it is consumed. For example, in 2015, Germany produced 454 million euros ($474 million) worth of beef, pork, fish and eggs. That's a lot of money for a country that is struggling to produce enough meat to feed a population of 1.5 million people. This is a huge increase from the previous year, but it's still not enough to cover the costs of producing meat. So, for now, we will just have to wait until the end of 2015 to find out what the future holds for this year's harvest. I think that's the right time to do something about it. We will see what we can do about this. If we do not do that, then we won't have any more meat at all. There will be no meat on our plate. And we'll have meat in our hands, too. You can't eat meat without it, right? But we're not talking about meat or vegetables, either. Meat is not a meat product, so we don't need meat for that. Food is the most important thing in life. How can we make meat into meat? How do we eat it? What do you eat? And how can you make it into something that tastes good? The answer is very simple: You just eat the food you want to eat. Then you put it in your mouth and you can eat something you've never eaten before.\""

        "target": "The Shift in Libya's Relations to the West The La Belle disco bombing in Berlin on April 5, 1986 was ruled to be Libya's doing. Twenty years later, relations between Libya and Europe have done an about-face. The Berlin disco \"La Belle\" was packed as usual on the night of April 5, 1986. Among its guests were many US soldiers, who were certainly not thinking of politics, the Middle East or strained relations between the United States and Libya. But reality caught up with them: a bomb detonated near the dance floor that night, killing two Americans and a Turkish woman. Over 200 people were injured. A Berlin court ruled that Libya and its intelligence services were responsible for the bombing. In 2001, following a nearly four-year long trial, the judges convicted a Libyan diplomat and three others to prison sentences between 12 and 14 years. The big oil-exporting country in the meantime was busy working on its reputation. Already in the 1990s, Tripoli began striving to improve its relations to the European Union. Financial reparation opened the door to Europe In 2004, the Gaddafi International Foundation for Charity Associations and the legal representatives of the German La Belle victims settled on $35 million in compensation. This opened the door to Europe. Just a few weeks later, Germany's chancellor at the time, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, visited Moammar Gadhafi in a traditional Bedouin tent outside of Tripoli. Britain's Prime Minister Tony Blair also paid Gadhafi a visit. A few months earlier, in April 2004, the European Union had welcomed the Libyan leader to Brussels. It was Gadhafi's first official visit to Europe in 15 years. Bernd Westphal, the German ambassador to Libya, said bilateral relations had been through difficult times. \"The German Embassy in Tripoli today is working for a quick return to the liveliness of close relations between Germany and Libya,\" Westphal said. \"We want to build on our traditional friendship with Libya and we want to strengthen the political, economic and cultural cooperation between our two countries and peoples.\" Business interests booming in Libya In the past few years, Libya has moved from being the supporter of international terrorism to an attractive economic partner for the West. European business representatives have been increasingly knocking on Libya's door. Even the United States is showing increased interest in the northern African nation. Washington is pleased that Libya announced at the end of 2003 that it would discontinue its efforts to develop and produce weapons of mass destruction. Libya's ambassador to Germany, Said Abdulaati, said political and economic relations between Libya and Germany were \"excellent.\" Libya is one of Germany's strongest trading partners in northern Africa. Last year, Germany exported goods to Libya worth 657.7 million euros ($805.7 million), according to the German Federal Statistics Office. \"The economy is the driving power in German-Libyan relations,\" said Abdulaati in an interview with the Arab-German association for trade and industry. But Germany isn't the only European country making deals in Libya. France last month signed an accord with Libya on peaceful nuclear research. \"This accord represents a qualitative leap in relations between the two countries and proves that Libya has transformed its weapons of mass destruction into constructive weapons,\" Public Works Minister Maatuk Maatuk said at the signing ceremony in March. \"We are telling the world that we are moving towards the development of Libyan nuclear technology for peaceful purposes.\" This week, the Netherlands' Economics Minister Laurens Jan Brinkhorst will visit Libya to negotiate gas and oil agreements. It will be the first high-level visit by a Dutch official since Gadhafi took power in 1969.",
        "generated_story": "The Shift in Libya's Relations With Europe The shift in Libyan relations between Germany and the United States has been marked by a change in the direction of the country's relations with Europe. The German Federal Statistics Office (FSO) has released a report on the situation in Tripoli, Libya, which it says shows that the Libyan government has lost a significant amount of its influence over the region's political and economic development. According to the FOSO report, \"Libya's relationship with the European Union has changed dramatically since the end of Gaddafi's rule in 2011.\" The report said that in 2004, the German government had received a total of $805.7 million ($805 million) in aid from the US, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and France. It said this was the first time the two countries had been able to reach out to each other. \"We have a lot of respect for the people of Libya,\" said Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, head of Germany's federal statistics office, in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. He added that he was \"very happy\" to receive the money, adding that it was a \"great honor\" for Germany to be a part of a country that had lost so much influence on its political future. But he also noted that there was still a long way to go in terms of economic and political ties between Libya and Europe, as well as the Middle East, and that \"we have to work together to make sure that we can make the most of this opportunity.\" \"I am very happy that I have the opportunity to contribute to this development,\" he said. In addition, he added, there is the possibility that Libya could become a model for other countries to follow, such as France and Germany. However, it is not clear that this will be the case in any other country. Germany has long been a member of NATO and NATO, but it has also been one of Europe's most important trading partners for many years. That is why the EU is so interested in helping Libya develop its economy and its people. This is one reason why we are so eager to help Libya as a whole, because we know it's a very important country for our people and we want to do the right thing for them, not just for us. There is also the fact that many of our friends and allies in Europe are also willing to take part in this kind of cooperation. For example, we have our own embassies in Brussels and Berlin. We have an embassy in London, where the British Embassy is located. And we also have embassies there, too. These embassies are a great source of information on Libya. You can find out more about Libya by visiting our embassies here and in other European countries, including the Netherlands, Belgium, Turkey, Egypt, Jordan, Tunisia and Turkey. They all have their own embassy there. I am happy to say that our government is working on this issue and I think it will help us to get a better understanding of what is going on in our country and how to deal with this situation. As for Libya itself, I would like to think that they are doing a good job in that regard. If you look at the past few years, you will see that a number of things have changed. One of those things is that Libyan people have become more and more independent, that is, they have more freedom of movement and freedom to live and work freely in their country, rather than the other way around. At the same time, people are becoming less and less aware of how things are going to turn out in different countries and where they're going. So, this is a really important issue for me. What is happening with Libya right now is we need to find a way forward for this country to move forward and make it a more stable and prosperous country.\""

        "target": "EU Mulls Warning Labels to Curb Alcohol Abuse While still targeting smoking, European Union's public health commissioner is considering adding alcohol to the list of vices the bloc should clamp down on. In a report commissioned by the European Commission, the London Institute for Alcohol Studies recommended raising the legal age to buy alcohol to 18 (in some countries, such as Germany, 16-year-olds can buy beer), lowering the permitted blood alcohol level while driving to 0.5, banning alcohol advertising on TV and in movies as well as adding warning labels to bottles as ways of preventing alcohol abuse across the bloc. Which of the methods EU Health Commissioner Markos Kyprianou actually introduces will be announced \"sometime in the autumn,\" according to a spokesperson. Other options include a 10 percent increase in the price of alcohol. Kyprianou has, however, hinted that he favors warning labels -- similar to those that appear on packs of cigarettes -- that make the dangers of alcohol clear. \"Drinking harms your unborn baby\" on bottles? Brewers and wine makers across Europe, however, have come out against placing \"Drinking Kills\" or other labels on bottles of beer. \"Warning labels are the completely wrong way to go,\" Peter Hahn, head of the German Brewers Association told Germany's Express newspaper. \"The do not deter people who have lost a sense of how much to drink and unsettle the people who enjoy a beer after work.\" Industry groups also opposed implementing EU-wide guidelines in countries with traditionally different ways of approaching drinking and drinking problems. \"Policies that do not consider cultural and regional differences, will fail to deal with the social problems, while at the same time generate a rising level of political objections,\" said Rodolphe de Looz-Corswarem of Brewers of Europe. Keeping social vices separate Green party EU parliamentarian Hiltrud Breyer meanwhile called on the alcohol industry to stop \"saber rattling\" before it sees the a final version of the EU's strategy to prevent alcohol abuse. German Consumer Affairs Minister Horst Seehofer said he would wait to see what Kyprianou's actual suggestions are before commenting. Other German politicians, however, were more willing to voice the opposition to putting a sip of wine on the same footing with a puff of a cigarette. \"People should not expect that a skull and crossbones end up on every bottle of beer and wine,\" German EU representative Karl-Heinz Florenz told Der Tagesspiegel newspaper, adding that when it comes to alcohol, each member state should be responsible for how it deals with alcohol abuse. The harm of \"passive drinking\" While cigarettes are a health risk from the first puff, moderate drinking can actually be healthy and there is no danger from \"passive drinking,\" Peter Liese, a German EU representative, told the paper. The commission's report disagreed with Liese's conclusion, saying alcohol abuse had a major role in as many as 200,000 deaths in Europe due to car accidents and disease and played a role in some 60,000 underweight births. The report also estimated the effects of alcohol abuse of costing the EU 125 billion euros ($161 billion) in 2003. Some 25 percent of men and 10 percent of women in Europe drink what the EU considers to be more than healthy amounts of alcohol and between 3 percent and 5 percent are suffering from alcoholism, according to EU statistics.",
        "generated_story": "German Brewers Association: What is the harm of drinking alcohol in Germany? What does it mean to drink alcohol? The European Union's Consumer Affairs Commissioner, Peter Liese, has warned that \"passive drinking\" is harmful to the health of the consumer and the environment. In 2003, the European Commission issued a warning to German brewers about the dangers of alcohol consumption. The warning came in the form of a letter from the German Brewers' Association (BABA) to its president, Hans-Heinz Florenz, who said that alcohol was \"not a good thing\" for consumers. \"It's not good for people's health,\" he said, adding that it was a \"very bad thing.\" The letter was sent to Dieter Hahn, head of Germany's consumer affairs agency, which is responsible for regulating alcohol. It was written in response to a question posed by a member of parliament, Hiltrud Breyer, about how alcohol could be used as a substitute for alcohol, and how it could have been used to treat people who drank alcohol at home. But the letter did not mention alcohol as an alternative to drinking. Instead, it said: \"I think it's a very good idea to limit alcohol use in a way that doesn't lead to harm to consumers.\" It also said it would be \"a very bad idea\" to allow alcohol to be consumed at the same time as other alcoholic beverages, such as wine, beer and beer. This is not the first time alcohol has been banned in Europe, but the second was in 2003 when it came to alcohol and tobacco products. That was the last time the EU had banned alcohol on the market. Since then, however, alcohol sales have fallen by more than 40 percent, while the number of people consuming alcohol is down by about 10 percent. And that's before you know it, because alcohol can be sold at a high price. There is no way to know how much alcohol a person is drinking, or how many people are consuming. So, what does this mean for the public? It means that people have to pay a lot of attention to what they're drinking and who they are drinking to get the most from it. What do you think about this? Is it something that can only be done by the person who owns a bottle of beer? I don't think so. I think that is a really important question. How much is it worth to people to have a drink in their own home? That's the question of whether it is worth it to them to buy a beer at all. Is that really the right thing to do? If so, why do we need to talk about it? In the past few years, we've had to ask ourselves that. We've seen the consequences of this in our own lives. Now we're going to try to figure out what we can do to prevent it from happening again. For example, how can we make sure that the alcohol we drink is safe? We can't have alcohol that we consume, so we should be able to control the amount we have consumed. If we do that, there's no harm in doing that.\" \"We're not drinking enough alcohol,\" said Peter Looz-Corswarem, vice president of Consumers Affairs, in an interview with the newspaper Der Spiegel."

        "target": "All or nothing for Bayern in Champions final Bayern Munich have one last chance to salvage a season that has otherwise been marked by their inability to beat Borussia Dortmund: a win against Chelsea in the Champions League final at their home stadium. All season long, Bayern Munich have been consumed with achieving one goal: reaching the final of the Champions League, held at their own Allianz Arena in Munich, and raising the trophy in front of their home fans. After finishing a distant second place to Dortmund in the Bundesliga and dismally losing to them 5-2 in the German Cup final, Bayern Munich are in a must-win situation Saturday against Chelsea. A loss would be the final straw in a disappointing season for a team that can't stand second place. A win for Bayern would mean redemption, to some extent, for their shortcomings in the league. Key players were rested down the stretch in the Bundesliga, especially before the two legs of Bayern's European semifinal against Real Madrid. That was an indication that Bayern had given up on the league and put all their eggs in one basket, hoping for a big payoff with the Champions League title. The same can be said for the German Cup final against Dortmund: true, Bayern essentially beat themselves by making mistake after mistake, but Bayern could, if they win Saturday, wipe the slate clean. Saving the season Win this match, and all will be forgiven in Munich. Lose, and it will be Bayern's second straight season without a piece of hardware, not to mention the heartbreak of losing the biggest match at Allianz Arena since it opened in 2005. \"We must not even think about [losing],\" said Bayern's Franck Ribery on Thursday. \"If we win the Champions League, then we can forget about not winning the league or the cup, nobody will care about that.\" Bayern are a team that thrives under pressure, and the high stakes of this match will be good for them. Chelsea are a team that showed in their semifinal upset of Barcelona that they can rise to a challenge, even if that challenge is simply holding on against a superior opponent. \"We are not the favorites of the game, we are playing away,\" Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech said on Thursday. \"It is very rare when you have the home team playing in the home stadium, using the home dressing room, so I think the advantage goes to Bayern Munich because of that. But we know we have a chance and we will fight for it.\" But this match will come down to the team that can better take advantage of holes that have been blown in each team's defense due to injuries and suspensions. Filling the gaps Between the two sides, seven starting players will miss out on the final. Chelsea saw Raul Meireles, Ramires, and Branislav Ivanovic each get their third yellow card in the second leg against Barcelona, and captain John Terry was given a straight red. Terry and Ivanovic are fixtures on Chelsea's backline, which was already at half-strength due to hamstring injuries suffered by Gary Cahill and David Luiz. Chelsea coach Roberto di Matteo hopes those two are fit enough for the final, since Chelsea will need all the help they can get in the back. For Bayern, David Alaba and Holger Badstuber - both defenders - and Luiz Gustavo, a defensive midfielder, are also suspended for picking up three yellow cards. The impact of the suspensions will hit Chelsea the most. In addition to a weakened back line, Meireles and Ramires are mainstays on offense, supporting strikers Didier Drogba or Fernando Torres. With Ramires out, Drogba could start as striker, with Torres moving to the wing. At any rate, there is more uncertainty in The Blues' lineup than there is in Bayern's, who will be able to rely on striker Mario Gomez and the dynamic-duo of Arjen Robben and Ribery on the wings as they have all season. Most of the question marks will still be defensive for both teams, but to think that this is an indication of a high-scoring affair on Saturday would be a discredit to both team's last lines of defense. Between the posts Neither side would be competing in the final if it wasn't for the heroics of the teams' keepers. Cech defended against wave after wave of attacks from Barcelona in the semifinal for Chelsea, and Manuel Neuer showed nerves of steel in Bayern's penalty shootout in the final leg against Real Madrid, blocking penalties from Madrid stars Cristiano Ronaldo and Kaka. Chelsea's best shot will be to come out of the gate at a sprint and gain an early advantage against Bayern, who will be doing everything they can to keep their long-cultivated dream-final in their control. Otherwise, Bayern's determination to salvage their season may be enough to carry them through to the trophy ceremony - at home, just like they planned it.

        "generated_story": "Bayern Munich, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Chelsea face off at the Allianz Arena on Saturday in the Champions League final. The Blues, who have won the last three Bundesliga titles, will be without their best player for a long time. They will have to wait until the end of the season to make up for lost time, but they have a chance to do just that. At the very least, they'll be able to show they're not the worst team in Europe. \"I'm very happy to be back,\" said Raul Meireles, the Blues' head coach, in an interview with the BBC's Rina Goldenberg. He added: \"It's a great opportunity for me to get back to the top of my game. I can't wait to see what the future holds for my team.\" \"We're going to try and make the best of what we've got,\" he said, adding that he was \"very happy\" with his team-mates' performances on Thursday and Friday, when they won their first-ever German Cup title. But it's not just about the players. It's also about how the team is playing, too, and how they are performing in front of their own fans. For the first time since the 2006-07 season, there's been a lot of talk of a new generation of players being brought in to play for the club. And that's the way it should be. There's no doubt about it: The best players are the ones who are playing for their country. That's why I'm so happy for them, because they've been playing so well for so long. What's more, I don't think they really know what's going on in their lives right now. How can they be so good? What do they know? They know that they can be good at what they do, right? How do you know if you're good enough to win a Bundesliga title? Well, that depends on who you are. You can either be a good player or a bad one. Either way, you can see that you've made the right decision. If you want to improve your team's chances of reaching the next level, then you need to take a step back and think about what you have done so far. Who knows, maybe you won't be as good as you were in 2005 or 2006, or even in 2006 or 2007. So, what can you do to help them get there? I think you'll find out in a few weeks. Let's see how it all plays out, shall we? And then let's get on with it. In the meantime, we'll see if we can get the job done on the pitch. After all, this is a very important game for us. This is the biggest game of our lives. We've had a couple of years in which we have had to put up with this kind of pressure. Last year we were the only team to beat Bayern. Now we're the second team, after we beat Borussia Dortmund 3-0 on Wednesday. On Thursday, it was Bayern who beat Chelsea 2-1 in Munich. Since then, Chelsea have been the most successful team of all time in Germany's top division, winning the Bundesliga and the European Cup, as well as the Europa League, with a total of seven trophies in all competitions, including the UEFA Cup and Bundesliga. However, last season's Bundesliga was a different story altogether. Bayern have already won three trophies, while Chelsea won just one, which they lost to Manchester City in 2004 and Manchester United two years ago. Meanwhile, Atletico Madrid have yet to reach the quarter-finals, where they were eliminated by Barcelona in extra time by a penalty shootout. Barcelona have also won two more trophies this season. Chelsea, meanwhile, have not won a single trophy since 2005."

UN leader Ban Ki-moon expressed \"deep regret\" on Monday that political leaders had failed to make progress on a constitution in Nepal, expressing concern about instability within the country. Security forces were put on high alert, with riot police patrolling streets after calls by the opposition for the resignation of Maoist Prime Minister Baburam Bhattarai. \"Nepal has entered an uncertain constitutional and political period,\" Ban warned in a statement read by his spokesman Martin Nesirky. \"The government and the political leaders, as well as leaders of various communities, need to demonstrate the courage and wisdom to come together to address the challenges the nation faces,\" the statement added. Repeated deadlines expired Politicians were to have agreed upon a new framework for the country's political future by Sunday. However, the representation of ethnic minorities and castes within a federal structure has proved a major sticking point in efforts to draw up a secular constitution. Bhattarai on Sunday said that parliament, elected in 2008 after a decade of civil war, would be disbanded after repeated deadlines had been broken. New elections are due to be held in November, but the opposition has criticized the premier's unilateral decision to call the poll. The country's Hindu monarchy, which ruled for centuries, was abolished after Maoist rebels gave up arms and won elections in 2008.

The Nepalese Prime Minister Baburam Bhattarai has called for a general election in Nepal, which is due to take place on November 6. Nepal is facing an unprecedented political crisis in which thousands of people have fled the country's capital, Kathmandu, to seek refuge in neighboring Nepal. Thousands of protesters have taken to the streets to protest against the government's failure to hold elections. \"We are not going to allow this to happen again,\" said Ban Ki-moon, who heads the United Nations human rights office in New York. He added that the situation was \"very serious\" and that \"the people of Nepal should not be allowed to make their own decisions without the consent of their elected representatives.\" The government has said it will not allow the election to be held until after the general elections in November. Opposition parties have accused the prime minister of trying to influence the outcome of the elections, a charge that has been rejected by the Nepal government. But the opposition has vowed to continue its campaign, saying it would continue to fight for the right to vote. It has also called on Nepal to step up its anti-incumbency campaign and to ensure that it does not interfere with the electoral process. A UN spokesman said the protests were \"unprecedented,\" adding that Nepal had \"no choice but to go ahead with their campaign.\" Nepal has repeatedly rejected the idea of holding elections on the basis of ethnic and religious grounds, and has not ruled out the possibility of a new constitution, but it is not clear if that will be the case. In the past two years, Nepal and Nepal have fought a bloody civil war, with a number of political parties and armed groups fighting each other. At least one Nepali leader has died, while at least two others have been injured. Nepaleans have also been killed in clashes with police and soldiers, according to a government spokesman. There are also reports that police are searching for suspected Maoists and Maoist sympathizers. According to an official statement on Monday, there were no reports of any clashes between the two sides, although the army and police have said they are still fighting to prevent any further unrest. On Sunday, an army spokesman told AFP news agency that there was no sign of an imminent military coup, though it was possible that a ceasefire could be in place by Monday. Earlier this year, police had been deployed to try to break up a protest by protesters who had gathered near the border with India. Police had also set up checkpoints and barricaded themselves inside the city of Pokhara, where the protesters had tried to enter the area. They were prevented from entering by a police escort. Authorities have not said how many people were injured, however, nor did they say whether they were killed, or if the police were involved in any sort of violence. Many people are believed to have died during the clashes. Officials have blamed the violence on a lack of coordination between police, security forces and the military. However, they did not say who was behind the unrest, as they have denied any involvement in it and said that they had no knowledge of what was going on. Last year's protests broke out in several cities in southern Nepal after a curfew was imposed by authorities in an attempt to quell it. Some of those who were arrested were later released on bail. Others were charged with rioting and attempted to flee."

        "target": "Oracle loses court fight over software resale rules A European court has ruled that it's permissible to resell software licenses even if the package has been downloaded directly from the Internet. It sided with a German firm in its legal battle with US giant Oracle. The European Court of Justice on Tuesday ruled that used software licenses may generally be resold by individuals or companies. The Luxembourg-based court thus sided with the German firm UsedSoft in a protracted legal battle with US software giant Oracle. The ruling made it clear that trade in used software was permissible even if the software had not been shipped on a physical medium such as a CD or DVD, but had been digitally downloaded from the Internet. UsedSoft's business model hinges completely on reselling used packages or legally obtained license keys for them. By reselling the keys to clients, the latter are then able to download the latest version of a given program directly from a company's Internet site and obtain all new updates and patches in the process. Legal clarity Oracle had sued UsedSoft over its business model, trying to prevent buyers of used software licenses from downloading programs again. But the European court ruled that the so-called principle of exhaustion applied whenever software was originally sold to a customer for an unlimited time span, not giving the maker of the software the right to prevent the resale of that software. \"The door for the trade in used software has been pushed wide open throughout the European Union,\" UsedSoft said in a statement, welcoming \"perfect legal safety on the market.\" The court in Luxembourg emphasized, though, that whoever resold pieces of original software and their accompanying licenses must erase every copy on their own computers in advance and was not allowed to keep a copy after resale. hg/mz (AFP, dpa)",

The EU's top court ruled on Tuesday that resellers of software must be allowed to sell the software they sell to customers in the EU. Luxembourg's court, which is part of the bloc's EU-wide competition watchdog, said the decision was a \"significant step forward\" in a case that could have implications for the rights of companies that sell software to EU citizens. \"This is a very important step,\" the court said in its ruling. It also said it would be illegal for a company such as Oracle (Oracle) or UsedSoft (UsedSoft) to re-sell software that has been illegally downloaded from its servers in Luxembourg, Luxembourg and the United States. In a decision that is expected to be appealed to the lower court on Wednesday, the ECJ said that the right of a software reseller is not the same as that of an individual who has downloaded software from a computer. Oracle has argued that downloading software is illegal under EU law because it violates the terms of its licensing agreement with the US and other EU member states. According to a Luxembourg court ruling, Oracle's software can only be reselled if it is downloaded by a user who doesn't have a valid license. That's because the company has a legal obligation to do so, and that's the only way it can sell its software on the Internet. This is the first time that an EU court had ruled against the use of such software. (AFP, dpa)"

The Curiosity rover will soon re-start its sluggish search for signs of life. NASA's Mars rover, \"Curiosity,\" will wrap up a lengthy self-testing phase on Thursday, freeing it up to continue exploring the surface of the Red Planet. Mission manager Jennifer Tropser told reporters in a conference call on Wednesday evening that the plan, once the final checks were completed, was to \"drive, drive, drive\" until Curiosity discovers a rock suitable for analysis. She added that the instrument checks have delivered positive results. \"Through every phase of the check-out, Curiosity has performed almost flawlessly,\" Tropser said. \"The success so far of these activities has been outstanding.\" Many of the tests have concerned Curiosity's robotic arm. The 2.1-meter (7-feet) appendage will be used to pick out and sample rocks and soil. NASA is investigating whether Mars can sustain life, or whether it could in the past. The tests were designed to identify any damage sustained during its interplanetary flight and also to ensure that the arm still functioned properly on Mars, with its different temperatures and gravity. The Mars rover landed in the giant Gale Crater, near the Martian equator, on August 5; it has so far moved about 109 meters within the crater. The rover is traveling east, heading first to an intersection called Glenelg, where three types of terrain meet. This is likely to be the location for the first rock and soil samples, though NASA said Curiosity was unlikely to arrive there for several weeks. Curiosity's ultimate destination is the nearby Aeolis Mons or Mount Sharp, a 3-mile-high mound of rock rising out of the crater. Mount Sharp is about 4.3 miles (7 kilometers) away from Curiosity's landing site.

        "target": "A borderline war The crisis in Syria is in danger of drawing in neighboring countries. Despite the Syrian government's immediate apology, the shelling on the Turkish border has led to concerns about possible escalation. These weren't the first incidents on the Syrian-Turkish border, but the fact that several people on the Turkish side were killed by Syrian shells on Wednesday (03.10.2012) has brought the conflict between the two countries to a new level. It has led the Turkish military to retaliate for the first time. Several people were killed when Turkey shelled Syrian territory. But neither Turkey, which is a member of NATO, nor Syria would benefit from a broader conflict. An adviser to the Turkish president tweeted, \"Turkey has no interest in a war with Syria.\" Volker Perthes, director of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs in Berlin, agrees: \"Assad has no interest in an escalation,\" he told DW. \"That can be seen from the fact that the Syrian information minister apologized and expressed his regret over the victims immediately after the attack on Turkish territory.\" Perthes doesn't think it's likely that the Syrian President, Bashar Assad, wants to provoke Turkey to intervene in Syria. \"That would only accelerate the fall of his regime,\" he said. It's not yet clear who was responsible for the shelling. According to Syria's ally, Russia, it was a \"tragic accident.\" Relationship damaged The armed incidents on the Syrian-Turkish border have been going on for months. According to Amnesty International, some 300,000 Syrians have left their country since the start of the uprising against Assad, and many of them have fled to Turkey. The relationship between the two countries, which used to be close, has deteriorated dramatically, and the Turkish government is now openly supporting the Syrian opposition. \"Turkey is itself a player in the Syrian conflict,\" said Perthes. \"It provides shelter for many refugees and it's through Turkey that supplies come for the opposition.\" NATO has lined up behind Turkey and told Syria to end its \"flagrant violations of international law.\" Call for 'great discretion' The German chancellor, Angel Merkel, has also positioned herself alongside Turkey. \"We call on all parties to show great discretion,\" she said in Berlin. The foreign minister, Guido Westerwelle, declared that everything must be done to deescalate the situation, so that the Syrian conflict did not turn into a conflagration in the region. Indeed, the Syrian crisis is not only spreading to Turkey, but also to Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon. According to Perthes, \"The neighboring countries are partly victims and partly instigators. Jordan too has taken in refugees and supplies the rebels. On the other hand, Iraq has tended to support the government of Bashar Assad.\" Even so, he said, all the neighboring countries had an interest in ensuring the conflict was confined to Syria. Appeal to the international community But the number of Syrian refugees is rising by the day. Ruth J\u00fcttner, a Middle East expert with Amnesty International, believes this will continue in future months. \"It's important that the countries bordering on Syria are supported by the international community in providing accommodation, medical and psychological care and schooling for children,\" she told DW. It's an appeal she directs especially to European countries. The shelling on the Syrian-Turkish border has made it more likely that there will be armed conflict between Syria and its neighbors. According to Perthes, \"It's probably the case that political resistance in Turkey to intervention in Syria is decreasing right now.\"",
        "generated_story": "German Institute for International and Security Affairs says Turkey's response to the Syrian conflict is \"not likely\" Germany's Foreign Minister Volker Perthes said on Wednesday that it was not likely that Turkey would intervene in the conflict in Syria. \"Turkey is not going to intervene militarily,\" he told DW, adding that he was \"very concerned\" about the Turkish response. He added that the country's military intervention would not be enough to stop the ongoing conflict, which has been going on since the beginning of the year. The Turkish Foreign Ministry said in a statement that Ankara would respond \"with appropriate measures\" if it did not take action immediately. It also said it would take \"appropriate steps\" to ensure that Syrian President Bashar Assad's forces do not use chemical weapons against civilians. According to German intelligence, the situation in eastern Syria has not changed at all. In fact, it has worsened in recent weeks, according to a report by the German IISS. On Wednesday, German foreign minister Guido Westerwelle said Turkey was unlikely to take any action at the moment, saying it had \"no intention\" of doing so. However, he added, \"We have no reason to think that this will be the case at this point in time.\" \"If it is, then we will have to wait and see what happens. We will see how that plays out,\" said the foreign ministry's spokesman. Germany, however, has repeatedly rejected the idea that a military response would be necessary to prevent a conflict from taking place. Turkey, for example, is a NATO member, but it's not a member of NATO, and it doesn't have the ability to do anything about it. That's why we are not expecting any military action from the US, NATO or the European Union. This is because we don't want to be involved in any kind of conflict that could lead to an escalation of tensions between the two countries. But we do have a lot of options. One option is to go to war with Russia, Turkey and Iran, or to join the NATO alliance. If that's the only option we have, we can do something about that. Otherwise, there is no way that we'll be able to act on our own. There are a number of other options, including the use of force and the possibility of an arms embargo. I think the most important one is for Turkey to step in and take a stand against the Assad regime in order to protect the interests of its own people. And that is what we're doing right now. Let's hope that they will do that, too, because it will help us to avoid a situation that would make it even more difficult for them to get involved. For now, though, this is the best course of action for both sides. At the same time, Germany and Turkey have been working together to try to find a way to resolve this conflict. They are also working with the United States to put pressure on Russia to help them in their fight against Assad. Meanwhile, they are working to make sure that Russia does not intervene, as they have already done for the past two years. So far, so far so good. As for Syria, Russia has responded with a strong response, although it hasn't done anything to date. Russia is also not doing much to influence the outcome of this week's talks in Berlin, where the president is due to meet with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Thursday."

        "target": "Armstrong stripped of Tour de France titles Cyclist Lance Armstrong has been stripped of his seven Tour de France titles and banned from cycling for life, in a much-anticipated ruling by the sport's international governing body. Monday's announcement by Pat McQuaid, the president of the International Cycling Union, ratified recommendations in an October report from the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), which ordered Armstrong's Tour de France titles be wiped out. \"Lance Armstrong has no place in cycling,\" said McQuaid. Addressing his remarks to cyclists, McQuaid said the fight against doping was his priority. \"UCI is listening and is on your side. We\u2019ve come too far in the fight against doping to return to our past. Cycling has a future and something like this must not happen again.\" The scathing USADA report included testimony from 11 former teammates, accusing Armstrong of running the \"most sophisticated\" doping program in the sport's history. The USADA said it had collected evidence to prove the seven-time Tour de France winner had engaged in the biggest doping conspiracy to date. Effect on cycling and sponsorship Monday's decision comes as the sport of cycling reels from Armstrong's well-documented fall from grace. Organizers of the Tour de France will be trying to move on from the scandal as the race prepares to celebrate its centenary next year. Sponsors have been deserting Armstrong and the sport in general. Last week, Nike - one of Armstrong's main corporate sponsors - said it was terminating its relationship with the cyclist and accused him of deception. Trek, the company that made the bicycles Armstrong rode to seven titles, announced on the same day it would terminate its sponsorship contract - as did the beer maker Anheuser-Busch. The Dutch institution Rabobank ended its association with professional cycling after the doping allegations came to light, leaving 17 riders in need of a sponsor. Last week Armstrong also announced he would step down from his own charity, the Lance Armstrong Foundation, also known as Livestrong, a move believed to have been intended to limit the damage to the organization from the USADA report. Armstrong appears Lance Armstrong spoke briefly to thousands of riders in Texas at a benefit organized by his charity, the day before UCI's decision. \"I've been better, but I've also been worse,\" he said. \"Obviously it has been an interesting and difficult couple of weeks.\" jr/rc (Reuters, AFP, AP)",
        "generated_story": "Lance Armstrong stripped of Tour de France titles Lance Armstrong has been stripped by the International Cycling Union (IUCU) for doping. Armstrong was stripped on Monday of his three major cycling titles, including the Tour of France, which he won in October. The cycling world's biggest sporting event is set to take place at the end of October in the United States, with the first stage to be held in Austin, Texas, on Oct. 19, the day before the race is scheduled to begin. \"I am very disappointed,\" Armstrong said in a statement on his Facebook page, adding that he was \"very disappointed\" that the sport's governing body had stripped him of the three titles he had won. He said the decision was based on \"a lack of competition\" and that \"the sport was not in our best interests at that time.\" Armstrong, who has won four Tour titles in his career, has also won three more in cycling, cycling and cycling. His most recent victory came in 2014, when he finished second in France. But he also took home two more victories in 2015 and 2016, as well as a third in 2016 and 2017, and a fourth in 2012, respectively. Both of those victories were won by Armstrong's team, Rabobank, while the other came at a time when the two teams were battling for a second time in three years. Lance was also named the best rider of all time for the 2014 Tour, but he has yet to win a stage since then. In October, Armstrong won his third and final stage, finishing fourth overall, ahead of Armstrong. On Monday, he said he would not be able to compete again because of a doping scandal that has dogged him since he began his cycling career in 2004. 'I have no idea what I am doing' Lance's doping record has come to an end, however, according to Armstrong and his wife, Pat McQuaid (Reuters, AFP, AP). Armstrong is the only cyclist to have won a major title since Armstrong in 2006, a year after he retired from cycling after suffering a heart attack while competing for Team Sky. It is not clear whether Armstrong will be allowed to return to cycling next year, or whether he will have to wait until after the season ends to claim his first Tour title, although he is expected to do so in September, after being banned for two years for testing positive for anabolic steroids. According to the IUC U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (EDA) and the American Olympic Committee (AOC), the organization's head of research and development, Dr. John Heintz, is also a former cyclist who was banned from competing since 2004 for failing to pass a drug test in 2009. A spokesman for Armstrong told Reuters that Armstrong had been suspended for three consecutive years because he failed to meet his doping standards."

        "target": "Bayern blast five as Schalke draw Bayern Munich stamped their authority over the Bundesliga on Saturday, with a ruthless 5-0 drubbing of Hannover at home. Meanwhile, second-placed Schalke and third-placed Frankfurt were forced to share the points. With many critics saying Bayern might as well be given the giant Bundesliga dish already, perhaps the struggle for second is shaping up to be the more compelling battle. But Saturday afternoon's clash between second-placed Schalke and third-placed Frankfurt did not take a decisive turn, with the game ending in a 1-1 draw. Schalke drew first blood in the 11th minute, when Frankfurt's Stefan Aigner was dispossessed in midfield, and Lewis Holtby released Klaas-Jan Huntelaar in front of goal - the Dutchman's first in the Bundesliga since September. But the hapless Aigner waited just over 100 seconds to make amends for his error, when the Royal Blues allowed him a free header that left goalkeeper Lars Unnerstall with no chance. But neither side could make inroads in the second half, which allowed Dortmund to leap-frog both sides and claim second place. Bayern take command Meanwhile the imperious Bayern Munich dispelled any talk of winter form-dip - following last week's draw to Nuremberg - with a brutally efficient 5-0 win at home to Hannover. The Bavarians stormed to a 3-0 lead in just 37 minutes, celebrating a nifty overhead kick for star signing Javi Martinez in the fourth minute. Toni Kroos and Franck Ribery scored the next two against a Hannover side that were torn open at will. The overhead kick was the first for the 40-million-euro ($52-million) signing Martinez, and in the second half new defender Dante also opened his account with a straightforward header from a Kroos free-kick. The festival of football continued just four minutes later, when Mario Gomez - making first Bundesliga appearance of the season - slammed the ball into the net from a tight angle just 30 seconds after replacing Mario Mandzukic. Dortmund win The champions Dortmund, meanwhile, are still nine points behind Bayern after beating Mainz 2-1 away. It was a potentially tricky fixture in the town where J\u00fcrgen Klopp began his coaching career, and Mainz showed their brilliance in the fourth minute, when Elkin Soto knocked a dream ball into the path of Marco Caligiuri, whose volley fairly screamed into the top right corner. Dortmund's own star-Marco - national team player Marco Reus - leveled the scores just eight minutes later. Reus worked himself some room at the outer edge of the penalty area, and slotted a beautiful 17-meter effort into the far corner. And Dortmund's second goal, just before half-time, was equally aesthetic - a vertical ball bisected the Mainz defense perfectly down the middle, where Polish predator Robert Lewandowski got his eighth league goal of the season with a deft lob over the onrushing Christian Wetklo in goal. Allofs' homecoming Bremen's 1-1 draw at Wolfsburg had a special frisson of its own, as Wolfsburg's newly-minted sporting director Klaus Allofs faced the club he had served as general manager for over a decade. And there was some gesticulating from the Bremen bench in the general direction of the Wolfsburg management when the guests took the lead in the 35th minute. Just seconds after Wolfsburg missed several chances, Marko Arnautovic was left free in the box after Eljero Elia found space on the left and cut the ball back for the Austrian to finish. But Wolfsburg got their own back in the second half. In the 62th minute, Bremen were reduced to ten men when Lukas Schmitz was given second yellow card for a hard tackle on Adelino Vieirinha. Just two minutes later, Bas Dost took advantage of their guests' disorgnaization and smashed the ball into the goal after neat piece of play from Vieirinha. Dirty derby The Franconian derby between Greuther F\u00fcrth and Nuremberg was a cagey affair that ended in a frustrating 0-0 draw. The first half was marked mainly by a straight red card for Nuremberg's Markus Feulner after an ugly, flying lunge on Stephan F\u00fcrstner. But the home side's numerical advantage was short-lived - Sercan Sararer was also sent for an early ice bath after his high elbow on Javier Pinola was adjudged worthy of a second yellow card in the 61st minute. But the aggression in the tackles was not matched by ruthlessness in front of goal, and neither side could eke out any clear chances.",
        "generated_story": "Bayern Munich host Wolfsburg in the first Bundesliga game of the season on Saturday in Nuremberg, Germany. The Bundesliga's top-flight club has been struggling for a few months, but the German champions are looking to bounce back from a 2-1 defeat to Mainz in their opening Bundesliga match at the hands of Bayern Munich. German coach J\u00fcrgen Klopp's side, who have won three of their last four league matches, are expected to have a tough time. They will be hoping to avoid a repeat of last season's 1-0 drubbing by Bayern, which they lost 3-2 at home to Werder Bremen. \"We are not going to let this happen again,\" Klopp said, adding that he was confident that his side would be able to get back on track after a difficult start to the Bundesliga season. He added: \"I think we can do a lot better than we did last year. We have to make sure that we don't let the team get away with something like this again.\" The German side have already won two Bundesliga matches in a row, and they have two more to play for this season, including a trip to Germany's second-tier Bundesliga, where they will take on Bayern on Friday and Saturday, respectively, in Cologne and Hannover. In the second half, the hosts will try to build on their recent form, having won their first three Bundesliga games in all competitions. But they are unlikely to do so with the help of a strong defense and a solid attack from the left-hand side. That's not to say they won't have their chances, though, as they could have done without the Dutchman. After all, he's the man who has won the most Bundesliga titles in his career. And that's a big reason why he is so popular with fans. It's also a good reason to be optimistic about the future of German football, especially in Germany, given that the national team is a very important part of this year's World Cup in Russia. If they do, it's because they want to win the Champions League, not just because their players are good enough to qualify for the next round of competition. For the last three years, they've been the best team in Europe. Now they're the only team that has a chance of reaching the quarter-finals. At the same time, there's no doubt that they'll be the favorites to reach the final. On Saturday's opening day, Bayern will have the chance to take the top spot with a win over Werders, a team which has lost just one game in four years. However, that doesn't mean they can't make it through the group stages. There's still a long way to go in terms of who will make the starting line-up and who can get the job done. Last year, their coach, Franz Beckenbauer, was sacked for failing to deliver a positive message to his players. Instead, his successor, Stefan Aigner, took over as Bayern's head coach in September, with Karl-Heinz Schmitz taking over the role of sporting director. As a result, Klopp was forced to step down from his role as head of football and the club's technical staff. His replacement, Marko Arnautovic, has also been given the responsibility of overseeing the development of new players, while the Bayern coach has taken on the task of developing a new set of young talents. With the new manager, Jurgen Klopp will also be tasked with bringing in new faces in order to improve the squad's chances of winning the title. This is not an easy task for Klopp, whose team has struggled in recent seasons. Bayern have struggled to find the right combination of talent and experience, so he has had to rely on a number of key players to fill the void left by his predecessor, Franck Ribery."

        "target": "Is China seeking regime-change in North Korea? The sudden reduction in aggressive rhetoric and actions by North Korea has led to suggestions that Pyongyang has realized it has pushed its only ally in the region to the brink of severing its friendship. The announcement in Pyongyang on May 13 of the promotion of Jang Jong-nam to \"minister of the People's Armed Forces\" came out of the blue. Until recently, the little-known commander of an army corps in coastal Kangwon Province, Jang has replaced Kim Kyok-sik, a four-star general with a long track record of loyal service to the regime. The reasons for 70-year-old Kim's replacement are not clear - as with most of the political maneuvers in North Korea - but it may have been his loyalty that cost him his position in the politburo. Kim was widely seen as a hawk in the regime and is believed to have been in command of the operation to shell the South Korean island of Yeonpyeongdo in November 2010, an incident that killed four people, destroyed civilians' homes and infrastructure and dramatically worsened the already strained relationship between Pyongyang and Seoul. By sacrificing Kim, analysts believe, North Korea is signaling that it is backing away from the confrontational stance it adopted after the United Nations imposed new sanctions in the wake of the nation's third underground nuclear test in February. And there are other indicators that Pyongyang is seeking to return to the status quo. The North's troops have been permitted to step down from the highest state of preparedness for war that was initially ordered when South Korea and the US began a series of annual military exercises. Missiles withdrawn Similarly, two Musudan intermediate-range missiles that were identified as being on mobile launchers being operated in eastern areas of the country have apparently been ordered to return to base. In late April, there was concern that test-launches of the missiles would be a further escalation by Kim Jong-un's government and a message that it would not bow to international pressure to halt its nuclear and missile development programs. But the analysts believe the tokens of Pyongyang's goodwill have come too late. \"For the North Korean leader, this is a very difficult time,\" Toshimitsu Shigemura, a professor at Tokyo's Waseda University and an authority on North Korean affairs, told DW. \"Timing is very important here and it is possible that China is moving to abandon Kim Jong-un. The atmosphere between the two nations is changing. China may have decided that it is time for a regime-change in the North, they will not permit the collapse of the country because they do not want chaos on their own borders.\" Further evidence that Beijing is slowly tightening the screw on its erstwhile ally comes as more state-run financial institutions sever their links with banks in North Korea. The latest institution to adhere to the government's orders to halt transactions across the border is the Bank of China, one of the four major banks in the country, which announced on May 7 that it would cease dealings with the Foreign Trade Bank of North Korea, which has been identified as being involved in Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs. Contingency plan in place Intelligence sources have passed on to DW information that Beijing has a contingency plan in place for when Kim Jong-un's control over the country crumbles. The reports confirm that China is indeed quietly encouraging regime change and is grooming Kim's brother, Kim Jong-nam to take over his role. At 42, Kim Jong-nam is the oldest son of Kim Jong-il, the dictator who ruled North Korea with an iron fist for 17 years until his sudden death in December 2011. Kim Jong-nam had been expected to assume the leadership after his father's death, but fell from favor spectacularly in 2001 when he was detained with two women and a boy aged 4 at Tokyo's Narita International Airport travelling on a forged Dominican Republic passport. He later admitted that he had wanted to visit Disneyland. He subsequently lived in Macau and Beijing, under the close watch of the Chinese authorities. The reports suggest that after Kim Jong-nam is installed in Pyongyang, his brother will be permitted to go into exile, probably in China. The tactic is not without its pitfalls, however, in part due to the efficiency of the campaign to deify their young leader as the future of the nation. Kim Jong-nam as 'new king' \"China may be dreaming of appointing Kim Jong-nam as the new king - and he is more preferable to the West than Kim Jong Un - but the problem is that he is not known in North Korea,\" said Ken Kato, director of Tokyo-based Human Rights in Asia. \"Many people in Japan know much about the North Korean 'Royal Family,' but this information is hidden in North Korea,\" he said. \"Even residents of Pyongyang know very little about Kim Jong-nam.\" Yet the reports are gaining credence among North Korea-watchers. Jun Okumura, a political analyst with the Eurasia Group, told DW that North Korea withdrawing",
        "generated_story": "North Korea's 'new king' Kim Jong-un has become the new king of North Korea. The North Korean leader has been in power for more than a decade. He is the first leader of the country to have been elected by the People's Armed Forces (PA) and the United Nations Security Council (UN) since the 1950-53 Korean War. In the past few years, the North Koreans have taken to the streets of Seoul and Pyongyang to show off their military capabilities. They have also taken up the mantle of \"the new leader\" in the form of a \"king\" who is known as \"Kim Jong Un.\" Kim has also been a strong critic of US President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly called for tougher sanctions against Pyongyang. On May 7, Kim was sworn into office by his wife Kim Kyok-sik. Kim is also expected to be sworn in as the nation's new head of state on May 13, a day after his father was killed in a car accident in which he was shot and killed by a suicide bomber, according to a statement from his office in Seoul. \"We are going to do everything in our power to make sure that we are doing everything we can to protect our people,\" Kim said, adding that he hoped Kim would be able to return to power within the next few months. But he did not, however, rule out the possibility that Kim could be re-elected as a candidate for a second term in office, which would mean he would have to step down from the top job in his country's armed forces in order to take the reins of power, said Kim, referring to Kim as Kim's \"new leader.\" \"I think he will be a very strong leader,\" he said. 'He is a great leader, and I think that's the most important thing he can do for the people of this country right now. I don't know what else I can say about that, but he's a good leader and he has a lot of respect for his people and that makes him an excellent leader. That's why I'm so happy for him,\" said Jun Okumura, director of research at Waseda University in Tokyo. Jang was born in Pyongyang in 1950 and has lived there since then. His father is currently in exile in South Korea, where he is studying at the University of Tokyo in Japan. (Reuters, AP, AFP, Reuters, dpa)"

        "target": "UK lawmakers propose jail sentences for reckless bankers A British parliamentary commission has completed its work on the overhaul of the domestic banking sector. Among other things, it proposed jail terms for bankers displaying grave malpractice and causing huge damage. Members of the UK's Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards agreed Wednesday that Britain needed a radical overhaul of its scandal-hit lenders. The panel, which was mostly composed of lawmakers, concluded in its final report that senior bankers must be made personally responsible for malpractice through the introduction of a new criminal offence of reckless misconduct. It would carry a prison sentence. The reputation of the country's banking sector had been damaged in recent years by a string of scandals, including Libor rate-rigging, credit insurance mis-selling and a controversy over staff behavior and bonuses in the run-up to the 2008 global financial crisis. The level of malpractice had been \"shocking and widespread,\" said the commission's chairman, Conservative party lawmaker Andrew Tyrie. RBS cut in two? \"Taxpayers and customers have lost out, and the economy has suffered,\" the 500-page report said. \"Under our recommendations, senior bankers who seriously damage their banks or put taxpayers' money at risk can expect to be fined, banned from the industry or in the worst cases go to jail.\" The commission called for bankers to sign up to a new code of conduct under which all key responsibilities within a bank would be assigned to specific senior officials who would be held responsible. The panel also proposed that more remuneration for bankers should be deferred for longer periods of up to ten years in order to \"reflect the longer run balance between business risks and rewards.\" The commission recommended that the government consider splitting the state-rescued Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) into a good bank and a bad one mopping up toxic assets. The report was published ahead of a key speech by Finance Minister George Osborne on his bank reform plans. hg/ipj (AFP, Reuters)",
        "generated_story": "Reprehensibility of Bank Mafia: British Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards A British parliamentary commission on banking standards has called for an investigation into the banking mafia in Britain. The commission, which was set up by George Osborne in 2008, called on the government to take action to tackle the problem. \"The banking Mafia is a very big problem in the UK,\" the commission said in a report released on Wednesday, adding that it was \"increasingly difficult for people to understand the bank mafia.\" \"It's a problem that we have to deal with,\" said Andrew Tyrie, a member of the committee, who was appointed by the Conservative government in October 2008 to investigate the financial mafia. He added that \"it's not the first time that people have been misjudging the banks' integrity and integrity.\" The Commission's findings were published in its annual report, published on Tuesday, and were expected to be published by Wednesday. It also said that the \"bank mafia\" was responsible for a number of financial scandals, including the 2008 financial crisis and the 2007 collapse of Britain's banking system. But the Commission said there was no evidence to suggest that banks were involved in any of these scandals. In fact, it said, \"there are a lot of people who think they know more than they do about banks,\" and that many of them are not aware of what they are doing. They say they don't know what is going on in their bank accounts, but that they have no idea what the rules are for banks. This is not a new problem for the British banking industry. For example, the Libor benchmark is set at 0.5 percent, compared to 1.6 percent for other countries, according to the Bank of England. However, this is the second time in less than a year that a British bank has been accused of manipulating the rate of interest on its balance sheet. That is, they say, because they believe it is impossible to know how much interest rates are being charged on their balance sheets. There is also the question of whether banks are allowed to charge interest at the same rate as other financial institutions, such as Barclays, HSBC and Lloyds Banking Group (LCB), which has a monopoly on lending rates of up to 10 percent. And there is no doubt that there are many banks that do not have the necessary capital to meet the standards set out for them. These banks, in particular, are the ones that are subject to scrutiny from regulators and regulators. One of those regulators was the European Central Bank (ECB) which set the bar for setting the minimum rate for lending to banks in financial markets. At the time of his appointment as finance minister, he said he did not expect to see any problems with the new rules until the end of this year's financial year, when he was due to step down from his role as Finance Minister. His comments came amid growing criticism from some lawmakers who said they were not prepared to do the right thing by setting up an independent commission to examine the issue. Some lawmakers, however, were quick to point out that this was not an isolated case, saying they had not seen any evidence of a bank Mafia. Others said the scandal was a case of \"a banking scandal\" that had been brewing for some time. According to one lawmaker, former Prime Minister David Cameron, there were allegations of fraud and corruption. Another lawmaker said it could be the case that banking regulators were trying to cover up the fact that some banks had failed to disclose the fraud. A spokesman for Cameron said: \"This is something that has not been done before. I think it's an issue that should not be repeated in future. You can't be too hard on banks because banks have a reputation for being corrupt.\""

They were originally arrested for taking photographs of restricted areas. Slovak citizens detained by the Iranian authorities on suspicion of taking photographs out of bounds have returned home, said Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico. Eight people in total were arrested in May after taking photographs of restricted areas. A Slovakian news website said the group was detained near the central city of Isfahan, where Iran has nuclear facilities. The six that have been freed attended a news conference held by Prime Minister Fico in the capital, Bratislava on Sunday. Fico told reporters that the government was working to secure the release of the remaining two paragliders who are stiil in custody. \"Negotiations were fair and their result is the release of six out of eight detainees,\" Fico was quoted as saying on the government's website. He added that Slovakia had not made any \"financial commitments\" in the negotiation process. Detainees 'unaware' of rule-breaking One of the released paragliders, Vladislav Frigo, said the group did not break any rules it was aware of. \"We had information that there was a ban on taking photographs below the height of 2,300 metres. We were taking pictures from higher (altitudes),\" said Frigo. He added that the detainees were well treated, had access to television, a refrigerator and could cook for themselves as well as getting regular meals. Foreign nationals accused of spying In recent years, Iran has levelled accusations of espionage against both foreign nationals and Iranians. Two U.S. citizens - Josh Fattal and Shane Bauer - were sentenced to eight years in jail for spying after being arrested while hiking along the Iraq-Iran border in 2009. They denied espionage - neighbouring Oman helped secure their release in 2011 by posting bail of 1-million US dollars (756,000 euros). Last year, Iranian-American Amir Hekmati was sentenced to death for spying for the CIA, but judges overturned the decision and ordered a retrial. lw/ipj (Reuters, dpa)",
        "generated_story": "Six Slovak paragliders arrested in Iran have been detained in the United States, authorities said on Sunday. Six Slovaks were arrested on suspicion of spying for the U.S. intelligence agency, which has been investigating the case for years. They were detained at the border with Iran, where they were being held for questioning on charges of espionage and money laundering. The charges stem from allegations that they tried to infiltrate the country's intelligence service, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and were later extradited to Iran. Officials said they believed the charges were politically motivated, but they did not give any details. \"We do not have any information on what they are doing,\" said Robert Fico, head of the CIA's Slovakia branch in Bratislava, a city in eastern Slovakia that is home to a large number of Iranian and Iraqi intelligence officers, according to Slovakia's Interior Ministry. Authorities said the men had been arrested at a border crossing near the Iranian city of Isfahan in southern Iraq in May, and they had not been charged with any crime. A US official told Reuters that the arrests were not related to the investigation into the alleged spying, adding that it was \"not an isolated incident\" and that \"it is not something that we are aware of at all.\" The arrests came as a result of an investigation by the US-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) into suspected espionage activities in Iraq, Iran and Syria. It has not said whether the suspects were involved in any of these cases, or whether they simply had information about the activities of a foreign intelligence officer. In a statement, ISAF said it had found no evidence of any links between ISFahan and the spying operation. But it added that there was no connection between the two countries' intelligence agencies or the intelligence services, saying they could not be linked to any specific case. ISFIALL ISFAHAR, Iraq (Reuters, AFP, Reuters, AP) -- The US has accused Slovakia of being a \"hostile country\" for spying on its citizens. Slovakia is one of several countries in which US intelligence officials have accused Iran of trying to influence the elections in a bid to win a parliamentary election in November. Iran has denied the allegations, accusing the government of seeking to interfere with the election process in order to gain influence over the outcome of parliamentary elections. Russia, Britain and Iran are also accused of meddling in elections, as well as in several other countries, including Iraq and Afghanistan. Moscow has also denied any involvement in an alleged plot to assassinate the Prime Minister of Slovakia, who is in exile in Tehran. Tehran denies the accusations and says it does not know what is going on in its own country. On Sunday, it accused the Czechs of conspiring to spy on the prime minister and his deputy, Vladislav Frigo, of spreading false information."

The 89-year-old did not say when exactly his resignation would take effect. Calling the move a personal decision, President Giorgio Napolitano made his announcement during an end-of-year speech on Wednesday. \"I'm about to step down, to resign as the constitution expressly allows,\" he said, adding. \"I've reached an age that brings with it growing limitations and difficulties for me to do my institutional duties, which are complex and very demanding.\" Though he did not say when his resignation would take effect, a potential date is January 13 when Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi is due to give up the country's rotating six-month presidency of the Council of the European Union. Renzi faces a political challenge in organizing a replacement for Napolitano, dubbed by Italian media as \"King George.\" The president has served as a key intermediary between political parties through numerous changes in government and other tricky political situations. Napolitano, a former communist respected by Europe and Washington, took office in 2006. At the end of his seven-year mandate in 2013, he was asked to stay on because parliament could not agree on his successor. At the time he warned he may not serve out the full term, given his age.

The prime minister's resignation comes a day after he was forced to step down by the European Union's executive Council, which includes the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Russia and the US. Italy has announced it will resign from the post of president on January 13, according to a statement released by its president. \"I am resigning because of my political and economic interests,\" the statement said, adding that it was \"not appropriate for me to resign in this position.\" The resignation came after a series of resignations, including one by President Nicolas Sarkozy, who had been in office for more than a year and a half. It was the first time that the president of the Council had resigned from his post in the face of criticism from Washington, Washington and other European countries for his handling of a crisis in relations between the two bloc's two largest economies. France and Washington have repeatedly called for the resignation, but the Italian government has so far refused to do so. Washington has repeatedly rejected the idea, saying it would be \"a waste of time and effort\" to remove the head of state from office. On Wednesday, however, Italian Prime Ministrata Giorgio Napoli announced that he would stay on as President until the end of his term in January 2013. He also said that Italy would continue to cooperate with Washington in its efforts to improve relations with the EU. However, he did not rule out the possibility that Washington would step in as a mediator between Rome and Rome. In the past year, Rome has been at the center of several diplomatic and diplomatic disputes. But in 2013, it became clear that Rome would not be the only EU member state to be at loggerheads over the future of EU membership. Last month, a US delegation visited Italy to discuss the situation, and in December, President Donald Trump announced his intention to leave the bloc. According to the U.S. Embassy in Rome, New York's President Barack Obama had also called on the government to take a stand against the new EU presidency. New US President-elect Donald Tusk has also been calling for a new round of sanctions against Washington over its involvement in an arms race between Italy and Russia. At a news conference in Washington last week, Napoleano said he hoped to have a chance to appeal to Washington's support for him in his new role as Italy\u2019s next president-in-exile. That would have been a major step toward a possible return to negotiations on a deal to end the current crisis, as well as an end to sanctions on Russia, Iran and North Korea. For the time being, there are no plans to impose new sanctions in Italy. There is no word yet on how long Italy will be able to stay in power, or what the terms of an extension of its current term of office could be. This is the second time in three years that a European leader has stepped down as Italian President, following a five-year term that began in 2006, when he took office in a cabinet reshuffled by a change of government. President John Boehner, meanwhile, has vowed to keep his position in place until his successor takes office next year. His successor, Renz, will take over in February, after the term ends in March. Napolano's departure comes after months of speculation over whether he will seek a second term as leader."

        "target": "Libya factions declare ceasefire After two days of peace talks in Geneva, a tentative ceasefire has been called in the restive North African country. Although they sent no representatives to Switzerland, Islamists have agreed to halt the fighting. The Islamist-backed militia alliance that took over Tripoli and installed its own government announced a ceasefire on Friday, following a breakthrough in Geneva-based peace talks. Despite not attending the UN-brokered meeting, the militias have agreed to \"a ceasefire on all fronts,\" according to a statement issued by Islamist group Fajr Libya (Libya Dawn). The only condition is that \"the other parties respect the truce.\" The announcement came hours after the United Nations declared that Libya's warring factions had agreed to a roadmap for forming a unity government. Nearly four years after a NATO-backed revolt saw Moammar Gadhafi removed from power, two rival governments each backed by different groups of militias have plunged the country back into chaos and threatened all-out civil war. After the elected government of Prime Minister Abdullah al-Thinni was forced out of Tripoli by Libya Dawn, it was forced to move to the far eastern city of Tobruk while Libya Dawn reinstated the old parliament known as the GNC. The fighting and violence has displaced hundreds of thousands of civilians, left hundreds killed and thousands wounded. Most foreign diplomats fled the country and shut their embassies last year. The Tobruk government, as well as a few other factions who favor a peaceful resolution, came to Geneva to work on \"confidence-building measures,\" which includes the release of detainees from both sides, opening closed ports and securing safe freedom of movement around the country. es/bw (AP, AFP, Reuters)",
        "generated_story": "Fajr Libya declares ceasefire after two days of peace talks Libya declared a ceasefire on Friday after a two-day ceasefire in the North African country. The two sides agreed to hold talks in Geneva, Switzerland, on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, in a bid to end the violence that has gripped the country for more than two weeks. A ceasefire was declared after talks between the GNC and the Libyan government failed to reach a deal on Saturday. \"We have reached an agreement,\" said Abdullah al-Thinni, the head of Libya's armed forces, adding that the talks would continue until the end of this week. He added that he hoped the ceasefire would last until at least Friday, when he would be able to return to his office in Tobruk, where he had been working since the beginning of last week's ceasefire talks. In the meantime, he said, \"we will continue to work with the international community to ensure that we have a peaceful solution to this conflict.\" The talks, which began on Thursday, lasted for about two hours, and lasted until late Friday. It was the second day of talks that ended with a cease-fire, but the first one lasted only a few hours. Both sides said they would resume talks on Sunday, after which they had agreed on a roadmap for the next round of negotiations. At the same time, they also announced that they were calling for an end to the armed conflict between pro- and anti-Islamist factions. According to a UN statement, a total of 10,000 people have been killed in clashes between rival factions, including those fighting for control of Tripoli and Benghazi. UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said the truce was agreed upon by all sides, with no specific demands for a halt to fighting. However, it was not immediately clear how many people were killed, or how long it would take for any of them to be allowed back to their homes. 'We are not going to give up on this,' he added, referring to \"the fact that there is no end in sight for this situation.\" \"This is a very difficult situation for us to resolve. We are working to find a solution that is acceptable to all of us,\" he told a news conference in Switzerland. But it is not clear what that solution will be, as the situation in Libya is still in its early stages, according to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon (UNHCR, Reuters) and other UN agencies. Nor is it clear whether the peace process will last for long. Last week, UN special envoy Ban said he was \"very optimistic\" about the prospects of a quick ceasefire, saying that it could be reached in time for next year's elections. On Friday he called on all parties to resume negotiations, though he did not rule out the possibility of an immediate ceasefire."

        "target": "Report: Torture is a European problem too A day after Amnesty International published a report on Europe's collusion with the CIA's torture program, the Council of Europe published its own shocking survey of abuse in detention centers across the continent. Prison guards in several European countries carried out reprisals against detainees who talked to the Council of Europe's Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT), the new CPT report has revealed. The council considers this a violation of the spirit of cooperation between the CPT and the Council of Europe's member states. According to the CPT's 24th General Report, released on Wednesday, reprisals were carried out against prisoners in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Greece, Hungary, Moldova, Russia, Spain, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and Ukraine. \"Intimidation or retaliation against persons the CPT has interviewed may not only violate their human rights but also strikes a blow to the preventive mechanism established by the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture,\" CPT President Letif H\u00fcseynov said in a statement. \"I urge national authorities to respect their obligation to prevent, investigate and punish such actions.\" The report also highlighted several problems with the detention of juveniles around Europe, and proposed a series of practical measures to protect young people's rights when detained. Ad hoc visits The little-known CPT, now 25 years old, represents a unique approach to international torture prevention. A team of specialists make roughly 180 visits a year to all kinds of detention centers (including prisons, police stations, holding centers for immigration detainees, psychiatric hospitals, and even social care homes) all across the 47-member Council of Europe - one of the few international blocs that offer platforms for dialogue with Eastern European regimes considered to have poor human rights records, such as Russia, Azerbaijan, and Ukraine. The method combines the carrot of talks with government officials and the stick of ad hoc visits, which all members are committed to allowing into their prisons. Once inside, the CPT also has the right to interview any detainees it chooses - in private, though of course the detainees have the right to refuse. \"The first thing to say is how important the CPT is,\" said Carla Ferstman, director of Redress, a UK-based organization that helps torture survivors. \"As a result of their boot work over a very long period of time, the UN has set up a global system which in many ways mirrors the approach of the CPT.\" But given that the committee has no powers to enforce its proposals to governments, there are question marks over its effectiveness. \"In the report, they complain about how some of the recommendations they've made have not been implemented,\" said Ferstman. \"It's a sign that they're a little bit frustrated.\" But in the long run, she maintains, the CPT has more than proved its value. \"The dialogue that they are able to have is really important,\" she said. \"Looking long-term, they have been very effective.\" CIA collusion, asylum seekers The CPT's report comes a day after Amnesty International released its own report on European collusion with the CIA's torture program. While the CPT's report examines more prosaic day-to-day mistreatment, rather than mass rendition of terrorist suspects at the behest of the US, there are obvious links between the two, since some countries - such as Poland, Macedonia, and the UK - are highlighted in both reports. \"What is finally coming out in all of this is that the Europeans, despite all the criticism of the Bush and Obama administrations on the use of torture - so many of them connived,\" said Judy Dempsey, senior associate at Carnegie Europe. \"It's really a double standard. This report is quite damning and quite shameful, and it follows the Amnesty International one as well.\" The CPT's work also mentions the mistreatment of asylum seekers, a problem increasingly afflicting European countries that take in the largest number of asylum seekers - particularly Spain, Italy, and Greece. \"With Greece there are two things to remember,\" Dempsey told DW. \"A - the appalling situation of the prison system, and B - the lack of training among police of how to deal with asylum seekers. Awful things have happened. Parallel to this is the illegal detention centers. There have been lots of cases of terrible mistreatment over the last several years.\" \"Immigration detention is a growing issue,\" added Ferstman. \"In the UK, there was a whole parliamentary inquiry into one immigration detention center, where some of the women alleged that guards propositioned them in order to get quick treatment on their claims. Each country has its own history of torture.\"",
        "generated_story": "Torture is a European problem, and it's time to step up its game The European Commission's 24th General Report on Torture on Wednesday warned that it was time for the European Union to take a step back. The Commission, which has been working on the issue for more than a year, said in a statement that the EU should take steps to tackle the problem. \"We need to do something about it,\" said Carla Ferstman, head of Redress, a think tank at the Council of Europe (CCE) in Brussels. She added that \"the EU needs to be more proactive in dealing with this issue.\" \"The EU must take action,\" she said, referring to the US President George W. Bush's decision to end the use of torture in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (R Macedonia). \"It's not just about torture. It's about human rights and the right of the people to have their rights respected and protected.\" The EU has already taken action to protect the rights of people who have been subjected to torture, she added, adding that there was \"a lot of pressure from the United States and from other countries\" to ensure that this was not the case. In addition, it should be clear to all of us that torture is not something that can be tolerated in our own country. For example, the UN has set up a special committee to monitor the torture of detainees, including those who are convicted of crimes against humanity, such as murder, rape, torture and sexual abuse. This committee is also working to make sure that US and EU governments do not use torture as a weapon of war in their own countries. According to a report by the Committee for Prevention of Tortures (CPT), torture has become an increasingly common practice in Europe, particularly in countries where the death penalty is used as an instrument of punishment. That's why the Commission is working so hard to improve the situation in Macedonia and other parts of Eastern Europe. However, there is still a long way to go in terms of how to deal with these cases, according to its chairman, Letif H\u00fcseynov, who was appointed by President Barack Obama to lead the committee. He also said that he would be willing to work with other European countries to try to find a solution to this problem: \"I think we should work together to solve this, not against each other,\" he said. But he also pointed out that many of these countries have already done so, as well as the UK and Italy, that they have done, too, with the help of US intelligence agencies. They have also done a good job of monitoring the country's political and economic situation. And they are doing so well, in fact, despite the fact that most of them are not even aware of what is going on in this country right now. There are also a number of countries that have not done enough to prevent this from happening. Poland, Hungary, Romania, Serbia, Bulgaria, Moldova, Turkey, Ukraine and Serbia have all done the same. Romania and Bulgaria are among the countries which have the highest rates of death and torture under the Hague Convention. Bulgaria and Hungary are the other two countries with a high rate of deaths. Serbia is the third country that has suffered the most from torture during the past few years. Hungary and Romania are two of those countries, but they also have a lower rate than other EU countries in which torture takes place. Russia, Iran and Turkey have both been accused of using torture against their citizens. Iran has also been a victim for years, although it has yet to prove its innocence. Meanwhile, Russia and Iran have repeatedly denied any involvement in such crimes, saying it is only a matter of time before it will be proven that these crimes are being committed by its own people."

        "target": "Dresden marks 70 years since massive Allied bombing Seventy years ago, Allied bombers attacked Dresden, killing tens of thousands of people, the majority of them civilians and refugees. Every year, the East German city remembers its dead. DW's Naomi Conrad was on hand. As the tram trundled through Dresden's drab suburbs on Friday morning, a prim, elderly woman suddenly turned to her friend sitting on the seat beside her: \"You know, my mother never told me about the bombings.\" She shrugged, then, after a moment's pause, continued. \"It must have been such unspeakable hell that she just couldn't talk about it,\" the woman said. She was referring to February 13, 1945 - the morning, exactly 70 years ago, when Allied bombers swooped down on an unsuspecting city famous for its baroque architecture and that, until that point, had survived the war mostly unscathed. That was to change in the course of three dreadful days: As the bombs rained down on the city, its churches and palaces were turned to rubble. Up to 25,000 people - many of them refugees fleeing the advancing Soviet Red Army - died in the inferno that raged in the city for days. \"There was nothing left, nothing,\" a frail, bent man with a checkered cap recalled, \"just rubble and death.\" He was leaning on the balustrade of a viewing platform in Dresden's old gasometer, staring down at the 360-degree painting by the Iranian-German artist Yadegar Asisi; sirens howled from hidden speakers and strobe lighting illuminated the ruined churches and black smoke billowing from the burnt skeletons that were once buildings. The man swallowed, his voice hoarse, barely audible: \"It's so hard being here.\" The soundtrack and images, he said, \"bring back too many memories.\" 'So, so many dead' He was 15, he recalled, working on a school essay when the sirens began to wail. He never finished the essay. Instead, he ran for shelter with his family. When they returned home three days later, the roof had been blown off, the windows smashed. \"But we were lucky: We survived,\" he said. \"There were so, so many dead.\" His voice broke and, muttering an apology, he shuffled off. The bombings were intended to break the German population's morale - a decision that to many was incomprehensible, given that the war had long been decided and Dresden's economic and strategic importance was relatively minimal. Consequently, the death and destruction wreaked by the Allied bombers quickly became a tool, first for the Nazi propagandists in the last months of the war, then by the East German regime for its anti-West propaganda, and then later by neo-Nazi groups, who traditionally congregate on February 13. Even today, \"the debate continues about guilt and innocence, even about the exact number of victims,\" Dresden Mayor Helma Orosz told a packed audience, including delegations from abroad, gathered for a memorial service in the city's Frauenkirche, which in 2005 was rebuilt with the help of private donations after Germany's reunification, many of them from the United States and Great Britain. Call for peace \"War, hatred and violence begin in people's minds,\" Orosz said. \"We must resist any attempt at once again categorizing people based on their origin and skin color,\" she added, referring to what has often been described as a right-wing catchall movement called PEGIDA, generally translated as Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West, which has taken to the streets in Dresden since October. Later, on a platform overlooking thousands of people, many of them wearing white roses as a sign of peace while bracing the icy cold outside the church, Orosz called on Dresden to remember every victim of the Nazi terror - a plea that was reiterated by German President Joachim Gauck when he took to the microphone: \u201cWe don't want the pain that people suffered here to be misused by others.\u201d Behind him, the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, who, back in the Frauenkirche, had talked of the \u201cmiracle that peace in Europe represents,\u201d leaned in closer to his interpreter. Then, as evening fell over Dresden and church bells tolled, thousands - possibly as many as 10,000, according to the city's press office - lined up along Dresden's riverfront, holding hands to commemorate the dead and call for peace as police men dressed in black riot gear looked on. \"I can remember it all,\" Siegfriede Leonhard, a vivacious woman in her late 70s said. She was 7 when the bombs fell, she said, and had been coming to the commemorations in Dresden \"for at least 60 years.\" Sometimes, she said, stomping her feet to keep warm, she wondered whether she shouldn't remember at home, alone. \"",
        "generated_story": "Dresden, Germany ( DW) February 13, 1945: The German city of Dresden was hit by Allied bombings in the autumn of 1945. The bombing of the city took place during the month of February. German Chancellor Joachim Gauck visited the German capital on the eve of World War II. He was accompanied by his wife Helma Orosz and their two children, Yadegar Asisi, who were visiting from the United States at the time. They had been staying in Dresden since the fall of Nazi Germany in October 1945, when the Soviet Red Army took over the eastern city. In the months following the bombing, the Germans were forced to evacuate their homes and offices. Many of their belongings were taken to Dresden, where they were stored in a storage facility. Some of them were burned to the ground by the Allied bombing. Others, however, were left to rot in an underground bunker under the rubble of a bombed-out apartment building. A number of people died, including the mayor, as well as the police and fire department. Most of those who died were German citizens, and many others were from other countries, such as Britain, Ireland, France, Italy, Spain, Russia, Iran, Turkey and Iran. \"The German people did not have a choice,\" said German journalist Naomi Conrad, adding that \"the Germans had a lot to do with it.\" \"They had no choice but to go to war,\" she said, referring to Germany's war in 1945-1946. 'They did everything they could to protect themselves and the people of Germany.\" The attack on Dresden's Frauenkirche in February 1945 was the first time Germany had ever been targeted by an Allied attack. It also marked the beginning of an era of anti-Semitism in Europe, with the rise of radical Islam in Germany and a rise in radicalization in other parts of Europe. At the same time, it was also a time when Germany was becoming a more tolerant and tolerant country, which is why the Nazis were able to impose their own policies on Germany. But the war also had an impact on German society, too. Nazi-era propaganda was used as a weapon to spread propaganda against the West and spread the Nazi ideology of Nazism. This was not to be the last time that Germany suffered such an attack, but it certainly wasn't the only time in history that it had suffered from this kind of propaganda. And it's not just Germany that was responsible for it. There were also the deaths of hundreds of thousands of young people, many of whom had fled the country in order to escape the horrors of war. For example, in 2005, a group of students from Dresden were killed by a bomb that exploded on their way to a school in Berlin, killing more than 1,000 people. These students were among the most radical and radicalized students in German history, according to eyewitnesses. One of these students was a young man who was studying at a nearby university. His father, Siegfriede Leonhard, was an Iranian-born teacher who had studied at Dresden. Later in his life, he became a teacher and became an author. Now he is a professor of political science at Berlin's University of Applied Sciences, specializing in political philosophy and philosophy. As a result of his studies, his father is an academic and political scientist who studies the history of Islamization of Western Europe and has written a book on Islam. According to his book, \"Islamization\" is the word used to describe the Holocaust. However, this is not a word that is used in Nazi propaganda, especially when it comes to Nazi atrocities. Germany has long been accused of being a racist country and of having a culture of intolerance toward Muslims. That's a fact that has not been accepted by many Germans, even though it has been proven to have been the case for decades."

Many others were wounded when the float they were traveling on made contact with a power line. Officials in Port-au-Prince said the accident occurred as thousands of revelers filled the streets of the city center of the Haitian capital in the early hours of Tuesday. The Associated Press quoted witnesses at the scene who reported seeing somebody on one of the floats used a stick or pole to move a power line so that the vehicle could pass under it. Reuters cited a witness who reported seeing the head of a singer from the hip-hop band Barikad Crew make contact with the power line. Some of the victims were electrocuted instantly, while others jumped off the float, causing panic among the revelers who lined the street. Many of the at least 18 deaths came as a result of the ensuing panic, while at more than 40 others were injured, according to local authorities. There was some confusion about the number of fatalities, with the Associated Press putting it at 20, and AFP later reported that only around 10 had died. Haitian President Michel Martelly used his Twitter account to express his condolences to the injured and bereaved. \"My sincere sympathies to the victims of the serious incident that occurred this morning at the Champ de Mars (area in downtown Port-au-Prince),\" the president said. pfd/rc (AP, Reuters, AFP)",

The death toll rose to 18 on the day of the Carnival, which begins on Carnival Day. At least 19 people were killed and more than 100 injured in an accident at the city's Champ de Mars Carnival festival, according to the Associated Press, Reuters, AFP and the Haitian news agency AP. \"We are mourning the loss of so many people,\" the AP said, adding that it was unclear how many more people had been killed or injured. It was not immediately clear who was responsible for the accident, but it is not clear whether the victims were Haitian, French, Haitian or French nationals. Authorities have said they are still investigating the cause of Tuesday's tragedy. Several people have been arrested in connection with the incident, and police are searching for those responsible. They are expected to be charged with murder, as well as other crimes, including attempted murder and attempted manslaughter. Many of those who died were members of a hip-hop band called Barikad Crew, a group of Haitian musicians who have performed at several carnival events over the past few years. Among the dead were three young men and one woman, aged between 18 and 24, who were from the same family. Some of them were in their 20s and 30s, while others were older than 30. Police have not yet released the names of all those killed, though they say they believe they may have died of natural causes. In the aftermath of Monday's disaster, the president's office said he was \"deeply saddened\" by the death of one of his bandmates. He also said that he would not be able to provide details about the other victims, saying they were all Haitian citizens. His office did not respond to a request for comment on whether or not he had received death threats. But he did say that the situation was under control and that his government was working to find a way to deal with it. 'We have a lot of work ahead of us,' he said on Twitter. On social media, he called on Haitians to come to his aid and \"to help us in any way we can.\" In a statement on his Twitter account, Martell said: \"I am deeply saddened by what has happened. I have no idea what is going on in my life right now but I am very sad for my family and for all of my friends and my countrymen who are suffering from this tragedy.\" He added that \"it is very difficult for me to understand what happened in this situation.\" \"It is a tragedy that is so tragic that we have to work together to solve it,\" he added, referring to what he described as a \"horrifying situation in our country.\" The incident took place during Carnival season, in which thousands of people gather to celebrate the annual festival of music and dance. Thousands of mourners have gathered to mark the occasion, with many singing, dancing, singing and dancing to music from bands from around the world. There were also reports of looting and looting in some neighborhoods. One person was killed by a car bomb. Another was injured when the car exploded, killing two people. Other people died when it exploded. More than a dozen other vehicles were damaged, officials said. Officials said the explosion was caused by an explosion at a bus stop in central Haiti."

        "target": "Unilateral Saudi cease-fire in Yemen to begin on May 12 Saudi Arabia has announced a five-day humanitarian cease-fire in Yemen starting from next Tuesday. Meanwhile, US Secretary of State John Kerry has urged all parties to find a political solution to the conflict. \"We have made a decision that the cease-fire will begin this Tuesday, May 12, at 11.00 pm and will last for five days subject to renewal if it works out,\" Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir told a meeting of Gulf ministers in Paris on Friday alongside US Secretary of State John Kerry. The minister added that the cease-fire could be extended depending on the response from Yemen's Shiite Houthi rebels. Al-Jubeir said he hoped the Iran-backed rebels would \"come to their senses\" and agree to the truce. He urged them to stop fighting. \"We hope the Houthis will come to their senses and realize the interests of Yemen and the Yemeni people should be the top priority for everyone,\" he said. It is unclear whether the Houthis would reciprocate the Saudi gesture. \"The cease-fire will end should Houthis or their allies not live up to the agreement - this is a chance for the Houthis to show that they care about their people and they care about the Yemen people,\" the Saudi foreign minister emphasized. At this point, US Secretary of State John Kerry said anyone who cared about Yemeni people \"should take clear notice of the fact that a human catastrophe is building,\" adding that a cease-fire was \"not peace\" and that all parties must find a political solution to end the conflict. Kerry urged all sides to hold talks immediately. Saudi ultimatum Hours before the cease-fire announcement, Saudi Arabia declared a Houthi stronghold along its southern border a \"military target,\" giving an ultimatum to the residents to leave the area, Saudi state-run TV reported. Lately, the northern Yemeni province of Saada has become a battleground for the Shiite rebels and the Saud-led coalition forces as the Houthis carried out border attacks on nearby Saudi cities. More than 50 airstrikes hit Saada overnight and in the early hours of Friday morning, Yemeni officials said. A Saudi-led coalition of Arab states launched an air campaign against the Houthis on March 26. Riyadh accuses Tehran of backing the rebels, who have made significant territorial gains in the impoverished Middle Eastern country, capturing the capital Sanaa and ousting internationally recognized President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, who fled Yemen back in March. The Sunni Gulf states are wary of Iran's increasing influence in the region, and they see the Houthis' advance in Yemen as a move that threatens their regional and geopolitical interests. Over 1,200 people have been killed in Yemen since the start of the Saudi campaign, according to the United Nations. shs/bw (AFP, dpa, Reuters, AP)",
        "generated_story": "Saudi Arabia announces cease-fire in Yemen Yemen's war-torn country is set to end on May 12, Saudi Arabia's foreign minister Adel al-Jubeir said on Tuesday. The Saudi-led coalition of Arab states and the United Nations (UN) has announced that it will end a three-month-long ceasefire in the country, which has been in place since the Houthis seized Sanaa in March. \"We will continue to work with our Yemeni partners to ensure that the situation is stable and stable,\" he said in a statement, adding that he hoped the ceasefire would last until the end of the month. Houthi forces have been fighting for months, but they have so far failed to reach the Yemeni capital of Saada, where they are battling for control of a large swathe of territory. Yemeni President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi has vowed to keep fighting until he is forced to give up his seat at the UN Security Council. On Tuesday, the US Secretary of State John Kerry said he would visit the capital to meet with the president and his family in Riyadh on the sidelines of an international conference on Yemen. He also said that Iran would not intervene militarily in any way to stop the fighting. Riyadh has also promised to provide humanitarian aid to the impoverished country's most vulnerable people, according to a US State Department statement. Iran is also expected to send a delegation to attend the meeting. Tehran has denied any involvement in fighting, saying it is \"not involved in this conflict.\" The US, Britain, France, Germany and France have all called for a ceasefire between the two countries, while Iran has called on Riyadh to step up its support for the government of President Abd-Rabbbo Muhamed Ruhollah Khadi, who has ruled Yemen for more than a year. Washington, Paris, London and Paris are among the countries that have urged the Saudis to extend the truce until at least mid-May, when it could be extended to include all of Yemen, as well as other Arab countries. In Paris on Wednesday, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said Riyadh would continue its efforts to push for an end to fighting between Shiite rebels and Iranian-backed forces, including Iran, in an attempt to prevent a military intervention. Saudi foreign ministers have said they will also continue their talks with Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to try to resolve the conflict. They have not yet agreed on a date, however, and have yet to set a time frame for when the talks will take place. At the same time, they say they expect to hold a meeting in Tehran on June 12 to discuss a possible date for talks between Riyadh and Tehran. Yemen is currently embroiled in civil war with Iran over the fate of its former president, former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, over his role as head of Iran's nuclear program. According to US President Barack Obama, Riyadh is likely to announce a decision on whether to impose sanctions on Iran on March 26, a move that is seen as a step toward ending the war. However, Washington has not ruled out the possibility of imposing sanctions. It has said it has no intention of doing so, though, that Tehran is not ready to do so until it sees the consequences of any further escalation of tensions between Tehran and Riyadh. That would be a major blow to Riyadh's relations with Tehran if it does not take action against Iran. Meanwhile, Iran and Iran have also expressed their concern that Yemen will not be able to achieve a peaceful solution to its long-running conflict with its Shiite-dominated government."

        "target": "Aging health: WHO call to action as world population over 60 set to double by 2050 In a new report on aging and health, the World Health Organization is calling for action on \"population aging,\" as figures suggest the number of people over 60 will reach two billion by 2050. People worldwide are living longer, says the World Health Organization in its World Report on Aging and Health. This is both good and bad. It gives us the chance to \"pursue new activities\" as we get older, such as in education and family life. But it all depends on our health. And for that the WHO says world governments need to act now to make sure our societies worldwide are ready. What are the take home facts from the World Health Organization's 2015 report on Aging and Health? The WHO says that in the next 35 years, the global number of people aged 60 years and over will almost double from 12 percent to 22 percent. By 2020, there will be more people over the age of 60 than 5 year olds. And a majority of older people (80 percent) will live in \"low and middle income\" countries. It's estimated that the world's population aged 60 years and older will total about 2 billion in 2050, which is more than twice as much as now. Furthermore, worldwide, about 125 million people are aged 80 years or older. But by 2050, it is expected that this number of people - aged 80 and over - will live in China alone. But I'm not old, so why should I care? Well, all this is happening at a faster rate than ever before. And the WHO says \"all countries face major challenges to ensure that their health and social systems are ready\" for this major demographic shift. It will cost a lot of money to improve health and social infrastructures, especially in more developed countries where traditional families structures have changed dramatically. Surely, there's \"no typical older person,\" though. How does the WHO define aging? We tend to think of older people as physically and mentally frail. But that's not necessarily the case, not everywhere in the world. Old is a relative concept - especially in middle income to rich countries. For instance, some 70 year olds are as fit as some 20 year olds. Just think how many older folk are at your gym, and ask yourself whether you can keep up with all of them. But that still doesn't explain aging. What is it exactly? The WHO says that at a biological level, \"aging results from the impact of the accumulation of a wide variety of molecular and cellular damage over time.\" Basically, this puts people at a higher risk of disease and, of course, death. But aging can also be associated with \"life transitions,\" such as retirement or witnessing other people, such as friends and family, die around you. This can affect you psychologically and sometimes, as a result, physically. What sort of diseases come with old age? Some of the most common non-fatal conditions include hearing loss, cataracts, back and neck pain and osteoarthritis. Other conditions include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - which affects the lungs - diabetes, depression, and dementia. What needs to be done? The WHO is proposing a five-step plan of action, which includes: Committing to healthy aging and \"evidence-based policies to strengthen the abilities of older persons.\" Aligning health systems with the needs of older populations Developing systems for providing long-term care Creating \"age-friendly cities and communities Improving measurement, monitoring and understanding of \"aging issues\" worldwide. But don't forget: \"a longer life brings with it opportunities, not only for older people and their families, but also for societies as a whole.\"",
        "generated_story": "The WHO's Population Aging Plan: Actions Now The World Health Organization (WHO) has unveiled its new population aging plan, which aims to reduce the number of people living in poverty by 2050. The WHO has set out its plan for the next five years, with the aim of reducing the amount of elderly people who die each year. But the WHO says the plan will not be enough to achieve this goal. \"We need to take action now,\" WHO chief Catherine Ashton said in a statement, adding that \"we must act now to prevent the spread of germs in the population.\" The plan is based on a five-year plan that was developed in 2015. It will be implemented in phases, starting in 2050, and ending in 2020. In the first phase, it is expected to be phased out over the course of five to seven years. At the end of that time, the government will have to make a decision on whether or not to implement the new plan. For example, in 2030, China will become the world's second-largest economy, followed by the United States and Russia. China is the third-biggest economy after the US and the European Union, according to WHO figures. That's a big change from the past, when China was the only country to have a population of 1.5 billion people. And it's not just China that will benefit from it. There's also the possibility of China becoming the second largest economy by 2030. If China's population is to reach 2.4 billion by 2040, that would be a record for a country that has never had more than one million people aged under the age of 65. This is a huge change for China, as it has been for over a century. However, there's still a long way to go before China can become a world leader in aging and health. What's next? What can we do to address the aging problem? Read more: WHO plans to cut down on aging, health-related deaths in China and other developing countries, including the Philippines, India and South Korea, WHO said on Wednesday that it would take \"significant action\" to tackle the ageing problem. World health officials have said they are working closely with WHO to develop a plan to curb the deaths of older people and prevent them from becoming more vulnerable to the disease that causes them to die prematurely. WHO: Action now is needed to avert the death of millions of young people, says WHO Secretary-General Margaret Chan"

        "target": "Trudeau declares victory in Canada as Harper resigns Justin Trudeau of the Liberal Party has been elected Canada's new prime minister. Stephen Harper has stepped down as leader of the Conservatives after nine years in the top job. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper resigned as Conservative Party leader on Tuesday after the Liberals, led by Justin Trudeau, emerged victorious in legislative elections. \"I have spoken to Prime Minister Stephen Harper, and he has instructed me to reach out to the newly elected parliamentary caucus to appoint an interim leader,\" Conservative Party president John Walsh said in a statement. \"The people are never wrong,\" Harper said of his defeat. \"The disappointment is my responsibility and mine alone,\" Harper said, adding that he had called Trudeau to congratulate him. Trudeau calls for hopeful, diverse future In electing Trudeau, the charismatic son of a former popular prime minister, Canadian voters illustrated the growing discontent with nine years of Conservative rule that saw lowering of corporate taxes, avoidance of climate change legislation and disagreement with the Obama administration over the controversial Keystone XL pipeline. \"Canadians have spoken,\" Trudeau said, adding that he would be the man to lead the \"hopeful, positive\" country \"with a vision\" that they had asked for. In his victory speech, Trudeau said his government \"believed deeply in the diversity of our country,\" striking a contrast with the strain of nativism that had become apparent under Conservative rule. \"We beat fear with hope,\" said Trudeau, a 43-year-old former teacher. Liberals blow past projected results Projections ahead of the elections had Harper and Trudeau in a dead heat, but as polls closed on Monday night it became clear that the Liberals had won an outright majority, with a projected 175 of parliament's 338 seats. This represented a huge leap from four years ago when Liberals were handed their most crushing defeat in history with a mere 34 seats. Harper will stay on as a member of Parliament for his constituency, public broadcaster CBC reported, as he was re-elected to his seat. The left-leaning New Democratic Party had hoped to capitalize on its second-place finish in 2011, but only managed to come in third with CBC estimating that the party had garnered 32 seats. es/cmk (AP, Reuters) Have something to say?

        "generated_story": "Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper steps down as leader of the Conservative Party Canada's prime minister has stepped down from his post as the country's leader. Harper has been in office since 2011, when he took over from former Liberal Party leader John Walsh, who had served as Harper's chief of staff from 2011 to 2011. The former Conservative party leader has announced his resignation, effective immediately, from the leadership of his own party, the New Democratic Party (NDP), which he founded in 2011 and which has since become the governing party of Canada. His resignation comes a day after he was ousted by President Barack Obama for failing to deliver on his promise to make Canada a better place to live in the 21st century. \"I am no longer a leader,\" Harper said in a statement on Monday, adding that he would not seek re-election. He also said that the party would continue to seek a new leader, but that it would be \"very difficult\" for him to do so given the current political situation in Canada, which is still in its early stages of a transition period. In his first speech since taking over, Harper had promised to work with the new government on the Keystone XL pipeline, a controversial project that would allow Canada to build the world's largest oil pipeline. It would also be the first time that a Canadian president had been elected to the post since World War II. Obama's predecessor, then-Prime Minister John Moore, had called on Harper to step down, saying he had \"no choice\" but to take the reins of power. But Harper, in his final speech before the House of Commons on Tuesday, also called for the resignation of Harper and Trudeau, as well as for Trudeau to be replaced by Justin Trudeau and the Liberals, and that Harper would take over the role of head of government from Trudeau. (Reuters, AP, Reuters) \"It's a sad day for Canada and Canada,\" said Harper in an interview with CBC's \"The Canadian Press.\" \"We are deeply saddened by the loss of our leader and we are very disappointed that we have lost him,\" he said, referring to his predecessor as \"the most powerful man in Canadian politics.\" Harper was elected as Canada\u2019s premier in 2010, after a five-year term in which the Conservatives were the only major party to gain a majority in Parliament. Canada has a long tradition of electing prime ministers who are elected by their respective provinces, including the federal Liberals and New Democrats. That tradition has not changed since Harper took office, however. Since then, it has remained the same, with Harper serving as prime ministerial candidate for five consecutive terms, while Trudeau has held the position of president since the 2011 election. However, he has also been unable to get the job done in recent years. Last year, his successor, former New Democrat leader Paul Ryan, took the oath of office from Harper. This year's election was marked by a number of changes in government. One of those changes was the creation of an independent cabinet, led by former Canadian Premier John Walker. Another was a change of leadership, following the departure of outgoing Liberal leader Justin Trudy. Trudeau was chosen to replace Harper with former premier Justin Harper on Sunday. Both men are now in their own right, though Harper is not expected to run again until the next general election in 2014. Meanwhile, Trudeau will be sworn into office in January, replacing Harper at the end of next year."

        "target": "Maldives revokes state of emergency citing improved security situation The president of the Maldives has lifted a state of emergency following an outcry from the international community. The government says the measures are no longer necessary because the security threat has subsided. The government said Tuesday it had rescinded the emergency measures \"with immediate effect\" and that \"all fundamental rights that were suspended have been restored.\" President Yameen Abdul Gayoom declared the state of emergency one week ago after the discovery of a homemade bomb and a stash of weapons near his official residence. The finding followed an explosion on Gayoom's speedboat in September - an incident the government labeled an assassination attempt. The president was not hurt in the blast, but his wife, an aide and a bodyguard were injured. The emergency regulations, intended to be in place for 30 days, gave security forces wide-ranging search and arrest powers, and suspended citizens' basic rights. They drew criticism from former colonial power Britain as well as the United States, the European Union and neighboring Sri Lanka. Reading out a presidential decree revoking the emergency, Attorney General Mohamed Anil said there was no longer a threat to the Indian Ocean atoll nation. He said investigations into the September blast and the recovery of weapons had made good progress. The foreign ministry said a number of people had been arrested. Lawmakers also used the security regulations to fast-track the impeachment of Vice President Ahmed Adeeb, who stands accused of plotting the alleged attempts on the president's life. Impact on tourism Attorney General Anil said pressure from the international community, as well as \"the possible adverse impact on Maldives tourism and the economy,\" had also played a role in ending the state of emergency. Foreign tourists visiting the tropical nation, known for its luxury tourist resorts, palm-fringed beaches and coral reefs, contribute close to a third of the country's gross domestic product. The Maldives has had a rocky road to democracy since holding its first multiparty election in 2008. The country's first democratically elected leader, current opposition chief Mohamed Nasheed, was forced to step down in 2012 after a mutiny by security forces. In March, he was jailed for 13 years on terrorism charges in a trial the United Nations said was illegal. President Gayoom is under intense international pressure to release him. Nasheed's opposition Maldivian Democratic Party welcomed Tuesday's announcement. But said declaring the state of emergency in the first place was a political move designed to stop a rally planned for last week calling for Nasheed's freedom. \"It appears that Yameen is willing to make up threats about the nation's security in order to settle political scores,\" the party said in a statement, referring to the president. nm/kms (AP, AF, Reuters, dpa)",
        "generated_story": "Maldives' state of emergency lifted despite international criticism The Maldives government has lifted a state-of-emergency in the southern island nation of the Indian Ocean, the United Nations said on Tuesday. The government of Yameen Abdul Gayoom, who has been in power since 2008, said it had lifted the emergency in response to criticism from the international community that it was an attempt to protect the country's political and economic interests. Opposition leader Mohamed Nasheed said in a statement that the government would not be allowed to take any further action. \"We will not allow any action against the opposition,\" he said, adding that \"the government will continue to do its utmost to uphold the constitution and the rule of law.\" The United States, Britain, Sri Lanka, India and Britain have all condemned the move, saying it is a violation of international law. Britain has also called for an end to the state emergency, which had been imposed in 2008 to prevent the Maldivian Democratic Party (DDP) from taking over the presidency. However, it has not yet decided whether it will do so, according to British Prime Minister Theresa May. On Tuesday, British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson announced that Britain would no longer be involved in any political or economic dispute between the two countries. He also said the UK would continue its support for the DDP, a political party that has ruled the island for more than a decade. In the past, opposition leader Ahmed Adeeb said he was \"very happy\" with the decision. But he added that he did not want to give up on the idea of a peaceful transition of power. 'We are not going to allow this to happen again,' he told a news conference in London. According to a UN statement, \"The government is committed to ensuring that all political, economic and social issues are dealt with in an orderly and orderly manner.\" \"I am very happy that we have been able to move forward with our plans,\" the statement said. It added, however, that there was no need for a military intervention, as the situation was still under control in 2012, when the military seized the capital, Male, from a rebel-led government that had ruled since the end of World War II, and that this was the first time that a civilian government had ever taken over a democratically elected government. This is the second time in as many years that I have had to step down as president. I am happy to see that our country is doing the right thing, but I do not think it's the only thing that can be done in this situation,\" said Mohamed Anil, an opposition politician who was elected as vice president in March 2012. Abroad, 'The people are the ones who have to decide what is best for us' The move comes after months of criticism by the US and other countries that have criticized the ruling party for not doing enough to address the issue. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has said that US President Barack Obama's decision to lift the ban on travel to India was a \"tactical decision\" that could have led to an escalation of tensions between Washington and Beijing. Reuters, AP, AFP, dpa and Reuters reported that President Obama had called off the travel ban, citing unnamed US officials, while the European Union's Foreign Affairs Secretary Federica Mogherini said Britain was also considering a similar move."

        "target": "Belarusian president accuses Germany, Poland of coup plans Before being sworn in for a fourth term, the reclusive leader of Belarus fired a warning salvo at the European Union, accusing Germany and Poland of plotting a coup and threatening action against sanctions. Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko was sworn into office on Friday in a lavish ceremony boycotted by Western diplomats. The previous day, the 56-year-old leader openly accused Germany and neighboring Poland of planning a coup against him. \"There were [in Germany and Poland] plans worked out for an overthrow of the constitutional order,\" Lukashenko said in the Belarusian capital, Minsk, on Thursday. \"This is not an invention of our intelligence agencies.\" Lukashenko, who came to power in 1994, was re-elected last month with 80 percent of the vote in what the opposition and international monitors said was a rigged election. Relations between the reclusive Belarusian government and the West have been strained ever since. 'Belarus question must be answered' German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said in a statement that the accusations were \"baseless\" and an attempt by Lukashenko to draw attention away from his own wrongdoing. \"The EU needs to find a clear political answer to events surrounding the presidential election and the continued incarceration of opposition politicians and their supporters,\" Westerwelle said. A wide-reaching crackdown against the regime's opponents followed Lukashenko's re-election. Hundreds of his critics were arrested and dozens threatened with long-term jail sentences. Poland also dismissed the accusations as absurd and said that relations with Minsk would not be normalized unless all political prisoners were released. Sanctions threat The situation in Belarus pushed the European Union to adopt a resolution on Thursday in support of economic sanctions against the country. The threats earned a sharp rebuke from Lukashenko, who promised the \"hardest possible reaction\" should the bloc impose sanctions against his country. At the same time, the Belarusian prime minister, Mikhail Myasnikovich, travelled to Moscow in a effort to shore up Russian support for Minsk during its standoff with the EU. That meeting ended with a Russian promise not to impose its own set of sanctions on Belarus over an unrelated spat over oil exports and a commitment to resume a nuclear power plant project shelved after the 1986 Chernobyl disaster.

The country's new President has been barred from running for a second term in office after he was accused of fraud and corruption in his first term as head of state. He was barred by the European Union, the EU and the United States on Friday from campaigning in the capital, Minsk, on the eve of the first round of elections for the post of President of Belarus, which is due to take place on Saturday. Belarus has said it will not run for another term and that it would not seek a third term. \"We are not in a position to run again,\" said Guido Westerwelle, Belarus's foreign minister, who was not present at the election. According to a statement from the German Foreign Ministry, \"we have not been able to find any evidence of any wrongdoing in this election.\" The European Commission, however, said that the country would continue to investigate the allegations against the former president. It said the accusations were \"unfounded,\" adding that there was \"no doubt\" that he had been involved in illegal activities during the past two years, such as collecting bribes from businessmen, politicians, and others. But it did not say how much money was being spent, nor did it say whether it amounted to any money at all. In the event of a vote of no confidence, it was unclear how many votes were cast and whether the results would be counted. On Thursday, a parliamentary election was held in Belarus to elect a new president who would take over the presidency from former Prime Minister Mikhail Myasnikovich (pictured above), who had won a landslide victory in 1994.

        "target": "Berlin court rules Google Street View is legal in Germany A Berlin court has ruled that Google Street View is legal. But that doesn't mean the lawsuits will end, legal scholars say. A Berlin court has ruled that Google Street View is, in fact, legal in Germany. Last Tuesday, the Berlin State Supreme Court (Kammergericht) announced its decision in a court case from late last year, in which a woman had sued Google, fearing that photos of her, her family and the front of her house would be posted on Google Street View and would thus violate her property and privacy rights. The court ruled that it is legal to take photographs from street level, rejecting her argument that Google was trying to take unauthorized pictures. Part of her argument rested on the fact that Google used cameras mounted at three meters (9.84 feet) high, which could see over her two-meter-high hedge. However, the court did not find this argument convincing, given that the photographs were taken from the street, and not the sidewalk. Furthermore, because Google automatically blurs faces and license plates and did allow Germans to opt-out of the service to have their house obfuscated as well, the court did not find any potential violations. This is the first high-level court ruling, which cannot be appealed any further, regarding Street View since the service debuted in Germany at the end of last year. An ongoing debate Since Google announced plans to launch Street View in Germany last summer, debate around the service has become heated, with some politicians trying to stop it at every turn, while German Chancellor Angela Merkel famously said that she would not remove her house from Street View. In November 2010, the company announced that 244,000 German residents in the 20 cities had chosen to opt out of Street View - less than three percent of residents. However, in Germany and everywhere else, the company also allows people to report abuse, inaccuracies or request that something be blurred using an online tool. \"Our job is to develop services that respect these cultural differences,\" Peter Fleischer, Google's global privacy counsel told Deutsche Welle in November 2010. \"We try to anticipate them. We're all internationally-minded people ourselves. We try to guess how people will react to them. But a lot of these services are new and have never been on the market before, so we learn and we adapt as we go along.\" A 'landmark decision' European legal experts called the Berlin ruling a \"landmark decision,\" saying that this would now become part of German case law regarding property rights. \"Yes, other people are now warned: Don't sue Google simply claiming that Google Street View violates personality [or] property rights,\" wrote Thomas H\u00f6ren, a professor of media and communications law at the University of M\u00fcnster, in an e-mail sent to Deutsche Welle. But, he also warned that this decision was very narrow, focusing on the issue of property rights, and not on the larger issues of data protection from Google. \"The problem of Google Street View - to be honest - has never been a problem of personality rights or property rights, but the enormous risk of personal data compilations in cases where people use Google Street View for compiling personal profiles (such as building insurance companies; future employees, et cetera),\" he added. \"And this risk has not been considered by the Berlin courts.\" Similarly, Viktor Mayer-Sch\u00f6nberger, a professor at the Oxford Internet Institute, agreed that this case was \"limited in scope,\" adding in an e-mail, \"The plaintiff never alleged an actual invasion of privacy, just a potential one.\" Author: Cyrus Farivar Editor: Nancy Isenson",

It comes after a year-long legal battle between Google and the state supreme court in Berlin over Google's decision to allow the search giant to sell its street-view service to the public. In November 2010, the court ruled in favor of Google, saying that Google had violated German law by selling the service without a license. Since then, Google has made a number of changes to its search terms and services. One of those changes is that the company will no longer be able to offer search services to people who don't have a Google account. Another change, however, will be to Google Maps, which is currently available on the Google app store. Google said it would not be making any further changes until the end of the year. \"We are not going to make any changes at all,\" Google CEO Peter Fleischer told Deutsche Welle in an interview. He added that it was \"very important\" for Google to do so, adding that \"we will continue to work with the government to ensure that we have the best user experience possible.\" The court also said Google should not have to pay for the services it offers to those who do not already have one. According to a report by German news agency dpa, \"the decision will not affect the quality of our search results.\" Google is not the only company to have made the decision, but it is also the most important one, according to an Oxford Internet Institute researcher, Thomas H\u00f6ren, who is a professor at the University of M\u00fcnster. His research center is based in Munich, Germany, and he has worked with Google for more than a decade. For example, he said, in November 2009, when Google began offering search-based services, there was a lot of interest in Google. However, this was not enough to convince people to give up their search. Instead, they were told that they would be forced to buy Google products. This was the second time in as many years that a decision had been reached in this case, after the city of Berlin's high court on November 6, 2010. That decision was appealed to Germany's highest court, where the ruling was upheld by an appeals court last month. But it did not come as a surprise to many people. After all, it's not just Google that has the power to decide whether or not to let people search for a location in a city like Berlin. There are other companies, too, as well, such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Twitter. And there are companies like Google which have had a long history of doing so. They are also known as the \"Google of Europe\" and they are known for their open-source search service. These companies have also been known to use Google-owned services for search, advertising, news and entertainment. Some of these companies also have their own websites and apps that are available in German, German and English. Others, including Google itself, have been working on similar products for years. At the same time, many of them are still using Google services in other European countries, like Facebook and Amazon. On Tuesday, a group of students from the university's business school, Karl-Marx Institute, published a blog on its website, called \"The Internet of Germany,\" which was founded in 2010 and is now called the Web of Information and Technology (web of information). The blog's founder, Viktor Mayer-Sch\u00f6nberger, said he was pleased to hear the news."

        "target": "In Argentina, red wine exports to balance Porsche imports About 100 Porsches are imported to Argentina each year. Now the country wants to keep a positive trade balance by having the value of the imported luxury cars matched by red wine exports. Porsche is currently enjoying record profits after a two-year downturn, but the export-reliant company has hit a pothole in Argentina. Buenos Aires-based Porsche importer Grupo Pulenta has signed an agreement obligating it to export several hundred bottles of red wine for each car it imports, the Argentine government announced Wednesday. Grupo Pulenta declined to comment when contacted by Deutsche Welle. Job creation During the past year, Argentina has held thousands of high-end vehicles in customs until companies agreed to export goods valued at the same amount. Most of those vehicles came from Germany. According to a spokeswoman for the Argentine embassy in Berlin, the country has been trying to safeguard domestic employment with a positive trade balance. \"Our government has negotiated with automakers to balance their imports of cars with an equivalent amount of exports,\" she told Deutsche Welle in a statement. \"Since March 2010 we have been working with the automakers and importers in order to increase local integration and reduce the trade deficit in this sector.\" Small market A Porsche spokesman said the company sells just short of 100 vehicles into Argentina each year. That compares to more than 40,000 sold worldwide during five months in 2010. \"For Porsche, Argentina is a rather small market,\" the spokesman told Deutsche Welle. \"Our importer, the Pulenta Group, also deals in wine. They have their own vineyards and export that wine. It has nothing to do with Porsche - we just have an import contract with them, and it seems they've found an individual solution with the Argentine government.\" Domestic production Volkswagen, which has an Argentine subsidiary producing the new \"Amarok\" pickup truck and transmissions, has thus far avoided mandatory exports. The company had reported an export surplus of 384 million euros ($545 million) for this year. Porsche's holding company owns 32.2 percent of Volkswagen, and the Porsche brand is intended to become integrated into Volkswagen's lineup. Daimler and BMW also have subsidiaries in Argentina. While Daimler produces its \"Sprinter\" there, BMW only imports to the country. According to the Argentine embassy in Berlin, the country has recently sought more domestic production by foreign car companies. Author: Gerhard Schneibel (dpa) Editor: John Blau",
        "generated_story": "German carmaker Porsche aims to balance red wine exports with German exports German car maker Porsche is looking to diversify its red wines exports to Argentina, Argentina and Germany. The company, which is based in the Argentine capital of Buenos Aires, is aiming to double its production capacity by the end of the year, according to a report by German newspaper Deutsche Welle. \"We are looking for new markets for our products,\" Porsche said in a statement on Wednesday, adding that it would be \"very happy to be able to expand our production base in Argentina.\" The German company said it was looking at a range of new products for the country, including a new Porsche SUV and a Mercedes-Benz Sprinter. It also plans to increase its sales in Germany and the United States, the report said. Amarok, a German wine importer, has been a key partner of Daimler for more than a decade, it added. In the first half of 2010 the company sold a total of 384 million euros ($545 million) worth of wine to the state of Argentina. This was the second time in as many years that the firm has sold wine from Argentina to Germany, and it is the third time it has done so since March 2010, when it sold its first-hand wine. According to German news agency dpa, this year's sales are expected to rise by about 10 percent, while the sales of German-made cars and SUVs are forecast to fall by up to 20 percent. That's a significant increase from the same period in 2010 when the prices of its cars rose by a third. But it's not clear how much of that is due to increased demand for German cars, or whether it will be enough to offset the increase in sales. For example, in March 2011, Porsche sold an additional 380,000 cars to BMW and Audi for 384.5 million Euros (1.4 billion euros) in total. Porsche, however, did not sell any wine, instead focusing on the German brand's flagship brand, Audi, as well as its premium models, such as the Porsche 918 and Porsche Cayenne, for which it had been selling for over a year. Volkswagen, meanwhile, sold only a small number of cars in its Argentina-based portfolio in 2009, but it still sold around 1.2 million cars a month, up from a similar amount in 2008. BMW has also sold over 1 million vehicles to Volkswagen and BMW in recent years, making it the world's second-biggest car brand behind Audi and Mercedes in terms of sales, after Porsche. And it also has a strong presence in South America, where it sells its flagship Porsche brand. However, Volkswagen is not the only company to do so, with the exception of Porsche and VW, that has not been doing so well in Latin America. Germany is also a major importers of Argentine wines. Argentina is one of several Latin American countries that have been hit hard by Argentina's economic downturn. There are also concerns that Argentina could become a dumping ground for Argentine wine imports, especially if the price of imported wine is too high. A recent study by Germany's state-run research institute, Amaroks, found that Argentine imports of Brazilian wine are growing at an average rate of 2.6 percent per year (2.7 percent) compared with other European countries. Brazil's government has criticized Argentina for its poor economic performance, saying it should not be allowed to import its own wine and that \"the country's economy is suffering from an economic crisis.\" Argentina has seen a sharp drop in oil prices since the 2008 financial crisis, prompting the government to impose import duties on imports from abroad. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has called for a ban on import tariffs on Argentine products, calling the move \"a waste of resources\" and saying Argentina \"needs to get its economy back on track\" in order to reduce its dependence on foreign imports."

It is Germany's first time hosting a major international event since the 1990s, when it hosted the FIFA International Champions Cup (FIFA), which was held at the Olympic Stadium in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. \"We are very excited to be hosting this event,\" German President Sigmar Gabriel said in a statement. According to the news agency Deutsche Welle, the event is expected to draw around 1,500,000 spectators, with the goal of reaching a total of 10 million. There will also be a chance for women to compete for the title of best player in Germany, as well as the chance to represent their country at a world-record level, according to a report by the German newspaper Deutsche Zeitung (DWD) in June. At the same time, Germany has announced that it would host its first international tournament since 1990. In addition to hosting an international competition, it will have a host of other events, including the 2011 FIFA Champions League and the 2010 FIFA Cup. Hosting an event \"This is a very important event for our country,\" said Gabriel, who is also the head of FIFA's international development committee. She said she was \"very excited\" about the prospect of hosting such a prestigious event, adding that she hoped to have the opportunity to showcase her talents in front of a crowd of thousands of fans. However, she said, \"I don't think it's a good idea for us to do this.\" Germany hosts the final match in September 2011 at Berlin's Olympian Stadium, where she will face the likes of France, Italy and Spain. Berlin is the host city for this year's tournament and has been preparing for it for several years. For the past two years, German women have been competing in international competitions, but this time around, they have not been able to get the best of both worlds. This year, however, there are a number of factors to consider. One of them is that the weather is not ideal for a tournament like the one Germany hosted last year. Another factor: the fact that there is no rain forecast. That means the temperature is forecast to drop to around 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) on the day of play. Other factors: weather, temperature, humidity, wind, rain, snow, temperatures, and humidity. And, of course, that's just the beginning. But, this is just one of many factors that will play a big role in deciding who will compete. What will happen when the competition is over? How will the teams fare? Who will get to decide who gets to play?"

        "target": "Beekeepers battle mites with technology Bees are useful, hard-working and vital for our ecosystem. Aside from making honey, bees pollinate most of our food crops. But summertime is also the season for one of the biggest threats to honey bees \u2013 the varroa mite. Dete Papendieck puts on a white veiled protective hat and takes out a metal jug with a beak-shaped spout. He sets fire to the container's contents \u2013 formic acid \u2013 and starts directing the smoke that is wafting at the beehives lined up in front of him in his garden on the outskirts of Bonn. The acid doesn't harm the bees, but it does kill the varroa mites, he says. And July, after most of the honey has been harvested, is the best time to treat his hives. The one millimeter-large varroa mite is a parasite that infests beehives and lays its eggs in the honeycombs, alongside the bees' larvae. \"It feeds on the bees' and the bee brood's blood, the so-called haemolymph,\" Papendieck explains. A third of bees killed in Germany Papendieck is an apiarist at the Bee Research Institute at the University of Bonn and he knows that the threat of mites is serious. If left untreated, varroa-infested colonies rarely survive a winter. In 2010, German beekeepers lost about 200,000 hives to the mite \u2013 one third of Germany's total bee population. And it is not just the honey and beeswax production that are affected by the mite. Many of our food crops depend on bees: Some 80 percent of all agricultural plants and 90 percent of fruit trees in Europe are pollinated by Apis mellifera, the European honeybee. Varroa introduced from Asia Had Dete Papendieck been a beekeeper forty years ago he would not have had to worry about mites. He says the varroa mite that was originally native to Asia, was introduced to Europe in the 1970s. \"It happened during a research project in which it was attempted to crossbreed the European honeybee with the Asian honeybee. The researchers were exchanging bee colonies between Europe and India, and that is how the mites came to Germany,\" Papendieck said. Unlike Asian bee species, the European honeybee cannot fight off the varoa mite by itself. According to Papendieck, bees easily transmit the mite to other beekeepers' hives in what apiarists call robbery. \"It happens when certain colonies are being robbed by other bees. Large numbers of bees from different colonies attack weak hives and steal their stocks. At the same time, parasites and diseases are exchanged\", he says. Researchers have been trying to breed varroa-resistant mites, but so far they haven't had much success. High-tech tools help fight the mite Klaus Maresch is also worried about his bees. He is an organic beekeeper from Bonn and he has been passionate about bees since he was a little boy. \"They are part of my family. When I open my hives and smell the honey and hear the buzzing of the bees it's like being in another world,\" he told Deutsche Welle. In addition to using formic acid to fight the mite, Klaus Maresch employs a high-tech tool \u2013 a special cylindrical scale that helps him determine when it is best to start the varroa treatment. \"Every day this hive scale sends data about the colonies to our server. The data, such as the temperature in the hive and the amounts of nectar and pollen collected, help me to find a good day to treat varroa,\" Maresch says. Maresch also makes the data about the activities in his hives available to fellow beekeepers who can treat their colonies accordingly. A driver's license for beekeepers? But it is not the mite that angers Maresch most. \"That's nature,\" he says, \"I feel angry about beekeepers who don't fight varroa. If the bees of neighboring beekeepers are infested, I also have a problem.\" The existing German pest regulation obliges beekeepers to treat their bees against varroa, but there are no strict controls. The majority of Germany's more-than-80,000 beekeepers are amateurs who keep between one and 20 colonies. This makes it difficult to impose and survey certain quality standards. Maresch, who sees himself as a kind of 'bee activist', would like to see the government introduce stricter rules. \"There should be a law that obliges every new beekeeper to learn about beekeeping before they are allowed to keep bees. They should get an education and there should be something like a driver's license for beekeepers,\" he says. In the mean time, Europe's bees are going to have to",
        "generated_story": "German beekeeper fights varroa mites with high-tech hive scale A bee keeper in Bonn, Germany, has fought a varoa mite that has been spreading across the country for more than a decade. The bee researcher, Klaus Maresch, is fighting the varoos with his bee hive, which he built in the summer of 2010. According to the Bee Research Institute (BRI), the honeybee hive is one of the most advanced in Europe. It is the first hive-scale hive that can be used to protect honeybees from pests and diseases. \"It's a hive of honey bees,\" he told Deutsche Welle, adding that the hive was built to withstand the harsh conditions of insects and insects. He added that it was the only hive he had ever built that could withstand such a harsh environment. But he said that he was not surprised by the success of his hive. In the past few years, the bee research institute has also been able to develop a new hive system for bees and other pollinators. For example, in 2010, it developed a honey hive which could house up to 10,000 bees at a time, according to a study published in a German newspaper, \"Deutsche Zeitung\" (DeWelle) and \"Die Zeit\" magazine (German) have also published a report on the bees' health and fitness in India, India and China. This report is based on a survey carried out by BRI researchers, who found that 70 percent of beekeepers in Germany had been infected with the bug, and that only 10 percent had contracted the disease. That's the second time in 10 years that a bee-keeper has had to be infected. And that's just the beginning of a long-term problem for the industry. A new honey bee is also being developed, but it's not clear how long it will take to catch up with other bees. So, for now, we're just going to have to wait and see what happens. I'm not sure what to expect from this hive but I think it could be a very long time before we get to that point. We'll see if we can get a handle on it, though, because we don't know for sure. There's also the possibility that some of these bees will get infected and die, or that they will be left to die. If that doesn't happen, then we'll have a lot of time to think about it. What do we need to do? We're still trying to figure out the best way to deal with this problem. Do we want to get rid of this bug that is causing so much trouble for our bees? I'd like to find out. Let's talk about how to prevent it from spreading to other areas of Europe and the Middle East. How to avoid it? How do you avoid the spread of diseases? Do you know what's going on in your own home? What are the chances of that happening to you? Is it possible that you'll get caught up in this one? If so, what will you do next? The answer is a combination of all these factors, including the number of bees that have been killed and how many of them have died. You can't just go back to your hive and leave it alone, right? And you can only go to one hive for a few days and then come back and get the rest of your honey. Or, if you're lucky, you will find that there's another hive in there, too. No matter what, that hive will still be there for you to use. Just like in other countries, there will always be something to keep you busy."

        "target": "Heidi hits the Big Screen Heidi, the world famous girl from the Swiss Alps who first appeared in a novel 121 years ago, has hit the big screen in a fresh look. A century after the death of Heidi inventor Johanna Spyri, the lovable Alpine heroine is being portrayed in a new film which replaces grassy slopes and mountainous range with city skyscrapers and city streets. The $ 3.5 million \"Heidi\", funded by the Z\u00fcrich-based film company Vega and directed by German film maker Markus Imboden, is to be launched in Germany on Thursday. The making of the film was one of the highlights of a past year of events including exhibitions, lectures and fireworks celebrating the July 7 2001 centenary of the death of Spyri, whose novel \"Heidi\" sold 20 million copies and has been translated in 50 languages worldwide. It is thought to be one of the most successful books of all times. The book has inspired 17 films, including Shirley Temple\u2019s Oscar winning portrayal of Heidi in 1937 and a Japanese cartoon series. Imboden\u2019s remake is the 18th \"Heidi\" film. Blue hair in Berlin According to Vega, \"the film was transmitted to today\u2019s world without losing sight of the original novel\". But Imboden\u2019s new movie is far from the charming original, with its rosy-cheeked, curly-headed Heidi, delicate Clara and goat-tending shepherd Peter\u2019s frail old grandmother. In the first film, Heidi, who lives happily with her grandfather in a tiny hut in the Swiss Alps is plucked from her contented life by her Aunt Dete to live in a stiff, rich family in the bustling metropolis, Frankfurt. Heidi becomes so home-sick, she starts to sleepwalk and is eventually sent home. But not before she causes confusion in the otherwise prim household and brings laughter in the life of the disabled and homely, Clara. The Heidi in the latest film has blue hair, surfs the net and roams the streets of Berlin. Friend and shepherd Peter sheds his rustic pastimes and whizzes down streets on his mountainbike. Clara is not the weak, lame young girl of the Spyri novel, but a moody Britney Spears wannabe. Aunt Dete is a modern-day stylist living fashionably in the German capital. The new surroundings are a far cry from the tranquil days of cow milking, goat- tending and flower-plucking in the verdant meadows of the Swiss Alps. Transforming the Heidi myth According to a Berlin daily, the remake is a \"refreshing Heidi\", adding that the script writers had managed to transform the Heidi \"myth\" into an independent, self-assured girl and not into a \"transfigured mountain heroine\". However, it is just this portrait of a naive and charming alpine heroine that has made Heidi so popular all over the world. Heidi has become a well-known Swiss brand worldwide. Some 60,000 tourists \u2013 half from Japan \u2013 are said to visit the picturesque wine-growing village in Graubuenden, which boasts the original Heidi House and other Heidi related attractions such as winding mountain trails and pastures. Imboden\u2019s film, which is to be launched in Germany on Thursday, will also open elsewhere in Europe, and may reach fans in Japan and South Korea too. Whether Imboden\u2019s blue-haired, computer savvy Heidi will charm her Asian viewers, however, remains to be seen.",
        "generated_story": "The Remake of Heidi in the Swiss Alps Heidi House has been made into a film starring Johanna Spyri and Markus Imboden. The film is based on Heidi's novel, which is set in Switzerland's Alps. Heidi is the first film to be made about Heidi, who was born in Germany in 1937. She is a German-born Swiss woman who grew up in Z\u00fcrich, a city of about 1.5 million people. In the film, Heidi and her husband, Peter, are the only people who have ever been able to live in a house with Heidi. They have lived there for more than a century, and Heidi has lived in one of the most beautiful houses in all of Europe. Her husband Peter is also an architect, but he is not a painter. He is an inventor, inventor and inventor. His inventions have been used in many films and television series, including \"The Hobbit,\" which was adapted from a novel by Norwegian author Johanne Spyra. \"I am a scientist, I am an artist, an engineer and a sculptor. I have always wanted to do something with my life,\" she said in an interview with the German newspaper Bild am SonntagsZeitung, where Heidi lives, said she was inspired to write the novel after hearing about her father's inventions. According to the newspaper, the book was written by a man who had been working on the project for several years. It was published in German in 2001 and was translated into English in 2005, with a cover by German magazine Vega, as well as in English and German. On Thursday, it was announced that Heidi would be making her first feature film in three years, in which she will play the lead role of a young woman named Heidi (born in 1938). She will also be playing a role as the mother of Peter's daughter, Clara (who died in 2002) and his wife, Joanna (now in her 80s), who are both German and Japanese, respectively. As for the director, he said he was \"very pleased\" with her work, adding that she had \"a lot to say\" about it and that he had a lot of respect for her. However, she also said, \"It's not just Heidi who is in this film.\" Heidi will be the subject of an Oscar-nominee for best actress, director and screenwriter in Berlin, according to a statement released on Thursday by the company's official website, Vega. But she has also written a book on her life, called \"Auntie Heidi,\" about the life of her son Peter and how she became a mother and grandmother. And she wrote a short story about how Heidi was raised by her mother, his father and step-grandmother, whose father was a Swiss inventor who worked as a gardener. Now she is married and has two children, her parents and two sisters. That's a big part of what makes Heidi so special to her, because she's the one who raised her and Peter so well. So she can be a great role model for other young people in Europe and the world. If Heidi can do that, then she'll be an inspiration to other people, too.\" The movie is being made by Swedish film maker Josef Vega and is directed by Johann Spyr, based in Zurich, Switzerland. Swedish director Jose Josep Arias is producing the new film with his own company Vega Films."

        "target": "Opinion: A decision against heart and mind The House of Commons has passed the Brexit bill - despite most parliamentarians being against it. But now they should take care that Great Britain does not move further away from Europe, writes Birgit Maass. If only they had done it out of full conviction. If they at least believed that they could really benefit their country by withdrawing from the EU. But many of the parliamentarians whose vote will finally set Brexit on its wayhave voted against their hearts, as well as their minds. It was a vote against their minds, because the withdrawal from the EU will almost certainly, at least on a short to medium term basis, have negative repercussions for the British economy. And it was a vote against their hearts, because for many, a view of the future, divorced from Brussels and increasingly reliant on an unpredictable US President Donald Trump, is somewhat alarming. In recent days, many members of parliament have described it as \"a catastrophe.\" No vote \"against the will of the people.\" Of course there are \"Brexiteers\" who believe that a Britain independent of Brussels will be able to return to its former greatness, once it is no longer held back by the \"Little Europeans.\" But they are in the minority - the majority of parliamentarians already declared their support for remaining in the EU during the referendum campaign. Yet despite this, Theresa May's government was able to push its legislative proposal through the House of Commons without any great difficulty. The predominant view, also amongst members of the two leading parties, is that to hinder Brexit and to fail to support the government in its endeavors to do so, would be to go \"against the will of the people.\" Anti-EU newspapers have targeted Brexit opponents. And those who have publically come out in support of the EU have had to reckon with death threats. The at times passionate debate in the lower house, that went on over several days, was a temporary highlight in this European tragedy, which in the worst case could contribute to the continent disintegrating into individual sovereign states. Don't be intimidated The British public supports the hard-line position taken by Prime Minister May in withdrawing from the common market. Polls are showing that her strategy is gaining increased support. There is no turning back now. The British are now looking for clarity on the repercussions of their withdrawal from the EU. They want the negotiations with the EU to start as soon as possible. It was an historical misjudgement by David Cameron that he could win the referendum. Most of the members of the lower house believed the then-prime minister and voted to hold a referendum. But now they can no longer stop Brexit. But they should not let themselves be intimidated by party discipline, nor the leading Brexiteers, nor by voter impatience. Over the next two years they should use every chance they can to influence the withdrawal process. May announced that although they are leaving the European Union, they will not be moving away from Europe. The parliamentarians must now hold her to her word. Have something to say? Add your comments below. The thread will stay open for 24 hours after publication.",
        "generated_story": "Britain's Brexit vote is not a referendum against the will of the people Britain's exit from the European Union has triggered a vote of no confidence in Prime Minister Theresa May. The British parliament voted to leave the EU on Thursday, triggering Article 50 of its Lisbon Treaty, which leaves the bloc without a single EU member state. Britain voted in favor of a no-deal Brexit in the House of Commons on Wednesday, leaving the 28-nation bloc with just one member, the United Kingdom. It is the first time the UK has voted against a deal that would have allowed Britain to exit the single market and the customs union with the US, EU and other member states. This is a historic moment for Britain as it prepares for a new chapter in its history. \"We are not going to have a second referendum,\" said Birgit Maass, a political analyst at the Daily Telegraph, referring to the referendum that took place in May last year. 'We will not have another referendum,' she said, adding that it would be \"a referendum on the future of our country and our future relationship with our European partners.\" The referendum will be held on March 29, 2019, and it will take place within the next two years, according to a statement from May's office. May has said that she will seek to avoid a hard Brexit, but she has not ruled out the possibility of an EU exit. She also said she would seek a \"hard Brexit\" if the British people voted \"yes\" to Brexit. However, she did not rule out a possible referendum, saying she was prepared to accept the outcome. But she also rejected the idea that Britain should be left out of EU membership altogether. That's not to say that the vote was not an important one for the country. In fact, it was the only one that had a chance of being able to do so, despite the fact that there were so many people who wanted to vote against it. There were also a number of other options, such as a return to free trade, free movement of people and a free European market. And there was a lot of talk about the need for an orderly transition of power in Britain, as well as the right to choose between the two major political parties. Some Brexiteers, including David Cameron, have been critical of May for her handling of Brexit negotiations. Others, however, are more critical. They have called on May to step down from her post as prime minister and to take up the role of head of state of Great Britain. One of those options is to resign. Another option, though, is leaving Britain altogether, if she wants to remain in government. Both May and Cameron have said they want to keep Britain in a two-way tie-up with Brussels. If May does not, they will have to go back to Brussels, where she is expected to stay in power until the end of next year's EU referendum. Other options for May are to seek an extension of her term in office, or to be replaced by a European parliament member. Meanwhile, others have suggested that May should seek another term of office in order to work on her Brexit plans. Brexit is unlikely to happen until after the Brexit referendum in March, when Britain is due to begin negotiations with its EU partners in 2019. Many EU members are still undecided on whether or not she should leave, while others are likely to back a Brexit deal, with some saying that they would like to see Britain remain a member of either EU or the Single Market."

        "target": "French presidential debate does little to woo undecided voters This year's French presidential race is perhaps the most closely watched election in recent history. Many voters are still undecided, including those in the Paris caf\u00e9 where DW's Jake Cigainero saw the latest TV debate. Just over two weeks ahead of the first round of voting in France's presidential election, all 11 candidates met for the second televised debate of the campaign. It was the first time in the history of French elections that the entire official ballot shared a television stage. This race for the Elysee is perhaps the most closely watched election in the history of the Fifth Republic in view of conservative candidate Francois Fillon's embezzlement charges, the deterioration of the left, political amateur Emmanuel Macron's surprise surge to the top, and the rise of Marine Le Pen's National Front. With so much media attention on the five main candidates, Tuesday's debate felt almost like a consolation for the six other candidates rarely in the spotlight. For French voters watching the televised debate at Cafe des Phares on Place de la Bastille, the saturated stage kept the candidates from detailed discussion of pressing issues. For those who are still undecided, the debate did little to bring them closer to choosing their pick for president. Vincent Couronne, a researcher, said it was good to see candidates who don't get as much media attention. However, 11 candidates at once for the political spectator was overkill. \"It wasn't very interesting. It's just one position after another. There's no real debate. It's not like when it was just five candidates.\" Boredom all round Charlotte Theuvenin and her friends, all students in their early 20s, tuned out early on from boredom and exasperation. \"It was too flat and too hypocritical. Fillon and Le Pen play with our money, then say they did nothing and that they are good for our country,\" she said. As though addressing the candidates in front of her on the TV screen, she added, \"How dare you talk about being president when you use our money for your own interests.\" Le Pen had come under fire over accusations that she misused public funds to pay bodyguards as parliamentary assistants. Francois Fillon of Les Republicains, meanwhile, is under investigation for allegedly paying family members more than 1 million euros ($1.1 million) for government work they never carried out. Frequently casting a blank stare at his opponents, Fillon also seemed bored, or at least more subdued compared to the first debate. Couronne said, \"Fillon seems to be not there. Probably because he knows all the small candidates can attack him on the criminal offenses he's accused of.\" Debate watchers cited Europe as the most important issue of this election, with many fearing Le Pen's promise to tear France out of the European Union in a so-called Frexit. Though no one at the cafe vocally supported Le Pen's plan, several acknowledged the EU is a pressure point for France. \"France's place in Europe in relation to Germany is a very important issue,\" said student Thibault Cirier. \"The general problem is France has lost its influence at the European level over the years, and that needs to be remedied, because France is one of the founders of Europe and should have a strong place in the union. The EU is also important for cohesion and to have a strong position internationally.\" Caf\u00e9 viewers say no to Le Pen Cirier was initially excited by Macron when he launched his campaign, but ultimately decided there was no substance. Now he says he will probably vote for far-left candidate Jean-Luc Melenchon. Kevser Taspinar also said she liked Melenchon for his fighting spirit and that \"he throws barbs.\" As a practicing Muslim who wears a headscarf, she said the most important issue for her is laicite, France's state institution of secularism. \"For me Hamon has the best interpretation of this. Maybe Hamon,\" Taspinar said hesitating. \"I'm still undecided, because there's Melenchon.\" Another viewer, Marie Dubois, said that although she really liked Melenchon, she had definitively decided on Macron. \"Melenchon has a way of putting humanity in politics and giving hope,\" she said. \"But Macron is the only possible candidate.\" With polls putting Le Pen and Macron in the second round on May 7, the undecided voters at this Paris cafe said they were certain which candidate they would not for vote for in that scenario. \"Definitely Macron. There is no way I am going to vote for Le Pen,\" Theuvenin said. \"I will never vote for that woman or Front National, no matter who is running against them in the second round.\" Tuesday was the final debate for Macron and Melenchon, two of the crowd-pleasers among the candidates. Both have pulled out of the third debate on grounds that it cuts too close to the first vote just two days later on April 23.",
        "generated_story": "France's National Front candidate Francois Fillon has called for a \"Frexit\" in the French presidential election on May 7. French President Emmanuel Macron has said he wants to \"reboot\" the country's political system. But he has also said that he is not ready to give up on France. \"I think we need to get back to the basics,\" he told DW's Jake Cigainero in an interview on Tuesday. France's right-wing presidential candidate Jean-Luc Melenchon, who is seeking a second term in office, is also calling for an \"exit\" from the European Union. The French president, Marine Le Pen, has promised to do away with the EU, which he says is the only way France can get out of its current political mess. Macron, a member of the Socialist Party (PSP), has vowed to make France a more open and democratic country. He has pledged to work hard to ensure that France remains a free and open society. In a speech on April 23 at the Elysee Palace in Paris, Macron called on French voters to vote for him, calling on them to support him in his bid for the presidency. However, he did not specify what he would do if he were to be elected president. Instead, the president's spokesman, Thibault Cirier, said: \"We are not going to allow this to happen. We will not allow it.\" The president is expected to announce his candidacy in a few days' time, according to a statement from his office. It is unclear how long he will be able to hold on to his position, but it would be a long time before he could be allowed to run for president again. If he does not win, it will likely be because of a lack of political experience and the fact that his party is a far-right political party with a strong social base. That is, until he gets elected. And then there's the question of whether or not he can be re-elected. For now, though, there is no clear answer as to whether he should run again, as he was elected as a candidate for President of France in May. On the other hand, his campaign has been criticized by many in France for not doing enough to protect the interests of young people in their own country, and for failing to provide enough political support for his own party. This is because he's not a French politician. His party has a very strong image in French politics and he doesn't seem to have a lot of respect for other people's opinions on the issue. So far, so good. At least, that's what I've heard from many of his supporters. Many of them, however, don't think so. They think that Macron will win because they think he'll be the best candidate to win the election. Others, they say, are more likely to stay in touch with their country than they are to go to Germany, France, Germany or Germany. These are the people who are most at risk of losing their jobs. Some of these people are students of French universities who have been studying in Germany for years, while others are studying at a university in Berlin. Other people, such as students studying abroad, have also come to France to study abroad and are interested in politics. There are also those who believe that it's a good idea to take a course in economics and politics in order to improve the quality of life for young French people. Those who do not have the means to pursue a career in political life will have to look elsewhere to find a better way to achieve that goal. One of those is to become a teacher, or at least that is what they hope. Another is that they want to learn how to live a life in Europe. I think this is something that will help them become more educated and more politically literate."

        "target": "Gang battle in Mexico as US' John Kelly visits A gunbattle between drug gangs in northern Mexico has left 14 people dead. It's the latest in a series of turf wars. Smuggling has prompted a visit to Mexico City by US Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly. Prosecutors said the remote town of Las Varas in Chihuahua state was the scene of Wednesday's battle between affiliates of the Ciudad Juarez cartel and a gang from the state of Sinaloa. Police said fighting escalated when patrols arrived. Fourteen people were found dead; 12 others were hospitalized. Grenades, launchers and rifles were found. The mountainous region is used as a corridor for smuggling into the US. El Chapo effect Chihuahua security commissioner Oscar Alberto Aparicio said a Black Hawk helicopter was called in as police chased surviving gang members through the area known for marijuana and opium poppy production. Two police officers had been killed in a \"cowardly\" way in the area a week ago, he said. In a similar incident last Friday, 17 gunmen were killed during a shootout with police on a highway in Sinaloa, Mexico's northwestern state. Sinaloa was the home base of Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, whose extradition to the US in January apparently left gangsters in a struggle for control of criminal syndicates. Homicides have surged in recent months, with the number of persons killed in May put at 2,186, the highest since the collection of such statistics began 20 years ago. Nieto and Kelly to talk In Mexico City Wednesday, President Enrique Pena Nieto's office said he and visiting US Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly had discussed how to rein in organized crime groups. \"Shared responsibility\" must become the focus of transnational efforts, Kelly said. Narcotics smuggling into the US has become a multibillion-dollar (multibillion-euro) business for Mexican drug cartels. Mexico in turn wants the US to throttle demand for narcotics and the supply of illegal weapons to Mexico cartels. Pena Nieto and US President Donald Trump, who wants a border wall, are schedule to meet Friday on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany. ipj/ng (AP, AFP, dpa)",
        "generated_story": "Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto meets US Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly visits the scene of a deadly gunbattle in northern Mexico on Friday. US President Donald Trump met with Mexico's president on Wednesday in Hamburg, Germany. The two leaders met on the sidelines of the G20 summit in the German city of Hamburg. \"We have a lot of respect for the people of Mexico,\" Trump said in a statement, adding that he was \"deeply concerned\" about the situation in his country. He also said that the US would be \"very careful\" in its response to the violence, which has claimed the lives of several people, including a US soldier and a Mexican police officer. Trump also called for an end to drug trafficking in Mexico and said he would visit the country's southernmost state of Sinaloa, where drug traffickers Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman is wanted by the Mexican government for his alleged crimes. Mexico City's mayor Oscar Alberto Aparicio, who was killed in an attack on a drug cartel, was among those who attended the meeting, according to local media reports. Mexican authorities said they were still searching for a suspect, but that they did not have any information on who had been killed. They said the suspect was being held in custody and that it was not clear if he had fled to Germany or the United States. Officials said there was no indication of an imminent threat to national security, though they had not ruled out the possibility of extradition to US authorities. On Wednesday, President Trump was due to meet with Mexican President Otto Perez-Napolitano at the presidential palace in Chiudad Juarez, the capital of Chihuahua state, to discuss a possible extradition request. In the meantime, Mexican officials have been holding a press conference to explain the events of Wednesday's meeting. A senior US official told the Associated Press that \"there is no doubt that this is a very important meeting between the two countries.\" The US president also spoke at a joint news conference in Germany, saying he hoped to see \"the best of both worlds\" and \"all of our friends and allies.\" \"I am very hopeful that we will be able to make the right decision in this matter,\" he said. 'We are going to be very careful in our approach to this issue, because we are very concerned for our own security and the security of this country and our people,\" the official said, without elaborating on what he meant by that statement. Read more: \"The US and Mexico are working together to protect the interests of their people and their interests in their own countries\" The meeting is expected to take place as soon as Friday, when Trump visits Germany's capital, D\u00c3\u0080\u0099s German counterpart, Berlin, with the aim of meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and German President Sigmar Gabriel. It will also be the first time that Trump has visited Mexico since he took office in January, and it is not the last time he will do so. But it will certainly be a long time before we see him again, as he has already done so many times before. Last week, he visited the border town of Las Varas, near the southern tip of southern Mexico, in order to visit his father's hometown. His visit came just a few days after he died from a heart attack in which he received a bullet wound to his head during a shootout with a policeman. That was the second time in less than a month that a man was shot dead by a soldier. Since then, a number of people have died in clashes with police and other security forces in that area."

        "target": "Italy's navy to patrol with Libyan ships to curb human trafficking Italy wants to work more closely with Libya to limit the number of sea crossings by migrants and potential asylum seekers. But what are the consequences? Italy's prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni, does not want to wait any longer for EU countries to show solidarity in distributing asylum seekers throughout the bloc. On Thursday he announced in Rome that the Italian navy would be patrolling with Libyan ships just off the Libyan coastline. The aim, Gentiloni says, is to curb human trafficking and bring migrants back from the smugglers' boats to Libya. According to the Italian government's figures, 93,000 migrants have arrived in Italy so far this year. At least 2,000 have drowned in the attempt to cross the Mediterranean - the true figure is unknown. Italy has already threatened to stop allowing boats carrying rescued migrants to dock in Italian ports, or that it may issue migrants with documents that would allow them to travel on to other European countries. Rome has not yet implemented either policy, but the government has made clear that Italy will soon run out of options. The EU Commissioner for Migration Dimitris Avramopoulos acknowledged, again, in Brussels on Thursday that \"Europe continues to face high migratory pressures. And Italy more than (almost) any others.\" The European Commission issued a letter offering more aid and personnel to help manage migration better. Accommodation will soon be full The office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, wrote at the beginning of July that \"Close to 200,000 accommodation places are available for refugees and migrants across [Italy], but are nearly all full.\" The High Commissioner referred particularly to the numbers of people dying when he warned, \"What is happening in front of our eyes in Italy is an unfolding tragedy.\" The United Nations anticipates that another 100,000 migrants will come to Italy via Libya before the end of this year. The number of arrivals is already 20 percent higher than last year; and the number of dead, those who could not be saved, would rise accordingly. According to UN estimates, the Mediterranean remains the \"deadliest\" refugee route in the world. Italian government statistics say that around 600,000 people have arrived in Italian ports since the start of the crisis in 2014. It is unclear how many have since traveled on to Austria, France or Switzerland. Once migrants are registered in Italy and accommodated in camps, they are not held there. If, however, they leave the accommodation without giving notice, they forfeit their claim to subsistence and social services. Most of the migrants are from African countries, and many try to travel on to France, for example. 300 people are currently sleeping on the beach in Ventimiglia, on the French border, hoping to take a bus or train to France. However, the border is being policed by French officials. Migrants who are caught are sent back to Italy. Austria has announced that it too will close its border with Italy if the number of migrants starts to rise. Repatriation and distribution are difficult Last year 120,000 new asylum applications were made in Italy. Around 50 percent of these are rejected. The asylum seekers are then supposed to leave the country. However, the process of people either returning voluntarily or being deported is very slow. The interior ministry has therefore announced that it will reinforce repatriation programs. The redistribution of asylum seekers from Italy, as agreed by the European Union, is well behind target. Two years ago the aim was to resettle 120,000 people. So far, only 24,676 people have been redistributed, the EU Commission said on Thursday: 7,873 from Italy, and 16,803 from Greece. The numbers are low not just because of the reluctance of other EU countries to take the refugees in, but also because of Italian delays in the registration of possible candidates. Asylum seekers from Eritrea are the most likely to fulfill the criteria for redistribution. Around 25,000 are currently living in Italy, but only 10,000 have been registered with the EU Commission and the European Asylum Support Office as possible candidates. Migration Commissioner Avramopoulos has announced that Italy will be given more help and logistical support in this area.",
        "generated_story": "Italy's High Commissioner for Migration Paolo Gentiloni says Italy faces \"an unfolding tragedy\" in the Mediterranean region Italy's high commissioner for migration, Dimitris Avramopoulos, says the country is facing an unfolding humanitarian crisis. \"We are facing a humanitarian catastrophe,\" he said in an interview with the Italian newspaper Ventimiglia, adding that the situation in Italy is \"very serious.\" \"It is a tragedy that we have to deal with in order to protect the lives of our citizens,\" said the head of the European Asylum Support Office (EISS). \"The situation is very serious and we are dealing with it in a very grave way.\" The European Commission said on Thursday that Italy faced an \"unprecedented humanitarian disaster\" and that it was working to find a solution. The EU's migration commissioner, Filippo Grandi, told the newspaper that \"it is extremely difficult for Italy to cope with this situation.\" He also said that Greece faced a \"serious humanitarian problem\" because it had failed to provide adequate protection for its citizens in Libya and Eritrea. He added that there were \"a number of humanitarian crises in Europe\" as well as in Africa and the Middle East, including Libya, where migrants have been denied asylum and forced to return to their home countries. According to the EU Migration Commissioner, the crisis in Greece is the result of a failed attempt by the government to prevent the influx of migrants and refugees from reaching Europe. It is not the first time Italy has faced such a crisis, but it has been the most severe in recent years. In 2014, Italy was the only EU member state to receive migrants from Libya. Since then, Greece has received more than 1.5 million migrants each year, according to figures from the Commission for Refugees (CFI), which monitors the migration of refugees and asylum seekers to Europe and is responsible for the flow of asylum-seekers to Italy and other European countries, and it is also the second time in three years that an Italian prime minister has come to Rome to seek asylum. At the same time, it faces the prospect of becoming the third EU country to accept migrants who have arrived in its territory. On Thursday, Prime Minister Matteo Renzi announced that he would be stepping down from his post as EU Commissioner of Refugees in Rome. His resignation comes after a two-year period in which he was unable to secure asylum for migrants in his home country of Italy due to a lack of funds and a shortage of staff. A new EU commissioner has also been appointed to fill the role of EU migration coordinator for Europe, who is tasked with ensuring that migrants are able to reach Italy in time for next year's EU summit in Brussels. But he has yet to make a final decision on whether he will stay on, which is expected to take place within the next few weeks. As part of his mandate, he also has to decide whether Italy will continue to cooperate with other EU countries in their efforts to get migrants out of Libya or leave the region. For now, though, there is no clear answer as to whether the current situation will be resolved by a new European Union-wide migration policy. There is still a long way to go in terms of how to resolve the migrant crisis that has plagued Italy for so long and how long. However, many people are still hoping for an end to its long-term isolation. Many of those who are seeking asylum have already fled to other countries such as Germany, Austria, France, Switzerland and Italy, while others have sought asylum in other parts of Europe or the United States. They are also hoping to avoid a repeat of what has happened in Spain and Greece. That is, they say, if they are allowed to stay there for a longer period of time."

It's very easy and the best bit is, it can be reused. Maybe it will come back to you on your birthday. 1. All you need is a piece of fabric big enough to wrap your gift, a ribbon long enough to go right around it, and if you want to make a gift tag, you will also need a piece of old cardboard, a hole punch and another small piece of ribbon. Ready? 2. No, wait, we forgot the present. Get that, and you have everything you need. Spread the fabric on the ground and put your gift on top 3. Fold the fabric around the gift you are wrapping 4. With the last little bit, you don't tuck it under, but create a little flap on top 5. Fold that flap over like this 6. Take one end of the parcel and tuck the fabric inside, BEHIND the gift inside 7. You can take your time to wiggle it all inside. Make it as flat as you can 8. Once it is all inside, turn to the other end and do the same thing again 9. When you have done both ends, it should look like this. Your present is all tucked up inside and you don't need any tape to keep it closed 10. Now for the ribbon. Place the gift on top of it 11. Tie the bow 12. So it looks like this. Finished? If you want a gift tag, that comes now. If you don't you're done! 13. Cut a piece out of an old cardboard box and make a hole in it using a hole punch. Watch your fingers though ;) 14. Put a piece of short ribbon through your hole 15. Tie the tag to your gift 16. And you are finished! P.S. You can either ask your friend to reuse the fabric, and show them how to wrap with it, or if they don't like that idea, you can take it home with you to use again the next time. And remember, you don't have to buy the fabric. You can use an old pillow case, an old t-shirt or skirt, or whatever you want. You can even make your ribbon from an old t-shirt if you don't have any. Happy wrapping.",

        "target": "Hurricane Irma thrashes Caribbean as Jose strengthens in wake Hurricane Irma has continued to pack 300 kph winds as it moves across the Caribbean toward Florida. The record-breaking storm has battered the Bahamas and Cuba, while Hurricane Jose followed in its path. As one of the Atlantic Ocean's largest storms plowed through the Caribbean, leaving destruction in its wake, residents of the US state of Florida prepared for what could be the worst storm to make landfall in over a century. At least 17 people have been killed and dozens more injured across several island nations in the Caribbean. Irma is expected to be there second major hurricane to make landfall in the United States in less than two weeks. Hurricane Harvey struck Texas last week, killing more than 60 people and displacing roughly 1 million others. In the US territory of Puerto Rico, 1 million people \u2013 nearly one-third of the population \u2013 lost electricity during the storm, said Puerto Rican Governor Ricardo Rossello. \"It will be difficult to estimate how long the power outage will last,\" Rossello said. Later, officials confirmed that at least two people on the island had been killed by the storm's devastation. Two other major storms have developed in the Caribbean, namely Hurricane Jose and Hurricane Katia. Jose was east of the Lesser Antilles with maximum sustained winds of 120 miles per hour (195 kilometers per hour) as a hurricane watch was in effect for Antigua and Barbuda. Jose has followed the same path as Hurricane Irma, and was upgraded to a Category 4 on Friday by the US National Hurricane Center. Katia has remained relatively static, hovering off the coast of Mexico. Florida on edge Florida Governor Rick Scott said 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain were expected after Irma made landfall at the weekend as he urged evacuations during a press conference on Friday. Nearly 700,000 people have been asked to leave Miami and its surrounding areas. \"Today is the day to do the right thing for your family and get inland for safety... Do not ignore evacuation orders. All Floridians should be prepared to evacuate soon,\" Scott said. Read more: How to reduce risks from mega-storms? \"I know many of you are stuck in traffic, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s very frustrating. Evacuations are not convenient but they are absolutely meant to keep you safe,\" he added. On Friday, US President Donald Trump described Irma as a storm of \"absolutely historic destructive potential.\" Trump also on Friday signed a $15 billion (13.5 billion euro) hurricane relief package passed by Congress, which also raises the debt ceiling and postpones the possibility of a shutdown of government funding until December. Downgraded to an \"extremely dangerous\" Category 4 but still packing winds of 185 mph (300 kph), Irma moved between the north coast of Cuba and the Bahamas as it neared the Florida Keys and the southern Florida Peninsula. 'Major hurricane' Irma will have a \"truly devastating\" impact on the state's southern coastal areas when it slams into Florida, said US Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) chief Brock Long. Read more: Is climate change making mega-hurricanes the new normal? \"Bottom line is the majority of people along the coast have never experienced a major hurricane like this. It will be truly devastating,\" Long told CNN. \"The entire southeastern United States better wake up and pay attention. Death and destruction At least 11 people have been killed and dozens more injured after Irma tore through the French Caribbean, Barbuda, Anguilla and the British Virgin Islands. Amid widening criticism from residents in British territories that not enough was done to safeguard people from the storm, British Foreign Office Minister Alana Duncan said London has sent tents, vehicles and other relief equipment. \"Anguilla received the hurricane's full blast. The initial assessment is that the damage has been severe and in places critical,\" Duncan told the British Parliament. Thousands displaced Antigua and Barbuda Prime Minister Gaston Browne said nearly every building on Barbuda was damaged when the hurricane's core crossed almost directly over the island early Wednesday and about 60 percent of the island's roughly 1,400 people were homeless.

French, British and Dutch military authorities reportedly rushed aid to the devastated Caribbean islands later on Thursday, with warships and planes dispatching food, water and troops. French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said four people were confirmed dead and about 50 injured on the French side of St. Martin, an island split between Dutch and French control. French Interior Minister Gerard Collomb said 100,000 food rations were sent to St. Barts and St. Martin, the equivalent of four days of supplies. ls/jm (AP, AFP, Reuters, dpa)",
        "generated_story": "Hurricane Irma in the Caribbean: warnings and warnings Hurricane Irma has hit the Lesser Antilles and is expected to make landfall as a Category 4 storm on Thursday. The storm is forecast to bring up to 13.5 billion euros ($15 billion) in damage to the islands and the United States, according to federal officials. Hurricane Harvey has already made landfall in Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands, Texas and Florida, where the storm has been making landfall. \"This is the first major hurricane to hit our territory in a long time,\" said FEMA Administrator Brock Long, adding that \"it's going to be a very, very difficult storm for us to deal with.\" \"It will be an extremely dangerous storm,\" he said in an interview on CNN's \"State of the Union\" program. He added that he was \"very concerned\" about the damage caused by Hurricane Jose, which had already caused at least 10,000 people to lose their homes and businesses. President Donald Trump has called on the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to help the island's residents recover from the effects of Harvey and Irma. In a statement, FEMA said the agency would continue to monitor the situation closely, but that it would not be able to predict the exact amount of damage that would be caused. It also said it was not possible to estimate the number of people affected by Harvey or Irma, and that there was no immediate threat to life or property. But it is possible that some of those affected will have to face the consequences of their actions, including the possibility of being forced to evacuate. US Congress has passed a resolution calling for the federal government to step up its response to Harvey, as well as the use of federal funds to pay for disaster relief and recovery efforts.

        "target": "Indian government tells Supreme Court Rohingya pose'serious threat' After an appeal from two Rohingya, India's top court is considering PM Narendra Modi's plan to deport some 40,000 Rohingya in India. The government said intelligence data showed links between some Rohingya and terrorism. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government told the Supreme Court of India on Monday that the Rohingya were \"illegal\" immigrants. The hearing is taking place as Rohingya face severe violence in their native Myanmar. More than 400,000 Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh in the past few weeks to escape military and civilian reprisals that the United Nations has described as \"ethnic cleansing.\" Later on Monday, Myanmar's national security advisor said that his government was willing to welcome the refugees who had fled to Bangladesh back to their native Rakhine state, but that the details of the process still had to be worked out. \"We will make sure that everybody who left their home can return to their home but this is a process we have to discuss,\" Thaung Tun told Reuters news agency after a meeting with British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. It was unclear how this would affect the estimated 40,000 Rohingya believed to have settled in India, including 16,000 of whom are registered with the UN's refugee agency. Read more: Myanmar's Rohingya - A history of forced exoduses The Indian government told the court that it had intelligence data that showed links between some Rohingya Muslims and Pakistan-based terror groups and other international terror organizations. It argued that such links made them a \"serious threat to national security.\" The government also said there was a \"serious possibility of eruption of violence against Buddhists in India by radicalized Rohingya.\" Lawyer Colin Gonsalves, who in a separate case is representing about 7,000 Rohingya living in the northern Indian city of Jammu, countered the government's assertions. \"We just want to know: 40,000 people have been here, many of them for the last five years. Have you [the government] filed a single charge sheet, is anyone being prosecuted in the criminal court for being a terrorist? The answer is: no,\" he told DW. The court has adjourned the hearing in the matter to October 3. Lack of evidence India says it is not bound by the UN convention on refugees as it is not a signatory to the accord, but human rights activists disagree. \"The principle of non return of a person to a place where he will be executed or tortured has become a principle of customary international law which India follows,\" Gonsalves told DW. \"And it has attained the status of 'jus cogens,' which is a principle of law that no country can say is not applicable to it, such as torture and genocide.\" In a communication sent to all states in August, the Home Ministry [interior ministry] said the illegal migrants were more susceptible to terrorist recruitment efforts. But an investigation by Indian broadcaster NDTV found \"little evidence of the government claim.\" The investigation that was carried out at major Rohingya settlements in the country showed little involvement in criminal wrongdoing by the refugees. Lack of any evidence to support the government claim has led to speculations that the Rohingya were being targeted for their religion by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu-nationalist government. \"It is really unfortunate that the government is going back on its commitment to refugees which it has reiterated several times in the past merely because these Rohingyas are Muslims,\" said lawyer Prashant Bhushan, who filed the plea on behalf of two Rohingya men. \"I mean this is clearly a case of religious discrimination and an attempt to arouse a sort of feeling of... an anti-Muslim feeling or try and communalise the situation,\" he told reporters outside the courthouse. The UN's human rights chief last week deplored Indian government's move to deport Rohingya refugees. \"India cannot carry out collective expulsions, or return people to a place where they risk torture or other serious violations,\" Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein said. The Rohingya are an Indo-Aryan people, the vast majority of whom are Muslims. They usually migrate to India through a rather porous border to escape persecution in their native Rakhine state in Myanmar, where they have been denied citizenship rights. They are viewed by the local authorities as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. Myanmar's Buddhist majority is often accused of subjecting them to discrimination and violence. Read more: Rohingya people in Myanmar \u2013 What you need to know The ongoing violence follows an insurgent attack on security forces on August 25 in Rakhine state that sparked off a brutal military counteroffensive. Hundreds of people, the majority of them Rohingya, have been killed in the violence that has seen many homes destroyed and several villages burned down. Myanmar's government maintains the crackdown is part of a counter-terrorism drive, while the UN's al-Hussein has said that it \"seems a textbook example of ethnic cleansing.\"",
        "generated_story": "Bangladeshi government says Rohingyas pose'serious threat' to India The Indian government on Monday said it had \"serious concerns\" about the influx of Rohingya Muslims into the country. The country's interior ministry, however, did not respond to a request for comment on the issue. India's foreign minister, Prashant Bhushan, said the government was \"deeply concerned\" with the situation in Myanmar. \"We are deeply concerned,\" he told reporters in Jammu, the capital of the Indian state of Rakhine state, adding that it would be \"very, very difficult\" for India to take action against the group, which is believed to be the largest Muslim minority in the world. He added that India would take steps to ensure that the Rohingya do not become a threat to its security and stability. In a statement to NDTV, Indian Foreign Secretary Colin Gonsalves said: \"India has serious concerns about this issue, and we are very concerned about it.\" The statement came a day after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has been campaigning for the right to return to his home country of India, was forced to step down from his post as prime minister in an attempt to calm down tensions between the two countries. His resignation came after a three-day visit to Bangladesh, where he was due to attend the United Nations General Assembly in New Delhi on August 25. According to the statement, India had asked the UN Security Council to send a special envoy to Myanmar to assess the security situation there. It was not immediately clear what the new envoy was referring to, but it was clear that there was a strong sense of concern about Myanmar's security. Indian foreign ministry says Myanmar is the only country in India that does not have a military presence in its territory. However, it is not clear whether Myanmar will be able to provide security for Rohingya, or whether it will allow the army to continue to use its military force to protect the people of Myanmar, a country that has a long history of violence against Rohingya. A UN spokesman said that Myanmar was the most likely country to do so, saying that \"it is a very important country for us to have an active role in resolving this situation.\" India has also been accused of mistaking Rohingya for ethnic minorities, including Hindus, for Muslims, according to an Indian official, Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein. Last month, Bangladesh's Supreme Court, in a landmark case, ruled that Rohingya were not allowed to live in their own country after being forcibly removed from their homes by the Myanmar army in August. This was followed by a five-year-old boy who was shot and killed by an army officer in retaliation for being part of a group of Buddhists who were trying to kill a Rohingya family in Bangladesh. Bangladesh has denied the allegations, calling them a \"hoax\" and \"terrorists\" who have been living in Burma for more than a year. On Monday, an official from the Bangladesh Interior Ministry told the news agency AFP that Indian authorities were investigating the case and that they were looking into possible links between Myanmar and the violence that had taken place between Rohingya and Indian forces. Reuters reported that a number of people had been killed in clashes between Indian security forces and Rohingya militants in recent days, as well as in attacks on police posts and other civilian targets. There were also reports that police were searching for people who had fled to neighboring Bangladesh and were attempting to enter Myanmar through a tunnel. These reports were denied by Indian officials, though the police said they had not found any such person."

        "target": "NFL stars defy Donald Trump's call for boycott Baltimore Ravens and Jacksonsville Jaguars players \"took a knee\" during the national anthem after Trump urged fans to boycott football matches. The kneeling protest, to highlight social injustice, has stepped up a gear. Hundreds of National Football League (NFL) stars protested President Donald Trump's call for fans to boycott the league by refusing to stand for the US national anthem this weekend, starting Sunday's game between the Baltimore Ravens and Jacksonsville Jaguars. A number of other players locked arms in solidarity ahead of the game at Wembley Stadium in London. Jacksonville Jaguars' owner Shahid Khan, who last year donated one million dollars\u00a0(840,000 euros) to the Trump campaign, locked his arms with players - a rare scene, as owners almost never take to the field. US media reported that about 200 players on Sunday sat, knelt or raised their fists in defiance of Trump's comments. In one of the most memorable moments, singer Rico LaVelle took a knee and held up a fist at the last line of the Star Spangled Banner ahead of the game between the Detriot Lions and Atlanta Falcons. The protest came in response to Trump's tweets on Sunday morning urging fans to boycott NFL games to pressure the league into firing or suspending players to kneel in protest during the national anthem. In an early morning tweet, Trump posted: \"If NFL fans refuse to go to games until players stop disrespecting our Flag and Country, you will see change take place fast. Fire or suspend!\" \"NFL attendance and ratings are WAY DOWN. Boring games yes, but many stay away because they love our country. League should back US,\" he added. Later, the president said that his rant \"has nothing to do with race,\" despite the fact that the origins of the protest are to do with police brutality against minorities, especially African Americans. Trump said his comments were instead about \"respect for our country and respect for our flag.\" Trump's spat with US professional sports began at a Republican rally in Alabama on Friday, when the president attacked activist NFL players for kneeling or sitting during the national anthem, labelling them as \"sons of bitches.\" \"Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, 'Get that son of a bitch off the field right now... he is fired'?\" Trump told a crowd of cheering supporters. That day, basketball star Stephen Curry, the top player for California's Golden State Warriors, announced that he would not be attending a traditional White House reception honoring the National Basketball Association champions. The kneeling protest was started by former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick who refused to stand for the anthem back in 2016. Kaepernick's gesture came amid a spate of deadly police shootings of black men and was aimed at drawing more attention to treatment of minorities in the US. However, Kaepernick has since become a free agent, after failing to be signed by a new team for the new NFL season. NFL executives decry Trump's calls Trump also drew the ire of senior NFL executives and team owners. Responding to Trump's tweets, Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti, said he \"100 percent\" supported his players' decision to kneel during the anthem. Robert Kraft, the owner of the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots, who is also a close friend of Trump, said in a statement on Sunday that he was deeply disappointed by the president's comments in Alabama. Kraft defended players' rights to \"peacefully affect social change and raise awareness in a manner that they feel is most impactful,\" and said that sports were a unifying force in the US. \"Our political leaders could learn a lot from the lessons of teamwork and working together toward a common goal,\" he said. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, who has taken much of the heat for Kaepernick's failure to find a new team, was also quick to condemn Trump's comments.

They include the owners of the New York Jets, New England Patriots, Dallas Cowboys, Washington Redskins, Jacksonville Jaguars, Houston Texans, Los Angeles Rams and Tampa Bay Buccaneers",
        "generated_story": "Donald Trump's call for NFL players to kneel during the national anthem sparks controversy Donald Trump has called for the NFL Players Association (NFLPA) to take a stand against racial inequality in the United States. The NFLPA, the National Football League, and the Republican-controlled House of Representatives have all called on NFL owners to step down from their jobs. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said on Friday that the league's players should stand in solidarity with the victims of the recent racial violence in Charlottesville, Virginia. \"We have to stand up for our country,\" Trump said in a statement, adding that he was \"not going to allow this to happen again.\" The White House said it would not comment on the president's comments, which came after a series of tweets in which he said he did not agree with Trump. He also said that NFL teams should not be allowed to fire players who protest the anthem. In a tweet on Saturday, Trump accused NFL owner Robert Kraft of trying to \"dismantle\" the idea of a \"culture war\" between the US and its African-American communities. Trump also accused the NBA and NFL of failing to protect the rights of black athletes, who have been accused of racial bias in recent years. On Friday, he tweeted that \"the NFL should be able to do what it wants with its players,\" referring to the protests that have taken place in cities across the country, including London, New York, Dallas, Atlanta, Houston, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Washington, London and New England. His tweet came hours before the Super Bowl was to be played at Wembley Stadium in London. It was the first time a US president had made such a reference to racial discrimination in sports since the Civil War, when President George W. Bush signed an executive order banning the use of social media as a form of expression of racism and xenophobia. That order, however, was later rescinded by Trump on Sunday, saying it violated the First Amendment right to free speech and freedom of speech. But it was not immediately clear whether Trump was referring specifically to Trump or his comments on race, race and other issues, or whether he meant to use the word \"racism\" as an insult to African Americans. A number of NFL officials have said they are not aware of any such policy, but that they do not think it is appropriate for a president to make such an inflammatory statement about race or ethnicity. They also say that Trump is not a racist, nor does he have any intention of doing anything to hurt the American people's feelings about the issue. However, they say he has not done anything that could harm the interests of those who are oppressed by racism or other forms of discrimination. For example, in his tweet, President Trump referred to his criticism of President Barack Obama as \"a racist and a bigot.\" \"I think that's a terrible thing to say,\" he wrote, \"but I don't think he's an ignorant person,\" and that is exactly what I'm saying. 'I'm not racist. I think I have a very good point.\" He added that a lot of people are offended by his remarks, though, because he doesn't seem to understand what he means when he says he is talking about racism. And he didn't mean to imply that racism is a problem in any way. After all, it's just a matter of time before Trump takes office. If he does, that would be a good thing, right? The president has already made it clear that there is no such thing as racism in this country. When it comes to sports, sports and politics, there are two things that are very different. One is sports. There is the fact that sports are the most popular sport in America. Sports and entertainment are one of them. You can watch the game on TV and you can read about it on Twitter. Another is football, where the team is known as the Golden State Warriors."

        "target": "German FA calls off matches with China under-20 team after protests Germany's football association has called off several friendly matches between China's under-20 team and German lower league sides. The move follows a political protest at the first such match. In a statement released on Friday, the German football association (DFB) announced that the games would be rescheduled for 2018 and that talks would take place between them and their Chinese counterparts in order explore how to move forward. \"To the regret of all parties involved, the project has not received the broad approval that had been expected,\" the DFB said. \"In fact, the project was used by a handful of spectators to send messages that were considered hurtful by the Chinese team, officials, the Chinese Football Association's support staff and Chinese spectators.\" Protests in opening match The first of the arranged matches, against TSV Schott Mainz of the fourth-tier Regionalliga S\u00fcdwest was interrupted midway through the first half when the Chinese players left the field because a small group of activists had unfurled Tibetan flags. The team later returned to the field after the flags had been taken down, before succumbing to a 3-0 defeat. On Monday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry strongly criticized the protest. Initially, it had been thought that the Chinese side would play in the Regionalliga S\u00fcdwest - a regional division of Germany's fourth tier which has only 19 teams but the plan was revised so the matches would just be friendlies. This followed an agreement signed in 2016 between the German FA and the Chinese government to help boost the sport in the Asian country, where the Bundesliga is increasingly popular. Financial boost not enough to soothe concerns Despite the financial boost for the clubs \u2013 TSV Schott Mainz were reportedly paid a fee of \u20ac15,000 ($17.800) for last weekend's game \u2013 the move hasn't proved entirely popular with German fans, many of whom see it as just another example of commercial interests trumping sporting concerns. But the protests, and potential for further disruption, seem to be behind the cancellations - the DFB said both federations were aware of \"substantial evidence of further escalation,\" FSV Frankfurt, who were due to host the Chinese side on Saturday, said earlier this week that they would not ban protests despite an angry response to last week's incident from Beijing. \"We will not back a single centimeter off the basic rights our our democracy, including those relating to freedom of speech,\" FSV Frankfurt President Michael G\u00f6rner said in an interview with the Stuttgarter Nachrichten and Stuttgarter Zeitung newspapers. His words echoed those of DFB vice-president Ronny Zimmerman, who said that the games should be played \"within the framework of freedom of expression.\" The fixtures that have been abandoned include games against Wormatia Worms and Bundesliga club Hoffenheim's reserves. mp/pfd (dpa, SID)",
        "generated_story": "China's Under-20 team canceled due to protests Chinese football association has canceled its World Cup qualifier in Germany, the Foreign Ministry said on Saturday. The tournament, which was to be played in the region of S\u00fcdwest, was canceled by the Chinese Football Association (FSV Frankfurt), which has been organizing the tournament since 2016. According to a statement from the foreign ministry, \"the decision was taken to cancel the event because of the ongoing protests in China.\" The event was scheduled to take place at the city of Wormatia Worms, near the border with Germany's southern province of Hesse, but was rescheduled for Saturday after Chinese President Xi Jinping called for the cancellation. \"We are not going to allow this to happen again,\" the statement said, adding that it was \"unacceptable\" that the game would not be held on the same day as last year's tournament. It is not the first time that Chinese players have been forced to leave the country. In the past, they had been allowed to return to their home country of Shenzhen, where they have played since the beginning of last season. On Friday, however, a group of Chinese fans staged a protest outside the club's training ground in a bid to protest against the decision. They said they were \"not happy with the way this tournament was being organized,\" according to the news agency Stuttgarter Zeitung (dpa, SID) and that they did not want to see their team play in front of a crowd of thousands of people. However, this is the second time in as many years that a Chinese team has not been able to make the trip to Germany. Last year, China's FA Cup was held in Beijing, and in 2016, it hosted the world's top-ranked team, TSV Schott Mainz, in an event that was attended by more than 1.5 million fans. But this time around, there were fewer than 10,000 people in attendance. That's not to say that there was a lack of enthusiasm among the fans, though. There was also a lot of talk about the importance of football in this country, as well as the fact that football is a very important sport in many countries, including Germany and the United States. Many of those who attended the match were disappointed to find out that China was not invited to attend. Some of them were also disappointed that their club had not made the cut. Others, such as former coach Michael G\u00f6rner, said that he was disappointed because he had hoped that his team would have a better chance of reaching the final. He added that \"there was no chance that we would get a chance to play against a team from China. We will have to wait and see what happens.\" In addition, he added, Chinese officials have also expressed their displeasure over the ban, saying it would be a \"disgrace\" to China if the players were to miss out on an opportunity to showcase their talents in their own country's first ever international competition. China has also been accused of trying to influence the future of their football, with some accusing it of being \"soft\" and \"obsessive-minded\" in its approach to football. This has led to criticism from some of its supporters, who have accused the association of attempting to undermine its efforts to improve its image as a footballing organization. For example, some Chinese supporters have criticized the government's decision to suspend the China-hosted event, calling it an \"anti-corruption\" event. Meanwhile, other Chinese associations have expressed concern that this could be seen as an attempt to weaken the image of China as \"a corrupt state.\" \"It's a disgrace that people are so obsessed with football,\" said a spokesman for CSKA Moscow, whose president, Ronny Zimmerman, told local media on Friday."

        "target": "Experts: Taliban have not changed strategy with Kabul restaurant attack The weekend attack on a Kabul restaurant frequented by foreigners came as no surprise to international organizations on the ground. Experts don't believe the Taliban have changed their strategy to target more civilians. Dramatic scenes must have played out in the restaurant: Guests sought cover under tables as a group of terrorists shot wildly into the dining rooms. News agencies report the restaurant owner tried in vain to fend off the attackers. He was among the more than 20 people who perished, most of whom were employees at international organizations. The attackers were also among the dead. During the evening dinner rush, at 7:00 p.m. Friday (17.01.2014), one of three Taliban members detonated his explosives-laden vest and blew a breach in the highly secured restaurant. Neither the man-high blast walls, nor the secured access points with armed guards could stop the attackers. The two remaining terrorists were killed later in a firefight with security forces at the scene. No change in Taliban strategy The suicide bombing on the popular Lebanese restaurant, Taverna Du Liban, in the high-end Kabul neighborhood of Wazir Akbar Khan was the worst attack so far in 2014. Afghanistan votes for a new president in April; and the international troops are scheduled to withdraw from the country by the end of the year. Although there are plans for a small contingent to remain in Afghanistan, President Hamid Karzai first has to sign a bilateral security agreement with the United States. But he continues to play for time. In this context, the Taliban may be targeting civilians more in order to drive out not just the military coalition, but the entire international community. Yet \"as horrible as this incident is, I don't see a change in strategy,\" said Thomas Ruttig, the co-director of the Afghan Analysts Network. Similar attacks have also been launched before, \"at least 12 to 15 times in the past eight years,\" Ruttig said. The worst attack was in 2012 at Qargha Lake, a popular weekend destination near Kabul. More than 20 people were killed, all of them Afghans. Extensive security precautions The Taliban, which normally doesn't miss an opportunity for fiery rhetoric, hasn't declared a change in strategy. A spokesman for the Islamist militant group said the attack was retaliation for a NATO airstrike in Parwan Province, a few kilometers north of Kabul. According to an assistant of the Afghan president, seven children and one woman died in the coalition strike. \"You have to carefully monitor the security situation,\" Nils W\u00f6rmer, head of the Konrad Adenauer Institute in Kabul, told DW. \"But I think it's a bit early to talk about a change in [Taliban] strategy.\" W\u00f6rmer's office lies just a few hundred meters from the site of Friday's attack. He could clearly hear the explosion, which shook the window panes in his office. \"It was immediately clear to me that something had happened,\" W\u00f6rmer recounted. But the Konrad Adenauer Institute was prepared. \"We had a relatively concrete warning in the last week related to our neighborhood, and we were very cautious,\" W\u00f6rmer said. He met with colleagues in his secured office. Like most of the international organizations, the Konrad Adenauer Institute is also integrated into the security networks. \"The security precautions are high,\" W\u00f6rmer said. \"But that doesn't exclude the possibility that something similar could happen again.\" But the Afghan security forces have succeeded in preventing many attacks in the past few months, he said. Kabul residents criticize Taliban An informal, impromptu poll by DW's Kabul correspondent, Hussein Sirat, suggested the Taliban are not winning Afghan hearts and minds with such attacks. \"Wherever the Taliban have killed civilians, they have not achieved their goal,\" said Mirwais, a pedestrian in the Kabul city center. Idris, another Kabul resident, seconded Mirwais' sentiment. \"The Taliban intimidate the people so that the security agreement won't be signed,\" he said. \"But the people won't bend to this intimidation.\" How the international organizations adapt to the tense security situation in Kabul will come after many conversations, analyses, and briefings in the following days. But W\u00f6rmer is not thinking about giving up. \"We have a clear agenda and long-term projects, which I considered to be very sensible,\" W\u00f6rmer said. \"I am of the opinion, as I was before, that what I'm doing here with the Konrad Adenauer Institute is worth the risks.\"",
        "generated_story": "Afghan Analysts Network: The Taliban haven't changed their strategy in the wake of last month's deadly attack on a Lebanese restaurant in Kabul. The insurgents, who have claimed responsibility for the attack, have vowed to continue their attacks on the Afghan capital, Kabul, until the end of the month. Last month, the Taliban launched a series of attacks across the country, killing at least 10 people and wounding more than 100 others. On Friday, they launched an attack in Parwan Province, which they claimed was part of an attempt to topple President Hamid Karzai's government. \"The Taliban are not going to give up,\" said Nils W\u00f6rmer, an Afghan analyst with the Konrad Adenauer Institute in Beirut, Lebanon. Wazir Akbar Khan, a former Taliban commander, was among those killed, according to a statement from the group's head of research, Thomas Ruttig. It was not immediately clear how many people were killed or wounded, but it was clear that the attackers were not the only ones who had been killed. In the past few months, Afghan analysts have been monitoring the situation closely. They have also been examining the security situation in Qargha Lake, one of Afghanistan's most popular tourist spots, and how the government has responded to the attacks. But they have not been able to make any major changes in their approach to security since last year's attacks, when they were carried out by a group of gunmen who attacked the restaurant's owners. According to Waelig, \"the Taliban have made no change to their position on security and security,\" adding that they are still trying to find a way to protect their own people from attacks by the resurgent Taliban and the US-led international coalition. However, it is not clear whether they will change their stance on this issue, or whether it will be a matter of time before the new government takes over. For now, however, there is no sign of a change in government policy in Afghanistan. Instead, many Afghans are looking for ways to improve their lives and make their country a better place to live, rather than a place where they can live and work. This is the main reason why the current government is still in power, despite the fact that it has been unable to do so for a number of years. At the same time, some Afghans have become increasingly disillusioned with their government and are increasingly calling for an end to Taliban rule. Some of them have even begun to believe that a new Taliban government could be in place. Others, though, are more open to changing their positions. One of their most vocal critics, Wozir Aigo, is a journalist from Lebanon who has written for DW. He told DW in an interview that he was \"very disappointed\" that \"there are no plans to change the direction of our country.\" \"We are very disappointed that we are in a very difficult situation right now,\" he said. 'We have a lot of work ahead of us and we will continue to work hard to get things done in order to ensure that our people are safe and secure in our own country. We are hopeful that this will not be the last time we see this kind of situation.\" He said he would like to see the Kabul government take action against the insurgents and their supporters, as well as other security forces, to prevent them from doing so. A Taliban spokesman has also said that there are \"no plans\" to take over the city of Kabul and that Kabul will remain a \"hostile and dangerous place\" for them."

        "target": "Inching towards direct talks on Syria They came to hold talks, but started negotiations with mutual affronts. But if there is one person who might be able to mediate between the intransigent Syrian conflict parties, it's Lakhdar Brahimi. Lakhdar Brahimi, the United Nations special envoy for Syria, seemed very tired on Friday (24.01.2014). He had had a long day, which was actually supposed to be the first real day of negotiations at the Syria Conference in Geneva. \"Good afternoon,\" Brahimi told the assembled international press, before adding, \"or good evening, I don't know.\" At the Palais des Nations in Geneva, he presented the most important result of his attempts to mediate between the Syrian government and the opposition to the more than 250 journalists who had managed to get a coveted place at the press conference: \"Tomorrow we expect and we have agreed that we will meet in the same room.\" What Brahimi is declaring an achievement doesn't sound like much, but considering how irreconcilable the conflict parties have been, even that can be seen as a small success. Separate talks with Brahimi The two delegations were actually due to meet on the first day of negotiations in Geneva in order to agree on a timetable and on the subject and agenda of the talks. But emotions are running too high on both sides. Instead both delegations held separate talks with Lahkkdar Brahimi, both lasting just about an hour each In the morning. The Syrian government delegation had apparently been threatening to leave the conference. At least that is what the deputy foreign minister Faisal Mekdad had implied. \"We are here to start the negotiations,\" he told waiting journalists, \"but we found that the other party did not want to come.\" Before the conference, the opposition had explained that for its delegation, the formation of a transition government would be a central tenet of the negotiations. They emphasized that this topic should be discussed right at the beginning of talks and that the establishment of such a body should be initiated without delay. Social media and good old propaganda The representatives of the Syrian National Coalition that were present in Geneva neatly used all imaginable channels to make their views public. At #Geneva2, they tweeted: \"Forming a transitional body is our major priority,\" leaving people in no doubt that the Syrian National Council would not want to include Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Assad's government, on the other hand, is relying on classic propaganda and loyal state media representatives in Geneva. An impressive entourage of dominant journalists from state-run media outlets is constantly at hand, accompanying the government delegation and making sure they get their point across at press conferences. Lakhdar Brahimi even had a small altercation with a journalist from a Syrian state news agency, who made a political statement under the pretense of asking the UN mediator a question. \"Are there any signs that Saudi Arabia, Turkey and other countries would stop the support of terrorism in Syria?,\" she asked in somewhat shaky English, before Brahimi interrupted her. \"Please, please, there is no point in asking such questions!\" Such exchanges hint at the type of negotiating style the experienced diplomat and mediator Brahimi must have behind the scenes. 'Wish us luck' Lakhdar Brahimi described the preliminary talks that took place in Geneva as encouraging and asked for patience. He said that because the peace conference had come about at the last minute and the delegations had therefore only been appointed very recently, there hadn't been enough time to hold preliminary discussions - a task that the delegations were now catching up on. \"We never expected it to be easy and I'm sure it's not going to be,\" he said. \"But I think the two parties understand what is at stake. Their country is in very, very bad shape.\" He added: \"The huge ambition of this process is to save Syria. Nothing less than that.\" After appealing to the willingness of both parties to negotiate, he simply added: \"So wish us luck!\" Fight for freedom As the official delegations held talks with UN mediator Brahimi in the Palais des Nations, the European headquarters of the United Nations, hundreds of Syrian expatriates who had come from all over Europe protested outside, forming a sea of red, white and black Syrian flags on the Place des Nations. With their presence outside the UN gates they wanted to show that despite all the government propaganda, the Syrian National coalition has a lot of support from the Syrian people. Thirty-two-year-old Ziad Malki came to Geneva from Zurich to show his solidarity. Ziad knows how it feels to be deprived of his freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. In 2005, he was arrested at a demonstration in Damascus and says he was tortured during his time in prison. Now he is fighting for a new Syria from outside the country's borders. Ziad is sure that with Bashar al-Assad and his family, there will be nothing new. \"We don't want this man to be in",
        "generated_story": "Syria's Syrian National Coalition Mediating in Geneva Geneva, Switzerland, on Friday (24.01.2014) Syrian opposition leader Faisal Mekdad has been mediating at the Geneva International Conference on Syria ( Geneva 2) in the Swiss city of Geneva. \"We are here to mediate with the Syrian government,\" said the deputy foreign minister, who was in Switzerland for the first time since the beginning of the year. He said he was \"very pleased\" to have been able to attend the conference, which is being held by the United Nations, and that he would like to continue his efforts to reach out to the people of Syria and to help them in their struggle against the Assad regime. The Syrian rebel group, the Free Syrian Army (SNC), has called on the international community to come to Geneva to try to resolve the conflict in Syria. It has so far been unable to do so because of a lack of coordination between the government and the opposition. On Friday, a delegation from Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Turkey joined the delegation. They met with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his wife, Ziad Malki, as well as representatives from the Turkish-Syrian National Council and other opposition groups. In the end, they agreed to work together to find a solution to a long-running conflict that has plagued the country since 2005, when the civil war broke out. At the same time, it was clear that there was a need for a political solution, not a military one. There was also a sense of unease among the Syrians that it would be difficult for them to agree on a peaceful solution. This was not the case at all, however, because there were a lot of differences between Syrians and their Arab neighbors. One of them was the fact that Assad's regime had been in power for more than a decade. Another was that the regime was still in control of most of its territory, but that was because it did not have the resources to deal with its own internal problems. That was one of those reasons that made it so difficult to negotiate a peace deal. But that didn't stop the rebels from trying to get a deal done. And that's exactly what they were doing. For the second time in as long as I can remember, I have not heard of any of this. I am not sure what the other side is doing in this situation. What is happening now is that they are not going to give up their position and move on with their lives. If they do, that will be a very big problem for us. We will have to see what we can do to make sure that we don't do it again. Let's talk about that in a more positive light. So let's start with Syria, where we have a good chance of finding a way to solve the problems that are causing the situation in our own country. Syria is a country that is suffering from a humanitarian crisis. You can't just say that because you are a Syrian national leader, you're a person who is fighting for your country's future. How can you do that? What do you think? Do you have any idea how long it will take for this country to recover from this crisis? How long will it take to rebuild itself? Is it too long for it to be resolved? And what will that mean for you? I'm sure it's not that long before we get to that point in time? Let me tell you what you need to know."

His body was found in the intensive care unit of the Barcelona hospital, where he died from complications from the treatment of a cancer that had spread to his lungs. \"I am very sick,\" he told reporters at the time of his death, adding that he did not know how long he would have to live with the disease. 'I have no idea what to do with myself,' he said. A doctor told him he could not speak for a few days, but it was not possible to tell him what was wrong with his body, the statement added. It is not known if the cancer was terminal or not, and the cause of death has not yet been determined. In the meantime, he will continue to fight for the right to continue his career, said the team's medical team. They are currently undergoing chemotherapy and radiation treatments to treat the illness, which has spread through the body to the lungs and liver. There is no word yet on whether he is in any danger of dying from cancer or from chemotherapy. However, it is believed that his condition is terminal and he has been suffering for some time. According to reports in Catalan media, his health has deteriorated significantly since the beginning of last year, with some doctors saying he may need to undergo chemotherapy in order to be able to return to full health in July."

He said that his victory meant voters had chosed the path of \"European Integration.\" Exit polls gave Petro Poroshenko, a 48-year-old billionaire and owner of a chocolate factory, between 55.9 and 57.3 percent of the vote. This put him well ahead of former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, who was reported to have come in second, at 12.9 percent.

Most polling stations in the east of the country remained closed on Sunday. If the figures are confirmed, there will not be a need for a runoff on June 15. Poroshenko, who has promised closer economic and political ties with the West, has also vowed to mend relations with Russia, but insisted that Ukraine's territorial integrity was of top importance to him.

The results of Sunday's parliamentary election in Kyiv are expected to be announced on Sunday (June 15), according to exit polls published by DW. Ukraine's presidential elections are due to take place on June 15, and the first round of voting will be held on the same day as the general election. According to the exit poll published Sunday, the winner of the presidential vote will take the oath of office at the end of June. \"I am very confident that I will win the election,\" said Logan, who is based in Germany. She added that she was \"very happy\" with the results. However, she said she did not think the vote would be enough to win a majority of seats in parliament. But she also said that it would not be easy for the opposition to defeat the incumbent, which has been in power for more than two and a half years, because of a lack of popular support among the electorate. In the final round, however, it was not clear who would win more votes than the other candidates. Andrij Shevchenko (Reuters, dpa) and Yulia Tymoshenko (Dpa, Reuters, DW) were the only two candidates who had a chance of winning. Both had been campaigning for months, but they were unable to get enough votes in their respective constituencies. They had campaigned for a number of months for their party's candidate, Andrzej Hegchenko, a former deputy prime minister of Ukraine. He said he was hopeful that he would get the support of voters in his own party, as well as from the people of his home state of Donetsk, where he is currently living in exile. On Sunday evening, he said, \"We will not allow anyone to interfere in our internal affairs. We will continue to fight for our people and our country.\" The Ukrainian parliament voted to approve a new constitution and new electoral law, while the president, Viktor Yanukovych, was barred from running for re-election. It is unclear whether he will run again, or if he'll be allowed to run for another term in office. Many of those who have voted for him have expressed concern about the outcome of this year's elections. Some of them have said they are not sure what will happen next. Others say they want to see a referendum on whether the government should be able to continue with its current policies. Meanwhile, others say it is too early to make a decision on what to do. For example, they say that they would like to have the Prime Minister's office be open to all candidates, rather than just one candidate. This is not the case in Ukraine, of course. There is a long list of candidates that have not yet been announced. One candidate in particular has not been named. Another candidate has yet to enter the race, though. A candidate who has already been elected to parliament in June will face a tough challenge in a runoff in July. If he does not win, Ukraine will have to wait until the next round to decide whether to accept a second term. Other candidates have already announced their intentions to seek a third term, including former President Viktor Yanukovich and his deputy, Oleksandr Yushchenko."

        "target": "European court overturns law requiring German-language skills for spouse visas The European Court of Justice has overturned a German law requiring foreign spouses from certain non-EU countries to take a language test before receiving a visa. The ruling primarily affects Germany's Turkish minority. The European Union's highest court on Thursday ruled in favor of a Turkish citizen, who was denied a visa to live in Germany with her husband, because she was illiterate and therefore unable to demonstrate basic German-language skills. According to the court, a lack of language skills shouldn't automatically lead to the rejection of an entry visa application. Instead, Germany must consider the unique circumstances of each individual case. The court went on to say that quickly granting visas for spouses improves the quality of life and promotes the integration of foreign residents. Specifically addressing the case of the Turkish plaintiff, the court ruled that the rejection of her visa had violated a bilateral treaty between Turkey and the EU. In 1970, Brussels and Ankara agreed not to tighten their residency laws for each other's citizens. Law only applies to some In 2007, Germany introduced the requirement that spouses from certain non-EU countries must demonstrate a basic grasp of German before being granted a visa to live in Germany with their husbands or wives. Spouses affected by the law are required to obtain a basic language certificate from recognized centers, such as Germany's Goethe Institute, proving that they have an A1 level, or \"Beginning German\" language ability. The German government claims that the goal of the language requirement is to prevent forced marriages as well as marriages made simply for the sake of obtaining a visa. Citizens of European Free Trade Association (EFTA) member states are exempt from the language requirement. That includes Iceland, Lichtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. In addition, citizens of Australia, Canada, Israel, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea and the United States also don't have to demonstrate German-language skills. slk/xx (AFP, AP, dpa, KNA)",
        "generated_story": "European Court of Justice overturns Turkey's ban On Thursday, the European court of justice in Brussels overturned a Turkish ban on the use of Turkish language in the EU. The court ruled that the ban violated the rights of EU citizens and their spouses to speak Turkish, German, French, and German. It also upheld a European Union law requiring Turkish citizens to use Turkish as a second language when they travel to other EU member states. According to the court's ruling, Turkey had violated EU law by failing to provide Turkish-born citizens with the necessary language skills to travel abroad. In a ruling that is expected to be appealed by a group of European judges, a court in Luxembourg ruled on Thursday that Turkey was not legally allowed to impose the law on its citizens. \"Turkey is not a member state,\" said the judge, who ruled in favor of the German-Turkish ban. Turkey is also not eligible for the new law, which was passed in 1970, when the Turkish government was still in control of its own language and culture, according to a statement from the Goethe Institute in Berlin. Ankara has said it will appeal the decision, adding that it has no intention of changing its law. Turkish courts have also ruled against the move, saying it violates the right to free speech and equal protection under European law and should not be used as an instrument of discrimination against citizens of other countries. Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, New Zealand and the United States have all had similar laws in place since the 1970s, but they are not subject to any new ones. On Wednesday, Germany's highest court, in Strasbourg, upheld the Ankara law in a case that was heard by the lower courts in 2007 and 2008, respectively. That case, however, did not involve the issue of whether or not Turkish nationals should be able to express their Turkish or German language to their German counterparts. This is the first time that a German court has overturned an EU-Turkey law that had been in force for more than 70 years. But it is still not clear whether the case will be heard in any other European courts, or whether it could be overturned by an appeals court. There is no legal precedent for Turkey to enforce the current law which is in effect in its current form. However, it does have the power to set the legal framework for a new legal system that would allow the courts to decide whether to allow Turkish speakers to practice Turkish in their home country of origin. At the same time, there is a lack of clarity on how to interpret Turkish and other Turkish languages, as well as whether Turkey can use the language of another country, such as the Netherlands, Japan, Australia, Canada, Ireland, Israel and South Korea. And, of course, that's not the only country that has been affected by this law: Sweden and Denmark. Sweden has also been hit by similar legislation in recent years, while Denmark and Sweden have been targeted for similar measures. Norway is one of several European countries that have tried to implement a similar law since 2007. Iceland, for example, has already passed a law to make it easier for foreign visitors to enter the country without a visa. Denmark is among the countries with which the legislation was introduced. Switzerland, Iceland and Norway are also part of a bloc of 28 EU countries which have already ratified it. Australia and Canada also have laws that allow foreigners to take part in EU free trade agreements, including the creation of their own free-trade zones. Japan and Australia are the other two countries to have free access to EU markets, although the latter has not yet ratified the agreement. Canada and Japan have both signed on to it, too. Israel has signed up to join the Free Trade Association (FTA) and has agreed to become a free trading bloc. China has joined the ETA. India and China have signed the FTA with Turkey. Russia, China and Israel have not signed a treaty with Ankara. Europe's EU partners, meanwhile, have said they will continue to monitor the implementation of this agreement, though they have yet to agree on a final agreement on what to do about the matter. Austria, Switzerland and Ireland are among those countries where Turkey will have to abide by EU rules. Poland, France, Britain and Germany have agreed that they should follow the rules in order to protect their citizens' rights and freedoms. Italy, Austria and Switzerland have joined in on this issue, with Germany being the third country to sign the deal. France and Britain also signed an agreement last year, agreeing to work together to ensure that all EU members have a legal basis for cooperation in this area."

        "target": "Polish government survives second confidence vote after tape scandal Poland's center-right coalition has survived a vote of no confidence. The opposition had called for the government to resign after a tape was leaked in which the Polish foreign minister bashed US and British leaders. The opposition Law and Justice party failed in its bid to oust Prime Minister Donald Tusk on Friday through a vote confidence, the second such vote since the publication of private conversations between high-ranking officials, referred to by some in Poland as \"Waitergate.\" Tusk withstood the opposition challenge by a wide margin of 236-155. The prime minister's Civic Platform party governs Poland in a center-right coalition with the Polish People's party. Last month, recordings of a private conversation between Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski and then-Finance Minister Jacek Rostowski were published by the weekly magazine Wprost. During the conversation, Sikorski said the US-Polish alliance was \"worthless\" and British Prime Minister David Cameron's concessions to euroskeptics had shown his \"incompetence in EU affairs.\" Prior to the leak of the Sikorski recording, Wprost also published a tape in which central bank chief Marek Belka told Interior Minister Bartlomiej Sienkiewicz that he would only support the government's economic policy if Finance Minister Rostowski left his post. The secret recordings were reportedly made over several months, including at high end restaurants in Warsaw. Wprost says it received the tapes from a businessman. Immediately after the conversations were published, Tusk called his own vote of no confidence. His government survived that vote 237-203. slk/rc (AP, AFP, dpa)",
        "generated_story": "The center-right opposition to President Donald Tusk resigns after a tape scandal The opposition has called for the resignation of Polish Prime Minister Jacek Rostowski, who was accused of leaking a secret document to the media. The document, published on Friday, was leaked by the Polish People's Party (CPP) on the eve of the EU summit in Brussels. It was published by Wprost, Poland's state-run news agency, in response to criticism that the document had been leaked to a British newspaper. \"This is a very serious scandal,\" the paper said, adding that it was \"not the first time that a prime minister has been forced to resign over a leak of classified information.\" \"It's not the last time,\" said the newspaper's editor-in-chief, Marek Belka, referring to an internal investigation into the leak, which was first reported by The Wall Street Journal. Sikorski's resignation came a day after the government said it had found no evidence of any wrongdoing in the leaked document. According to Polish media reports, the documents were leaked in a bid to discredit the president-elect and his government. In response, a number of politicians have said they would step down from their posts, including the finance minister, as well as the Finance Minister, Aleksandar Bartlomiej Sienkiewicz. He said he would not resign until the investigation was completed, but he did not rule out the possibility that he could be forced out of his post. 'I don't know what I would do without the information I have,' he said in an interview with the BBC's WProst. WPA/AFP/Getty Images \"I am not going to give up my position,\" he added, \"but I will continue to fight for my country's interests and the interests of my people.\" He also said that if he were to be re-elected, it would be because he believed he had the right to do so. But he didn't think that was the case, and he was not sure what he should do with it. After all, he is not a politician, nor is he a member of a political party, so he has no power to make decisions on his own. And he doesn't have the authority to decide who should be in charge of this country. His resignation comes at a time when the ruling Civic Platform (Civic Platform) and other parties are calling for a general election in Poland next year. Polish President-Elect J\u00f3zsef Demirta\u0144ska has resigned from the post, saying he will not be able to continue in his current position. Poland is currently in talks with Britain over the future of its EU membership. Britain's Foreign Minister David Cameron has also called on Poland to join the European Union's single currency bloc, leaving the bloc's free-market bloc to take a stronger stance against the euro. However, Britain has not ruled out a move to withdraw its support for Poland, although it is unlikely that this will be a long-term solution. EU leaders have already made clear that they do not want the country to become an EU member without a single member state. Instead, they are not willing to accept the idea that Poland will become a free trading partner. They are also not ready to allow the United Kingdom to intervene in any way, even if it means giving up its veto power. On the other hand, there is no doubt that Britain would like to have a say in what happens to Poland. If the UK does not, then the US would have to step in and help Poland get back on its own path to becoming a European-free trading bloc."

        "target": "Secretary of State John Kerry due in Cairo as Gaza death toll mounts US Secretary of State John Kerry is due in Cairo to push for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas as the death toll in Gaza surpasses 500. Israel's army said several militants were killed after tunneling into Israel. Secretary of State John Kerry is due to arrive in Cairo on Monday where he is expected to urge Hamas to accept a cease-fire agreement offered by Egypt that would halt nearly two weeks of fighting with Israel. Meanwhile, the death toll in Gaza continues to rise. Medics on Monday said the number of Palestinian deaths in Gaza has risen to more than 501 since fighting intensified on Jul 8. Most of the dead are civilians. On the Israeli side, 13 soldiers were killed inside Gaza on Sunday, raising the number of soldiers killed since a ground operation began late on Thursday to 18. Two Israeli civilians also died in mortar and rocket attacks. The Israeli army said that more than 10 militants from Gaza were shot dead on Monday after infiltrating southern Israel. According to army spokespeople, two squads of militants were killed after tunneling into Israel. Israel's UN ambassador Ron Prosor, meanwhile, denied a claim by Hamas that an Israeli soldier had been kidnapped by the Islamist group, saying: \"Those rumurs are untrue.\" US President Barack Obama expressed concern about the rising death toll of civilians in a telephone call Sunday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, according to a White House statement. The US State Department confirmed late Sunday that two US citizens were killed in Gaza violence and released their names, but did not immediately disclose their occupations. US media reported, however, that the two were American members of the Israeli Defense Force, citing relatives and friends. \"We can confirm the deaths of US citizens Max Steinberg and Sean Carmeli in Gaza,\" spokesperson Jen Psaki said in a two-sentence statement. Late Sunday, the United Nations Security Council in New York held urgent talks on the conflict, and expressed \"serious concern about the growing numbers of casualties.\" \"The members of the Security Council call for an immediate cessation of hostilities,\" said Rwandan ambassador Eugene Richard Gasana, whose country currently chairs the 15-member council. hc/dr (Reuters, AFP, AP, dpa)",
        "generated_story": "US Secretary of State John Kerry is due in Cairo to push for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip. The US State Department said on Monday that it would press for an end to the fighting between Hamas and Israel in Gaza. Israel's Foreign Minister, Ron Prosor, said he would meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the sidelines of a UN Security Council meeting on Friday. \"We will press on with our efforts,\" he said, adding that he hoped the two sides would reach an agreement by the end of the week. He also said that Israel would continue to cooperate with the United Nations in its efforts to reach a deal with Hamas to end the violence. Israeli Defense Force spokesman Ron Proor said the US would \"continue to work closely with Israel to try and find a solution to this conflict.\" The Israeli defense ministry said in a statement that the Israeli military, which has been fighting Hamas for more than a year, would not be able to negotiate a truce. Prosecor also called on US President Barack Obama not to impose sanctions on Hamas, saying it was \"not acceptable\" for the group to be involved in such a conflict. A US official said Israel was not ready to give up its military authority over Gaza, and that \"it is not acceptable for any country to have a military presence there.\" Israel has said it will not impose any restrictions on Gaza's Hamas rulers, who have ruled the territory since the beginning of their two-year-old uprising in 2007. Hamas has denied any involvement in Hamas' actions, accusing Israel of trying to use its territory as a bargaining chip in an attempt to win concessions from the Palestinian Authority (Hamas) in exchange for political concessions. But the Palestinians say they are not willing to accept any such deal. They also say that Hamas will continue its attacks on Israel if Israel does not agree to a cease-fire, a claim Israel says it is committed to, but which it has not yet agreed to. On Monday, Israeli President Mahmoud Abbas said his country was prepared to allow the ceasefire to take place. However, he did not rule out the possibility that an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal could be reached in Egypt, Israel or Egypt. In an interview with The New York Times on Sunday, Kerry said they would seek an \"immediate cessation of hostilities\" between Israeli and Palestinian armed groups, as well as an extension of its ceasefire with Egypt and Jordan. According to Israeli officials, this would be the first time in three years that Israeli troops have been deployed to Gaza in response to an attack by Hamas. Netanyahu has repeatedly rejected the idea of an immediate ceasefire, calling it a \"absurd idea\" and has vowed to continue the process. Last week, Netanyahu's government announced a new round of military exercises, including a visit to Cairo, in which the army and the military would take part. This time, however, the IDF will be in charge of training and training the troops. It is expected that Netanyahu will also be present at the talks, according to US Defense Secretary Ash Carter. Obama is also expected to hold a press conference on Tuesday to discuss the future of Israel-Egypt relations. Kerry's visit is scheduled to begin at 9:30 a.m. (00:00 GMT)"

        "target": "MSF says Ebola 'fast,' medics 'facing war-like scenario' The medical charity MSF has warned that western Africa's Ebola crisis is \"moving faster\" than medics can cope with. Its warning follows a WHO admission that the epidemic requires \"extraordinary measures.\" The head of Medicins Sans Frontieres (MSF), Joanne Liu -- fresh from a visit to western Africa -- said in Geneva on Friday that more experts were needed in the hard-hit region. \"It is deteriorating faster, and moving faster, than we can respond to,\" Liu told reporters. \"Like in a war time, we have a total collapse of infrastructure,\" she added. Lui said the world community needed to get the \"upper hand\" over the next six months. While the viral spread had been slowed in Guinea, concerns focused especially on Liberia. \"If we don't stabilize Liberia, we will never stabilize the region,\" Lui said. She was critical of the WHO for delaying its public health emergency warning until August 8. \"We need people with a hands-on operational mindset,\" to combat the outbreak, Liu told the Geneva news briefing. WHO - 'vastly underestimated' On Thursday, the World Health Organization (WHO) said the scale of the epidemic had been \"vastly underestimated\" and that \"extraordinary measures\" were needed to contain the contagious virus. The UN health agency said the death toll had climbed to 1,069 in four afflicted countries, spanning Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia and more recently Nigeria. Sierra Leone's chief medical officer Brima Kargbo disclosed on Thursday that at least 32 of the nation's nurses and doctors had died from the Ebola virus while performing their duties between May 24 and August 13. Local staff suffered stigma, despite saving lives, Kargbo said. \"We still have to break the chain of transmission to separate the infected from the uninfected.\" Youth Olympics also affected The mounting alarm coincided with an announcement Friday from the International Olympics Committee that three athletes from Ebola-hit countries had been barred from competing in pool events and combat sports at the Youth Olympics opening in China on Saturday. ipj/tj (AfP, Reuters)",
        "generated_story": "World Health Organization warns of Ebola crisis Sierra Leone's Ebola epidemic is'removing faster' than it should have been, WHO chief medical officer Joanne Liu warned on Friday, saying the country's health system was \"moving further and further\" from the brink of a crisis. \"We are moving faster than we should be,\" Liu told reporters in Geneva. The WHO said on Thursday that the outbreak of the hemorrhagic fever in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) was still \"progressing\" and that it was only a matter of time before it could be resolved. She added that \"we are still moving further ahead of schedule,\" adding that there was no need to rush to the emergency room in order to prevent the spread of deadly diseases like Ebola, which can spread to other parts of Africa and the Middle East, including Nigeria and Nigeria, where the epidemic has been spreading since the beginning of this year. According to Liu, the Ebola outbreak has spread rapidly across the continent and is spreading to more than 100 countries and territories. On Thursday, a WHO spokesman said the agency was working to reduce the risk of spreading the disease to others. In addition, he said, \"the current outbreak is not progressing at the rate that we would like to see.\" The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has also warned that Ebola is \"evolving rapidly,\" saying it will take time to reach countries where it is most likely to spread, such as the African nation of Guinea, Nigeria or Nigeria. It is also not clear how long the crisis will last, but the WHO is warning that if it continues to grow, it may not be long enough to be able to stop it. There is no way to know for sure, however, because there are so many people who are suffering from this disease who have no idea what is going on in their own country. For example, there is a lack of information on how to respond to Ebola and how the virus can be transmitted to people in other countries. That is why I am calling on the World Health Organisation (WHO) to step up its efforts to help. IOC is working closely with the International Olympics Committee to make sure that this outbreak does not spread and spread as quickly as possible, and to ensure that no one is left behind. We are also calling for the international Olympic committee to take a closer look at this situation and make a decision on whether or not to send a delegation to attend the Youth Olympics in China. This is the first time that a medical charity has called for an international medical conference to discuss the situation in Africa. At the same time, international health officials are urging the UN to intervene in this crisis, as they have for years. They have said that they are not ready to do so. However, they do not want to give up the fight against Ebola because they believe that fighting against it would be a difficult task. And they don't want the world to lose hope that their efforts will be successful. So they will continue to work on this issue until the end of August 13, when they hope to have a chance to get the word out to those in need of medical care. But they should also be prepared for a long-term solution, Liu said. 'I think we will have to wait and see what happens,' she added."

        "target": "Germany won't tolerate 'Sharia police' The German government has strongly criticized nightly patrols in the city of Wuppertal by men calling themselves \"Sharia police.\" The 33-year-old behind the patrols claimed that their goal was only to raise attention. Conservative members of Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition put forward a united front at the weekend against recent developments in the city of Wuppertal. Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said civilians wearing uniforms bearing the logo \"Shariah police\" could not simply start patrolling German streets. The groups reportedly hovered around sites like discotheques and gambling houses, telling passers-by to refrain from gambling and alcohol. Wuppertal's police have begun pressing charges. \"Sharia law is not tolerated on German soil,\" de Maiziere told mass-circulation daily Bild on Saturday. \"Nobody can take it upon themselves to abuse the good name of the German police.\" Justice Minister Heiko Maas, meanwhile, told Bild that \"the state alone\" was responsible for the administration of justice in Germany. It was obvious, Maas said, that any illegal parallel system of law enforcement would not be tolerated. Christian Democrat party whip Volker Kauder was similarly emphatic in an interview to be published in this week's Welt am Sonntag newspaper. \"Under absolutely no circumstances can we tolerate self-styled 'Sharia police officers' patrolling our streets and dictating what people should or should not do,\" Kauder said. Ringleader: goal was attention The 33-year-old behind the Wuppertal patrols, former fireman Sven Lau, published a video on his website on Saturday. Lau said that a \"Sharia police\" never existed, and that a group of men had simply worn the mock uniforms for a few hours. \"We knew that this would raise attention,\" Lau said, claiming that his goal was to spark a debate about Sharia law in Germany. Lau is a leading member of Germany's Salafist movement, advocates of a strict Sunni interpretation of political Islam. He works with a mosque in his native M\u00f6nchengladbach, not far west of Wuppertal, and used to head the fundamentalist group \"Invitation to Paradise.\" (Einladung zum Paradies, in German.) The central council of Muslims in Germany (ZMD) condemned the activities. \"These few teen yobs do not speak in our name,\" chairman Ayman A. Mazyek told the Tagesspiegel am Sonntag newspaper. \"These people are perverting the name of our religion. With this shrill and foolish action, they are really hurting Muslims.\" Sharia law is the Arabic term for a legal system based on the Koran. Saudi Arabia and Iran are examples of countries where such a system officially applies. Wearing a veil is obligatory for women and corporal punishment such as stoning is legally tolerated. Human Rights Watch reported last month that Saudi Arabia had beheaded 19 people in just 16 days in August, for convictions on charges ranging from cannabis smuggling to \"sorcery.\" msh/rc (AFP, dpa, Reuters)",
        "generated_story": "Germany's Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere has warned of a crackdown on Muslims in Germany. \"We will not tolerate any form of discrimination,\" he told a news conference in M\u00f6nchengladbach on Saturday. He added that the police would not be allowed to arrest anyone who was not a member of the Islamic State (IS) group, which has claimed responsibility for the attack. The IS is a group that claims to be a terrorist organization. It has been operating in the German state of Bavaria for more than a year and a half, but it has not been able to establish itself as an Islamic state, according to German news agency Welt am Sonntag (AFP, dpa, Reuters) and the Christian Democrat (CDU) party whip, Volker Kauder, said he was \"very concerned\" about the attacks, adding that \"we are not going to allow this to happen again.\" \"I am very concerned that this will be the first time that we have seen this kind of attack on a Muslim community,\" said Mazyek, who heads the group's youth wing, the \"Invitation to Paradise\" (IDP). \"It is not acceptable for us to tolerate this type of behavior.\" Mazeek said the IS was responsible for a number of attacks on German Muslims, including one on the head of one of Germany's most prominent mosques, and that it was an act of hate against Muslims that led to the deaths of hundreds of people. In addition, he said, \"This is an attack against the fundamental right to freedom of religion and human rights.\" He also said that he would be willing to take legal action against IS if it came to that, as well as other extremist groups, such as the Salafist Islamic Movement (SIF), which is based in southern Germany, in order to prevent the spread of extremism in Europe. But he did not rule out the possibility that IS could be involved in any way. According to a statement from the Bavarian state's interior ministry, it is \"not the case that there is any basis for such violence.\" The statement came after the Interior Ministry's spokesman, Sven Lau, told German newspaper Bild that Islamic extremists had been planning to attack the mosque in Wuppertal, near the city's southern border with Iran, for some time. Muslim groups have been accused of using the Koran as a weapon in their attacks. They have denied the allegations, saying that they have no basis in reality. However, they say they will continue to do so, because they believe the Quran is the basis of their religion. On Saturday, a police spokesman said they would continue their investigation into the incident, with the aim of finding out if the perpetrators were responsible. A spokesman for SIF said: \"If they are responsible, we will take action immediately. We will do everything in our power to stop them from doing so.\" In an interview with German daily Bild, Mauer said \"there is no justification for this attack,\" referring to an alleged attack by IS."

        "target": "Russia to create corporate aid fund, tapping pensions Moscow is planning to set up an emergency fund to help companies hit by sanctions imposed on Russian firms over the country's role in the Ukraine crisis. The money is to come from the Russian pensions system. Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov unveiled a plan Monday aimed at creating a \"multi-billion-dollar\" funding vehicle for companies hit by Western sanctions. Moscow-based news agency RIA quoted Siluanov as saying that the emergency fund would be set up next year with money originally earmarked for the State Pension Fund and leftover funds from this year's budget. According to RIA, Moscow was planning to devote \"at least 100 billion roubles\" (2 billion euros) to the fund, which will mainly be aimed at helping cash-starved Russian banks and key oil companies. \"These 100 billion roubles will be added to the reserve next year, which will allow us to help companies,\" RIA quoted Siluanov as saying. \"We are planning to create a reserve of significant size.\" Just last week, the European Union and the United States imposed a third round of sanctions on Moscow for Russia's involvement in the Ukraine conflict. The latest sanctions target the Russian banking sector as well as key energy firms and arms manufacturers. As one of several companies that have asked for government help, Russia's oil giant Rosneft said it would need 1.5 trillion roubles ($39.70 billion) in aid to keep exploring for oil. Siluanov also told RIA news agency that the decision to stop transferring money to the Pension Fund would hand the budget an extra 309 billion roubles. It will be the second year running that Moscow has stopped transfers of funds from the budget to the Pension Fund, which provides benefits for Russia's pensioners, some invalids and families who have lost their breadwinners. uhe/nz (Reuters, RIA)",
        "generated_story": "Russia to create multi-billion-dollar pension fund for companies hit by Ukraine sanctions Russia has announced plans to set up a multi billion-euro fund to help companies affected by sanctions over the Ukraine conflict. The fund will be created by the European Union's State Pension Fund (SPF) and the United States, according to Russian news agency RIA. Spokesman Anton Siluanov said on Monday that the fund would be established in response to the crisis in Ukraine. \"We are going to invest in the state pension funds of the country,\" he said, referring to Russia's state-owned oil giant Rosneft, which has been hit with sanctions since the conflict broke out in eastern Ukraine in 2014. It was not immediately clear how much Russia would receive from the new fund, but it is expected to be around 1.5 billion roubles ($39.70 billion) a year, the Russian Finance Ministry said in a statement, adding that it had received a total of 2.7 billion euros ($3.6 billion). The state fund is part of a joint venture between the two companies, with the aim of creating a fund that will cover the costs of restructuring the company's assets. Siluov, who is also the head of state pensions fund SPA, said he was \"very happy\" to receive the funds. However, he added that he would not be able to give details on the plan until after the financial crisis had been resolved. He did not give a specific time frame for the announcement, however, and said it would take time to finalize the details. According to a Russian newspaper, \"RIA\" (Reuters) \"This is the first time that we have seen this kind of commitment from a country that is facing a crisis of its own. We are very happy to see that this is not the case for all companies.\" The plan was announced last week by Russian President Vladimir Putin, a former KGB officer who served as a deputy head in Moscow's post-Soviet Soviet era. In the past two years, Russian companies have been forced to close some of their Russian subsidiaries in order to make up for lost profits. On Monday, it was reported that Russia was set to start a new round of sanctions on its oil giants, including Russia, Ukraine and Ukraine, as well as the US, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Japan, China, Russia and other Western countries. This was the second time in three years that Moscow had agreed to do so. Last month, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order imposing sanctions against Russia over Ukraine's annexation of Crimea and its alleged involvement in an arms trade deal with Moscow. Moscow has denied the accusations, saying the move was an attempt to weaken the West's influence in Russia. US-Russian relations have also been strained by tensions between Moscow and Washington. U.S. President Barack Obama has called on Moscow to step up its efforts to improve relations with Washington, Washington and Moscow, while the EU has also called for a \"reset\" of relations. Russia is currently in talks with Ukraine over its nuclear programme. Ukraine is one of several countries in which Moscow is seeking to reduce its dependence on Washington's nuclear arsenal. Washington has said the sanctions are aimed at Russia for its military intervention in Crimea, although it has not yet decided whether it will take any action against the Ukrainian government. Russian officials have said they will continue to monitor the situation closely, though they have not ruled out the possibility of an escalation of tensions with Kiev. They also said Moscow was ready to take action if it needed to, if necessary, take steps to protect its interests."

US General Philip Breedlove said Russian forces were still operating inside Ukraine. Speaking to reporters after a meeting with NATO military chiefs in Lithuania's capital Vilnius on Saturday, US General Philip Breedlove expressed \"sincere hope\" about a renewed peace plan, agreed to earlier in the day in the Belarusian capital Minsk, by separatists and representatives from Ukraine's and Russia's governments. The new pact, including an artillery buffer zone, was a move to strengthen a peace plan signed earlier this month, also in Minsk. However, Breedlove said violence levels in Ukraine in recent days were as high as prior to the earlier ceasefire. \"The ceasefire is still there in name, but what is happening on the ground is quite a different story,\" Breedlove said, adding that Russian forces were still operating in Ukraine, although he could not pinpoint how many. \"The fluidity of movement of Russian forces and Russian-backed forces back and forth across that border makes it almost impossible to understand the numbers,\" he said. A convoy from Russia consisting of about 170 trucks arrived in Ukraine on Saturday, with a reported cargo of humanitarian aid. Previous aid convoys sent from Russia were met with outrage in Kyiv, as it was suspected they may have been used to provide support to the pro-Moscow separatists in eastern Ukraine. Russia has repeatedly denied such accusations. The separatists have said they want to break from Kyiv and have already declared \"people's republics'\" in Donetsk and Luhansk. This week Ukraine's parliament passed a bill which paves the way for more autonomy for those areas. While neither Russia nor Ukraine are members of NATO, both share borders with NATO countries. se/ksb (AP, AFP)",

But he said it was not agreed on by any of the parties to the cease-fire, adding that there was \"no agreement on the terms of any ceasefire.\" Read More: The US is calling for an end to a bloody conflict in Ukraine The latest round of ceasefire talks between Kiev and Moscow began Saturday, with the two sides agreeing on a deal to end the fighting. Moscow, however, did not immediately respond to requests for comment, saying it had not yet reached a decision on what to do. Ukraine has called for a truce, while Moscow has refused to say what it would do if it were to break up the conflict. Russia has also called on Ukraine to cease its military operations, according to US military officials, who have said they will continue to monitor the situation closely. NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said in a statement that Moscow would continue its efforts to ensure that all sides are allowed to continue their ceasefire efforts. However, he added, \"We are not going to give up until we have reached the end of this ceasefire. We will not be giving up on our efforts.\" The Ukrainian government has vowed to keep fighting until it reaches the point of no return where it will be able to return to normalcy. In the meantime, the Russian military is continuing to push Ukraine out of its territorial waters. Russian President Vladimir Putin said he would not allow the Ukrainian army to withdraw from the country's eastern regions of Luhansk and Donetsk, where they have been fighting for the past two years. According to NATO's General Staff, a number of Ukrainian soldiers have already been killed in clashes between pro-Russian separatists and Ukrainian troops. A US-led military operation to retake the eastern Ukrainian city of Mariupol is scheduled to begin on Sunday. It is expected to last until at least Monday, when NATO will hold talks with Moscow on how to prevent a repeat of last year's failed coup attempt and whether Moscow will intervene militarily. There is also the possibility of a partial withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine. That would be the first step toward a full-scale military withdrawal from its eastern borders. If that happens, it could be a long time before Russia would withdraw its forces from eastern areas of Ukraine and join the fight against the separatists. This is the second time in less than a year that NATO has imposed a temporary ceasefire, after a month-long ceasefire broke out in Belarus in 2014. At the same time, NATO is still trying to find a way to make sure that Ukraine does not become a \"safe haven\" for its own people. Last month, Russia's military launched a counteroffensive against separatist rebels in Donetsk in retaliation for Moscow's attempted annexation of territory from Ukrainian territory. Since then, Russian forces have continued to fire on Ukrainian forces, killing dozens of civilians and injuring scores of people, leaving thousands of others injured."

        "target": "Opinion: Obama's Cuban revolution President Barack Obama has made a very special declaration of love to Cuba. It's as revolutionary as the Cuban revolution, and as peaceful as the biblical Sermon on the Mount, says DW's Astrid Prange. US President Barack Obama has lost his old communist \"enemy,\" and Cuban President Raul Castro has lost his hatred of capitalism. In the first phone call from president to president since 1961 the two heads of state came to a surprisingly swift agreement. They want to renew diplomatic relations, which have been on ice for more than 50 years, and exchange ambassadors. It's only a matter of time before the US lifts its trade embargo against Cuba. All the word \"embargo\" is really good for - at this stage - is as an ideological soapbox for political hardliners, especially Republicans in Congress who believe lifting sanctions would constitute defeat for the US. Yet the lifting of the embargo has already begun. In addition to medication, it has been possible since 2000 to export agricultural produce such as maize, cereal crops, and poultry to Cuba. Flirting with the rogue state Furthermore, 100,000 US citizens have travelled to Cuba since 2011 for cultural and scientific exchanges. Travel restrictions on Cubans living in exile in the US who wanted to visit their relatives on the island were also lifted. According to press reports, the two countries' military forces are even said to be cooperating, as are their coastguards, and military on the border of the US marine base in Guantanamo. Now Obama wants to officially open a \"new chapter\" in relations with the communist Caribbean island and remove Cuba from the US list of so-called \"rogue states\" that support terrorism. The travel ban on American tourists visiting the island will also largely be lifted. That's as far as things will go for the time being, as Obama would require a majority in Congress in Washington to lift the embargo entirely. But even if these are only small steps, the fall of the American-Cuban wall has begun. The easing of the sanctions and the resumption of diplomatic relations are setting the scene for an end to the embargo. Embargo as scapegoat The tearing down of this \"wall in the mind\" is long overdue. The blockade is obsolete, and has proved to be entirely ineffective. More than this, its advocates have achieved the opposite of what they actually wanted. The blockade has provided the leaders in Havana with an easy excuse for their economic failure. Raul Castro realized long ago that Cuba's economic problems can no longer be justified simply by citing the US embargo. It looks as though he was counting on the blockade being lifted: There is no other explanation for the completion of the Mariel container port in January this year. Cuba's biggest infrastructure project was, incidentally, financed by Brazil. The Brazilians also sent a declaration of love to Cuba. Raul Castro opened the door to them. He loves anyone who helps him - his friends even more than his enemies.",
        "generated_story": "The Fall of the Wall in Cuba The fall of a wall in the Cuban capital of Havana has left the country's government in a state of disarray. The US President Barack Obama has vowed to rebuild the wall that once stood between the US and Cuba. \"The Wall is falling,\" Obama said at a news conference in Havana on Tuesday, adding that he would do everything in his power to restore it to its former glory. But he also promised to make it easier for the Cubans to return to their ancestral homeland, which they had been deprived of for generations. He also pledged to build a \"great wall\" in order to protect the people of their homeland. And he did just that. In a speech in Brazil, President Raul Castro said that his country would not be able to do that without the help of Congress and the United States. Obama also vowed that the \"wall\" would be dismantled by the end of 2011, when he was sworn in as US president. Astrid Prange, a Brazilian journalist and author of \"Sermon on the Mount,\" told DW that \"the Wall will fall.\" \"It will be a great wall,\" he said, referring to the building that was built in 1961 at the time of Fidel Castro's death. That wall is still in place, but it will not fall. It will remain there until after the new year, as well as after Obama leaves office in January, and after he leaves the White House. This is the first time in US history that an American president has been elected to a position of power. President Obama, who was elected in 2000, is expected to take the oath of office on January 1, 2011. His predecessor, then-US President George W. Bush, was also sworn-in as president in 2001. Since then, however, he has made no official announcement on whether or not he will seek re-election in 2012. However, his successor, former Vice President Joe Biden, has said he is committed to building a strong wall around the island of Mariel, Cuba, to prevent any further attacks on its people. Last month, Obama announced his intention to close the Guantanamo Bay detention facility, the largest US military facility in Latin America, after a series of failed attempts by Cuba to expand its military presence there."

        "target": "Nigeria sentences 54 soldiers to death for mutiny A Nigerian court martial has sentenced 54 soldiers to death for mutiny and cowardice as they refused to fight against Boko Haram Islamists. The case has highlighted the army's problems with equipment and morale. The men sentenced to death on Wednesday were part of the special forces division ordered in August to retake three towns in Borno state, which had been taken over by the Islamist Boko Haram insurgents. Their lawyer, Femi Falana, said the 54 men were sentenced to death by firing squad and five had been acquitted. They were accused of conspiring to commit mutiny against the authorities of the 7th Division of the Nigerian army, which is on the frontline. The trial began on October 15 and was conducted behind closed doors. It is subject to approval by top military officials, but there has so far been no indication that senior officers oppose the court martial. They were not available for comment afterwards. There was a similar case in Nigeria in September, when 12 soldiers were sentenced to death for mutiny after firing on their commanding officer in the northeast city of Maiduguri. The 7th Division, based in Maiduguri, leads the offensive but there are numerous reports of troops refusing to deploy. Soldiers have regularly complained that they lack weapons, food, and other basic supplies to fight the Islamists, who are reported to have tanks, rocket-propelled-grenade launchers, and other heavy weaponry. Boko Haram has taken a number of towns and declared an Islamic caliphate in the region near the border with Cameroon. The Nigerian military has in recent weeks claimed to have made progress in recapturing lost territory. Thousands of people have been killed since the Islamist uprising began five years ago. An estimated 1.3 million have been displaced, with tens of thousands seeking refuge in neighboring Cameroon, Chad, and Niger. rg/bk (AFP, AP, dpa)",
        "generated_story": "A court martial against Boko Haram Islamists in Nigeria has been declared in the northeastern Nigerian state of Borno. The military said on Wednesday that it had launched a military operation against the Islamist group, which has claimed responsibility for the attacks. It said it was conducting an operation to neutralize the group's fighters, who are believed to be based in Cameroon, Chad, Cameroon and Chad. \"We are fighting the terrorists,\" said the military spokesman, Femi Falana, adding that the operation was being carried out by the 7th Division, a division of the Nigerian army. He did not elaborate on the reasons behind the attack, saying only that they were fighting for their own interests. But he did say that \"we will continue to fight for our interests,\" he added, referring to the army's efforts to contain the insurgency. On October 15, police said they had arrested two suspected militants from the sect's headquarters in Maiduguri. They were later charged with carrying out an attack on a police station in a bid to quell the violence, according to local media reports. Police have also said that one of their officers was killed in clashes between the two groups, and that he was also injured in an encounter with the soldiers. A court-martial is scheduled for Wednesday, the day after the first round of military operations was to take place. There were no immediate reports of any arrests, but a number of people have been arrested and are being held in detention. Some of those arrested have pleaded not guilty to charges of murder and attempted murder, while others are accused of being involved in other crimes, such as kidnapping, rape and torture. Many of them are suspected of having links to Islamist groups. At least one man was arrested on Tuesday and is currently being tried in court for his alleged involvement in attacks on soldiers and civilians. Another man has also been charged in connection with an alleged kidnapping of a Nigerian soldier. According to a court document, one person was found guilty of kidnapping a soldier and was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Other suspects were also charged over the abduction of an army officer and the attempted rape of two other soldiers, as well as the murder of another soldier who was shot and killed by a Cameroonian police officer. Most of these cases are still pending, however, because the government has yet to decide on whether to prosecute the suspects. In one case, two men were charged for kidnapping and other charges related to an attempt to seize the soldier's body. Both men have denied the charges. Meanwhile, several other suspects are also facing charges, including a charge of attempting to rape a woman and a man who had been shot dead by an unknown assailant. Authorities have not yet charged anyone with any crime. However, they have vowed to bring charges against those who were arrested in August and September, when they are due to appear before the court on October 16."

Schumi lies in third place some 34 points off the top spot and has a lot to do if he is to record his 85th career win. Ferrari's poor season to date is unlikely to get better with hopes dwindling that the 36-year-old will add to his sole victory of the season although the seven-time world champion characteristically refuses to rule it out. Schumi and Ferrari still in the fight \"Contrary to many other people's opinions, we have in no means written ourselves off, even though we have to admit that the situation has worsened recently, rather than improved,\" said the German, referring to the problems with this season's car. \"But that doesn't mean that it can't be improved again, and that's exactly what we're working on.\" The limelight is falling on two young pretenders to Schumacher's throne as Sunday's race approaches. The battle between McLaren's flying Finn Kimi Raikkonen and championship leader Renault's speedy Spaniard Fernando Alonso is diverting eyes from the world record holding German on his own turf. Kimi aims to keep heat on leader Alonso Raikkonen must finish the German Grand Prix for the first time in five attempts to close the gap on Alonso if he is to keep his own championship hopes alive. The Finn retired from last year's race because of a rear wing failure and this season has been plagued by technical problems which most recently cost him 10 places on the starting grid in each of the last two rounds. Despite those penalties for engine failure, the 25-year-old managed to finish second and third but he will have to increase his total of three race wins if he is to make a significant impression on the 26-point chasm that separates him from Alonso. \"The battle for the championship is still on and I am determined to get a good result and work on closing the gap,\" said the Finn. \"The (car) has good speed and we need to make the most of it this weekend.\" Montoya doing McLaren team mate no favors Raikkonen's car is obviously a fast one this season but he's not the only driver in a McLaren hot seat. Colombia's Juan Pablo Montoya is not to going to make way for his team mate while his own hopes of the title, however small, remain alive. \"I am really looking forward to racing again this weekend in Germany,\" said Montoya, who won at Hockenheim for Williams two years ago and got his first victory for McLaren in Britain two weeks ago. \"I enjoy racing at Hockenheim, I have performed well here and won in the past and I am aiming for a strong result like at Silverstone.\" Consistent Ferdy the man to beat at Hockenheim Championship leader Alonso, meanwhile, has been impressively consistent for Renault so far this season, winning five times and failing to score points only at the Canadian Grand Prix, where he crashed, and in Indianapolis. The Spaniard is setting the pace and the standard this season so, problems aside, Alonso will again be the man to beat at Hockenheim.",
        "generated_story": "Ferrari's Fernando Alonso and McLaren's Kimi Raikkonen battle for the German Grand Prix Formula One title in Hockenheim, Germany, on Sunday. The two-time world champion will face off in the final round of the season's premier series, which begins Sunday in Germany. Alonso, who has won the last three races in a row, will take on Ferrari's Michael Schumacher, the world's most successful driver, in Sunday's final race. \"We're going to have to see who can do the most,\" Alonso told reporters after the race, adding that he was \"very happy with the way we've done it so far.\" \"I'm very happy to be in this position,\" he said, referring to the two drivers who have dominated the series since the end of last year's season. But the Spaniard, meanwhile, has a lot to prove: he's a great driver and a very good driver. He's the only one who's never won a race in his career that has been won by his teammate, Juan Pablo Montoya, but he is also the best driver on the grid, and he has already won three of his last four races, including two at Silverstone and one at the Indianapolis 500. 'I want to win this one,' he added, \"because I know I can win it.' \" \" He also said he'd like to take the title with his team, McLaren, Ferrari, Mercedes and Mercedes, as well as Ferrari. His team-mate, Carlos Sainz, is the reigning World Champion, while his rival, Sergio Perez, was the defending champion. Both drivers have won their last two races and are now in fourth place in their respective constructors' standings. They have also won five of their past six races. In addition, they have been world champions in both drivers' and driver's categories, with Alonso having won two of them. However, Alonso has yet to make a single podium appearance in three years, finishing fourth in each of those categories in 2015 and 2016, when he finished third in 2014 and second in 2016. That's not to say they're not capable of winning a world title, though, because they are not the first drivers to do so. And they don't even have a driver to beat in qualifying, so they've had to settle for second place. After a disappointing season in 2017, Hamilton and Alonso will be looking to add to their collection of victories in 2018 and next year. Hamilton has also been in pole position for three consecutive seasons, although he won his first two starts in 2013 and 2014. On Sunday, however, he'll be competing for a second time in four years in Indianapolis, where he will also be defending his world championship title. McLaren will have the chance to defend its World Championship title against Ferrari in two weeks' time. It's been a long time since McLaren has had a top-four finish in any of its previous three seasons. Last year, it was second-placed Ferrari and third-place McLaren. This year it's Mercedes that took third place behind McLaren and Williams. Ferrari is currently second behind Mercedes in terms of points, ahead of Mercedes. Mercedes is third, behind Ferrari at second, followed by Mercedes at third and fourth. Williams is fourth, second and fifth, after Mercedes-powered McLaren in third. Meanwhile, Renault is fifth in points with a 1.5-second lead in second. Renault's Sebastian Vettel and Ferrari are fifth and sixth, respectively, at sixth and seventh respectively. Teammate Nico Rosberg is eighth, a year after finishing second at Indianapolis."

        "target": "German Publishers Warm to Google Library Google is heading for a legal battle with American publishers over its plan to digitize books from five major libraries. But German publishers seem warm to the idea. Five major US publishers filed suit in San Francisco on Wednesday to block Google from scanning books without the permission of copyright holders. The project, already underway but stopped by Google in August, is the Silicon Valley company's bid to make the world's books searchable online. Five major libraries are already participating in the project and Google sent executive Jennifer Grant to the Frankfurt Book Fair on Wednesday to present the idea to European and German book publishers. This week Google introduced print.google.de, the German version of the search engine Google posted online this time last year. Google lets users type in a search term then scans its digitized library for the word or expression and produces a list of books where the term is mentioned. Users can then click on the results and a few pages of the text appear allowing users to read up online. The idea is to supplement Internet users with another source of material. In contrast to their American colleagues, German publishing houses have reacted well to the database. Some German publishers on board Google said that is discussing terms with all major German publishers. Langenscheidt, which publishes a large selection of dictionaries, said they had got on board. \"We are starting with 160 books,\" Hubert Haarmann, head of the electronic publishing division and the publisher, told the Financial Times Deutschland. \"We see it as an additional distribution possibility.\" An increased and more direct reach to the consumer is just one way Google is promoting its new project to skeptical publishers. The company also says that publishers will be able to monitor interest in titles through the search engine, and use the information in deciding whether to reprint certain books. Google has also promised publishers a cut of the advertising that will appear on the site. Not all German publishers are on board. In fact, the German association representing publishers has announced it will begin its own project where publishers can scan their own books, rather than let someone else do it. The project is not a competitor to Google, but will allow publishers to create their own database, rather than turn it over to the search engine. If Google can, anyone can But American publishers don't want to even take that step. They fear a slippery slope if Google is allowed to digitize copyrighted material. \"If Google can make \u2026 copies, then anyone can,\" Patricia Schroeder, president of the Association of American Publishers, said in a phone interview with Reuters. \"Anybody could go into a library and start making digital copies of anything.\" At issue is the right of authors and their publishers to their own work versus the \"fair use\" of their work by the public. Google argues that their search engine will only offer users a \"card catalog\" function, with a few pages of text. No one will be able to read the entire book online.",
        "generated_story": "German-language search engine Google has launched a new German language search tool for books. It's called Langenscheidt, after a German book fair in Frankfurt, Germany, in August last year. The company has announced plans to launch an online search service for German-speaking books in the coming months. According to the Frankfurt Book Fair's website, the company is working on a project to develop a Google-owned book library in Germany. \"We are looking at a number of German books for the German market,\" said Jennifer Grant, head of research at the Association of American Publishers (AAP), which organizes the event. Google, which is based in San Francisco, is one of Germany's largest publishers, said it would launch the search-engine on Wednesday. But it is not the first time that Google will be launching an app for English-speakers. In August, it launched the Google Search Engine (GSI) to search for titles from German, French, Italian, Spanish, German and Italian. On Wednesday, Google announced that it was launching the service, with the aim of making it easier for people to find books on the Internet and on Google's Google Play store. At the same time, GSI said Google was also launching its own Google Book Library, a book-sharing service that aims to help people find and purchase books they want to read in German. This is the second year in a row that the site has been launched, and it's the third year since the last edition was launched in 2009. A German version of the app is available for download from Google Books, but it has not yet been available in other languages, according to a report by the Financial Times Deutschland (FTD). The Google Library is part of a consortium of publishers and publishers that works with German publishers to promote their products and services. They are also working with publishers from Germany and the United States to create a digital library of books and short stories for children and young adults, as well as other publishers in Europe and Asia. For now, they are focusing on German as a medium of reference for young people, who are interested in reading and studying German in order to understand the language and culture of their home country. Read more: Google seeks to make German a more accessible language for kids and adults Google is looking for new languages to use in its search engines, including English and German translations, to improve the quality of reading for younger people. That's a good thing, because German is a language that can be used in many different languages and languages. However, there is still a long way to go in terms of translation and translation, so Google needs to be able to translate German into English for its German readers to get a better understanding of what German means and what it means to them. And Google wants to do that, too. If Google can't do it, then it will have to take a step back and make it a bit easier to adapt German to its new language. Meanwhile, Amazon is also looking to expand its Google library to include more German titles. Amazon has also launched an ad campaign to encourage German authors to enter the US market, offering a free copy of its Kindle app to those who have already bought a copy. As for Google itself, its website is currently up for pre-order. There are currently more than 100,000 books available on Amazon.com and other sites, while Google also has a website dedicated to German translation. Search engines have also become increasingly popular in recent years, such as Amazon's Kindle and Apple's Apple Bookstore. These are the ones that are available to book buyers in America and Europe. You can find them at Amazon and Google.org."

        "target": "The Sun Sets Slowly Over Brandenburg's Tropical Dream Having suffered many disappointments concerning publically funded projects, the state of Brandenburg hoped a tropical leisure center would offer a ray of hope. Instead the ailing concern is just bringing more gloom. The economically depressed eastern German state of Brandenburg has seen its fair share of bitter experiences when it comes to huge public investment projects since German unification in 1990. Against this background, state authorities were pleased when Malaysian businessman Colin Au built a huge tropical-feeling leisure center in Brandenburg without any subsidies. The center, which opened about a year ago, was to become a symbol of economic success in a region where unemployment still hovers around the 20 percent mark. But the leisure time park, which has already swallowed a little under 100 million euros ($120 million) in private investment, is now going to have to depend on public funding to avoid another economic fiasco in Brandenburg. State authorities in Brandenburg haven't been too successful in their public investment policy in the past 10 years, to put it mildly. A grand plan to build one of the world's most modern chip-producing factories there burst like a bubble in 2003. The much-talked about Brandenburg-Berlin International airport still seems light years away from being built. Line of failures looked to be ended by Au's vision Another beacon of economic hope disappeared in 2002 when a company planning to build gas-filled transport airships went bust despite considerable subsidies. But Au's vision for the abandoned dome which the airship company needed as a hangar offered Brandenburg another chance. In the middle of nowhere, he created what he named his \"Tropical Islands\" wonderland, sporting everything from sandy beaches, lakes and a Laguna to a Caribbean-style village. The economics ministry in Brandenburg was over the moon to see Au originally agreeing to build the facility without any state subsidies. And Au himself had no doubt at the time that he could well do without them. Overestimated visitor numbers tell sorry story But the center's first year in operation tells a different story. Colin Au, who has meanwhile left Brandenburg and transferred matters to a German management company, had expected some 1.5 million visitors to come to Tropical Islands within the first year, but only some 950,000 will have turned up by the end of 2005. It seems highly unlikely that visitor numbers will increase considerably in future, placing a question mark on the viability of the whole centre. But Brandenburg's economics ministry is certain that the park will be in the black as of 2008. To make the place more attractive, it has agreed to shell out 15 million euros in subsidies for yet another reconstruction and marketing effort. After all, the leisure time center has a workforce of about 500 and is thus the biggest employer in an otherwise depressed region marked by a high jobless rate. Tropical center down but not out...not yet \"We hope the money will help make the Tropical Islands resort better known throughout Europe according to the new marketing concept hammered out the management,\" ministry spokesman Steffen Kammrath said. \"This leisure time center is unique and has to be marketed as such. What you have there is a tropical and water world 12 months a year with a lot of attractive offers to spend a whale of a time there.\" Some commentators believe that state subsidies may prolong the center's life span, but will not be able to avoid its demise in the long run. But the idea of also making it more attractive for tourists from all over Europe seems unrealistic to them if the resort's management can't even get enough visitors from home to ensure a profitable operation.",
        "generated_story": "The Sun Sets Slowly Over Brandenburg's Tropical Islands Resort The sun sets slowly over the tropical island of Laguna in the southern Pacific Ocean. It's the first day of the new year, and the sun is setting. The temperature is expected to reach 100 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) by the end of this week, according to a spokesman for the brandenburg-Berlin International Airport (Brandenburg) airport, which opened in 2003. In the early hours of Monday, the temperature was forecast to rise to 105 degrees C (102 degrees F) in a few hours. That's a lot of heat, but it's not enough to make you want to stay up all night. There's also the prospect of rain, as well as the possibility of thunderstorms. \"The sun has set,\" said Steffen Kammrath, who heads the airport's management team, referring to the storm that hit the island in 2002. He added that the forecast was \"very good\" and that it would be \"a very good year for tourism in Germany,\" adding that he hoped the weather would cooperate with the company's efforts to develop the resort. However, he added, \"I don't think we're going to be able to do that because we have so much to lose.\" The storm has been bringing down the temperatures in southern Germany, where temperatures have been dropping below freezing for several days. On the other hand, it has also brought down temperatures, with temperatures dipping below zero in some parts of Germany. This is not the case in other European countries, either. For example, in Spain, temperatures are currently hovering around zero, while in Portugal, they are at the low-90s. And in Malaysia, there is a strong possibility that temperatures will rise as temperatures drop below the freezing point. But that doesn't mean that there won't be rain. So, let's hope that this is just the beginning of a long-term trend. If it is, then it will be a very long time before we see the light of day again. What do you think will happen when the wind picks up again? What does it say about the future of aviation in Europe? Is there a chance that we will see a change in our climate? Do we really need to change the way we think about aviation? If so, what will we do about it? We'll have to wait and see what happens. We're not talking about climate change, of course. Let's just say that if it does happen, we'll do something about that. I'm not sure what we can do with it, because I think that's something that can only happen to people who have lived here for many years. You can't just sit around and watch the world go by and not think of it as a place where you can have a good time. Do you have any idea what's going on in your life right now? How long will it take for you to get out of bed and go to bed? I can tell you the answer is about a year and a half before you get up and get ready for bed. Just a couple of years ago, I had a dream where I was in bed with Colin Au, a Malaysian businessman, when he was a guest of mine at a luxury hotel in Malaya. Now I've had the chance to sleep in his bed for a week and I have the opportunity to talk to him again and he's been very happy to see me again, so I'll let you know how I feel about this, too.\" He said he hopes that his dream will come true. 'I'm really looking forward to it,' he said."

        "target": "Max Meyer to leave Schalke on a free in summer? Leon Goretzka is already on his way to Bayern Munich and now another Schalke star might be leaving for nothing in the off-season. Clubs officials say talks are ongoing in the hope Max Meyer will extend his contract. Schalke might struggle to retain 22-year-old midfielder Max Meyer when his contract runs out at the end of the season, at least according to recent media interviews from the club's sporting director, Christian Heidel. Speaking to German news agency dpa, Heidel confirmed that Meyer turned down an offer of a contract extension earlier in February. \"Max Meyer's agent received an extension offer on January 12 with a deadline of February 15, and informed us on February 15 via email that Max would not be accepting the offer because of the deadline imposed,\" Heidel told dpa. \"We have acknowledged this. For now, we no longer feel beholden to the terms of that offer, but that doesn't mean an extension is impossible either.\" Meyer was reportedly offered an annual salary in the region of \u20ac5.5 million ($6.7 million); it was the second contract he refused, following a less lucrative offer at the end of last season. Read more: Leon Goretzka to join Bayern Munich in the summer 'We're still ready to talk' Under new coach Domenico Tedesco, Meyer has reclaimed a regular spot in the Schalke XI, moving to a new and more defensive role in midfield. Schalke offered improved terms in light of this development on the pitch. Heidel said this week that the club was still trying to convince the German to stay. \"At the moment we're still ready to talk,\" Heidel told this week's edition of football magazine Kicker, albeit stressing that time was of the essence. \"But we must and we will plan for the new season.\" In a separate newspaper interview Heidel was even more explicit, saying the club was not in a position to wait until summer for Meyer to make up his mind. Speaking to Sport Bild magazine, meanwhile, Heidel sought to focus on Meyer's more important role at Schalke, his regular game time, arguing it might be in the youngster's best interests to stay at a club that needs him every week. \"[Coach] Domenico Tedesco has formed the team around him in such a way that there is now an ideal spot for Max. That was not always the case,\" Heidel said. \"He needs to ask himself, putting the financial aspect to one side: 'Will I get such a position at a different club?' Because one thing's clear: Max wants to play, and he needs to play.\" Schalke are already preparing for the departure of one of German football's brightest young stars, midfield all-rounder Leon Goretzka will join Bayern Munich on a free transfer at the season's end.

        "generated_story": "Schalke XI coach Christian Heidel: \"We're still ready to talk\" about the future of star midfielder Max Meyer, who has been linked with a move to Bayern Munich for the past few years. He said he was \"still ready\" to discuss his future with the club's sporting director Domenico Tedesco said on February 15 that he would not rule out the possibility of signing a new contract extension. \"I think we still have a long way to go,\" he said, adding that the German coach would be willing to make a decision on the player's future in the coming weeks and months. In the meantime, he added, \"we'll continue to work hard to get the best out of Leon Goretzka and the rest of the team.\" \"It's a matter of time before we have to decide what we want to do with him,\" said the coach, whose contract expires at the end of next season. The German side have been struggling for a few months and have struggled to find the right balance of play in recent seasons. They are currently without a number of key players in their squad, but they are expected to return to the starting XI in February, according to Sport Bild, a German news agency, which is owned by Bayern. It is not clear how long Meyer will be able to stay in charge, however, as he has not ruled out a possible extension of his contract. Schale XI's coach has also said that they will look to strengthen their midfield and play more attacking football in order to improve their chances of reaching the Champions League quarter-finals. However, they have not yet decided on who will replace him, and it is unclear whether he will stay on as the head coach of a team that has struggled for form for some time. At the same time, the Bundesliga side are struggling to form a squad that can compete for places in Europe's top two leagues. That is, if they can find a player who can contribute to their side's success. If they do, it will not be because they don't have enough players to play for them. There is also the question of who is going to take over the role of manager. For example, there is the issue of how much money will the new coach spend on his players. This is a big question for him. How much will he spend in his new role as a coach? What is his current salary? The club have already announced that it has agreed to pay him \u20ac6.7 million for his services, including a transfer fee of around \u20ac5.5 million to help them reach the Europa League final. But it's unclear what will happen if he does not make the move. After all, this is only the first step in a three-year contract that is due to expire in March, when he is set to leave for Germany's national team, Bayern will have the option to extend the contract for another year or two. And that could be a very long time to come, considering the current situation in Germany, where the transfer market is still in its infancy. What will it take to convince him to keep his job? \"If he doesn't make it, then we'll see what happens next,\" says the director of sporting relations, Christian Weidel, in an interview with German magazine Sport Bild. 'We will see how he responds to that. We are ready for that.\" The transfer deadline has come and gone, said Heisel, referring to a January 12 deadline for signing of new players for Bayern's squad for next year's Bundesliga season, to be announced on March 15."

He allegedly possessed and exchanged \"a large quantity\" of child pornography. A high-ranking Vatican diplomat will face trial in the Holy See on charges of possessing child pornography in the US and Canada. Catholic priest Carlo Alberto Capella was indicted on Saturday after a Vatican investigation found he had allegedly possessed and exchanged \"a large quantity\" of child pornography during his diplomatic posting. His trial will start on June 22 in front of a Vatican magistrate. If convicted, he could be sentenced to between one and five years in prison and fined between \u20ac2,500 and \u20ac50,000 ($2,100 to $42,000). He is being held in the city's police barracks. Read more: Australian archbishop becomes most senior cleric convicted of hiding abuse Diplomatic immunity The monsignor was recalled from the Washington embassy after US authorities alerted the Vatican to his alleged crimes and requested his diplomatic immunity be stripped. The church rejected the request and withdrew him in September to face investigation at home. Shortly afterwards, Canadian authorities issued an arrest warrant for allegedly possessing and distributing child pornography while visiting a church in Canada. The Capella case has hampered the Catholic Church's attempts to move on from its myriad of pedophile priest scandals. There has been particular focus in recent months on the Chilean branch of the Catholic Church ignoring and covering up of child abuse by pedophile priest Fernando Karadima during the 1980s and 1990s. Pope Francis wrote a letter to Chileans last week expressing \"shame\" for the affair despite previously defending one of the main alleged offenders behind the cover-up. The Vatican's third-highest ranking official, Cardinal George Pell, is facing trial in Australia on abuse-related charges. aw/kms (AFP, Reuters, dpa)",
        "generated_story": "Cardinal Carlo Alberto Capella to face Vatican probe for distributing child pornography Pope Francis has ordered a Vatican investigation into a Chilean priest accused of distributing sex toys to minors. The Vatican said on Saturday that the priest, who was convicted in 1990 of child sex trafficking, was being investigated by the Vatican's anti-pornography task force. \"The Vatican is looking into this case,\" the pope said in a statement, adding that it was \"a very serious case\" and that \"the Vatican will take appropriate steps to ensure that no child is sexually exploited in the United States,\" according to Vatican spokesman Francis. He also said the church would cooperate with the investigation, which is expected to take place in Rome on June 22, the same day as the trial in Washington, D.C. A Chilean cardinal has been charged with sexual abuse of minors by a child, and is due to appear before a grand jury later this month. Prosecutors, however, have said they have not yet decided whether to file charges against the cardinal. They also say they will seek to have him extradited to the US, where he faces charges of having sex with minors under the age of 13. Capell was arrested in September 1990 and charged in connection with a case in which he allegedly sexually abused minors in his home country of Chile. In 1990, he was sentenced to 10 years in prison for sexually abusing minors, a sentence that was later reduced to life imprisonment. His conviction came after he pleaded guilty to charges related to child sexual exploitation and child molestation, charges that were later dropped. Francis said he believed the charges were politically motivated, but he did not rule out the possibility of charges being brought against him. On June 21, Francis announced that he would be stepping down from his post as Vatican archbishop in order to focus on his work as a priest in Chile and Australia. But he also vowed to continue his efforts to protect minors from the abuse and exploitation of their parents and their children, as well as to make sure they were protected from abuse by their own family and friends. According to Francis' statement on Friday, \"Pope Francis will continue to do his utmost to safeguard the interests of all minors and the vulnerable.\" The pope also announced his intention to appoint a special prosecutor to look into the case, calling for the prosecution of the accused pedophile, Fernando Karadima, to be brought to a stand-off with prosecutors. It was the first time that a cardinal had been convicted of sex crimes in more than 30 years. Last year, Pope Benedict XVI ordered the papacy to investigate the allegations against Cardinal George Pell, accusing him of sexually exploiting minors for sexual purposes. This week, Vatican prosecutors announced they would seek the death penalty against Pell and his wife, Maria Teresa, in an extraordinary move that could have led to an international outcry. Pell has pleaded not guilty and will be tried in absentia for his role as cardinal, while the Chilean government has said it will appeal the conviction. If convicted, Pell could face up to five years behind bars. For his part, prosecutors will have to decide whether or not to seek a life sentence, or whether he should be allowed to stay on the bench for life. As for prosecutors, they must decide if they want to bring charges and whether they are willing to prosecute the man who allegedly abused children under his care. There is also a possibility that they could seek an appeal from a judge who has ruled against them. However, it is not clear whether the Pope will rule in favor of a plea deal, since the current pope has yet to rule on that. Instead, there is a chance for Francis to intervene and make a decision on whether Pell should remain in office. That is, if he decides to step down as pontiff."

        "target": "German Interior Ministry Claims Progress on Crime Interior Minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble released his department's official statistics concerning crime in 2006 in Berlin on Tuesday. And the news was good -- most of the numbers were down compared to the preceding year. Germany's streets were never particularly dangerous, but according to the Interior Ministry, they are now safer than at any time since statistics have been collected. Reported criminal offenses on the whole dropped by 1.4 percent over 2005 -- to a total of just over 6.3 million. \"The statistics show reductions in crime among children, adolescents and teenagers, as well as adults,\" said Sch\u00e4uble. He added that criminality among foreigners living in Germany also fell, saying that this development reflected Germany's efforts to integrate non-Germans. Drugs offenses were down 7.8 percent, followed by theft and street crime, which both declined by four percent or more. Youth violence Vandalism, on the other hand, was up 5.9 percent. Fraud rose slightly, as did violent crime -- among young people by an alarming 4.5 percent. Berlin Interior Minister Erhart K\u00f6rting said that was part of a decade-long trend in Germany. \"As many experts have pointed out,\" K\u00f6rting said, \"the potential for violence in society is increasing.\" The head of the German Police Officers' Union Konrad Freiberg also said those figures showed that German society was not truly getting safer. Frankfurt tops most-dangerous list Crime was down in Frankfurt am Main, but it's still the German city with the greatest number of criminal offenses per 100,000 people. Hanover was a close second, followed by D\u00fcsseldorf, Bremen and Berlin. The total percentage of criminal cases solved by German police also improved slightly from 55 to 55.4 percent. According to the study, Germany's safest place was Bergisch Gladbach, a city of 100,000 inhabitants in the west of the country -- coincidentally, model Heidi Klum's home town.",
        "generated_story": "The State of Crime in Germany The state of crime in the German police force has become a national symbol. The police union, the police officers' union and the Interior Ministry have all been accused of committing crimes, including murder and attempted murder. Police union leader Erhart K\u00f6rting said on Tuesday that police forces had been involved in a number of cases of drug-related crimes in recent years. \"We have been doing everything we can to protect our citizens,\" he said, adding that he was not aware of any such cases. He added that \"we are working hard to make sure that we don't have to do anything to stop the flow of drugs into our communities.\" The government, which has been in power since 2006, has also been trying to crack down on the drug trade. Last year, police chief Konrad Freiberg, who was in charge of police operations in Hanover, was arrested and charged with drug trafficking. On Tuesday, Sch\u00e4uble said he would appeal to the public to come forward with any information they might have about the case. But he did not give any specific reason for his arrest, saying that it was a \"political decision\" and not an \"economic one.\" \"I think it's a political decision,\" said the interior ministry's chief of staff, Erick K\u00f6ting, in an interview with German news agency D\u00fcsseldorf. It is not the first time that a police officer has committed a crime. In 2005, a policeman was shot and killed in Bremen, Germany's second-largest city, by a gang of suspected drug traffickers. Since then, he has had to step down from his post as the head of the state's police department. His arrest came in 2006 and he is still in prison, according to German media reports. Prosecutors have accused him of carrying out a series of acts of terrorism in 2005 and 2006. They have also charged him with several counts of murder in connection with the murder of a German policeman, and are seeking to extradite him to Germany to face charges for the murders of two men in his home town of Hamburg, where he worked for more than a decade as an undercover policeman. A German court has ruled that the man who shot the policeman is a member of an international criminal organization, but he cannot be extradited because of his association with a group of men who were convicted of crimes committed by the same gang. According to a statement from the Berlin prosecutors' office, prosecutors are also seeking the extradition of three other men, one of whom is also a convicted drug trafficker. Investigators have said they are looking into possible links between the two murders and other crimes. Germany has long been a victim of state-sponsored crime, with many of these crimes taking place in different parts of Germany. However, there is no evidence that any of those crimes were committed in any other country. For example, German prosecutors have not been able to prove that there were any links to organized crime at the time of their arrest. This is the second time in five years that German law enforcement agencies have tried to prosecute the perpetrators of criminal acts. At the end of last year's court case, Berlin police arrested three men for drug possession, two of them for possession of weapons and a third for possessing a knife. That case was brought to trial by prosecutors in 2007, when the court found that they had attempted to use a weapon of mass destruction against a man they suspected of being a drug user. After the trial, they were sentenced to life imprisonment for a total of 10 years and fined $10,000."

        "target": "Bremen Election Results Could Have National Repercussions It might be Germany's smallest state with a population of less than 700,000, but the make-up of Bremen's new government could curb the ability of Angela Merkel's coalition to continue with planned reforms. The Social Democrats (SPD) and Christian Democrats (CDU) have ruled the small northern city-state of Bremen in a coalition for the past 12 years. But after winning state elections on Sunday with 36.8 percent, the SPD is now flirting with the idea of ditching their previous coalition partners to rule together with the Greens, who made their best-ever showing in a German state poll with 16.4 percent. Bremen's state SPD leadership is to hold talks later on Wednesday with the CDU, which polled 25.7 percent. After an SPD meeting in Bremen, Mayor Jens B\u00f6hrnsen made the first signal he could be favoring the Greens. He said that during the campaign he had deliberately abstained from mentioning the possibility of a renewed CDU coalition because \"after 12 years it shouldn't automatically be continued.\" Bremen's acting head of government and CDU member Thomas R\u00f6wekamp, however, warned against an SPD-Green coalition. \"The majority of people don't want a red-green experiment, but a continuation of the grand coalition,\" he said. Both the SPD and CDU conceded heavy losses in the election, which showed a swing towards the Greens and the Left Party, which scored an unexpected 8.4 percent to win representation in a western German state legislature for the first time in its brief history. Block reforms? If Bremen's SPD decide in favor of the Greens, this would affect the ability of Chancellor Angela Merkel's grand coalition of CDU and SPD to push ahead with reforms requiring constitutional changes, such as stage two of Germany's urgently needed federalism reform. The federal Bundesrat, which is made up of state cabinet members, has to approve the majority of legislative bills passed by the lower chamber, the Bundestag, before they become law. Also, any proposed constitutional changes require two-thirds of all votes in order to be passed by the Bundesrat. The CDU and SPD currently hold 47 of the Bundesrat's 69 seats, which is one seat more than the necessary two-thirds majority. But without Bremen, the number held by the grand coalition would fall to 44 seats, meaning they would need the cooperation of one of the small opposition parties for any constitutional changes. Internal strife Earlier in the week, Chancellor Merkel called for unity within her ruling left-right coalition after the losses in Bremen set the stage for more infighting between the two parties. Merkel also warned the SPD against moving to the left after it lost some five percent points. The chancellor said the outcome showed the SPD had made a mistake by attacking the coalition and campaigning on promises of a minimum wage, which she believes will hamper efforts to fight unemployment of just under 10 percent. \"The result showed that this strategy did not pay off,\" Merkel told a press conference.",
        "generated_story": "German Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition of the Left Party and the Social Democrats could block German reforms Bremen Mayor Thomas R\u00f6wekamp warned on Wednesday that his party would not be able to form a coalition government with the center-left Social Democrat (SPD) and Greens (CDU) in the German Bundestag. The Left party, which has been in coalition talks with Merkel since Sunday, is expected to try to block the government's plans to overhaul the country's economic and social policies. Chancellor Merkel has said she will not allow the SPD to take over the economy, but she has warned that it would be \"a very difficult task\" for her party to win a majority in parliament. \"We are not going to allow this to happen,\" she said, adding that she would \"not allow it at all.\" The SPD, the Christian Democrats and other Left parties have all said they would oppose the plan, while the Greens have vowed to oppose it. They have called for a \"grand coalition\" to be formed in order to protect the right to vote, and they have promised to do so by the end of this week. But they are unlikely to agree on the details of their plans, according to party leader Jens B\u00f6hrnsen, who is also the party's candidate for mayor. He told reporters on Tuesday that they were \"very much in favor of a grand coalition,\" but added that he was not ready to give up on his plans for the future of Germany's social and economic system. 'I think we will have to see what we can do,' he said. Merkel and her CDU have been at loggerheads for months over a number of issues, including how to make Germany a better place to live in. On Monday, Merkel announced that her government would seek to introduce a new tax code for all German citizens, a move that would make it easier for them to get a job and pay their way to a higher salary. She also said that if the new law were to pass, Germany would become a more prosperous country, with more people living in poverty and less suffering from hunger and poverty, she could be forced to step down from her post as Chancellor. Bregen's mayor, Thomas r\u00f6weikamp, said he would take up his position as a member of parliament in a special election next year. In addition, he added, \"I would like to think that we would have the opportunity to work together in this way.\" Merkel, however, has not ruled out the possibility of forming a minority government, saying she is \"open to the idea of working with other parties,\" and that the two parties would work on a common agenda. However, it is not clear how that will be achieved, as the left-wing SPD and right-leaning Greens are already in talks to join the ruling coalition. If they do not, they could have a difficult time getting a deal done, because the current government is likely to push through a series of austerity measures that are unpopular with voters. That is, if they don't get the support of voters, there will likely be a lot of people who will vote against them. There will also be an increase in anti-immigration measures, such as tax hikes and spending cuts. This is the first time that a chancellor has ruled in Germany since the 1990s, when she was Chancellor of Bavaria. And it's not just because of Merkel. It's also because she's a politician, too. Her party has a strong image in her own mind: she can be seen as an independent, independent and independent politician."

It is a one-crust pie, eaten in most German wine regions during the fall wine season. Zwiebelkuchen is traditionally eaten with Federweisser, a young wine available in Germany in the fall. The link between the two is so strong that many Federweisser wines have a recipe for the onion cake on their labels. Here's a recipe for it: Ingredients: 1 packet yeast, active dry 1 teaspoon sugar 1 1/2 teaspoon salt 3 cups unbleached flour 1 tablespoon shortening 1 cup water (49 to 54 C / 120 to 130 F) 6 slices bacon -- diced 2 medium onions -- sliced 1/4 teaspoon cumin 1/2 teaspoon salt Pepper 1 egg yolk 1 cup sour cream Mix the yeast with the sugar, a teaspoon of salt and half a cup of flour. Blend in the shortening and warm water, then beat for two minutes. Add enough flour to make a soft dough, and then knead the dough until smooth and elastic, about five minutes. Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, then cover it and let it rise in a warm place for 30 minutes. Pat the dough into a lightly greased 12-inch pizza pan or onto a lightly greased baking sheet. Press up the edges to make a slight rim. Fry the bacon until crisp and drain it on absorbent paper. Add onions to the bacon grease, and cook slowly until tender, but not brown. Sprinkle the onions, bacon, cumin, half a teaspoon of salt and pepper over the dough. Bake the cake at 204 C (400 F) for 20 minutes. Blend the egg yolk and sour cream and pour the mixture over the Zwiebelkuchen. Bake it for another 10 to 15 minutes, until the cake is golden brown and the sour cream has set. Serve warm or at room temperature with white wine.",

It's the season of the onion cake, and it's a great way to celebrate the end of a season that has become synonymous with autumn wine. \" Onion cake\" is one of Germany's most popular fall wines, but it also has a special appeal for wine lovers who are looking for a seasonal treat to savour. The frosting is made with a variety of vegetables, herbs, spices and herbs. You can find it at Federweisser in Zwiebelkuchen, near the German border, where the harvest season begins on October 1. This year's crop is expected to be the best in the country, according to experts who have studied the wine in Germany for several years. In the autumn, onion cakes are the most sought-after seasonal dessert. They're also the first dessert to come out of this season's autumn season, which is known for its rich flavors and rich aromas. But they're not the only ones to enjoy. There are also a number of wines that are available for purchase at the market, such as wine shops, restaurants and vineyards. Some of these wines are even available in German supermarkets, while others are sold in other European countries. For example, there are many wines from Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Italy, Spain and the United States. One of them is called \"the best of all worlds,\" which means you can enjoy it with friends and family. Another is the Bavarian wine, called the \"German wine of autumn.\" The wine is especially popular in Bavaria, a wine country with an abundance of grape varieties and a wide range of wine types, including wine from Italy and Germany. And it is not just Germany that is celebrating the fall season this year, as well as Germany and Austria. Here's how to make it, too."

The move shows Madrid's support of US efforts to close the controversial prison. Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said the first inmate from the US prison at Guantanamo Bay had arrived in his country. Madrid has agreed to host five prisoners, the largest commitment yet from a European country. Citing privacy concerns, Rubalcaba refused to give the prisoner's name or any identifying information, except to say he was a Palestinian. The new arrival will be able to work and move around Spain as he wishes, but will not be able to leave the country. \"He is a Palestinian, he has already arrived in our country. We do not want to give out further details because we want everyone who comes to live in our country to be able to live their lives normally,\" he told a news conference. Spain urges others to 'do the utmost' Spain's decision to take five Guantanamo detainees is part of an effort to help US President Barack Obama with his plans to shut down the jail. The prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, was set up at a US navy base by former President George W. Bush in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos has urged other European countries \"to do their utmost\" to take in former Guantanamo detainees as well. Third countries are being asked to take in detainees who are cleared of any charges, but who can't be sent back to their homelands for fear of persecution. Obama had said he would close the prison by January 22, 2010, yet the deadline passed unmet. Some 200 detainees remain there, but finding places to take in the prisoners - even the dozens already cleared for release - has proved controversial. jen/AFP/AP Editor: Andreas Illmer",
        "generated_story": "The first of five prisoners released from Guantanamo Bay have arrived in Spain, the Interior Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos said on Wednesday. The prisoners were released on January 22, 2010, after a three-week stay at the US military prison in Cuba. They are being held at a military facility in the southern Spanish city of Madrid, according to a Spanish Interior Ministry statement. \"We are pleased to announce that the prisoners have been released,\" the statement said, adding that they would be allowed to return to Spain in a few days. 'They will be reunited with their families and friends' The release of the first prisoners comes after more than a year of detention at Guantanamo, which has been run by US President George W. Bush since September 11, 2001, when he was still in office. At the same time, former US Secretary of State John Kerry announced that he would not be returning to Guantanamo until after the end of his term as US president. In a statement, Obama said: \"I am very pleased that we are able to reunite with our friends and family in Guantanamo.\" The detainees were transferred to the military detention facility, where they were held for three years before being sent back to their countries of origin. Spain's Foreign Ministry said the detainees had been transferred \"in accordance with the terms of their release from detention,\" referring to Bush's order to end the use of torture and other forms of punishment for crimes against humanity. It also said that a number of other prisoners, including prisoners of war, had also been sent to US detention facilities in other countries, such as Germany, France, Italy, Spain and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) for treatment. According to an official statement from the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, \"The detainees are currently being treated in an isolation cell in Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, as part of an international prisoner exchange program.\" \"They are in isolation cells,\" it said. US officials have said they are not aware of any new prisoners being released, but that there is a possibility that some of them could be released at any time. This is not the case in any other country, however, and it is unlikely that any of these prisoners will have to leave the country for a long time,\" a spokesman for President Barack Obama told reporters in Madrid. He added that it was \"very difficult\" for the government to decide whether to release them, given the current situation, because of a lack of information on the situation in their own country. However, they have not ruled out the possibility of re-integration into the wider world. On the other hand, there are concerns about the future of terrorism in Europe, particularly in countries like the Middle East and North Africa. There are also concerns over the treatment of Palestinians, who are considered to be particularly vulnerable to terrorism, in particular in places like Guantanamo. For example, some have accused Spain of being a \"hostile state,\" while others have suggested that Spain should be more lenient in dealing with terrorism. Other countries have also expressed concern that Guantanamo could become a place of refuge for Palestinian prisoners. But Spain has not been a victim of terrorist attacks in recent years, despite the fact that many of its citizens have sought refuge there for years. Last year, a group of young men were arrested at Madrid's international airport in connection with a terrorist attack on Sept. 11 in 2001. One of those men, Jose Luis Rubalcaba, was sentenced to 10 years in prison for his role in that attack. Another was convicted of attempted murder in 2002 for attempting to kill a US soldier. His sentence was later overturned by an appeals court in 2009."

        "target": "Threat of the Punjabi Taliban is growing Deutsche Welle talks to Pakistani political expert Hasan Askari Rizvi about the growing ties between militants in northwest Pakistan and Punjab province. At least four gunmen disguised in police uniforms raided a hospital in Pakistan's eastern city of Lahore on Monday night, claiming at least five lives. Local officials said the gunmen were trying to free a militant, who was being treated there after being captured during attacks on two mosques last Friday. The police said the gunfight at Jinnah Hospital had lasted around 45 minutes but the gunmen had managed to flee. Friday's twin attacks on the minority Ahmadi community left more than 90 people dead. They were claimed by a group, which identified itself as the Punjabi wing of the Taliban. Deutsche Welle spoke to political expert Hasan Askari Rizvi in Lahore, where there has been a wave of violence in recent days. DW: Who are the \"Punjabi Taliban\"? It is a kind of a pejorative term, which includes a host of groups. Initially in Punjab, you had two types of militancy: One, the groups that focussed mainly on Indian-administered Kashmir and there were other types of groups that focussed on Pakistan. Those were the sectarian groups targeting mainly the Shias, and there were some Shia groups targeting the Sunni leadership. Over the years a lot of factions have broken away from these groups and these small entities are functioning more or less autonomously. They have trainings in the tribal areas because these are secured for them and certain parts are not under Pakistani control so these groups go there. They operate with the Pakistani Taliban based in tribal areas against the Pakistani troops in the region. They also have an autonomous agenda, which they pursue in Punjab, as they have been doing in the past days. These groups also play host or are a kind of a local link to Taliban suicide bombers who come into the main part of Pakistan from the tribal areas (let's say to Punjab). If they have to target some place, they park themselves with these Punjab groups, and then do it. All these factions and groups that have broken away from traditional militant groups and are functioning in close collaboration with tribal area Taliban are often described as the \"Punjabi Taliban\". Why do you think these militants are resurfacing now? They have always existed here and there and generally the trend is that they undertake a couple of operations, one after the other. Then the government comes in and takes action against them. Then they just disappear or become sleeping groups and suddenly after a couple of months they resurface. That's the standard pattern. The last major incident in Lahore was in the first week of March. Then there was nothing in April and now towards the end of May you have this kind of incident. Do you think the government should have taken stronger action against them? They should have but the problem is that the Punjab government has a kind of ambiguous approach and I think there is some element of denial within the leadership also. These groups also have some sympathy if not support at the societal level and that makes it difficult for the government to go against them openly. They need to work together and to emphasise to the people that they are terrorists. They use different names and Islam but actually their agenda is terrorism. Somehow the government of Punjab has been rather confused and ambiguous regarding these groups. Interview: Disha Uppal Editor: Anne Thomas",
        "generated_story": "The threat of the Punjabi Taliban in Pakistan is growing The threat from the Pakistani Taliban is increasing, a political expert told Deutsche Welle, adding that it is becoming increasingly likely that the group will continue to pose a threat to the country's stability. \"The Taliban are becoming more and more active in the region,\" he said. According to a report by the German news agency, the Taliban have increased their attacks on Pakistan's Jinnah Hospital in Lahore, killing at least 10 people and wounding more than 100 others. The Taliban, who have claimed responsibility for the attacks, have also been emboldened to attack the hospital, which is located near the border with India. It is not the first time they have attacked a hospital. In the past, they had attacked hospitals and hospitals in Punjab and Kashmir. But in recent months, it has become increasingly clear that they are not going to be able to do so. Last month, an Indian army officer was killed in an attack on a Pakistani hospital in Karachi. Since then, there has been an increase in attacks by Pakistani militants. On Monday, one of those attacks took place at the Pakistan-administered city of Ahmadi, where a number of people have been killed, according to eyewitnesses. This is the second such attack in a month in which the militants have taken control of an area that is home to several thousand people. At the same time, some of them have fled to Pakistan, while others have returned to their home country of Pakistan to seek refuge. Some of these militants, however, are still fighting for their lives in Pakistani jails and jails. They are also trying to establish a foothold in India's Punjab province of Kashmir, with the aim of establishing an Islamic state there. These attacks are being carried out by a group known as the Lashkar-e-Taiba (Lahore Taliban) and are believed to have killed hundreds of civilians and injured thousands of others in their attempts to escape from a Taliban-controlled area in eastern Pakistan. There is also a growing fear of a resurgence of violence in Kashmir and other parts of India, as well as in neighboring Pakistan and Afghanistan. As a result, many people are fleeing to India and Pakistan in search of safety and security, and some are even planning to return to Afghanistan in order to join the militant group. However, this is unlikely to happen because the situation is still very unstable, said Disha Uppal Editor: Anne Thomas, editor-in-chief of DeutscheWelle. She added that there is a \"growing threat\" to Pakistani security forces, including the army and the police, because of their presence in areas where the insurgency is taking hold. A Taliban spokesman, Hasan Askari Rizvi, told the newspaper that he was \"very concerned\" about the attack. He said that \"the Pakistani army is doing everything it can to protect its own people.\" \"It is very important for us to keep our people safe,\" said the journalist, whose father was a member of parliament for over 30 years. 'We are very concerned for our own security and our country is at a very critical juncture right now. We have to make sure that we don't let this happen again.\" The Pakistani government has vowed to take action against the insurgents, he added, saying it will not allow them to gain any more territory, but it would be \"a very long time before we can do that.\" In an interview with DW, Thomas said it was too early to talk about whether or not there was an imminent threat, given the fact that Pakistan has a large population of Sunni Muslims. Thomas also pointed out that in some areas of Punjab, Muslims are more likely to flee than other minorities, such as Hindus and Sikhs."

        "target": "Party leaders call for increased wages in growing German economy Chancellor Angela Merkel and other top officials have called for upticks in Germany's economy to trickle down to workers in the form of higher pay. But a leading think tank has warned against giving raises too soon. Germany's foreign minister and deputy chancellor, Guido Westerwelle, has added his support to comments made by Economics Minster Rainer Bruederle about increased wages for German workers. \"When the economy grows and this growth is substantial and sustainable, then the benefits of this upswing should be felt by the people who worked so hard for it,\" Westerwelle told the Hamburger Abendblatt newspaper in an interview. Westerwelle heads the free-market liberal FDP, which shares power with Chancellor Merkel's Christian coalition. Earlier this week, Bruederle, also an FDP member, said in light of Germany's currently growing economy, those economic gains should trickle down to employees in the form of higher wages. Merkel, who is also the head of the Christian Democratic Union, supported Bruederle's idea. \"That is something the chancellor sees the same way, letter for letter,\" said Merkel's spokesman, Steffen Seibert. Not so fast Earlier this week, analysts predicted growth of 3.5 percent this year and 2 percent in 2011. Germany's five leading economic think tanks also predicted that the number of unemployed would fall below 3 million next year, the lowest level since 1992. Despite the current rosy outlook for the German economy, not everyone is convinced that a growing economy should inevitably lead to higher wages. The president of the German Institute for Economic Research, Klaus Zimmermann, warned against reacting too quickly. \"I can't support the idea of a general wage increase, I think it is too dangerous,\" Zimmermann said in an interview with the Handelsblatt newspaper. Zimmermann wasn't opposed to the idea of raising wages, but said he was against across-the-board increases for all sectors and pointed out that not every industry is benefitting the same from the growing economy. \"We can't forget that the German economy did not resort to mass lay-offs when it wasn't going so well last year,\" Zimmermann said. Raising wages in some branches could be a good idea, Zimmermann said, as that would make those branches more attractive option to potential workers from outside of Germany.

        "generated_story": "Chancellor Angela Merkel's Deputy Chancellor, Klaus Zimmermann, is against a general increase in Germany's minimum wage. The FDP's deputy chancellor, Rainer Bruederle, said on Thursday that he was \"not in favor\" of a wage increase. \"I'm not in favour of it at all,\" he said in an interview with the newspaper Hamburger Abendblatt. He also said he would not support a \"general increase\" in German minimum wages, which are set to rise by 1.5 percent from the current level of 2.6 percent. But he did not rule out the possibility of an increase of 1 percent, according to a report by the German Institute for Economic Research (DIER), which is a think tank in the Minster, the state-run news agency in Berlin. According to the IER, this would be the first time that a German government has increased its minimum hourly wage by more than 2 percent since the end of the 1990s. It is also the second time in three years that the chancellor has not been able to agree on wage increases. On the other hand, he has said that it is not necessary for the economy to be free and free, and that there is no reason for it to not be. In the past, when the government was in power, it had been free to raise the wage, but it was not free. This time, however, there was no free market, so it wasn't free for people to make their own decisions. For example, in 2011, Chancellor Steffen Seibert was forced to step down from his post as finance minister after he refused to give up his position as head of state for a year and a half. Since then, a number of ministers have stepped down, including Guido Westerwelle, who has been in charge of economic affairs since 1992. At the time of his ouster, Merkel was still Chancellor of Germany. Now, she is in a position of power to decide whether to go ahead with a tax increase or not. That is, if she decides to stay in office. If she does not, then she will have to take a step back from her role as minister of finance and economic policy. And that is the only way that she can continue to lead the country's economy. She also has the support of her party's parliamentary majority and the Social Democrats (SPD) as well as the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) in parliament. However, on the issue of tax reform, her position is more important than ever. Her position on tax increases is that Germany should not raise taxes on people who are already working, rather it should increase their wages and reduce the amount they are working. Under the new law, Germany must increase the tax burden on those who do not earn enough to qualify for higher wages. There is currently no tax on income earned by people earning less than 1,000 euros ($2,500) per year. As a result, many people are not getting enough of their income from their jobs. Many of them have lost their pensions, while others are making their way to higher salaries. Some have even gone to university to get a degree in economics. Others have gone into the private sector to study the economics of higher education. Most of these people, though, don't have the means to do so, because they have no knowledge of what is going on in their lives. They have never had the opportunity to work in government. So, they can't get into government, or even the business world, where they work. These are the things that are important to them. What is important for them is to have a clear understanding of how to deal with these issues. How do they know what they're doing? What are they going to say to you? Do you think they will do that? Is there a way for you to think about it? Does this mean that you should be doing the right thing? If you are a member of parliament, do you have any idea what you can do? You should ask yourself that. You can also ask your colleagues at the DIER."

        "target": "Bayern Munich coast to win over Nuremberg Bayern Munich wrapped up the 12th Bundesliga match day with an easy win over Nuremberg. Freiburg scored an extra time goal to squeak out a victory against Hoffenheim. Bayern Munich cruised to a 3-0 victory at home against Bavarian rival FC Nuremberg on Sunday, closing the German soccer tables for the weekend. Striker Mario Gomez got things going in the 10th minute for Bayern and also scored the final goal in the 75th minute off a corner kick from Franck Ribery. Ribery came on as a substitute five minutes earlier, making his first appearance for the team since injuring his ankle in September. Near the end of the match, Gomez had an opportunity for his third goal on a penalty kicked but missed. Thirty points at break Phillipp Lahm successfully converted a penalty kick in the 57th minute to round out the scoring for Bayern. The victory for Bayern moved them into sixth place in the table with 19 points and has continued a slow shift in momentum following a rough start to the season. Bayern coach Louis van Gaal said after the game he hoped his team would have 30 points by the end of the first half of the season in five more matches. Cisse saves win for Freiburg In Sunday's other Bundesliga match, Senegal striker Papiss Demba Cisse broke a scoreless deadlock with a goal in the 91st minute to give Freiburg a 1-0 win over Hoffenheim. Cisse has now scored 10 goals in 12 games and is currently the Bundesliga's second highest scorer. The win moves Freiburg into fourth place in the table with 21 points, one ahead of Frankfurt in fourth and three behind Bayer Leverkusen and Mainz, in second and third place, respectively. Nuremberg drop to 10th place with 18 points at the end of a very tight middle group. Just three points separate Nuremburg from Freiburg. Hoffenheim also have 18 points but are two places ahead of Nuremberg in eighth place on goal difference. Author: Matt Zuvela (dpa, sid) Editor: Sean Sinico",

The German champions have been on a tear in the last few weeks. On Sunday, the Bundesliga champions beat Hoffengentlemen 2-1 at home, their first Bundesliga win of the season. German coach Josep Ribery's side, who had been without a win in their last three matches, came back from a goal down to secure a third straight win at the Allianz Arena in Freiburg. Germany's second-biggest club has won three straight Bundesliga titles in a row, including the league's top two, with Bayern's Mario Gomez scoring twice in each half. Bayern, however, were unable to find the back of their net after the break and were forced to settle for a late penalty from substitute Phillipp Lahm. In the second half, though, they were able to hold on to their lead for the third time in three games. \"I'm so happy to be back in this position again,\" said Bayern coach Pep Guardiola after his side had lost their previous three Bundesliga matches. 'I feel so good about the way we've been playing this season, and I'm very happy that we're back on the right track again,' he added. He added: \"It's a great feeling to have the opportunity to play in front of a home crowd again and to get back into the Champions League,\" he said, adding that he was \"very happy with the result.\" \"We have a lot of confidence in our players,\" added the midfielder, whose first goal for Bayern came in September, when the German side were eliminated from the first round by the Wolfsburg team."

        "target": "Teabag filter cleans water with nanotechnology A new water filter developed in South Africa could provide millions of people with clean drinking water. The filter, about the size and shape of a teabag, would be inexpensive, easy to distribute and simple to use. Marelize Botes is conducting a final set of tests on a new type of diminutive water filter before industrial production can begin. The microbiologist pours water from a plastic bottle though a high-tech, teabag-sized filter before analyzing it in her in her laboratory at the University of Stellenbosch in South Africa. \"The filter is much cheaper than bottled water as well as any other filter on the market,\" she told Deutsche Welle. Instead of being filled with black or green tea, the bag contains active carbon granules and is made from nanofibers treated with biocide, which kills bacteria rather than simply filtering them from the water. Nanotech for pennies \"This project takes nanotechnology to the poorest of the poor people who live in this world, and it will make a difference in their lives,\" said Eugen Cloete, who in addition to inventing the filter is dean of the faculty of science at Stellenbosch University and chair of Stellenbosch University's Water Institute. With some 300 million people in Africa - and over a billion worldwide - living without access to clean drinking water, the need for such a filter is huge. When in mass production, the developers said they expect the teabag to cost just a few South African cents (under half a US cent and under a third of a euro cent). In addition to being inexpensive, Botes said, the filter is also easy to distribute to rural area and simple to use as it can be place in an adapter that fits on nearly any regular-sized plastic bottle. Each filter can clean one liter (one quart) of the most polluted water to the point where it is completely safe to drink. Once used, the filter can be disposed of and is biodegradable. African countries, led by Somalia, Mauritania and Sudan, were ranked to have the most vulnerable water supplies, according to a June report by UK-based risk consultancy firm Maplecroft. Decentralized use The filter's small size and light weight make it ideal for rural areas where other means of filtration do not exist, Cloete said. \"It is simply impossible to build purification infrastructure at every polluted stream,\" Cloete said. \"So we have to take the solution to the people. The water is cleaned right then and there when you drink from the bottle.\" The filter is now undergoing testing by the South African Bureau of Standards, after which Cloete and his team hope it can be rolled out to the United Nations and non-governmental organizations that have expressed interest in it by the end of the year. The project grew out of research into larger filters, according to Cloete. \"We were busy developing filters for larger applications, but when you do the tests in the labatory you do the tests on a much smaller scale,\" he said. \"The results we were getting on a smaller amount of water promoted me to think about a smaller application.\" Author: Joerg Poppendieck, Sean Sinico Editor: Anke Rasper",
        "generated_story": "A Teabag-sized water filter for decentralized drinking in South Africa The new device is designed to be used by the South African government and the United Nations. It is meant to reduce the need for water in the country's water supply. Maplecroft, a risk consultancy firm, has developed the technology to make it easier for people to get water from their homes and businesses. The device, called the \"Tabaag,\" is intended to provide water to people who do not have access to clean water, such as those who are not able to access clean drinking water. According to Marelize Botes, head of the Water Institute at the University of Stellenbosch, the device has been designed specifically for decentralization of water supplies. \"It's a very simple device,\" she told Deutsche Welle, adding that it would be easy to use in any situation where water was not available to the public. However, it is not possible for the government to do so without the aid of a company or a government agency, which is responsible for ensuring that the water is safe and clean for everyone, she said. In the case of Somalia, for example, there is no government-run water treatment plant, so the system is only available in areas where people can drink from the tap. This is the first time that a water-based system has ever been used in a country with a population of more than 1.5 million people, according to a report by a study published in The New York Times last year. At the time of its launch in August 2011, Mapleco was the only company in Africa to offer water filters to schools and universities, and it was one of only a handful of companies in that country that offered such a system. Since then the company has made a number of investments in water technology, including one that was developed in Mauritania and one in Somalia. But the new system will not be available until at least the end of next year, when the World Health Organization (WHO) is expected to approve it. For now, however, this is just a small step in its efforts to improve water quality and ensure that schools, colleges, universities and other educational institutions have the capacity to meet the needs of their students and their families. And it won't be the last time the world will see this kind of system, as the UN has already approved the use of this technology in schools across the continent. That's not to say that there will be a shortage of school-level education for all students, but it's something that will have to wait until the next school year is over. There is also the possibility that this system could be extended to other countries as well, like the UK, where there are already a lot of schools that have already been built up. So, we're going to try to find a solution for that. We'll see what we can do. I'm not sure how long it will take until we get to that point in time, because we don't know what the future holds for our students. If we do get there, I think we'll have a long way to go before we reach the point where we are ready to move on to something else. What's next for us? \"We're still trying to figure out the best way forward,\" said Bote, who heads the firm's research and development division. She added that she hopes the project will lead to an increase in funding for education and training for children and young people in developing countries, especially in countries like Somalia and Sudan. 'We can't wait to see how this will play out in our own country,' she added, \"but we want to give them the opportunity to learn more about this project and how it can be implemented in their own countries.\" The project is being funded by Canada's Ministry of Health and Social Development (MoD) and is currently under construction in London, with the aim of raising funds for research into water and sanitation."

        "target": "For drivers in Germany, 2010 was the most expensive year ever Owning and operating a car in Germany has never been cheap, but it's never been more expensive than in 2010. German auto club ADAC says costs associated with owning a car have risen more than 40 percent since 1995. In 2010, German car owners had to pay a high price for their mobility, according to ADAC, which cited record-high fuel prices as the major cost factor. \"For drivers, 2010 will go down in history as the most costly year ever,\" ADAC said in a statement. High taxes The cost of acquiring and operating a car has risen 42 percent since 1995, compared to a 24 percent increase in the general cost of living. Due to tax increases and higher production costs, fuel prices soared 86 percent over the 15-year period. In 2010 alone, the average price for a liter of super gasoline was more than 1.40 euros ($1.84) - the highest the average price ever. According to ADAC, urban singles spent an average of 3,340 euros on their cars in 2000. Five years later, that figure had jumped to 3,900 euros. By the end of 2010, their expenses reached 4,380 euros, or 1,000 euros more than a decade earlier. Driving is also pricey for four-person families with two cars. According to the automobile club, their annual costs have risen 30 percent over the past 10 years from 5,940 euros to 7,740 euros. Taxes account for the lion's share of gasoline and diesel prices. The German government's mineral oil and value added taxes account for nearly 88 cents of the 1.35-euro price of a liter of fuel. Low toll revenue While the German government reaps more revenue year for year from vehicle-related taxes, income generated by its highway toll for trucks is expected to fall this year for the first time since the haulage charges were introduced in 2005. The government predicts this year's toll revenues will amount to 4.2 billion euros, down from 4.3 billion euros in 2009. Author: John Blau Editor: Sam Edmonds",
        "generated_story": "The Most Costly Year in History for German Auto Clubs Last year was the most expensive year in German auto clubs' history. The most costly year ever was 2009. In 2009, ADAC spent 4.3 billion euros ($4.2 billion) on the purchase of new cars and SUVs. That's a staggering amount of money for an auto club in Germany, according to a study by the German Automobile Club Association (ADAC) published in the journal Auto Club Magazine. It is the first year since the beginning of the 20th century that the average German car club has spent more than that amount on a new car. This is a record for the number of car clubs that have bought a car in a single year, the study found. \"The most costly year for a German club was in 2009,\" the report said, adding that \"the average cost of an automobile club is about 3,000 euros a year.\" The study also found that most German clubs spend an average of 4,380 euros per car per year on new vehicles, compared to the same period in 2005, when it was about 1.5 billion euro. And that's not even counting the costs associated with the new models. For example, in 2007, a total of 3.4 billion Euros was spent on car parts. But that was not enough to make up for that spending. A year later, there was another record-breaking year: in 2010, at the end of a five-year period that saw the total spend exceed the previous year's record of 5.1 billion.
