        "target": "Myanmar Junta Announces Amnesty The junta in Myanmar, also known as Burma, announced an amnesty for more than 7,000 prisoners on Friday, including a few political detainees. The amnesty came on the 21st anniversary of the brutal crackdown of a student-led pro-democracy movement in 1988 and the subsequent seizure of power by the current junta. Journalists were invited to Yangon\u2019s notorious Insein prison on Friday as the authorities released the first batch of prisoners. At least 600 inmates were freed as part of an amnesty for over 7,000 inmates nationwide. Among those released in Yangon were two journalists and 25 political prisoners -- rights groups say this is only 1 percent of the total number of political prisoners held by the military regime. Maung Zarni, a research fellow at the London School of Economics, was \u201chappy for the prisoners who were part of the release\u201d. \u201cThis is a very positive personal development and I am happy they have been released but we need to understand that the junta is using the prisoners\u2019 release as a public relations exercise. It is the 21st anniversary of the military coup so they are using this as a way to pacify political discontent in the country.\u201d Amnesty comes ahead of next year\u2019s polls Myanmar's director general of prisons, Zaw Win, said that the prisoners had been freed so they could take part in next year's polls. In recent months, rights activists, pro-democracy activists and Western countries have cast doubt on the credibility of the planned elections as many key political activists are still in detention. This includes pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who recently began a new 18-month period of house arrest after being found guilty of violating her house arrest order in a widely condemned trial. \u201cThe whole Suu kyi trial is rather unlawful,\u201d said Zarni. \u201cBecause the country does not have an independent judiciary, the judges are just puppets who dance to the tune of the top leadership.\u201d Junta is holding on tightly In 1990, Suu Kyi\u2019s National League for Democracy won Myanmar\u2019s last general election by a landslide. But the junta never recognised the results and has since tightened its control over the country. The 2008 constitution, which was drafted and approved by the military generals, which guarantees the army 25 percent of parliamentary seats, is yet another sign of its desire to consolidate power. \u201cThe military is going to be in power for a long time,\u201d warns Zarni, \u201cbecause they have got control of all the political and economic institutions in the country as well as the entire state of Burma. So with or without elections, this is likely to remain the same.\u201d New Democratic Party formed Meanwhile, a new political party has been formed in Myanmar. The Democratic Party is headed by Mya Than Than Nu, who is the daughter of the country\u2019s first democratically-elected prime minister, U Nu. The party has proposed a power-sharing deal with the military, which would give 40 percent of power to politicians and 60 percent to the military rulers. Harn Yawnghwe, the director of the Brussels-based Euro-Burma Office, doubts the new party stands a chance: \u201cIt is possible that they they would be able to get some votes. But it is not likely, even if they were able to contest the elections freely, that they will be able to form a new government because the military is not prepared to let any party rule.\u201d Democrats should exploit elections He thinks the only way out for the democratic forces in Myanmar is to use the upcoming elections wisely and \u201cto take part in them even if they are against them. I think we have to look at the elections as a process which will lead to democracy -- maybe in few more years.\u201d The National League for Democracy has indicated that it will not take part in the polls unless all Myanmar\u2019s political prisoners, including Suu Kyi, are released. Suu Kyi\u2019s lawyers have filed an appeal against the extension of her house arrest and the court is expected to give a ruling on October 2. But few are hopeful that the junta will amnesty her anytime soon. Author: Disha Uppal Editor: Anne Thomas",
        "generated_story": "Rohingya's New Junta: Myanmar's Aung San Suu Kyi has been accused of inciting violence in the country's new junta. Amnesty International (Amnesty International) has called for the release of thousands of political prisoners in Myanmar. Zaw Win, director of the United Kingdom Institute in Yangon, said in a statement that he was \"deeply saddened\" by the allegations. \"I am deeply saddened by what has happened in my country,\" he said, adding that the government has failed to act on its promises to end violence against the Rohingya. He added that \"we are not going to allow this kind of violence to continue in our country.\" Insein, a village near the border with neighboring Myanmar, was among the first to be released from prison in 2014. U Nu, who is also a professor of international relations at the London School of Economics (LSE) in London, also said that it was not possible for him to return to his post as president of Myanmar after the military government was overthrown by a military coup in 2011. The new government, however, has vowed to take action against those who have been convicted of crimes against humanity, including murder, rape, torture, and attempted murder. On Tuesday, the National League for Democracy (NLD) announced it would release more than 1,000 political detainees from jail. According to the NLD, this would be the second time in three years that a political prisoner had been released after being sentenced to life in prison. In the past, detainees were released in exchange for being released on conditions of release. However, in recent years, many of them have fled to neighboring Bangladesh, where they are now living in exile. They are being held in detention camps in northern and western Myanmar and are awaiting trial in absentia, according to a report from the International Criminal Court (ICC). The report, which is based in Brussels, is the latest in an ongoing series of cases in which rights groups have called on the Myanmar government to release them. It is not clear how long they will be out of jail, but it is possible that they could be freed in future, if they have not already been freed. Last year, they were sent to prison for a year and a half for their alleged involvement in human rights abuses. This was the third time they had received death threats from Myanmar since the new military regime came into power in 2012. Since then, it's been a long time since Myanmar has seen a change in its constitution and the constitution was amended to make it easier for people to live under the rule of a civilian president. But it has not been easy to find a new constitution that will allow them to have a say in what they want to do in their lives. For example, there is a law that says they must not be allowed to use their right to freedom of expression. There are also laws that prohibit the use of social media in public places, such as schools, hospitals and hospitals. And there are restrictions on access to internet access. That means that people can't access the internet without having a smartphone. So, for now, I am not sure what to expect. I have no idea what the future holds for these people. What I do know is that I don't know what will happen to them when I get back to my home country. If they do decide to go to jail again, then I will have to give them a chance to get out and get a better life. Mya Than Than Nu is one of my closest friends. She's a lawyer and she's an advocate of democracy, so I think that's what I'm hoping for. When I was a child, she had a lot of friends and relatives who were imprisoned for many years. Her father was an army officer and her mother was also an Army officer who worked as a nurse. Now, her father is an activist and now she has a wife and two children. (Reuters, AP, AFP, dpa) (AFP, Reuters) The Associated Press)The ruling Democratic Party of Burma (DUP) said it will continue to press for an independent investigation into the deaths of people who committed crimes. A spokesman said the party would not comment on this case, saying the investigation is still ongoing, \"but we will do everything we can to prevent it from happening again.\" The ruling party has promised to investigate the case. Meanwhile, my father has said he would like to see the results of this investigation. His wife, Harn Yawnghwe, told Reuters that she will appeal to her family to come to me for help. After all, he's the only one who knows what she wants. As a former military officer, his wife is married to someone who has worked in politics for over 30 years and has many friends who are still alive and well. At the end of her life she was able to help her raise her daughter to adulthood and raise a family in her home state of Naypyidaw (AP) - Reuters - AFP/AFP/dpa/Reuters"

        "target": "US duo shares Nobel Prize for Economics US researcher Elinor Ostrom is the first woman to win the Nobel prize for economics since it was created in 1968. She will share the prestigious award with US compatriot Oliver Williamson. The jury from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said the Americans' research had shown how \"economic analysis can shed light on most forms of social organization.\" Ostrom, a professor at Indiana University, was honored for her \"analysis of economic governance,\" especially in relation to the management of common property or property under common control. The political scientist's work challenges the widely accepted belief that common property is poorly managed and should be either regulated by central authorities or privatized, it added. She carried out numerous studies showing how self-organization and local-level management work to keep common resources viable. Her studies included both natural resources, such as forests, and artificial structures, for example police forces. Ostrom told Swedish television that she felt \"great surprise and appreciation\" and was \"in shock\" about being the first woman to win the prize. The pros and cons of big firms In his work, co-prizewinner Oliver Williamson, of University of California, Berkeley, examines why large corporations tend to arise - and why they do not - based on the cost and complexity of transactions, according to the Nobel committee. \"He has taught us to regard markets, firms, associations, agencies, and even households from the perspective of their contribution to the resolution of conflict,\" the jury said. Williamson authored 'The Economic Institutions of Capitalism' in 1975, a landmark text of the 'new institutional economics' movement that questioned the idea of firms as simple profit-making machines. Last but not least The Nobel prize for economics is the only Nobel award that was not created by the will of Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel in 1896. It was actually founded by the Swedish central bank, the Sverige Riksbank, to celebrate its tri-centenary a year earlier. It was awarded for the first time in 1969 under its official name: the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel. But although it was the last \"Nobel prize\" to be created and the last to be announced each year, the prize is not a poor relation in monetary terms. Winners of the awards for peace, literature, medicine, physiology, chemistry and physics all receive 10 million Swedish crowns (969,000 euros). A good year for women This year was a record year for women laureates. German-Romanian writer Herta Mueller won the Nobel Prize for Literature. Australian-American Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider of the United States were awarded the prize for medicine. And Ada Yonath of Israel was one of three scientists recognized for her work in chemistry. Americans more or less swept the board this year. Nine of the 11 laureates were US citizens. The most prominent of those was US President Barack Obama, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for his \"extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples.\" jg/AFP/dpa/Reuters Editor: Sam Edmonds",
        "generated_story": "The first woman to win the Nobel Prize for Literature has been awarded to a Swedish woman. Elinor Ostrom won the prize in 1968 for her work in the field of economics. The prize was presented to her by the University of California, Berkeley, in a ceremony held at the university's campus in Berkeley on Saturday. It was the first time a woman had won a Nobel prize for economics since Alfred Nobel in 1867. In 1968, the Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded the most prestigious prize to women in economics, with a prize of $1.5 million. Nobel-prize-winning Nobel laureate Oliver Williamson, a professor of political science at Indiana University in Indiana, said he was delighted to receive the award. \"It's a great honor,\" he said, adding that it was \"an honor to be able to share the laureates with other women.\" \"I'm very happy to have won this award,\" Williamson said in an interview with the Associated Press. He added that \"the prize is a very big honor for women, and I think it's an honor that we can all be proud of.\" The award was given to one of the world's most influential people, Nobel Laureate Carol Greider, who was born in Sweden in 1918 and died in Germany in 1957. She was a graduate of Purdue University, where she earned her doctorate in philosophy and economics from the same year. Her work was published in \"The Economic Institutions of Capitalism\" and was translated into several languages, including German, French, Italian, Spanish, German and Romanian. When she won it, she was only the second woman in history to claim the title of \"Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences\" for the work she did on the topic of economic theory and the theory of social theory, which she wrote about in her doctoral thesis, \"Economics as a subject of study.\" She also wrote a book about her experiences as an economist at Purdue, Germany's largest university. According to the book's author, author and lecturer, her research was based on her own experiences in business, economics and politics. But she also said that she had been inspired by her father's work to write about the importance of free markets. That's not to say she didn't have a lot of experience in this field, but she said she wanted to give it to someone who had studied the subject for a long time. And that's exactly what she has done: she's been writing about it since the beginning of her career. At the end of last year, Erika Mueller, co-editor of The Economic Institute of America, published her first book in English, called \"A Nobel for Economic Literature,\" which is based in Berlin, Berlin and Paris. On the other hand, it is the only book that has ever been published by an English-speaking author. Author: Elizabeth Blackburn, The New York Times, HarperCollins, Reuters, AP, AFP, dpa, iStock, Bloomberg, Deutsche Welle, Rheinische Zeitung (Reuters) and other news agencies reported that the winner of this year's prize will be awarded in Stockholm on Sunday, Jan. 21, at a time when the country is celebrating the 50th anniversary of its founding in 1900. This is not a day to celebrate the birth of a new generation of economists, however, as the nation's first female Nobel winner is still a young woman who has gone on to become a leading figure in its field. For the past 50 years, Sweden has had a number of women who have become the best economists of their generation. Many of these women have been in positions of power in their own right. They are the ones who made it possible for them to do so. Now, they have the opportunity to make a difference. Their achievements are being recognized by their peers at universities across the globe. One of them is Nobel's wife, Ada Yonath, an economics professor at IU's business school in Munich. Another is professor emeritus of business and finance, Anne Mueller. Both are women of German descent. Neither has a PhD in political philosophy, so she is an expert in economic philosophy. Nor is she a specialist in politics or economics who is interested in social science. Nevertheless, both women are well-versed in both fields of politics and business. As a result, there is no shortage of people who want to learn more about how the economy works. There are also many who don't know what the future holds for their country. I'm not sure that I can say the exact same thing about Germany or the United States, for example. However, I do know that there are many of us who would like to see a similar kind of success in other fields, such as business or politics, or even the humanities, because of what they've done in recent years. So, let's take a look at how they are doing. What do you think? What are you going to tell us? Do you have an opinion? Tell us what you've learned? Read more: \"What are your thoughts?"

        "target": "'One in three' unaware they are HIV-positive The number of people living with HIV/AIDS in the European Union and neighboring countries has increased by nearly a third, with one in three unaware they have the virus, the EU Commission warned Monday. In a document on combating AIDS, the Commission said that as of 2007, around 2.2 million people carried the virus in the EU and nearby countries, an increase of 700,000 from 2001. According to Commission figures, around 730,000 of these live within the EU's 27 member states. France, Italy, Spain and Portugal have relatively high infection rates - ranging from 0.4 percent to 0.5 percent. In the Baltic country of Estonia, the infection rate stands at around 1.3 percent. In neighboring Ukraine, around 1.6 percent of the population has been diagnosed with HIV, while in Russia around 1.1 percent are HIV positive. The Commission warned that now was not the time for Europe to drop its guard on preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS, adding that in some neighboring countries the number of people carrying the virus had doubled. EU Health Commissioner Androulla Vassiliou said political momentum in the fight against HIV/AIDS needed to be maintained, adding that people must \"take responsibility for themselves and their partners by talking about and practicing safe sex and going for HIV testing.\" A cure for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has yet to be found more than a quarter century after it was brought to public attention. However, efficient treatments exist to slow the evolution of the virus. dfm/AFP Editor: Chuck Penfold",
        "generated_story": "One in three people living with HIV/AIDS in the EU and neighboring countries are unaware they are HIV-positive, the European Commission (EU) has found. The number of people who have been unaware of their status for more than a year is up from one in five in 2010, according to the latest figures from the Commission. This is the first time the commission has been able to confirm the status of a person who was unaware that he or she was HIV positive. According to a new report, 1 in 3 people in EU countries have not been tested for the virus, which is linked to AIDS. In addition, a third of those who were tested had been told they had HIV. \"This is a very serious problem,\" said Androulla Vassiliou, commissioner for health and human rights for Europe and the United States, adding that it was \"very difficult\" for them to know they were living in a country with a high rate of HIV and AIDS, and that they would have to live with the disease for at least a decade. That is, until a few years ago, when the average age of an HIV patient was 18 years old. Since then, it has become increasingly difficult for people to recognize their HIV status. For example, in some countries, HIV is classified as a form of cancer, while in others it can be treated as an AIDS-related illness. But in many cases, this is not the case in other countries. HIV can cause serious health problems, such as kidney failure, liver failure and even death. There is no cure for HIV, but the most common cause of death is AIDS in people with no known medical history. It's not just a disease that affects the immune system. AIDS is also a condition that can affect the body's ability to cope with life-threatening situations. A recent study by the World Health Organization (WHO) found that 90 percent of the world's men and women with AIDS live in countries with high levels of AIDS risk. Most of these men, women and children are not even aware they have HIV at all. Some men have AIDS and some have had AIDS for years. Many of them have never had sex with their partner. They have no memory of having been infected, or of being exposed to HIV or AIDS before they became infected. One in four men in Europe has HIV in their family. Another one, who lives in France, has a history of sexual abuse and neglect. These men are also victims of domestic violence. And then there are the women who live alone, with little or no contact with family, friends, relatives or relatives. Men who don't even know their partners. Women who are married or have children have a difficult time finding a partner who is willing to give them a chance to get married and raise their children. Those who do, however, have little chance of getting married, because they can't afford to pay for their own children's educations, education, medical care or even a child's education. If they do decide to marry, they will be forced to take care of themselves and their families in order to avoid having to leave the country. At the same time, there is little hope that their child will have the opportunity to become a father or a mother. So, what do you think about this? What does this mean for you? Is it a good thing that you're married to someone who has AIDS? Do you know what you want to do with your child? Are you married? Does it make you feel like you have an obligation to your children? If so, how can you help them? The answer is simple: You can do something about it. You just need to ask your partner to help you. What are you going to tell your spouse? Tell them what to say to them. Then you can tell them about your family and how you've been living your life. I'm sure they'll be happy to hear from you and tell you what's going on in your own life, too. Just ask them how they're doing. How do they feel about their kids? I think it's important to be aware of what they've done in this situation. Is there a way to make them feel better? How can they be a parent? Who knows? And who knows what will happen to you, right now? You'll never know for sure. Maybe you'll find out. Or maybe you won't have any children, you might even find a job? Or you will find someone to care for, say, your parents? That's the question I have asked my husband to answer. Let's talk to him. Tell him what he's doing in his own words. He's a man who doesn't know. Who cares? He has no idea. Why is it so hard for him? Well, that's what I do? Let me tell him that I want you to think of your kids. We're not a woman who's having a baby. When you do this, he'll tell me what is going through this life and then you"

The spokesman said more help was needed, but could not give exact numbers \"due to pending assignments.\" Recent soccer violence raises concern Swiss media has been questioning the security preparations for Euro 2008 after a spate of violence at recent games. In the latest incident, seats were ripped out and a goal post wrenched from the ground after St. Gallen faced the prospect of relegation following a 2-0 defeat to Bellinzona on May 20. St. Gallen was the third incident in a month that saw violent clashes with police who twice resorted to rubber bullets and tear gas. While Switzerland is seen as a low risk country in terms of hooliganism, violence has been on the increase in recent years and estimates claim there are around 400 hooligans and 600 sympathizers. Swiss Sports Minister Samuel Schmid said that hooliganism cannot be ruled out, reported German news agency DPA. But he expressed his belief that extra measures such as more policing, restrictions on alcohol -- which he has called \"a catalyst for violence\" -- and video surveillance will help keep trouble at bay. Private firms to boost European police The private security companies will be responsible for patrolling the stadiums and their surroundings, as well as the public viewing areas, team hotels and trainings areas. An international police force will manage the rest. Switzerland has committed some 31,200 police officers and soldiers. Another 1,700 police will be sent from Germany, which will have the authority to make arrests. France will offer the third largest contingent with 750 officers and Croatia, Poland, Sweden, Greece, Russia and Spain will also send reinforcements.",
        "generated_story": "Private firms to help with security preparations for Euro 2008 Private firms will help in the security preparation for the Euro Olympics in Germany, according to a Swiss sports ministry spokesman. The private firms have been working closely with the German sports federation, Tages Anzeiger, to ensure that security measures are in place before the event. According to the Swiss news agency DPA, a number of private companies have already been hired to provide security training to security personnel in St. Gallen and Bellinzona, as well as to prepare for a possible security breach at the end of the tournament. \"We are going to do everything in our power to protect our athletes,\" said Urs Stadler, head of sports at Taus Anziger. He added that \"we will be doing everything we can to make sure that we have the best security system in Europe.\" The firm, which is based in Bern, is one of several private security firms working in Switzerland. It is also the only one that has been paid for by the government, and it is not the first time it has done so. In 2009, it was the second year that it had paid the equivalent of $1.5 billion. Since then, however, the firm has also been able to raise funds to cover the costs of security, including the cost of hosting the games. This year's tournament will take place on June 14-15, with a total of 10,000 participants from all over the world. At the same time, Germany's sports minister, Samuel Schmid, has said that he is \"very happy\" to be part of a security team that is working on the final preparations. However, he also said he was not happy about the fact that the competition was being held in a foreign country, such as the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). \"I am very happy that I am not alone in this,\" he said, adding that his team would be working hard to secure the venues and venues in which the game is being played. Germany is expected to host the finals, but it will also have to decide whether it wants to take part in an event like the Olympics or not. For now, there is no way to know for sure. There is a lot of uncertainty about what will happen in terms of who will win and who might not win, so I think it's a good time to step up and take a look at what we are doing. We are also looking forward to having the chance to see what is going on in other countries and to have a better chance of winning the contest. I'm sure we will have some good news to share with you, too, because we know that there are some very important things to look out for. That is, if you are a member of our team, you will know what to expect from us. If you have not already, I'd be happy to tell you that you can do it. But I don't think you should be too worried about that. You should also be aware that this is an important event for us, for example, of how many people are coming to this tournament and how much money we'll be spending. And that's not to say that all the money will come from the financial sector. What is important is that everyone is doing the right thing and that they are being prepared for this event, not just the participants, who are the winners of this competition. So, let's be clear: We will not be giving up on this, we're not giving away any money at all. Let's just be honest with each other and be realistic: It's very, very difficult to predict the outcome of these events. After all, what can we expect? You can never be sure, right? But we've all been through this before and there's always a chance that something like this can happen. Just ask your friends and family. Do you know who you're talking to?

        "target": "German Minister Urges Peace in Georgia's Separatist Regions German Foreign Minister Steinmeier has called for an end to the \"spiral of violence\" between the Georgian government in Tbilisi and its Russian-backed rebel regions and presented a three-stage plan to break the deadlock. Steinmeier issued the plea as he began a tour of the region to sponsor a new peace plan aimed at calming the simmering tensions over Georgia's separatist regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. \"This is my appeal to break out of the spiral of violence. A lack of dialogue is not an option for the future,\" he said after meeting with his Georgian counterpart Eka Tkeshelashvili. Steinmeier, who chairs the so-called Group of Friends of the United Nations' Secretary on Georgia, is proposing a three-phase peace plan based on a mutual declaration of non-violence and repatriation of about 25,000 ethnic Georgians expelled from Abkhazia in the 1990s. Negotiations over the status of the two rebel regions, which have enjoyed de facto autonomy since the end of a civil war in 1994, was reserved for the final phase of negotiations. Tkeshelashvili said, \"The plan has great potential for success,\" but added that the most difficult thing would be to convince Russia. Peace talks remain distant The threat of armed conflict in the region last month has given urgency to international pressure for renewed peace talks, but Tbilisi, Moscow and the Russian-backed regions remain far apart on the basic premises for restarting peace talks. Officials in Tbilisi oppose a treaty on the non-use of force without guarantees on the return of refugees and the withdrawal of Russian peacekeeping forces base in the region. Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was skeptical of peace efforts Thursday. \"Signing of a treaty on the return of Georgian refugees to Abkhazia is unreal now, because such a return requires a calm situation,\" Lavrov was quoted as saying by news agency RIA-Novosti. \"We think that signing a treaty on the non-use of force without any preconditions is an absolutely unavoidable first step,\" he added. Experts see little hope for Steinmeier's plan Analysts do not expect anything conclusive from Steinmeier's trip, pointing to intransigence on the part of the Abkhaz President Sergei Bagapsh, who said he would \"not consider the plan.\" \"We are not going to discuss Abkhazia's status with anyone. We are building an independent, democratic state,\" Bagapsh was quoted by Georgian news agencies as saying. Speaking to journalists ahead of the meetings Thursday, Steinmeier admitted: \"We don't have any illusions about simple answers, but we cannot stand by without acting on this conflict. That would be irresponsible.\" From Tbilisi, the German minister is to travel to the Black Sea city of Batumi for talks with Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili and then to Abkhazia on Friday before ending his three-day tour in Moscow. Most citizens of the breakaway republics have been issued Russian passports and over 2,500 Russian peacekeeping troops patrol the region under a UN ceasefire agreement. In opposition to Georgia's bid to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Russia moved to strengthen diplomatic ties with the breakaway regions sharply aggravating tensions with the Georgian leadership in recent months.",
        "generated_story": "A New Peace Plan for the Separatist Regions of Georgia, Abkhazia and South Ossetia President Frank-Walter Steinmeier has called for a new peace plan in Georgia. The two regions are part of the Caucasus region, which has been split between Russia and Georgia since the fall of Soviet rule in the Soviet Union in 1991. A new plan is being drafted in Tbilisi by the United Nations' Secretary-General for Peace and Security in a bid to end the conflict between the two former Soviet republics. According to the new draft, the plan would be based on a \"new, comprehensive, and inclusive\" peace process. It would also include the creation of an independent state, with the goal of creating a state of law and order. However, it would not be the first time that the region would have to be split into two separate regions. \"We are not going to allow this to happen again,\" the German Foreign Minister said in an interview with RIA-Novosti, adding that it was \"very difficult\" for Georgia to agree to such a deal. In addition, he said, \"we will not allow it to take place without the cooperation of all the other regions.\" The draft was drafted by a group of experts from the European Union and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and was signed by Russian President Sergei Bagapsh and Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili on Wednesday. Russia's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, who heads the OSCE delegation, said the draft document should be published within the next two weeks. He added that he hoped to have it ready by then, but that \"it would take a long time\" before it could be ready. On Wednesday, a delegation of foreign ministers from Germany, France, Britain, Italy, Japan and Germany met in Moscow to discuss the possibility of a peace deal between Georgia and Russia. At the same time, they also said that they would like to see an end to a conflict that had been going on for some time. They also called on the Georgian government to provide a roadmap for peace and stability in their region. For the time being, however, there is no way to know for sure if it will be implemented. There is a lot of uncertainty about the future of this conflict, as well as the prospects for an eventual peace agreement between Moscow and Moscow. This is not to say that Russia is the only country that is willing to give up its sovereignty. But it is also not an isolated country. Since the end of World War II, Russia has not given up on its quest to create a stable state. Its role as a guarantor of peace is to protect the interests of Georgians and their families. That is why it has taken so long to come to terms with this plan. And it's not only Russia that has made it so difficult to reach out to Georgia's people. As a result, many of its people have become disillusioned with it. Many of them are still living in exile in Russia, where they don't want to return to their home countries. These are the people who have lost their homes and families to leave the country in order to find a better life for themselves and for their children. Most of these people live in poverty and have no hope of finding a way out of their own home. One of those is Eka Tkeshelashvyili, an ethnic Georgian who was killed by an Armenian separatist during the war. She is now a teacher at the University of Baku. Her husband, former military commander, was also killed in that conflict. Now she is in prison for life, according to Amnesty International. Meanwhile, her husband is fighting for his life. His wife has also been imprisoned for five years for being a member of her family's political party. Both men have been sentenced to life imprisonment for crimes against humanity. What does this mean for them? What do you think about this? Is it a good idea to try to make peace with Russia? Do you have any idea what that means for you? If so, what does it mean to you that you are a victim of what is happening in your own country? I think you will find it very hard to believe that this is something that can be done.

        "target": "Bayern's Klinsmann Praises, Hoeness Attacks Hoffenheim The Bundesliga's two top teams don't play until Friday, but the mind games are already underway. Bayern's coach Juergen Klinsmann says Hoffenheim are legitimate contenders, but commercial manager Uli Hoeness disagrees. When the Bundesliga scheduled Bayern's home match against Hoffenheim in the league's unloved Friday night slot, they probably didn't imagine that it would turn out to be the match of the first half of the season. Indeed, few experts or fans thought that Hoffenheim, a first-division debutante located in a southern German village with 3,000 inhabitants, would give mighty Munich a run for its money. But it's the first week of December, and Hoffenheim top the table by three points. They also have a much better goal difference than their second-placed rivals -- and that has drawn praise from Bayern's coach, Juergen Klinsmann. \"I have the highest estimation of Hoffenheim because they've built the squad very ambitiously, rationally and with very good players,\" Klinsmann told DPA news agency. \"They can be proud of that.\" Klinsmann said he thought that the club could establish itself among the top three or four sides in Germany in the years to come and qualify for international competition next season. He also had words of praise for Hoffenheim's software billionaire patron, Dietmar Hopp, whose money has funded the club's ascent. \"There's nothing negative about it,\" Klinsmann said. \"He used to play for the club, is a soccer man through and through and helped the team get on its feet.\" Some fans have criticized Hopp and Hoffenheim for paying inflating salaries and luring talent away from other clubs instead of developing homegrown players. In fact, Hoffenheim's official salary budget is about average for the Bundesliga. Hoeness sounds his horn But while Bayern's coach was praising his opponents to the skies, Munich's commercial manager Uli Hoeness has been trying to play with their heads. On the heels of Bayern's convincing win over Leverkusen last weekend, Hoeness is back to taunting rivals. \"The performance we showed in the second half against Leverkusen will be enough against Hoffenheim,\" Hoeness told the German soccer magazine kicker. Hoeness also dropped a none-too-thinly-veiled hint that Hoffenheim's personnel expenditures were far higher than the officially released figures and scoffed at the idea that strategy would determine the outcome of Friday's match. \"Games are decided by the better players, not by tactics,\" Hoeness said. \"And of course, we've got better players than Hoffenheim.\" But that particular verbal attack may represent some wishful thinking of the manager's part. Hoffenheim coach Ralf Rangnick is one of only two current Bundesliga skippers with a winning record against Munich. Rangnick, whose team cruised past Bielefeld last weekend to keep Bayern three points back, reacted to Hoeness' remarks with a shrug. \"We're preparing for Munich exactly the same way we did against Bielefeld,\" Rangnick said. In any case, soccer fans in Germany know what they'll be doing Friday evening -- finding a bar with cable sports television to watch a top match that no one, before the start of the season, would have considered possible.",
        "generated_story": "Hoffenheim's Commercial Manager Reacts to the First Half of the Bundesliga Season Uli Hoeness has responded to criticism of his team's poor first half. \"We are in a very difficult situation right now,\" he told the club's official website on Tuesday. The club is in the midst of a difficult period, with the first two games of their Bundesliga campaign in doubt. After a poor start, the team has been struggling to find a way to get back on track. In the second half, they have struggled to keep up with their top-flight rivals, and that's not to say that they are going to be able to make up for it. They are, after all, a team with a lot of good players and a good manager. But they will have to work hard to stay on top of things. At the same time, there will be an opportunity for them to improve on their recent form, which has seen them win three consecutive Bundesliga titles in their last four seasons. That's the goal of this season's Champions League campaign, but it's also a chance to show how much they can improve upon their form in recent years. On the other hand, their first-half results have been a bit disappointing. For one thing, it was a disappointing start to their season. Leverkusen, who have won just one league game in four years, have had to adapt to a new system of playing in which they don't need to rely on a central central defender to win the ball back. This is a change from last season, when they lost to Bayern Munich and then to Borussia Dortmund, where they won the league in 2014 and 2015. It's a different situation this time around, however, as the German side have a much better chance of winning the title than they did in 2015-16. With the exception of Bayern, Hoffengheim have managed to avoid relegation for the past two seasons, despite the fact that their coach, Juergen Klinsmann, is still in charge of managing the side. He said he was \"very happy\" with his new management team, adding that \"we are very happy with our team and the way we are doing things.\" The Bundesliga's most successful season so far, though, has come at the expense of many other teams, including the likes of Dortmund and Schalke. Bundesliga leaders Bayern have also struggled with injuries and suspensions, while Hoffenerheim, meanwhile, are also struggling with injury. Last year's Bundesliga champions, Bayern were the only side to lose a single game, losing three in as many weeks. Bayern are currently in fourth place, having lost four in five games. Their only win in all competitions this year came against Hoffenheimer, whom they beat 2-1 at home to Hoffensheim on Sunday. However, that has not been the case in this campaign either. There are still a number of teams who are struggling in terms of fitness and fitness, such as Bayern and Dortmund. And there is the possibility that Bayern could be in trouble, too, if they do not have the right manager to take over the position of head coach. A new manager, Ralf Rangnick, said that he would be looking forward to working with Bayern's players, \"I am very pleased with what we have in mind. I think we can get a better understanding of what is going on here. We will see what the future holds for our players. You can't have too many injuries, for example, because we know that there are so many young players out there who can play for Bayern. If you want to play well, you can do that, then you've got to do it right, right? You just need a little bit more than that. So, let's talk about the positives. What do you think?

On Wednesday, European Commission Vice President Frans Timmermans - a former Dutch foreign minister - announced the move, marking the first time the EU has used the mechanism. Timmermans said that the move was aimed at entering \"into a dialogue with the Polish authorities, to clarify the facts in an objective way and help find solutions if necessary.\" He added that the procedure is focused on seeking answers regarding the new right-wing Polish government's actions not to apply two judgments by the country's constitutional court, and the reasons behind the president and vice-president's terms were shortened. Preserving rule of law However, Poland's deputy foreign minister said that the European Commission was informed of the reasons behind the government's actions. \"We would insist that the questions are phrased precisely because we have provided much information to the Commission in recent days and we are not entirely clear as to what the Commission is still not clear about,\" Szymanski noted to reporters at the European Parliament. New media laws, giving the government the power to hire and fire senior figures at state broadcasters, were also called into question by Timmermans. The controversial legislation prompted mass pro-democracy protesters in the European country. \"The rule of law is one of the EU's fundamental values. Making sure the rule of law is preserved throughout the Union is a key part of the European Commission's responsibilities,\" Timmermans wrote on his official Facebook page.

The European Parliament has warned Poland not to take sides because of the ongoing political crisis in the country. Polish Foreign Minister Frans Timmermans said on Wednesday that the European Union was \"very concerned\" about Poland's political situation. \"We are very concerned about the situation,\" he told reporters in Brussels, adding that it was not the first time Poland had been involved in political disputes in recent years. Poland has been accused of being a victim of a \"political witch-hunt\" by the government of Viktor Orban, the former Hungarian prime minister, who is currently in exile in Germany. Hungary, Poland and Hungary have been at loggerheads for years over a number of issues, including the right to vote in elections. But the dispute between the two countries has not been resolved, according to the Foreign Ministry, which has said it will not intervene in any way at this time. On Wednesday, Hungary and Poland signed a joint statement saying that they would cooperate with the Commission in its investigation into the case. However, they have not yet reached an agreement on how to resolve the issue. According to a statement from the foreign ministry, \"the Commission is very worried that Poland is going to have a very difficult time in this regard.\" The statement came after Hungary's Prime Minister Geert Wilders accused Poland of trying to influence the outcome of an election in which it won a majority of seats in parliament. It also said that Hungary would not participate in an EU referendum on whether to accept the results of Sunday's election, despite the fact that many of its citizens voted for the pro-European Union government. In addition, it said Hungary was the only country in Europe that voted against the new constitution, while Poland voted in favor of Article 50, a law that would have allowed the constitution to be amended to make it more binding on EU member states. Opinion polls show that more than 70 percent of voters in Hungary will vote for a new government in November. Many of those voters, however, have rejected the move. Some of them have called for an early election. Others, though, say they are not ready to give up on their country's future. They also say that if the current government does not change its stance on the future of EU membership, then Poland will be left with no choice but to leave the bloc. That would be a huge step backward for Poland as it has long been a member of NATO and the United States, but it is also a step forward for many other countries, such as Germany, France, Spain, Italy and even the US. And it's not just Poland that is at risk of losing its membership in NATO. There are also concerns over the possibility of Poland becoming a NATO member state, as well as about Hungary becoming one of Europe's biggest trading partners. This is not a country that has a lot of political power. For example, there is a long list of countries that do not want to join NATO, and there are many countries which do, in fact, not many that are willing to do so. One such country is Hungary. Another is Slovakia, for example. Slovakia is part of that country, with a large population of around 1.5 million people who live in rural areas in eastern and central Europe. Other countries also have large populations of Hungarian and Slovak citizens. Most of these people are poor and have little or no education, so they don't have access to basic education and basic social services. As a result of this, many people in Slovakia are unable to afford to attend school in their own countries. At the same time, Slovakia has had to learn to live with its own problems. Slovaks and Czechoslovakia are among those who have suffered the most from a lack of education in schools and universities. These are the countries most affected by this kind of situation, because they lack the resources to study and learn from each other. So, this is an important issue for Slovakia. I think that Slovakia will have to adapt to this situation in order to get a better education system and a more stable future for itself. If the Polish government is to become a European member, that's a problem that will only become more difficult to deal with, I'm not sure what will happen to it. What is the next step in that process? The EU has already decided to step up its efforts to improve its relations with Poland. We will continue to work on this issue, even if it takes a few years to reach a solution to its problems, if not more, than we have in other European countries like Hungary which have had a relatively easy time getting a job as a government, or at least not as much as the Czech Republic and Slovakia have, since the 1990s, when Poland was a communist state. Since the end of World War II, Polish politicians have become increasingly isolated and isolated from other parts of society. From the beginning, Poles have struggled to find a way out of it, too.

Greece had previously voiced reservations about the proposal. The proposed mission to be discussed at a NATO defense ministers meeting in Brussels on Thursday comes days after German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutolgu said they would raise the issue of refugees with the Alliance. According to a Reuters report citing a senior German official, initially reticent Greece has now given the green light for the operation, which could see NATO assets deployed in the Aegean in a mostly intelligence and reconnaissance role. Under the proposal, which would need to be approved by Alliance members, NATO maritime assets would provide information to national coastguards and the EU border agency Frontex to combat illegal smugglers using rickety boats to bring migrants to Europe. Turkey would then take back the refugees, as envisioned as part of a 3 billion-euro ($3.2 billion) EU-Turkey deal agreed to last year. According to German sources, the mission would not be similar to the NATO mission in the Mediterranean intercepting migrant boats making the dangerous run from Libya to Italy. However, NATO ships could intervene in emergency situations to save passengers. \"It is not NATO's remit to push back or stop refugee boats,\" the official told Reuters. The mission would use assets from the Alliance's standing naval group, a permanent reaction force deployed in the Mediterranean. The naval group's current flagship is the German combat support ship \"Bonn.\" Denmark has already said it would provide additional ships to the mission, according to the official. However, it is unclear whether NATO members will approve the mission which may fall outside the bounds of the Alliance's mandate. Complicating matters is a long-running maritime dispute between Greece and Turkey over sovereignty in the Aegean, where the two NATO members' jets regularly engage in dogfights. Turkey has taken in more than 2.5 million Syrian refugees, and is a major transit point for migrants from Asia and Africa. More than a million migrants and refugees reached Europe last year, many making the dangerous boat journey from Turkey to Greece by boat. So far this year, more than 340 have perished in the cold waters trying to reach Europe. cw/msh (AFP, dpa, Reuters)",
        "generated_story": "NATO's Standing Naval Group in the Aegean to combat illegal smugglers The NATO-led military alliance has deployed a naval ship to patrol waters off the Turkish coast. The ship is part of a NATO task force that has been tasked with fighting illegal smuggling across the Mediterranean Sea. Frontex, the European Union's maritime border agency, said on Thursday that it had deployed the ship \"to combat the smuggling of illegal migrants and refugees from Syria and Iraq.\" It was the first such deployment in Europe since the end of the Cold War, which began in 1991. It is the largest deployment of ships in NATO's Mediterranean region, and it is one of several NATO ships that have been deployed there since then. \"We are working with Turkey and the EU to tackle the illegal flow of refugees and migrants,\" German Defense Minister Ahmet Davutolgu said in a statement. He added that \"we are not going to allow smugglers to enter our territory without a permit,\" adding that the ships would not be allowed to leave Turkey until they had completed their mission. Germany, however, welcomed the deployment, saying it was a \"great step forward\" for the alliance. However, it did not take long before it became clear that Turkey was not the only EU member that would be affected by the presence of such ships. Turkey, for example, has sent ships to Turkey to help with the search and rescue of Syrian refugees. But it has also sent a message to other EU members, including the United States, to warn them to stay out of Turkey's territorial waters. According to the German Foreign Ministry, Turkish ships have also been sent to Turkish waters to search for refugees fleeing the war in Syria. German officials said they were also sending ships and aircraft to Greece and Turkey. They also said that they would send a team of naval experts to Cyprus to assess the situation there. There, they said, \"the ships will be able to provide the necessary intelligence and intelligence to assist the Greek and Turkish authorities in their efforts to prevent the spread of terrorism.\" The ships are expected to arrive in Cyprus on Friday, according to German news agency dpa. In the meantime, Germany's defense ministry said it would continue to cooperate with Turkish naval forces to try to find the smugglers, as well as to ensure that Turkish vessels were not being used as weapons of mass destruction. At the same time, German defense minister Sigmar Gabriel said Germany was also working closely with Ankara on the issue of how to deal with smugglers who are trying to smuggle people into the country illegally. Gabriel told DW: \"I think we have a lot of work ahead of us. We have to do to make sure that we are doing the right thing and we will do that. I think it's a very good thing for our country and for Europe.\" In addition, he added, there are also plans to send troops to Syria, where the Syrian army is fighting alongside Turkish troops in an attempt to clear the way for Syrian rebels to cross the border into Turkish territory. This is an important step for Germany to take, because it will give Turkey a chance to counter the threat posed by Turkish forces. For the time being, I don't know what the future holds for Ankara, but I do know that there is a long way to go in order to get to this point. If Turkey does not want to be involved in this kind of conflict, then I'm not sure what we can do about it. That's not to say that Ankara won't do anything to stop it from happening. As I've said before, this is not an easy task. You can't be too careful what you do with your own country. And that's exactly what Turkey is doing. What we're doing is very, very important. Let's be clear: We're not just talking about Turkey - we've got to talk about the problem of smuggling, we need to address it, too. So, let's talk a little bit more about what's going on here. First of all, what is happening in Turkey right now is how Turkey will respond to a situation like this. How will Turkey respond? What is Turkey doing? How can Turkey react? Is it react to that? The Turkish government has already responded to Erdogan's threats to attack Turkey with a military operation? And what are the chances of that happening? It's too early to tell, of course. Erdogan has said he will not allow it to happen. Meanwhile, Erdogan, who is currently in power, is also not giving up on his country's future. His government is already looking for a way out. Last week, Turkey announced that he would step down from his position as the head of NATO. On Thursday, President Erdogan told me he was stepping down as a member of his government. Then, on Wednesday, a Turkish military spokesman said Erdogan will take over the task of dealing with this issue. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his Turkish counterpart Recep Erdogan have already taken a step back and let Erdogan do the job of taking care of Erdogan. Why is Erdogan not doing it?"

        "target": "Opinion: The pope's impossible mission in Mexico Pope Francis's trip to Mexico is a dangerous mission - a diplomatic as well as political balancing act, one that brings with it enormous expectations. Francis won't be able to meet them, says DW's Astrid Prange. Dead prisoners, disappearing students, refugees shot dead and murdered priests. Mexico has lived through one violent episode after the other. The mood in the nation is explosive. And now this: just a day before the pope is set to arrive, more than 50 people died in the largest prison revolt in the country's history. What meaning does the pope's presence hold on such an occasion? Only one thing is certain: Francis won't be able to resolve the problems of the world's second largest Catholic nation in just a five-day trip. The unrealistic demands placed on him are not something he can fill. Yet the pope carries with him an important message: you don't have to love your enemies but you do need to speak with them. And he's living the example himself by meeting with the Russian Orthodox Patriarch Kirill on a stopover in Cuba on his way to Mexico. Cuba all over again It's sensational! Bannings and mutual ex-communications are ancient history. Nearly a millennium after the split, the head of the Roman Catholic Church and the head of the Russian Orthodox Church are speaking to each other. It's not as if the two will become friends - their positions are far too different. Yet their centuries-old enmity feels out of place and in view of the massive worldwide persecution of Christians, almost unchristian. And both of these church leaders know this. In Mexico, efforts to stem the polarizing forces at play in society have not been successful. The extreme differences between rich and poor are dividing Mexican society. President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto has prioritized economic growth over dialogue with his critics - a group which includes students as well as teachers and union members who regularly protest against government policies. They demand an end to lawlessness and corruption. The presumed murder of 43 teaching students in Iguala in September 2014, a crime which remains unsolved, stands as a symbol of the lawlessness sweeping Mexico. The recent mutiny in a Monterrey jail serves as further proof of the country's shortcomings in regard to human rights and the rule of law. With a visit to Ciudad Juarez and the largest prison in Mexico, Francis will only make that deficiency more transparent. Even the pope of peace has enemies. The route he's chosen to take on his travels through the country has displeased the staunchly Catholic president. A meeting with the relatives of the Iguala victims is therefore hush-hush and participation in a holy mass remains secret. Considering the tense situation in the country, it's still possible that the pope's route will change once again. The church in the pillory Even within his own church, Francis has met with opposition. A meeting he requested with victims from the church's abuse scandal will not take place - a bitter disappointment for many former seminarians who were abused by Marcial Maciel, the founder of the Legion of Christ, and members of his order. It's just one example of how impunity continues even within the church itself. None of the perpetrators have yet to answer for their crimes in court. It appears as though the pope has accomplished more on the world stage than he has brought on reforms to the Vatican. Despite the revolutionary coming together of Cuba and the US and the revolutionary meeting with Patriarch Kirill, the revolution in Rome has yet to materialize. Do you have something to say? Add your comments below. The thread to this editorial closes in 24 hours.",
        "generated_story": "Pope Francis's impossible mission in Mexico robs him of his papacy Pope Francis has been accused of failing to deliver a message to Mexico's Roman Catholic Church. The Vatican has denied the accusations, saying the pope's mission to the country was \"impossible\" and that it was impossible for him to receive a letter from the Russian Orthodox Church, the Vatican said on Sunday. \"It is impossible,\" Francis said in an interview with DW, adding that he had \"no idea\" whether he would receive the letter, which was sent to him by Russian Patriarch Kirill. Francis, however, said he did not know what to expect. He also said that \"it is not possible for a pope to travel to a country where he doesn't have the authority to do so.\" \"I don't know if he will be able to get there, but I think he is going to have a difficult time getting there,\" he said, referring to his country's capital, Ciudad Juarez, in the southern Mexican state of Monterrey. In the past, Francis had traveled to several other countries, including Mexico and the United States, to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin and his wife, Empress Maria Theresa. On Sunday, he was due to return to Rome for the first time since taking office in January. But he didn't get the chance. Instead, his trip was delayed by a few days because of a lack of funds. His first stop was in Rome, where his daughter, Marcial Maciel, was born. Since then he's been traveling to other parts of the world, mainly in Europe and Asia. During his first visit to Italy in 2015, Pope Benedict XVI visited the city of Rome and met with the pontiff's wife and two young children. They had been expecting a visit from him, and were surprised to learn that the visit was not to be granted. It was instead a chance for Francis to give a speech on the importance of family and community, as well as the need to strengthen ties with his family, friends and colleagues in his native Rome. Pope John Paul II has also been visiting Rome in recent weeks, according to an Italian newspaper, \"The New York Times.\" The pope is expected to visit Rome later this month, when he meets with President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, who is also visiting the Holy See. However, it is unclear whether the trip will take place at all. According to one Vatican official, there is no guarantee that Francis will receive his letter. Another official told DW that there would be an invitation to attend the meeting. Other Vatican officials told the newspaper that they were not aware of Francis' visit, though they had not been informed of it at the time of publication. This is the second Vatican visit in less than a year. Last year, President Barack Obama visited Mexico in December, a trip that was criticized by many as an attempt to undermine the Pope's credibility as a papal authority. That was followed by criticism from many in Latin America, particularly from Russia and China. Many of those who have been critical of him have said it would not be a good idea to send Francis on his visit. Some have even suggested he should not go. Others have called for his resignation. One Vatican source said Francis should be allowed to stay on as pontifical spokesman, even if it means he has to resign from his post as pope, because he does not want to take the position of head of state. Meanwhile, others have expressed concern about the situation in Russia. Russia, for example, has expressed its concern over the possibility of sending a delegation of Russian bishops to Moscow. Moscow, meanwhile, is considering sending an envoy to Washington, D.C. to discuss the matter. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has said Moscow is \"very interested in meeting with Francis.\" Russia's foreign minister, Maria Zakharova, also a Russian diplomat, told Reuters that Moscow has not yet decided whether it will send an official delegation. Poland's Foreign Ministry has already sent a representative to Berlin. Ukraine's ambassador, Astrid Prange, says that Russia is a close ally of Putin's government. Reuters/AFP/File (Reuters, AP, dpa, AFP, Reuters)Russia: Russia: Moscow: The Russian government has accused Russia of meddling in Ukraine, Iran, Syria and Iran. Putin: \"Russia is trying to influence the outcome of this election,\" the Kremlin's spokesman said. Foreign ministry spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia has rejected the idea of an election. Kremlin: Russian diplomats have also criticized the move, accusing Moscow of interfering with elections in a bid to prevent a referendum on whether Russia will accept the results of its election in November. Both Moscow and Tehran have denied any involvement in any way. Iran: Reuters reported on Friday that Russian officials have not received a formal invitation for talks with Moscow's president, Sergey Lavrov, or any other Russian delegation in Moscow on Thursday. Tehran: Foreign diplomats are also considering a request for an inquiry. Washington: Washington has called on Moscow to investigate the issue of interference in this week."

President Obama vowed to nominate a successor 'in due time,' despite political opposition. The 79-year old justice died in his sleep, presumably of natural causes, local media reported on Saturday. Scalia was visiting Texas for a hunting trip, and his body was discovered after he failed to appear for breakfast in the resort where he was staying. US President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama extended \"their deepest condolences to Justice Scalia's family,\" White House deputy spokesman Eric Schultz said. Texas Governor Greg Abbott described the conservative justice as a \"man of God, a patriot and an unwavering defender of the written Constitution and the rule of law.\" \"He was the solid rock who turned away so many attempts to depart from and distort the Constitution. His fierce loyalty to the Constitution set an unmatched example, not just for judges and lawyers, but for all Americans,\" Abbot said. Battle for the empty seat His passing is likely to open a new political front between President Barack Obama and the Republican Party, as Scalia's replacement could shift the composition of the court towards a more liberal persuasion. Several Republican lawmakers have already urged Obama to leave the decision to the next president who will be voted in later this year. \"The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court justice,\" Senate Republican majority leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement, referring to the upcoming November general election. \"Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president,\" McConnell concluded. President Obama, however, said he would fulfill his constitutional duty and nominate Scalia's successor \"in due time.\" \"These are responsibilities I take seriously, and so should everyone. They are bigger than any one party,\" he said. Decades of controversy Scalia joined the Supreme Court in 1986, becoming the first Italian-American to serve in the top judicial body. He was nominated by US President Ronald Reagan. Throughout his long carrier, Scalia voted in favor of privacy and protecting defendants' rights, but also against legalizing abortion, same-sex marriage and gun control. He also drew public attention for his theatrical flair and sharpness of tongue, as well as his alleged unwillingness to compromise. In June last year, the nine-person Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage with a five-to-four vote. Scalia, who was in the minority, commented he would \"hide my head in a bag\" if his own name were associated with the decision. He also said that the majority opinion was \"couched in a style that is as pretentious as its content is egotistic.\" dj/jm (AP, Reuters, AFP, dpa)",
        "generated_story": "Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia dies in sleep in Texas The death of a conservative Supreme Court justice has rocked the Republican Party. The late conservative justice of the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit died in his sleep on Friday. His death was the latest in a series of deaths in the United States, including one in which he was a federal appeals court judge. In the wake of his death, conservative justices in both the Texas and Texas high courts have been mourning the loss of one of their own. Scalia's death came as a shock to the conservative legal establishment, which had been hoping for a quick resolution to its long-running legal battle with the federal government over the death penalty. \"We are deeply saddened by this tragic event,\" said Republican Senator Greg Abbott, who was on the court's bench at the time Scalia died. He was 80 years old when he died, according to his obituary, and his wife, Mary, said she was shocked to learn that he had died of an apparent heart attack while on vacation in Washington, D.C. On Friday, the Justice Department announced that it would appeal the case to a lower court, where it is expected to hear the appeal. It is the first time that a US court has ruled in favor of overturning a death sentence for someone convicted of murder. Justice Scalia, a Republican, was sentenced to life in prison for murder and attempted murder for his role as an advocate for abortion rights and the right to free speech. President Barack Obama has vowed to uphold the U.S. Constitution, saying it should be rewritten to protect the rights of all citizens, not just those who are not citizens. But he has also promised to amend the Constitution to make it more lenient for people who do not wish to have their rights infringed upon by the government. And he's not the only one who has done so. Just last week, President Donald Trump announced his intention to nominate a new justice to replace Scalia as the nation's highest court justice. Obama's announcement came just hours after his predecessor, Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), announced he would be stepping down from his Senate seat in order to take up the seat vacated by conservative Justice Anthony Kennedy (D-Kentucky). \"I think it's a very sad day for our country,\" Obama said in an interview with The Washington Post, adding that \"we are going to do everything we can to help the people of this country.\" The president also said he hoped that the Senate would pass a bill that would allow the president to appoint a replacement for Scalia to fill the vacancy left by Kennedy. Republicans have long been reluctant to back down on their stance on abortion, but they are now more than willing to step up their opposition to abortion. They have also been more open about their position on gay rights in recent weeks, as well as on immigration, immigration and immigration. Many Republicans in Congress, however, have said they will not allow abortion to be allowed in their states. Some have called for an end to gay marriage. Others have criticized the move, calling it a \"disgraceful move\" by President Trump. Republican lawmakers have repeatedly called on President Obama not to allow it to happen again. One of them, Texas' Republican Senate Majority Leader, John Cornyn, has said that abortion should not be considered an option for voters in states where abortion is legal. Other Republicans, meanwhile, say they want to see abortion legalized. Another Republican senator, Senator Ted Cruz, says abortion could be legalized in some states, too. Senator John McCain, R-Texas, voted against the bill last year. (AP, AFP, dpa, AP, Reuters) Senator Jeff Flake (r-Arizona) said the vote was \"not a good idea\" and said it was too early to say whether abortion would become a legal option. Senate Republicans are also considering a constitutional amendment to repeal the abortion ban. Meanwhile, Democrats are calling for more restrictions on abortions, particularly in rural states such as Texas, Arizona and New Mexico. A new bill would make abortion illegal in many states that have legalized the practice of abortion in public places. Abortion rights advocates say abortion will be a big issue for many Americans, especially in conservative states like Texas. That's the position that many Republicans hold on to, despite the fact that Roe v. Wade was overturned by a court decision in 1973. Democrats have accused the Obama administration of trying to limit abortion access to minors. Both Republicans and Democrats oppose abortion restrictions, though, while Democrats say the law is still in effect. Texas has a long way to go. If abortion becomes a law, abortion remains a top priority for Republicans. Lawmakers have already voted to legalize abortion across the country. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has called abortion a crime. Congress has already passed a similar bill in several states to prevent abortion nationwide. Democratic Senator Cory Booker (dpa) has backed abortion on Tuesday, citing concerns about the possibility of women being able to obtain a permit to carry a concealed carry permit. GOP lawmakers are still opposed to try to"

The 53-year-old will be leading Germany's second biggest lender. After successfully weathering the Great Recession, Commerzbank's board of directors appears to want to signal a continuation in its growth trend with Martin Zielke's appointment as the new CEO as of May 1. Outgoing head Martin Blessing announced last year he would not renew his contract. Zielke had previously been put in charge of implementing reforms in the company's private banking sector following the recession. His restructuring measures attracted 800,000 new customers to the bank and changed the image of the 146-year-old financial institution. The 53-year-old has an illustrious career across several German financial institutions to look back on, having started at the teller of a local branch in 1983. Zielke's crowning achievement The beleaguered German financial institution recorded a profit of more than a billion euros (more than $1.1 billion) last year. It was the first time in five years that Commerzbank had made such profitable gains, which it said would translate into paid dividends for shareholders. A good portion of the yields were achieved by a restructuring and expansion drive of Commerzbank's private banking arm under Zielke's leadership. However, some of that money will go to the German government, as it had to step in and rescue the bank in 2009 to the tune of 18 billion euros ($25 billion at the time) by chiefly acquiring more than 15 percent of the shares, effectively nationalizing part of Commerzbank's operations. ss/jlw (dpa, Reuters)",
        "generated_story": "CEO Martin Zielke to be Commerzbank's next CEO Martin Blessing is set to take over the German bank's board of directors. The German lender is expected to announce a new chief executive in the coming weeks. \"We are going to have a very difficult time,\" Martin B Blessing, the head of the country's largest bank, said in a statement on Thursday. He said he would be stepping down from his post as CEO to focus on his new role as chairman and CEO, which he said would help the bank cope with the Great Recession and the financial crisis. Bailout: \"I think we will be able to make the right decision,\" he told a news conference in Berlin, adding that he was \"very pleased with Martin's decision to step down as the company's CEO.\" He added that the board would look into the possibility of a merger between the two companies, but that it was too early to talk about a possible merger. In the meantime, he added, \"we will look at a number of other options.\" The bank is also looking into a potential merger with Deutsche Bank, in which the CEO will take on the role of chief financial officer for the first time since he took over in 2009. It is unclear whether the new CEO would have the experience of leading a bank that has been in financial trouble for years, or whether he will have more experience than he did in his previous role. Zilke, who was appointed CEO in 2010, will also be looking at the future of Germany's second-largest lender, Deutsche Boerse (DBK), which was founded in 1882. His appointment comes after a series of scandals that have led to the resignation of several senior executives, including the former CEO of Deutsche Telekom, as well as a string of high-profile scandals. One of those scandals was that of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's chancellor, Herbert DiNapoli, when she was in power for three years. That scandal, however, did not lead to a change of government. Instead, it led the Bundesbank to form a coalition government in Germany, a move that was seen by many as an attempt to prevent a repeat of last year's economic downturn. At the time of his appointment, Germany was the only country in Europe that had not experienced a recession since World War II, and it had been the case for a long time. But in recent years Germany has seen a resurgence in economic growth, with unemployment at an all-time low of 3.5 percent and a rise of 5.7 percent. This year, unemployment has risen to 4.6 percent, according to Deutsche BK (dpa) - the highest level since the beginning of 2008. Unemployment is still high at 7.8 percent - and unemployment is forecast to rise to 6.3 percent by the end of next year. Germany is one of Europe's fastest growing economies, behind only the United States in terms of population growth. And it's not just Germany that is struggling. There are other countries, too, that are struggling to recover from the recession, such as France and Italy. For example, Italy, where unemployment rose to 7 percent in 2008, is the number one country for which joblessness is highest, followed by Germany and France. France, Spain and Germany are also among the top five countries for job creation, while Italy and Spain are the second and third, respectively, after the U.S. and Britain. Both countries have experienced the worst recession in decades. Italy has also suffered from a severe economic crisis in its history. Europe, for instance, has experienced an economic slowdown, although the euro zone has suffered the most from its debt crisis, despite the fact that many of its citizens are still living in poverty. Spain, Greece and Portugal have also been hit by a prolonged recession. Greece is another country where the eurozone's biggest economy is suffering from high unemployment, though it is not the biggest contributor to economic weakness - but it still has a lot to lose. German President Francois Hollande, meanwhile, says he is optimistic about the prospects for economic recovery, saying that \"the economy will recover.\" \"The eurozone is doing very well,\" Hollande told the Financial Times in an interview last week. Hollande said the economy was doing well, even though the European Central Bank has not yet made any progress on its plans to cut its budget deficit. However, there is no doubt that Germany will continue to struggle to find a way out of this crisis and that will not be easy for Germany to achieve its goal of becoming a European powerhouse. On Thursday, Merkel said she would not rule out a deal with Germany. She said it would take \"a lot of time to reach a solution to this problem. I think that's a good thing,\" she said. Berlin is hoping to avoid a similar situation, she added. According to Reuters, this is unlikely to happen again this year - if it doesn't happen. If it does not happen, Europe is likely to remain in recession for at least the next few months. We are hoping that Europe will"

        "target": "A quarter of deaths caused by environmental degradation, says UN A new United Nations report warns that pollution and global warming are causing millions more deaths than conflicts. The UN's environment agency has called for an urgent roll-back on harmful substances and fossil fuels. In its report \"Healthy Environment, Health People,\" the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), the World Health Organization and several other environment organizations said that, in 2012, an estimated 12.6 million deaths were attributable to deteriorating environment conditions. The largest numbers of deaths took place in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific regions, followed by sub-Saharan Africa, where around a quarter of deaths were likely caused byair pollution, chemicals, climate change and a lack of access to sanitation. \"By depleting the ecological infrastructure of our planet and increasing our pollution footprint, we incur an ever-growing cost in terms of human health and well-being,\" said UNEP Executive Director Achim Steiner. He added that humanity's life support systems had been compromised by globalization and powerful economic interests. The report was released during UN climate talks in the German city of Bonn which are drawing up rules pertaining to the Paris agreement, which seeks to lower carbon emissions. The document suggested that several drivers were responsible for the threat to human health, including ecosystem disruption, climate change, inequality, unhealthy and wasteful lifestyles, along with unsustainable consumption and production. Worsening effects UNEP estimated that an extra 250,000 deaths could occur each year between 2030 and 2050 as a result of climate change, leading to malnutrition, malaria, diarrhea and heat stress. Between them air pollution and a lack of access to clean water and sanitation cause almost 8 million premature deaths each year. Environmental impacts are responsible for the deaths of more than one quarter of all children under the age of five, the report states. UNEP called for governments to act to remove harmful substances from working environments, reduce the use of carbon fuels and rely instead on renewable energy, and change lifestyles to allow a more sustainable use of the world's resources. The report also called for a bigger investment to protect the planet's natural ecosystem. UNEP predicted a further increase in emerging zoonotic diseases (spread between animals and humans), and called on developing countries, in particular, to prioritize prevention methods. \"Never before have so many animals been kept by so many people - and never before have so many opportunities existed for pathogens to pass through the biophysical environment and wild animals to livestock and people,\" the report warned.",

The World Health Organization (WHO) said in a statement on Thursday that the number of people who died from the effects of global warming rose to a quarter in the past five years. According to the organization's head Achim Steiner, the figure is \"more than twice as high\" as it was in 2007, when the WHO warned of a rise in greenhouse gas emissions. \"This is the highest level of human mortality since the 1970s,\" he said, adding that it had been \"increasingly difficult\" to prevent the spread of greenhouse gases. He added that \"we have to be very careful about what we do and how we treat the environment.\" \"We are not going to allow this to happen again. We will not be able to do that again,\" said Dr. Ailsen, who heads the U.N. Environment Programme in Bonn, Germany, which is based in Paris, France, and the United States, said on its website that there was a \"significant increase\" in deaths from climate-related pollution in recent years, including from wildfires and floods. It was the first time that a major environmental disaster had occurred in Europe since World War II. In the 1990s, around 1.5 million people died of heatstroke in Germany. Since then, it has been estimated that about one-third of all deaths were caused to people living in countries with high levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, according to WHO. This is a significant increase compared to previous years when CO2 emissions were the main cause of most deaths, but it is still not clear how much of this is due directly to human-caused pollution. And it's not just the weather that is causing the deaths. There is also the issue of pollution, as well as the lack of clean water in many countries, such as China, India, Japan and South Korea. Some of these deaths are linked to poor sanitation, while others are related to pollution from burning coal, oil and natural gas. These are the most common causes of death for people with chronic health problems, experts say. Experts say that in some cases, there is no way to know for sure how many people have died because of environmental pollution and whether or not they are being treated properly. That is, until you look at the situation in terms of what is happening in their own country. If you are a country, you have a lot of responsibility. You are responsible for your own health and for the health of your family, for example, because you do not want to live in an environment where you don't have access to clean drinking water or clean air.

        "target": "Opinion: Yet another crisis for Merkel A summery turquoise blazer and fresh makeup could not hide the fact that Angela Merkel was \"not amused.\" Now she is needed as a champion in the fight against populist forces, DW's Kay-Alexander Scholz writes. Britain-EU divorce proceedings will probably last about two years. Until then, the status quo must be maintained, German Chancellor Angela Merkel emphasized in her press statement. If she is no longer chancellor after the upcoming parliamentary elections in 2017, then others will have to live with the consequences of Brexit. But that is not what she is actually thinking. It is not coincidental that foreign ministers and government leaders are visiting Berlin in the coming days. They want to discuss how things will continue. Berlin, under Merkel's chancellorship, has become a center of power outside of Brussels. Difficult international politics The Brexit decision has disrupted Europe's equilibrium. Germany has lost an important ally on European issues related to economic growth and budgetary discipline. Now, France presumably will be the next to raise its voice against Maastricht Treaty criteria. If the Netherlands and Denmark also decide to leave the EU, Germany will become isolated, as Eastern Europe is not as tight with Germany as it once was. Poland now plays a key role for the Balkan nations and the Visegrad Group (Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic and Slovakia). And Poland is still annoyed about Merkel's refugee policy. What about Germany's populists? They're giddy with glee as they feel that their anti-establishment policies have been validated. They are teaching potential AfD (Alternative for Germany) voters a lesson: \"Here, have a look: it's possible. There is always an alternative. Vote for us!\" Those are exactly the words that protest voters want to hear. Germany's AfD has forged ties with other right-wing parties in Vienna, Paris, The Hague and London. They are all pursuing a \"European\" plan to gain power. The recent Austrian presidential election was significant, as the populist candidate lost by a very narrow margin; in fact, the final election results are still undecided as they are being contested. The Brexit vote was also triggered by populist powers. Domestically difficult Many populists believe that the stronger populism becomes - no matter where - the more advantages there would be for individual parties of their persuasion. Many would also like to see Donald Trump as US president. That is how AfD may become even stronger in Germany, which also means that political majorities would fluctuate even more. Will there be enough seats after the next election for a Christian Democrat and Green coalition, or will yet another grand coalition made up of Christian Democrats and Social Democrats be formed? Can Angela Merkel change course? Can she counter the trend with a new political model in Europe and Germany? Or do we stand on the edge of a new era, a \"political revolution,\" as the AfD calls it? Until now, Europe has survived attacks on its currency (euro crisis), the principle of peaceful coexistence (Crimea crisis) and its open borders policy (refugee crisis). Merkel deserves credit for defending these values, despite mistakes that have been made along the way. The outcome of the Brexit crisis is, however, still open. Have something to say? Add your comments below.",
        "generated_story": "Angela Merkel and the Brexit Crisis in Europe Angela Merkel's Alternative for Germany (AfD) is the latest political party to come to the fore in Germany. The AfD is a far-right party that opposes the European Union's withdrawal from the bloc. It is an anti-immigrant party, which has been in power for more than a decade. Its main focus is on Europe, but it is not just Europe. In the past few years, it has become a party of the left, the right, and even the center-left. But in the last few months, that has changed. For the first time in a long time, Merkel has made it clear that she does not want the EU to leave. She has also made the case that Europe's future is dependent on the ability of other countries to make their own decisions. \"We are not going to give up,\" Merkel said in an interview with DW, referring to her party's support for Brexit. Merkel, however, has said she will not allow it to happen again. On the other hand, she has not ruled out the possibility of an EU exit, saying she would not be able to do so without the support of her own party. Germany's Social Democrats (SPD), meanwhile, have called on Merkel to step down from her post as Chancellor. They have also called for a referendum on EU membership, a move that would allow Germany to join the 28-nation bloc of 28 EU countries, including the United States, Britain and France, to enter the single market. That would mean that Germany would have to accept the terms of a new EU member state, rather than the current one. This would be a huge step for the SPD, who have long been a Eurosceptic party with a strong image of Germany as a Europe-first country. And it would also be an important step toward a future Germany that is closer to Europe than Germany is to itself. German Chancellor Merkel is facing the prospect of losing her parliamentary majority in parliament if she doesn't win a majority of seats in next year's European Parliament elections. If she loses her majority, Germany will be left without a single member of parliament, as it was in 2015, when she was first elected to parliament. Her party is currently in opposition, with the Greens and Greens as the main opposition parties. However, in recent weeks, they have made a number of changes to their platform. One of them is that they are calling for an end to austerity and a return to a \"one-party state\" government. Another is calling on voters to vote in favor of \"austerity.\" The other is called the Green Party (Green Party) and other parties to take a stand against austerity measures, such as reducing taxes and increasing the minimum wage. Both parties have said they want to reduce taxes, increase spending on public services and create jobs for people who are already working in low-wage jobs. At the same time they say they would like to see the economy grow and invest in infrastructure and infrastructure. There is no doubt that this will lead to an economic recovery for all of Europe as well as for many other European countries. So far, so good. As far as I'm concerned, this is just the beginning of that. I don't think there is much to say about the future of German politics. You can read more about this in DW's German edition, here.

And what are you doing with your life? Why should you do it? I'd be happy to hear that the German parliament will decide the outcome of your vote on this issue, because it could be very important for us to have an open debate and decide what we're doing? We're not the only one who wants to talk about that, right? That's going forward"

        "generated_story": "Lockdown lifted after active shooter incident at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland US President Barack Obama has lifted a lockdown at the US military base at Camp Springs, Maryland, after an active-shooter incident on Friday. Officials said the lockdown was lifted in response to the incident, which took place on the second day of the military's annual spring break. The lockdown came after a gunman opened fire on US troops stationed in the area. US Defense Secretary Joe Biden said in a statement that he had been briefed by the Pentagon about the situation. \"We have been informed that there is no threat to our national security,\" he said, adding that \"we will not allow any further escalation of hostilities.\" US officials said they were not aware of any specific threat, but that they had no reason to believe it was an isolated incident. They added that no one was injured, and that the base was not at risk of being shut down for the time being. There were no reports of injuries, however, the statement said. A spokesman for US Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis said that military personnel were being asked to leave the site immediately after the shooting. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said there was no indication of an imminent threat from the attacker, who is believed to be a US Army veteran. Obama said he was \"very pleased\" with the response from military officials, including the commander of US forces in Afghanistan, as well as the president himself. However, he did not rule out the possibility that an attack could take place, Kirby added, saying that it would not be the first time that such an incident had taken place at a military facility. In the past, there has been a series of incidents at military bases in Europe and the Middle East. One of them involved a suicide bomber who was shot and killed by US soldiers, according to Kirby. Another was wounded by a stray bullet that hit a Humvee, killing at least one person. Both were taken to a nearby hospital, where they later died. More than a dozen other people were injured in that incident and more than 30 others were wounded. At least three of those injured were in critical condition, while the other two were treated for minor injuries. According to reports, one soldier was killed and another was critically wounded in an apparent attack by an unknown assailant. It is not clear how many soldiers were killed or wounded, nor is it clear if the attack was related to an ongoing military operation. President Obama, in his first address to Congress since taking office in January 2009, called on Congress to take action to prevent a repeat of last year's deadly attack. He also called for an end to military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria. On Friday, Obama issued an emergency statement on his visit to Washington, D.C. to reassure the American people, calling on them to remain vigilant and to protect themselves and their families from further attacks. But he also stressed the importance of keeping their safety and security in mind when it comes to their own safety. His visit came just days after President Donald Trump was sworn in as US commander in chief. As he left the White House, Vice President Biden told reporters he would be visiting Washington on Saturday, \"I will be in Washington for a few days.\" The president also spoke to reporters at his weekly press conference, a day after his inauguration, about what he thought was a \"good day for our country.\" \"It's a good day to visit Washington,\" said Biden, referring to his trip to Iraq and Afghanistan. I'm glad to see you, Joe, because I think it's important to remember that we have a lot of people who are very close to you. You're welcome to come visit. We're going to get to know you and your family very well. Thank you for your support.

It is based on a series of short stories and essays by the artist and publisher of the collection. In the first issue, he describes his collection as a \"collection of stories, essays, photographs and photographs.\" It was published in the spring of 2014 and was released in October of that year. \"It's a collection,\" he says, \"of stories of people who have gone through a difficult time in their lives. I think it's very important that we get to the bottom of these stories.\" The book's cover features a picture of a woman in a bathing suit and a bottle of water, with the words \"no detox water\" written on the back. He describes the book as \"a collection about people's lives and their experiences in life,\" adding that it is \"the story of one man, one woman, and one person's journey through life.\" In addition, it features photographs of women in bathing suits and men in dresses and skirts, as well as pictures of men and women dressed in black and white. There is also a story about a young woman who was raped by a man she met at the age of 14. She is now married and has three children. Her husband, Klaus, is the author of several books, including one about women's rights and the rights to abortion. Klaus has also written a book about the subject, which he hopes will be translated into English and be used as an educational tool for young people to learn about abortion and contraception. His work has been published by The New York Times, The Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal and other news outlets in addition to \"The New Yorker\" and \"New York Magazine.\" He also has published several other books on abortion, contraception and human rights, among other topics. One of those books is called \"Trouble with Water,\" which is about water and how to get it out of your body. Other books are available for purchase in English, Spanish, German, French, Italian and Spanish. Another book is titled \"Water with a Purpose,\" in which the story is told from the point of view of someone who has never had sex before and who wants to have sex again. And another is a work of art, written by an artist who lives in France and Germany. This book has a number of illustrations by Klaus and his wife, who are both artists and publishers. Read more: \"I'm a water lover, but I don't know what I'm going to do with water,\" says Klaus in an interview with The Times. What I do know is that I have a lot of respect for Klaus's work and what he's doing with it. But I also think that he has done a good job of making it a very good work for the people he works with. That's not to say he doesn't have an interest in water. If he does, I'd like to be able to tell you more about it, because I've never seen anything like it before. You can read the whole thing in French and English. Here's one of my favorite things about this book: It's called 'Water With A Purpose' and it tells you about how water can be a beautiful thing to drink and why water is so important to you. When you're thirsty, you can drink water from a cup and then you have to take a shower and go to bed. Sometimes you just want to soak up the water in order to make it better for yourself and your family. Water is not the only thing that matters in your life. So, that's what we're doing. We're trying to figure out how we can make a difference in this world. How do we do it? Well, let's try to find out. Let's start by looking at what's going on in our own lives, right now. First, we need to look at all the things that are happening in my life, so we'll see what the future holds for us. After all, this is just the beginning of something that will make you feel good about yourself. Right now, there are so many things to think about. For example, water has become so much more important than water - and that is water! And then there's the fact that water isn't just water that you drink - it has to come out, too - but it can also help you get water to your skin. Just ask your friends and family and have fun. Then you've got to decide whether or not you want it to stay cool, or if you really want something to go out and drink. Or, what do you think is best for you? You know, how can you do that? We've been drinking water? What are the best thing you could do? I can't think of anything that would be good for your own life? Let me tell me what you'd rather you know that the world is going through this water"

        "target": "Rethinking the term 'honor killing' The murder of 28-year-old Samia Shahid comes less than two weeks after Qandeel Baloch was killed by her brother. The media was quick to report them as \"honor killings.\" We have to rethink that term, writes Gouri Sharma. When news broke that Samia Shahid, a British-Pakistani woman, had been found dead while visiting relatives in Pakistan at the end of July, mainstream media outlets were quick to report it as an honor killing. It was the second time in two weeks that the media had reported a killing of a woman this way - the first being the murder of Pakistani social media star Qandeel Baloch. There are strong similarities between the cases. Both were murdered in places where they would have felt they were at their safest - in their family homes. It's likely they knew their killers - in Baloch's case, her brother has admitted to strangling her, and Shahid's father and cousin have already been questioned. And as more reports emerge about Shahid's death, it's clear that both were killed because they didn't behave in a way deemed acceptable in a conservative, patriarchal society. 'Deeply offensive' term The debate around terminology in \"honor killings\" isn't new, and after Baloch's murder there were members of the media - such as ABC Australia journalist Juanita Phillips - who decided against using the term, calling it \"deeply offensive\" and referring to it as a \"family killing\" instead. And there are outlets, like the Guardian, that already use inverted commas with the word honor. But some commentators argue that more needs to happen if media consumers are to gain a better understanding of the problem. \"I think an important step for the media would be to refuse to give weight to the term 'honor crimes,'\" said UK-based freelance journalist Shehnaz Khan. \"While it is imperative to highlight that these crimes and murders stem from the roots of misogyny and therefore a false sense of 'honor,' there is absolutely nothing but'shame' within them, as murder is nothing but dishonorable.\" \"The word 'honor' can sometimes carry an almost positive connotation that we are inclined to automatically accept just because it's not happening to us, when the reality is, this a huge problem affecting thousands of girls and women across the world,\" she added. Naming the issue But this isn't a view shared by all journalists. Ruby Hamad, a writer at Australia's Daily Life newspaper, said that the first step in dealing with the issue is naming it. \"There are some deeply patriarchal societies that still limit women's freedom according to old tribal concepts of honor, where, unfairly, the behavior of women reflect on their entire family,\" Hamad said. \"By naming these 'honor killings,' we are acknowledging the role that this misogynistic concept of honor plays, not only in the murders themselves but in these entire societies, and how it entraps both men and women.\" Through the eyes of the perpetrator? There are other issues with the term though. Some have argued that by framing it as such, media outlets are showing the crime through the eyes of the perpetrator - and not through the victim - as they should. And with such cases regularly hitting the headlines, framing is important. The United Nations estimates that around 5,000 women - predominantly from Asia and the Middle East - are killed annually in honor-related crimes, a figure that women's advocacy groups say is closer to 20,000 worldwide. This raises an important cultural element for the media to consider - how far does the term play into cultural stereotypes? \"When honor is considered the most important thing in life, then all family members become expendable,\" Hamad said. \"The collective outweighs the rights of the individual. Does this feed into cultural stereotypes? Perhaps. But that doesn't mean we should pretend that this cultural context isn't there.\" Looking for answers - and alternatives There have been many alternatives put forward by women's advocacy groups, including hate crime, misogynistic murder, femicide and shame killings. But which one should we pick? Al Jazeera for one has decided which one they won't use. \"We are always updating our style guidelines to convey a deeper and more authentic understanding of world affairs. Recent events in Pakistan ignited a healthy debate in Al Jazeera on the term 'honor killings' in particular. Our editors are currently studying alternatives to the term, but'misogynistic murder' is not one of them,\" said an Al Jazeera spokesperson. Terminology in the media matters, and for murders as complex as these, it's the media's responsibility to find a name that better fits the crime. Only then will it become easier to work towards a solution.",
        "generated_story": "Rethinking Honor Killings: A Cultural Perspective A cultural perspective on the death penalty in Pakistan has been published by the Guardian. It is the first book in a series of essays by author and journalist Samia Shahid. The book is published in the United States, Australia and New Zealand, and is set to be released on Monday. In it, the author, journalist and author of the book, \"Honor Killers,\" examines the role of honor killings in Pakistani society. Shehnaz Khan, a journalist based in London, has written a book about the subject, which she calls \"honor killings.\" The author has also written an essay for the New York Times, The Guardian and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). The essay is based on her experiences as a victim of honour killings, including the murder of her mother and sister by a Pakistani soldier. Her father, Qandeel Baloch, was shot to death in his home town of Lahore in 1947. He was sentenced to life in prison for killing his wife and three children. His mother, who was also killed in action, is now in jail for her role in her father's death. \"I think it's a very sad day for Pakistan,\" she told the newspaper, adding that she and her husband had been killed by Pakistani soldiers during the 1980s and 1990s, when they were in their early 20s. At the time of his death, she was the only Pakistani to have survived. Since then she has lived in exile in Australia, where she worked as an interpreter and translator for a number of years. Now she lives in England and Wales, with her family and friends, but she is also a member of a group of Pakistani women's rights activists who have campaigned against the killing of their own sons and daughters. As a result, they have been accused of killing their sons, daughters and grandchildren. They have also been convicted of murder, rape and attempted murder. Read more: Pakistan: What's the difference between honor killing and Honor Killing? Read More: Honor killing: How to stop it from happening in your own country Honor killings have become so commonplace that it has become a taboo subject in our society, even in countries like India, China, India and Pakistan. This is not a new concept, however, as it is part of Pakistan's tradition to protect the rights of people who are killed for their beliefs. According to the report, more than 1,000 people have died in honor-killing cases since the end of World War II. Many of these killings took place between the ages of 14 and 30. Most of them were committed by men who were killed at the hands of soldiers, police and civilians. Some of those killed were women, while others were men of different ages and ethnicities, according to a report from the Pakistani newspaper \"The Guardian\" (AP) in 2002. More than a century later, there are still many more victims of war crimes, such as the massacre of children in Karachi, in which hundreds of thousands of young people are murdered every year. There is no doubt that the perpetrators of such killings are the same as those who committed the murders of innocent people. But the fact that they are so often killed is a fact of life that has not been fully understood by many of us. For example, many people in India have never been able to understand the meaning of death and have no idea why they killed their loved ones. That's because they didn't know what to do with their lives, or what they had done to them. And that's not the point of this book at all. What is it? What do you think? Is there a way to make a difference? I don't think so. I think there is one way or another. If you want to know, you have to ask yourself that, if you are a Muslim, then go to Wikipedia and read the article. You can read more about it here, here and here. Here is what I have written about in this article: \"Why do we have honor murders? Why are we so obsessed with honour killing our own children?\" The article also discusses the issue of respect for our country's history and why we should be so careful not to glorify the killings of innocents. Why is this so important? The answer is simple: We have a lot to learn from our history. We are all human. Our history is very important to us and we are very fortunate that we live in an environment where we do not have the opportunity to live a normal life. So, let me tell you what we think is important. Let's start with respect to honor our ancestors. Do you agree with me? Tell me what you would do? Let me know if I'm wrong. Then let's talk to your friends and family. Tell them about your family, tell them what happened to you, because you will be the one who killed your parents. How can you be respectful of your country and your culture? And why should you do that? You will find out of course,"

        "target": "A Brief History of the Seaside Holiday These days, millions take seaside holidays for granted as one of life's pleasures. But 200 years ago, a dip in the sea was more a test of courage. Hardly anyone could swim. As late as the 18th century, many Europeans still thought of the sea as the realm of Satan: storm-tossed and inhabited by terrifying monsters. \"Unlike the mountains, the coasts were terra incognita as a holiday spot,\" says Manfred B\u00e4tje, director of the Bade-Museum on the North Sea island of Norderney. Anyone who set foot in the water was \"stepping into the unknown\". Brighton showed the way That only began to change after the British aristocracy discovered the healing power of salt water. As early as 1780, Brighton, England's biggest and oldest seaside resort, was a bustling spa. Philosopher and physicist Georg Christoph Lichtenberg (1742-1799) of G\u00f6ttingen gave Germans the starting signal with his 1793 essay \"Why doesn't Germany have any large public seaside resorts?\" In it, he called for the creation of a resort in Cuxhaven on the North Sea. He received support from the most notable German physician of the time, the Prussian king's court physician, Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland. But things turned out somewhat differently. Germany's first seaside resort was indeed built in September, 1793, but in Heiligendamm on the Baltic Sea. Four years later, permission was granted for construction of Germany's first resort on the North Sea, on Norderney. \"For the first bathing season on July and August of 1800, only around 250 guests turned up. Now, the nearly 6000 residents host a good 530,000 bathers annually, plus around 230,000 day-trippers,\" B\u00e4tje reels off the figures. Romanticist inspiration In the 19th century, the landscapes of Caspar David Friedrich, such as his famous Chalk Cliffs on R\u00fcgen (1818), gave seaside holidays added impetus. From then on, the sea was no longer a voracious beast. From the shore, the cultivated, modern European contemplated the vast melancholy of the deep. \"The calm sea became an embodiment of unspecified yearning, the waves an expression of vitality and dynamism,\" soliloquizes museum director B\u00e4tje. But the journey to the sea long remained an arduous, time-consuming one. It took the mail coach a good thirty hours to cover the distance from Hamburg to the North Frisian town of Aurich over bumpy, muddy roads. The express cab from Bremen only took about 16 hours to reach the East Frisian town of Norden - including six changes of horses along the way. \"It wasn't comfortable,\" explains B\u00e4tje. Not until the introduction of seaside tourist steamers out of Hamburg and Bremen to the islands and the expansion of the railways did the journey become easier. Strict bathing rules At first, it was primarily the well-to-do bourgeois and nobility who were able to afford a seaside holiday. Victorian-era society is known for its extreme prudishness, and the beach was not exempt. Bathing machines were essentially changing cabins on wheels that could be rolled into the surf. The sexes were kept strictly separated. Wet swimsuits could not be allowed to cling, thus revealing the body's contours. Women sported baggy flannel garments with bloomers underneath that swiftly became waterlogged to where the bather was risking her life. Hardly anyone really knew how to swim anyway. \"Most bathers wouldn't stay in the water any more than two minutes, often just seconds at a time. The English had a rule: 'Three dips and out',\" quips archivist Manfred B\u00e4tje, whose Bade-Museum is housed in a building for a former wave pool, just a few steps from Norderney's Weststrand, where, during the summer months, vacationers sunbathe in wicker beach chairs and on blankets, cooled by a salty sea breeze. Sunbathing first came in style early in the 20th century, and the first true swimsuits were produced in the United States. \"Starting in 1919, today's bathing culture gradually began to take shape,\" B\u00e4tje looks back. At the same time, ideals of beauty were in flux - such as the attitude towards tan skin, which had long been regarded as a mark of farmers and manual laborers. B\u00e4tje: \"People were still cultivating their genteel pallors.\" Water, Waves, Wellness Today, the sun worshipers are the devout masses, and seaside holidays are their pilgrimages. The North Sea resorts alone count some 12.9 million overnight stays annually. Health is once again a primary concern: sea air, sea water, sea salts and the algaes and mud used in",
        "generated_story": "A Brief History of the Seaside Holiday in Germany Germany's Bade-Museum in Norderney, Germany, has published a brief history of a seaside holiday in the German Alps. It is a collection of pictures, essays and historical accounts. The exhibition, entitled \"The Seaside Holiday,\" is set to be released on Thursday. In it, the exhibition will feature a selection of photographs taken during the holiday, as well as an exhibition on the sea-side holiday. \"This is the first time I have ever seen a picture of an ocean holiday,\" says Manfred B\u00e4tje, who was born in Bremen and grew up in Brighton, England. He was a child when he was in his mid-twenties, and his father was also a sailor. His father died in a shipwreck, but his mother was the only one who survived. After the ship sank, he returned to his family home in northern England, where he spent the rest of his life as a young man. At the time, his parents were still living in England and he had been studying at the University of Groningen. Now he lives in Hamburg, a city he has spent his entire life in, with his wife and two children. They have been married for almost 30 years. Their first child, Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland, is now 13 years old and they have two sons, Caspar David Friedrich and Christian Friedrich. Both of them are now in their early 20s and have lived in Berlin for a number of years, before moving to Hamburg and then to the city of Cuxhaven. During their time together, they spent a lot of time with their families and had a good time. But they also had their own families, which they did not have the opportunity to have. And they had to make sacrifices for their children and grandchildren. That's why they were able to spend so much time at home. For the last few years they've had the chance to visit their parents, their grandparents and their extended extended family. This is their first visit to Germany since the end of World War II, when they visited their father's house in Humboldt, near the Baltic Sea. There were also visits from relatives, friends, relatives and friends who came to see them. Some of their relatives were even invited to stay with them, while others stayed at their home, in order to get a taste of what life was like in those days. Many of these visits, however, were not as memorable as they might have seemed. One of those trips was when the Germans visited the Chalk Cliffs in North Rhine-Westphalia in August 1945. A group of German seamen from the nearby town of Aurich were among those who stayed in town for the holidays. When they returned, there were only a handful of tourists, many of whom had never been to a German holiday before. These were the ones who were staying at a nearby hotel. As a result, it was very difficult for them to find a place to relax and relax. On the other hand, this was not the case for many Germans who had come to enjoy the seashore holiday last year. Instead of spending the summer holidays alone, some had gone to their homes and spent their summers there. However, that was only because they didn't have enough time to do so. Last year, thousands of people came out to celebrate the Christmas holiday with relatives or friends. More than 100,000 people were expected to attend the festivities, according to German newspaper Der Spiegel. Most were unable to leave the hotel, despite the fact that the weather was so warm and sunny. Only a few were allowed to come in. According to local news reports, more than 1,500 people had arrived from other countries, including Germany and the United States, to take part in this year's festivities. Among them were a couple of young men from Germany who went on a trip to Denmark and Denmark. Another was an elderly couple from Hamburg who lived there for several years and were married to an Austrian couple. While many had returned from their honeymoon, others had already returned home for Christmas, leaving the couple to raise their kids. Others had stayed to help their family, or to go to school and study abroad. German tourism is one of many factors that have made the trip a success for German tourists. Germany has a long tradition of welcoming tourists to its shores. Germans have always been a great tourist destination, especially in recent years when it comes to visiting the coast of Germany. From the beginning, these tourists were welcomed with open arms and a sense of community. Since then, people have come from all over the world to experience the sights and sounds of Europe. You can see how many people are visiting Germany every year and how much they are enjoying the country. I think that's a big part of that is because of all the people who are here. So, I'm glad that they came here, because it's such a wonderful time for us. We're glad they're all of"

The 71-year old can now leave the country for medical treatment. Brazilian judge Juliana Leal de Melo - who serves on a court overseeing amateur and professional sports - authorized the release of Hickey's passport upon payment of 1.5 million real ($435,000) bail. Hickey could now have medical treatment, the Rio state court system said in a statement. Reported to have a heart condition, Hickey was arrested three months ago during the Rio de Janeiro Olympics on ticket scalping charges. He is awaiting trial, though has not been imprisoned. Hickey has denied any wrongdoing. He is one of 10 people facing charges of ticket scalping, conspiracy and ambush marketing related to the Olympics. Hickey said he would fight \"each and every one\u201d of the Rio Games ticket-touting charges he faces. Hickey, who was also the head of the Olympic Council of Ireland, was released from custody last month, but must remain in Brazil until the case is heard. \"For clarity, I am not under house arrest as, like with so many things with this case, has been misreported by the media,\u201d Hickey said in a statement on Monday. Hickey was arrested on 10 August at a luxury beachfront hotel during the games.

        "generated_story": "Olympic Council of Ireland's Patrick Hickey freed on bail in Rio de Janeiro Olympic council member has been freed after being released from prison in Brazil. The Dublin-born Irish Olympic Council member was freed from jail on Friday after a two-week jail term. He was released on a bail of $1.5 million, the European Olympic Committee (EOC) said in a statement, adding that he had been released \"on bail.\" The EOC said it was not aware of the bail conditions and that it had not yet decided whether to release him. \"We are not going to press charges against him because we don't want him to be extradited to the United States. We want to make sure that we are able to get him out of jail in the first place,\" it said. In addition, it added that the court had ordered the release of a number of Brazilian athletes, including Juliana Leal de Melo, who was convicted in absentia last year of failing to show up for the Rio Olympics. She was sentenced to three years in prison for her role in organizing the Olympic Games, which took place at Rio's Olympic Stadium in 2014. Her sentence was commuted to one year in jail, and she is due to appear in court in Tokyo on Monday, June 19, to face charges related to her alleged involvement in an attack on an Olympic torch-wielding Brazilian athlete. Prosecutors have said she was the victim of an act of terrorism committed by the Brazilian government in connection with the murder of her husband. A trial date has not been set yet, but the trial is expected to take place on June 21, according to a court filing. It is not known if she has a lawyer, or whether she will be allowed to appeal her conviction. Hickey, a former Olympic committee member, was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and is currently being held without bail. His bail was set at \u20ac1 million ($2.4 million) and he has pleaded not guilty to all charges. According to court documents, he faces up to five years behind bars if convicted of any crime. However, prosecutors have not ruled out the possibility that she could face a life sentence, as she had pleaded guilty earlier this year to an unrelated charge of attempting to commit a terrorist act. That would have been the second time in two years that a Brazilian Olympic commission had tried to extradite her to Rio. But the case against her was dismissed on appeal after she refused to cooperate with prosecutors, saying she did not have any evidence to prove her innocence. At the same time, she also denied any wrongdoing in relation to what she said was an attempt to cover up her actions. As a result, her lawyer has appealed for leniency in her case and has asked that her client be released immediately. If she does not face any charges, they will have to pay a fine of at least \u20ac500,000 ($1,500) for any additional costs. This is the third time she's been charged with a criminal offense and the fourth time the IOC has charged her with an offense. Since the Olympics began in 2002, Ireland has had to step up its efforts to protect the rights of athletes who have suffered from the loss of their Olympic rights. Ireland, however, has also been accused of being a victim in this case. For example, in its bid to prevent the use of excessive force against athletes at the 2012 London Olympics, Olympic Secretary-General Paddy Jackson has said that \"it's not the right thing to do\" to allow the athletes to compete at a world-record level. On the other hand, there are many other Olympic committees in Ireland that have had similar experiences in recent years, such as the London 2012 Olympics and Rio in 2012, where she won a gold medal for Ireland in which she lost her Olympic bid. There is no doubt that this is a case of mistaken identity, though, that Ireland will not be the only country that has suffered a loss in international relations. And that is something that can only be solved by doing something about it. I think that's a good thing, because it's an important step forward for Irish athletes and their families. After all, we have a lot of work ahead of us. So, I'm not sure what we can do to help them. What can we do? Let's talk about that, shall we? What are we doing? We can't do anything about this, right now? The Olympics are a very important part of our Olympic legacy. You can never have too many Olympic athletes. They are the most important people in our lives, after all. These athletes are so important to us that they have the opportunity to participate in Olympic events, so it is important for us to have that opportunity. Just as we all know that there is so much to learn about the sport of sport, you can learn more about sport and sport. Here's what I can tell you about Rio, for example: I've been a member of this Olympic team. Let me explain to you why we're so many"

        "target": "Reports: Merkel to run for fourth term as German chancellor German Chancellor Angela Merkel has confirmed that she will stand for the chancellery in the 2017 election, German media reports. The Christian Democrat Leader (CDU) first took office in 2005. After months of speculation, German Chancellor Angela Merkel reportedly told her fellow Christian Democrats (CDU) in Berlin on Sunday that she is prepared to lead the party into next year's election. An official statement is expected from Merkel at 7 p.m. local time (1800 UTC) on Sunday. The 62-year-old has faced a number of difficulties in recent months, from criticism over her handling of the migration crisis to falling support amid a rise in right-wing populist sentiment. Since taking office in 2005, however, Merkel has also been praised for navigating Europe's largest economy through the financial and eurozone crises. According to an Emnid survey published in the German newspaper \"Bild am Sonntag\" 55 percent of Germans are in favor of Merkel remaining head of the German government for another four years. Thirty-nine percent said they were against her re-election. Sign of stability Should she be elected next September, another full four-year term would put Merkel on a par with her mentor Helmut Kohl who set the post-war record and presided over the Fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. In light of the UK's shock vote to leave the European Union in June and Donald Trump's election last week as US president, Merkel's re-election is likely to be welcomed in many capitals as a sign of stability. During his final visit to Berlin this week, US President Barack Obama said that if he were able to, he would vote for his longtime partner and friend. In an interview with German magazine \"Spiegel\" and broadcaster \"ARD,\" Obama said: \"She has great credibility, and she is willing to fight for those values in a way that is very, very important.\" \"I'm glad that she's there and I think the German people should appreciate her. Certainly, I've appreciated her as a partner.\" Winning back votes With the less that a year until Germany heads to the polls, Merkel's CDU is now turning its efforts to wooing back disenchanted voters who have left the conservative camp to support the right-wing populists, Alternative for Germany (AfD). Formed as a Euro-sceptic party in 2013, the AfD won 4.7 percent of the popular vote in the last federal elections in 2013, just falling short of the 5 percent threshold required to enter the Bundestag - Germany's lower house of parliament. After benefiting from the rise in europsceptic, anti-immigration sentiment, seemingly sweeping across western Europe, the party now holds seats in nine of Germany's 16 states.",
        "generated_story": "Merkel's re-election bid comes amid growing populist sentiment in Germany German Chancellor Angela Merkel has announced she will seek a second term in office. The right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD) party is seeking a third term as chancellor in the next federal election, which is due to take place in September. It is expected to win a majority of seats in parliament, with the Greens and the Social Democrats leading the way. But it is not clear how many seats it will win, according to a poll published on Sunday by the Christian Democrat Leader (CDU). The CDU's Helmut Kohl, who is also the party's parliamentary leader, said he would seek another term. \"I would like to be able to run again,\" he told Bild am Sonntag, a German newspaper, adding that he was \"very optimistic\" about the future of the country. Merkel, however, has said she would not run for a fourth term, saying that she was not ready to accept the results of a new election. She also said that her party would continue to work closely with other parties, such as the Green Party, the conservative Christian Democrats, and other political parties. In addition, she has promised to hold a referendum on whether or not to give up the right to vote in November's federal elections. This would be the first time in German history that a major political party has won a parliamentary election in such a short period of time. Last year, Merkel's party won the most votes of any major party, but it also lost a number of key parliamentary seats, including the Bundestag. On Sunday, it lost its parliamentary majority to the far-right Social Democratic Party (SPD), which had been in power since the 1990s. Since then, there has been a surge in anti-immigrant sentiment, as well as a rise in xenophobic rhetoric. That has led to calls for Merkel to step down from her post as Chancellor of Germany. Germany's chancellor, Helmand Kohls, is set to face a tough reelection battle in December, when she faces the prospect of losing her majority in a coalition government. German media reported on Monday that the AfD's candidate for the federal parliament was likely to lose the chance to form a government, despite the fact that it was founded by a former Communist Party member. According to German daily Bild, this is the second time that Germany has seen a change in government in less than two years, after the fall of Berlin Wall in 1989. Many of its voters have been disillusioned with Merkel and her government's policies on social issues, while others have become increasingly critical of her policies. For example, they have called for her to withdraw from the European Union and leave the EU. They have also called on the German parliament to pass a constitutional amendment that would make Germany a more open and democratic country, rather than a \"free Europe.\" The new constitution would also make it easier for German voters to make their own decisions on what they want to do with their political future. After all, Germany is a democracy, not just a democratic democracy. There are many democratic institutions in this country and there are a lot of people who believe in democracy and freedom of expression. However, many of them don't believe that democracy is something that can only be achieved through the rule of law. And that is precisely what the new chancellor is trying to achieve. If she does not win the presidency, her chances of becoming chancellor will be very limited. At the same time, that doesn't mean she is going to have a chance of winning the popular vote, because she won't have the support of all the people in her own party. (Reuters, AP, dpa, Reuters, AFP) She will also have to decide whether she wants to stay on as prime minister, or if she decides to seek an extension to her parliamentary seat in Berlin, where she currently lives. What is her position on this issue is unclear, though, given the current political climate. How will she do that? \"She will need to find a way to change her mind,\" she said in an interview with German magazine Der Spiegel on Friday. Her spokesman, Wolfgang Schaeuble, told the magazine that \"she will not be allowed to say what she thinks is best for us.\" She added that there is \"no way she can change the constitution.\" \"The constitution is very clear that we can't change it,\" Schiauble said, \"but it's not the only one who can make that happen. We need a strong constitution and a clear vision of what we want. I think that's a very good thing for our country.\" Merkel is hoping that voters will come out in favor of an independent government that will make her a better leader in future elections, even if it means she loses her seat at the top of parliament next year. 'I'm not sure that I can do anything for my country,' she added, referring to what is currently a difficult position to get elected to parliament. So far, so many people are still undecided. You can"

        "target": "France's conservatives: Combating the National Front with a swing to the right A staunch conservative is joining the race for the French presidency. Republican candidate Francois Fillon could turn into a big problem for right-wing extremist Marine Le Pen's National Front. France's Republicans are moving to the right: by choosing Francois Fillon, voters nominated a presidential candidate who has a reputation as a staunch conservative. The former prime minister has already announced that he intends to refocus politics with the traditional family in mind. Fillon takes a dim view of homosexual couples adopting children. He wants to introduce a cap on the number of refugees allowed into France, he intends to make it harder for foreign nationals to access the social welfare system, and he wants to put Muslim communities and mosques under government control. In addition, Fillon advocates a renationalization of school curricula. Fillon makes gains in FN territory Fillon's agenda could turn out to be a problem for the \"National Front\" (FN). The 62-year-old appeals to similar sentiments as the right-wing party's base: concern about foreign domination and loss of identity, fear of terrorism and crime. \"For a long time, FN was the only political force that addressed those fears,\" said Henrik Uterwedde of the German-French Institute (dfi) in Ludwigsburg. \"Now a politician has arrived on the scene who addresses those fears using a different language and makes them a political offer.\" In rural, Catholic France especially, where traditions still matter a great deal, the avowed Catholic Fillon strikes a chord with his proposals pertaining to family and society policies. He receives support from traditional Catholic groups who, for years, have been able to mobilize crowds for demonstrations against gay marriage. During the intraparty election campaign, Fillon predominantly traveled to France's villages and small towns - regions which FN leader Marine Le Pen had labeled the \"forgotten France,\" regarding herself as their foremost lobbyist. \"Fillon has made gains in an environment that is also canvassed by Le Pen,\" Andreas Jung, Chairman of the Bundestag's German-French parliamentary group, told German broadcaster rbb-Inforadio. \"He does not represent the lofty levels of Parisian politics, but rather provincial entrenchment. Fillon is committed to traditional values, like the family. Therefore, he may not only be capable of defeating Le Pen, but also of taking the lead during the first ballot.\" 'Most dangerous candidate for FN' Consequently, the FN camp is less than enthusiastic about the conservative's candidacy. \"Because of Fillon, we now have a strategy problem,\" Marion Marechal Le Pen, the FN leader's niece, recently told journalists. \"He is the most dangerous candidate for the National Front.\" Pollsters' findings appear to support that statement. Recent surveys establish Fillon as the current favorite in the French presidential election scheduled for next May. However, Fillon's election is not a foregone conclusion. By denouncing the conservative candidate as a member of the establishment, FN tries to win over those who are frustrated with politics and politicians in general. There is persistent opposition against his economic-liberal plans in particular. Fillon wants to abolish the 35-hour working week and raise the retirement age to 65 years. In addition, he wants to cut 500,000 jobs in the public sector and reform industrial law. Fillon is known as an admirer of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. \"Issues pertaining to liberal economic policy have always been heavily contested in France,\" said Uterwedde. \"Fillon's adversaries have already taken up their positions, criticizing what, in France, is called 'ultra-liberalism.'\" That was one of the nastiest words in French politics, he added. An offer for the left Fillon wants to raise VAT by 2 percent. This would predominantly hurt low-income households. Exactly that clientele, however, is wooed by FN with a program that is regarded as rather left-wing. The right-wing extremists are on a clear anti-globalization course, intending to seal off the French economy against foreign countries and exit from the European Union. The party is already trying to present Fillon as a symbol of anarchic, ultra-liberal capitalism. \"Francois Fillon will even go beyond EU demands for austerity and liberalism,\" David Rachline, Marine Le Pen's election campaign manager, wrote on Twitter. According to current polls, it is very likely that Fillon will have to face Marine Le Pen in a runoff election in May. The main hazard for the Republican candidate: his economic-liberal course could deter left-wing voters from choosing the conservative in order to avert Le Pen. \"Francois Fillon will have to start making offers, also to those voters who are closer to the center and more moderate,\" said France expert Uterwedde. \"And he will, prior to the runoff election at the latest, have to make offers to left-wing voters - without changing his original course.\"",
        "generated_story": "French presidential candidate Francois Fillon is the most dangerous candidate for the French presidential election, according to the German-French Institute of Politics. The former finance minister faces a tough re-election campaign in France next year, with the right-wing National Front candidate Marine Le Pen facing an uphill battle in the first round of the presidential vote. French voters have already decided who they want to vote for, and who will be the front-runner. In the second round, the left-leaning candidate will face off against the far-right candidate Marion Marechal le Pen, who is expected to win the popular vote in a landslide. If she wins, she will have a chance of becoming the country's first female president. \"I think she has the best chance,\" said Henrik Uterwedde, head of research at the Germany-France Institute in Ludwigsburg. He added: \"She has a lot of experience in politics, but she is not a politician. She is a woman of many talents and she knows how to work with people. And she's a very smart person. I think that's what makes her so appealing to people who don't want her to be a candidate. That's why I'm so worried about her, because I know she won't be able to get the votes she needs. It's not that she doesn't have experience, it's just that her party is so far ahead of her in this election. But she does have the experience of being a member of a political party that has been in power for a long time. For example, when she was a child, her father was an economist and her mother worked as a teacher. Now she works as an academic at a university in Germany. Her father, Andreas Jung, is also a professor of political science at Germany's University of Leipzig, where she teaches French and German history. After all, he's the only person who has studied French history and knows French politics well enough to know the language of French, German and French. His father had been a journalist for more than 30 years. When he was in his teens, his father taught him to read German, which he did not understand. At the time of his death in 2007, Germany was the third-largest economy in Europe, after France and the United States, followed by Germany, Austria and Switzerland. Since then, France has become one of Europe's most conservative countries. On the other hand, there are a number of other countries that are not so lucky. France's conservative parties, such as the Socialists, are also in danger of losing the election in June. They are facing a difficult time in their own right. Many of them, however, do not believe that they can win a second term. There is no doubt that the current French president is going to lose the next round. This is because they are too far away from the center of France, a country where the people are so divided over the future of their country and where they have to choose between their politics and what they believe is best for them. As a result, they will need to find a way to make their way back to power in order to avoid a repeat of last year's inconclusive elections in which they lost their majority. (Reuters, AFP, dpa, AP, Reuters) The French Republican Party (RSP) is currently in second place, behind only the conservative Alternative for France (AfD) party (SPF), which is in third place behind the Socialist Party of Germany (PD). The party's main rival, Emmanuel Macron, has also lost its support in recent polls, as well as in several other European countries, including Germany and France. Macron has lost the support of voters in both the Netherlands and Germany who are in opposition to him, while the Greens have gained a majority of support from voters who support him. However, polls show that he is still a popular candidate, despite the fact that many voters are still undecided on whether he will win. Some of those voters, though, have expressed their support for Macron's candidacy, saying he would be an easy candidate to defeat. Other candidates have also been given the chance to do well in other elections. Among the candidates who have been elected to parliament are the anti-establishment parties and those who want a change of government. These are those with a strong sense of direction. Most of these candidates are far more experienced than the mainstream parties. Only the extreme right are likely to succeed in winning a third of seats in November's general election - and that is unlikely to happen, at least for now - but it is possible that it could be possible. Both candidates will get a better chance at winning the vote than they currently have - if he wins the presidency, if the polls are held to a certain standard. So far, so good, indeed, that will not be easy to predict the outcome of next month's vote, even if they do decide to run for president in May's runoff. What do you think will happen? The far rightist right now,"

Minister wants ban on meat names for plant-based foods Terms like \"vegan sausage\" and \"vegetarian schnitzel\" confuse consumers and need to be replaced, according to German Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt. He wants new names for plant-based dishes. Germans shouldn't be biting into a \"vegan sausage\" or cutting a slice of \"vegetarian schnitzel,\" German Minister for Food and Agriculture Christian Schmidt told the daily \"Bild\" newspaper on Wednesday, adding that names traditionally used for meat-based dishes should not be applied to plant-based foods. \"I don't want anyone to pretend that these pseudo-meat dishes are actual meat dishes,\" Schmidt said. The minister said manufacturers should come up with distinct names for plant-based meat-substitutes. Schmidt also said meat was part of a healthy and balanced diet and belonged on the menu in schools and kindergartens. Soy? Steak? Soy-steak? Schmidt's statements echo demands from the German Farmers Association and German Butchers Association. Both lobbying groups have asked for a ban on terms such as \"vegetarian ham\" or \"soy steak.\" Schmidt's call for plant-based foods to have their own name was also made in October in the state of Lower Saxony, a state with many large livestock farms. The German Vegetarian Association, however, argued against the proposal. A spokesperson for the organization said that \"names that are used for animal-based products should without a doubt also be legal to use for vegetarian substitute products.\" More meatless 'whatever-you-want-to-call-thems' The market for vegetarian and vegan dishes has grown steadily in the past few years in Germany, partly at the expense of the meat industry. According to a research paper by the Institute for the Study of Trade (IfH), revenue for vegetarian and vegan products in Germany was 454 million euros ($474 million) in 2015 and grew by more than 100 percent between 2010 and 2015. In the same time period, the demand for meat products fell by almost 10 percent. mb/sms (dpa, epd)",
        "generated_story": "No more'veggie sausages' and no more'vegetarian schnitzel' German farmers association has announced that it will no longer be able to produce sauerkraut in Germany. The German Farmers Association (DFA) announced on Thursday that they would be cutting down on the amount of meat they produce in the country. \"We are going to cut back on meat production, which we have been doing for the past few years,\" said Christian Schmidt, the AFA's head of agriculture and agribusiness, in an interview with the German newspaper Bild. 'We will not be producing meat that is unfit for human consumption. We will be making meat which is not suitable for humans,\" Schmidt said, adding that he had no intention of cutting meat from the meat. He added that Germany's farmers' association would continue to make meat for its members, but it would have to do so in order to meet the needs of the farmers. In addition, he added, \"we will also be reducing the number of vegetables that we produce. This is the first time we will have a meat-free meat market, and it is a very important part of our agricultural future.\" German agricultural magazine Bild reported that the association had announced plans for a new meat industry in Lower Saxony, a region in eastern Germany, to be developed by the new German government. According to Bild, this would mean the creation of a \"meat market\" that would not only produce meat but also produce vegetables, fruits and vegetables. It would also allow farmers to sell their produce to other farmers, who would then have the opportunity to grow their own meat and produce it for their families. But it also would allow them to avoid having to pay a tax on their meat to the government, as well as the cost of producing it. That would make it easier for farmers and consumers alike to eat meat without the need for tax breaks, Schmidt added. However, there is still the possibility of tax exemptions for those who do not have tax-exempt status. For example, if a German farmer were to receive tax exempt status, they could be fined up to 10,000 euros ($13,500) a year. If they did not receive the tax exemption, Germany would still be subject to tax and a fine fine, according to German agriculture magazine \"Die Welt\" (AFP, dpa) which published a report on Sunday, saying that \"the German market for meat has become increasingly difficult to compete with other countries in Europe.\" The report also said that there was an increase in meat sales in recent years, with more than 1.5 million people buying meat at the end of last year alone. German meat exporters have also reported a rise in their sales since the beginning of this year, despite the fact that meat prices have risen by around 10 percent. Germany has also seen a decline in its meat exports, particularly to China and the United States, where the price of beef has risen to a record high of $1.7 billion. Last week, it was reported the industry was down by 20 percent from its pre-war peak, when it reached $2.3 billion in 2008. Since then, German industry has been growing at a rate of 10.6 percent annually, while German food exports have fallen by almost half a million euros per year since then. On the other hand, many farmers are still struggling to find a way to get meat into their homes, especially in low-income areas, such as rural areas where there are few jobs available. There is also a shortage of quality meat products, so it's not surprising that many of them are not available for sale. Many of these products are now available on Amazon.com and other online retailers, however, have not been made available to people who want to buy meat, because they are too expensive and expensive to purchase. These are the only products that are available in German supermarkets, for example. You can find them in supermarkets and supermarkets.

How can you tell which meat you're eating? What are you doing with meat? Is there a good meat substitute? The answer is very simple: You're not eating meat! You've got to take meat out of your house. And that's a big reason why you can't eat it, right? That's the main reason I'm here. I can tell you what's good news for me: I've never had meat on my plate before. My meat isn't very good at all. So, I have no idea what to expect from my meat shop. When I was a child, meat was the most expensive thing I could ever eat.

Twenty years later, relations between Libya and Europe have done an about-face. The Berlin disco \"La Belle\" was packed as usual on the night of April 5, 1986. Among its guests were many US soldiers, who were certainly not thinking of politics, the Middle East or strained relations between the United States and Libya. But reality caught up with them: a bomb detonated near the dance floor that night, killing two Americans and a Turkish woman. Over 200 people were injured. A Berlin court ruled that Libya and its intelligence services were responsible for the bombing. In 2001, following a nearly four-year long trial, the judges convicted a Libyan diplomat and three others to prison sentences between 12 and 14 years. The big oil-exporting country in the meantime was busy working on its reputation. Already in the 1990s, Tripoli began striving to improve its relations to the European Union. Financial reparation opened the door to Europe In 2004, the Gaddafi International Foundation for Charity Associations and the legal representatives of the German La Belle victims settled on $35 million in compensation. This opened the door to Europe. Just a few weeks later, Germany's chancellor at the time, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, visited Moammar Gadhafi in a traditional Bedouin tent outside of Tripoli. Britain's Prime Minister Tony Blair also paid Gadhafi a visit. A few months earlier, in April 2004, the European Union had welcomed the Libyan leader to Brussels. It was Gadhafi's first official visit to Europe in 15 years. Bernd Westphal, the German ambassador to Libya, said bilateral relations had been through difficult times. \"The German Embassy in Tripoli today is working for a quick return to the liveliness of close relations between Germany and Libya,\" Westphal said. \"We want to build on our traditional friendship with Libya and we want to strengthen the political, economic and cultural cooperation between our two countries and peoples.\" Business interests booming in Libya In the past few years, Libya has moved from being the supporter of international terrorism to an attractive economic partner for the West. European business representatives have been increasingly knocking on Libya's door. Even the United States is showing increased interest in the northern African nation. Washington is pleased that Libya announced at the end of 2003 that it would discontinue its efforts to develop and produce weapons of mass destruction. Libya's ambassador to Germany, Said Abdulaati, said political and economic relations between Libya and Germany were \"excellent.\" Libya is one of Germany's strongest trading partners in northern Africa. Last year, Germany exported goods to Libya worth 657.7 million euros ($805.7 million), according to the German Federal Statistics Office. \"The economy is the driving power in German-Libyan relations,\" said Abdulaati in an interview with the Arab-German association for trade and industry. But Germany isn't the only European country making deals in Libya. France last month signed an accord with Libya on peaceful nuclear research. \"This accord represents a qualitative leap in relations between the two countries and proves that Libya has transformed its weapons of mass destruction into constructive weapons,\" Public Works Minister Maatuk Maatuk said at the signing ceremony in March. \"We are telling the world that we are moving towards the development of Libyan nuclear technology for peaceful purposes.\" This week, the Netherlands' Economics Minister Laurens Jan Brinkhorst will visit Libya to negotiate gas and oil agreements. It will be the first high-level visit by a Dutch official since Gadhafi took power in 1969.",
        "generated_story": "The Shift in Libya's Relations to Europe The shift in Libyan relations between Germany and the United States has been marked by a shift of the political and economic landscape in the country. The German Embassy in Tripoli, Libya, is the latest in a series of diplomatic shifts that have taken place between the two countries. Last week, the German government announced that it would be sending a delegation to Libya to meet with President Moammar Gadhafi and his Libyan counterpart, Said Abdulaati, for the first time since he took power in 2011. According to German Foreign Minister Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, this will not be the last. \"We are not going to allow this to happen again,\" he told DW in an interview published on Thursday. He added that \"we will continue to work closely with the Libyan government to ensure that we have the best possible relations with them.\" The move comes as the government of former Libyan dictator Moamermar Gadhafi, who is now in exile in Germany, seeks to strengthen ties with his former home country, Tripoli. In the past few months, however, tensions between Libya and Germany have escalated. On Thursday, Germany's foreign minister, Bernd Westphal, said that the \"differences between our countries are becoming more and more apparent.\" \"It's not just that there is a change of government, it's that you have to have a strong sense of security and a sense that your country is in good shape. You don't need to be a dictator to understand that. That's the way it should be. It's how it is, and that's what we want to do. We want you to feel safe and secure in your own country,\" said Westph, referring to the fact that Libya is not the only country in eastern Libya that has a weak economy. At the same time, there's a lot of uncertainty about what the future holds for you and your family. There's also the question of whether you will be able to get a job as a journalist, or if you are a person who works for a German newspaper. This is why we are here in Berlin, which is where I am. I'm not a politician, but I think that is what this is all about. What is happening is that people are coming to terms with what is going on in this country and what you're going through. For example, in Tunisia, where the president is based, a number of people have been killed by Gaddafi's regime. And in Egypt, when the dictator is still in power, many of them are still living in squalor. But there are also many people who have not seen the light of day. Many of these people, including the former Prime Minister, have no idea what to expect from the new Libyan leader. They are concerned that his regime is trying to impose its will on the people of Libya. However, they do not want him to know that he has no intention of changing his position. As a result of this, he is no longer in control of his country's government. Instead, his government is being forced to take over the reins of power from his predecessor, former prime minister Haider al-Abujaat, as well as his brother, Maatuk Maatauk. Both men are now working as ministers of state at the Berlin Federal Statistics Office (BFSO) and are in charge of public works at Berlin's Berlin-based German Federal Statistical Office, according to a report in The New York Times. After the fall of Gaddafi in January 2011, both men were released from prison. Since then, their relationship has become strained, with both of their families being sent to prison for crimes against humanity. Now they have returned to their home countries to live in fear of losing their jobs and their livelihoods. A new generation of migrants is expected to arrive in Europe this year. More than 100,000 migrants have arrived from Libya in recent years. Most of those migrants are from Syria and Iraq. Some have come to Germany to seek asylum, while others from other parts of Europe have moved to other countries, such as France and Italy. These migrants, meanwhile, are seeking asylum in other European countries and to return home. (Reuters, AP, AFP, dpa, Reuters) \"They are desperate to find a better life for themselves and for their children,\" the report said, adding that they would like to stay in touch with their relatives and friends in their new country of origin. 'They want us to help them find their way back to our homeland,' said the newspaper's editor-in-chief, Erich Wieseltier, an expert on migration and migration issues. Germany is also hoping that this new influx of refugees will help ease the burden of living abroad. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has called for an end to this crisis. She said she would welcome the release of all migrants and refugees, especially those who are fleeing the Middle East and North Africa. Berlin is hoping the situation will improve, she added, \"I think it will make it easier for them to come"

In a report commissioned by the European Commission, the London Institute for Alcohol Studies recommended raising the legal age to buy alcohol to 18 (in some countries, such as Germany, 16-year-olds can buy beer), lowering the permitted blood alcohol level while driving to 0.5, banning alcohol advertising on TV and in movies as well as adding warning labels to bottles as ways of preventing alcohol abuse across the bloc. Which of the methods EU Health Commissioner Markos Kyprianou actually introduces will be announced \"sometime in the autumn,\" according to a spokesperson. Other options include a 10 percent increase in the price of alcohol. Kyprianou has, however, hinted that he favors warning labels -- similar to those that appear on packs of cigarettes -- that make the dangers of alcohol clear. \"Drinking harms your unborn baby\" on bottles? Brewers and wine makers across Europe, however, have come out against placing \"Drinking Kills\" or other labels on bottles of beer. \"Warning labels are the completely wrong way to go,\" Peter Hahn, head of the German Brewers Association told Germany's Express newspaper. \"The do not deter people who have lost a sense of how much to drink and unsettle the people who enjoy a beer after work.\" Industry groups also opposed implementing EU-wide guidelines in countries with traditionally different ways of approaching drinking and drinking problems. \"Policies that do not consider cultural and regional differences, will fail to deal with the social problems, while at the same time generate a rising level of political objections,\" said Rodolphe de Looz-Corswarem of Brewers of Europe. Keeping social vices separate Green party EU parliamentarian Hiltrud Breyer meanwhile called on the alcohol industry to stop \"saber rattling\" before it sees the a final version of the EU's strategy to prevent alcohol abuse. German Consumer Affairs Minister Horst Seehofer said he would wait to see what Kyprianou's actual suggestions are before commenting. Other German politicians, however, were more willing to voice the opposition to putting a sip of wine on the same footing with a puff of a cigarette. \"People should not expect that a skull and crossbones end up on every bottle of beer and wine,\" German EU representative Karl-Heinz Florenz told Der Tagesspiegel newspaper, adding that when it comes to alcohol, each member state should be responsible for how it deals with alcohol abuse. The harm of \"passive drinking\" While cigarettes are a health risk from the first puff, moderate drinking can actually be healthy and there is no danger from \"passive drinking,\" Peter Liese, a German EU representative, told the paper. The commission's report disagreed with Liese's conclusion, saying alcohol abuse had a major role in as many as 200,000 deaths in Europe due to car accidents and disease and played a role in some 60,000 underweight births. The report also estimated the effects of alcohol abuse of costing the EU 125 billion euros ($161 billion) in 2003. Some 25 percent of men and 10 percent of women in Europe drink what the EU considers to be more than healthy amounts of alcohol and between 3 percent and 5 percent are suffering from alcoholism, according to EU statistics.",
        "generated_story": "German Brewers Association warns against \"passive drinking\" The European Union is warning about the harmful effects of alcohol on German brewers. The EU's consumer watchdog, the European Consumer Affairs Commission, has warned that alcohol consumption could lead to a rise in the number of cases of underage drinking in Germany. In a letter to the German Brewers' Association, its president, Peter Liese, said he was \"deeply concerned\" by the association's warning. \"We have to be very careful,\" he said, adding that \"we don't want people to drink too much alcohol, but we do want to make sure that it's not harmful to our consumers.\" \"It's a good thing that we're not drinking alcohol at all, and that's what we are trying to do. We are not going to let people drink alcohol in our homes.\" The letter, which was published on Tuesday, was written by German brewer Hiltrud Breyer, who is also a member of the Association of Brewers of Europe (BBA). It was signed by BBA president Karl-Heinz Florenz. It is the first time in German history that a German beer has been sold on the market. But it is not the only beer that is being sold at the grocery store. There are also many other products that are sold in other countries, such as wine, beer, wine and spirits. Some of these products are even available on Amazon.com. Others are available for sale in supermarkets and convenience stores. However, they are only available to those who buy them at a reasonable price. For example, if you buy a bottle of wine in a store, it will cost you about 10 euros ($13.50) to buy it. That's the price you pay for it, according to German consumer affairs Minister Horst Seehofer (pictured above), who has said that he would like to see a ban on alcohol sales. (Reuters, AP, dpa, Reuters) \"I think it would be a mistake for the consumer to think that this is an acceptable way to consume alcohol,\" said Dieter Wieser, a spokesman for Germany's Chamber of Commerce and Industry (CDI). \"But I think we should be careful, because we have a lot of people who do not have access to alcohol.\" He added that the ban would not affect the quality of beer sold to consumers. He also said the EU would take steps to protect consumers from the harm caused by alcohol abuse, as well as to reduce the amount of consumption that can be done by minors. This is something that has long been a concern of many German consumers, he added. And it isn't just about alcohol. Alcohol is a big part of German society, too. You can't have alcohol without drinking it in your own home, for example. If you have an alcoholic beverage, you can drink it with a glass of water or a cup of milk, or even a mug of ice water. What's more, alcohol can also be used as a lubricant for your skin. How do you feel about it? How can you tell if something is wrong with your body? Do you know what you're drinking? What are you doing? Are you having a bad day? Is it OK to smoke a beer? If so, what is your opinion of your drinking habits? Can you say that you've had an unpleasant experience with alcohol? I'm not sure. I can tell you that I have had a very difficult time with it all. My opinion is that there are many people in my life who are very unhappy with the way alcohol is consumed in this way. So, I am very concerned about this. Why is it that people are drinking so much? Why do I feel so bad for them? It's because they have no idea what they're doing in their home country? Because alcohol has become so important to them. They have been drinking all the time. When I was a child, my parents drank alcohol and I drank beer all day long. Now I drink beer and they drink wine with their children and their friends. These are the things that make me feel good about my family and friends, especially when you are a young person? That is what I say to my children. Let's be honest with each other, right? You know the answer to that question. Is alcohol really good for you? Well, that depends on how much you drink? The answer is, of course, on what kind of drinking you do? Let me know. Just ask your friends and family. Tell them to tell me what's going on with you. Then I'll tell them about your family, friends or relatives who drink and you'll be able to enjoy your beer. Or, how can I do that? And then I will tell my kids that they will be OK with that. Who knows what will happen to you and your children? Who will they think about their parents? Then they'll have the right to have their own children, so they won't be okay with this? They'll know that,"

All season long, Bayern Munich have been consumed with achieving one goal: reaching the final of the Champions League, held at their own Allianz Arena in Munich, and raising the trophy in front of their home fans. After finishing a distant second place to Dortmund in the Bundesliga and dismally losing to them 5-2 in the German Cup final, Bayern Munich are in a must-win situation Saturday against Chelsea. A loss would be the final straw in a disappointing season for a team that can't stand second place. A win for Bayern would mean redemption, to some extent, for their shortcomings in the league. Key players were rested down the stretch in the Bundesliga, especially before the two legs of Bayern's European semifinal against Real Madrid. That was an indication that Bayern had given up on the league and put all their eggs in one basket, hoping for a big payoff with the Champions League title. The same can be said for the German Cup final against Dortmund: true, Bayern essentially beat themselves by making mistake after mistake, but Bayern could, if they win Saturday, wipe the slate clean. Saving the season Win this match, and all will be forgiven in Munich. Lose, and it will be Bayern's second straight season without a piece of hardware, not to mention the heartbreak of losing the biggest match at Allianz Arena since it opened in 2005. \"We must not even think about [losing],\" said Bayern's Franck Ribery on Thursday. \"If we win the Champions League, then we can forget about not winning the league or the cup, nobody will care about that.\" Bayern are a team that thrives under pressure, and the high stakes of this match will be good for them. Chelsea are a team that showed in their semifinal upset of Barcelona that they can rise to a challenge, even if that challenge is simply holding on against a superior opponent. \"We are not the favorites of the game, we are playing away,\" Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech said on Thursday. \"It is very rare when you have the home team playing in the home stadium, using the home dressing room, so I think the advantage goes to Bayern Munich because of that. But we know we have a chance and we will fight for it.\" But this match will come down to the team that can better take advantage of holes that have been blown in each team's defense due to injuries and suspensions. Filling the gaps Between the two sides, seven starting players will miss out on the final. Chelsea saw Raul Meireles, Ramires, and Branislav Ivanovic each get their third yellow card in the second leg against Barcelona, and captain John Terry was given a straight red. Terry and Ivanovic are fixtures on Chelsea's backline, which was already at half-strength due to hamstring injuries suffered by Gary Cahill and David Luiz. Chelsea coach Roberto di Matteo hopes those two are fit enough for the final, since Chelsea will need all the help they can get in the back. For Bayern, David Alaba and Holger Badstuber - both defenders - and Luiz Gustavo, a defensive midfielder, are also suspended for picking up three yellow cards. The impact of the suspensions will hit Chelsea the most. In addition to a weakened back line, Meireles and Ramires are mainstays on offense, supporting strikers Didier Drogba or Fernando Torres. With Ramires out, Drogba could start as striker, with Torres moving to the wing. At any rate, there is more uncertainty in The Blues' lineup than there is in Bayern's, who will be able to rely on striker Mario Gomez and the dynamic-duo of Arjen Robben and Ribery on the wings as they have all season. Most of the question marks will still be defensive for both teams, but to think that this is an indication of a high-scoring affair on Saturday would be a discredit to both team's last lines of defense. Between the posts Neither side would be competing in the final if it wasn't for the heroics of the teams' keepers. Cech defended against wave after wave of attacks from Barcelona in the semifinal for Chelsea, and Manuel Neuer showed nerves of steel in Bayern's penalty shootout in the final leg against Real Madrid, blocking penalties from Madrid stars Cristiano Ronaldo and Kaka. Chelsea's best shot will be to come out of the gate at a sprint and gain an early advantage against Bayern, who will be doing everything they can to keep their long-cultivated dream-final in their control. Otherwise, Bayern's determination to salvage their season may be enough to carry them through to the trophy ceremony - at home, just like they planned it.

        "generated_story": "Borussia Dortmund beat Bayern Munich to reach the Champions League final The Blues will be hoping for a repeat of last season's Bundesliga final, which they lost to Real Madrid in the quarter-finals. The German champions will have to wait until the end of the season to see if they can get through to the last 16. They will need to win the German Cup to qualify for next year's competition. That would be the first time in their history that they have reached the final of a major competition, and it would also be their first European final since the 1990-91 season, when they beat Barcelona 3-0 at the Allianz Arena in Munich. Cech, who has been a key player for the Blues since he was a teenager, will take on the role of captain in this final. \"I think it's going to be a very difficult game for us,\" said Raul Meireles, the club's director of football. He added: \"We have a lot of work to do, but we are very happy with the way we have been able to play this season. We are so pleased with our performance and the quality of our players. I think we can do better than we did last year,\" he said, adding that he is \"very happy\" with his team-mates' performances. But he added that \"we are not satisfied with what we've seen so far.\" \"It's not just the players who are disappointed, it is the coaches who have disappointed us. It's the fans, too, that are the ones who want to get the best out of them,\" added the midfielder. 'We are happy for them, because we know they are a great team and we want them to have the chance to make the most of their chances.\" The hosts, meanwhile, are hoping to avoid the humiliation of losing their last two games in Germany, where they will face a tough task in reaching the semi-final. At the very least, they'll have an opportunity to show what they're capable of doing. And that's a good thing, as they've been doing for so long. For the past few years, their best players have done so much to help them win their way back into the top four. However, in recent years they haven't done enough. Last season they had to rely on their attacking midfielder, Fernando Torres, to keep them in contention. In the second half, though, Torres was unable to find the back of his own net and was replaced by Brazilian midfielder Juanfran Ramires. On the other hand, Diego Costa was the only player to score a goal in his first competitive match for Bayern, a game he had not scored in over a year. After the game, Costa and Costa were both involved in a number of chances for their side, with both of those goals coming from the penalty spot. Costa, however, failed to convert a free kick in an effort to put Bayern ahead, leaving the hosts in trouble. Meanwhile, Cristiano Ronaldo and Gary Cahill were also on target for Barcelona, although they did not score in that game either. Both had chances to take the lead in stoppage time, while the Spaniards had a couple of clear chances. With the goal, Ronaldo had the ball in front of him and Ronaldo was on his way to scoring his side's first goal. Madrid's goal came after the hour mark, after which the home side were forced to concede a late equaliser to Bayern's Luis Suarez. Ronaldo's second-half equalizer was their only chance of equalizing. Chelsea's last-minute winner in all competitions was also a consolation goal against Barcelona on Wednesday, beating Bayern 2-1 in extra time. Spain's Lionel Messi scored the winner against Bayern last week, scoring the decisive goal to seal the title for his country. Barcelona won the Bundesliga title with a 1-2 draw at home to Manchester City on Sunday. Cristian Schuerrle and Marcos Rojo also scored a brace for Chelsea, despite the fact that the Spanish side had won their previous two matches in Europe's top-flight. David Luiz's side are also in danger of missing out on a Europa League spot in next week's group stage. Jose Mourinho's men will now be looking to add to their tally of 10 points from a possible 12. Bayern have already secured a place in Sunday's final in Kiev. Manchester United, Barcelona and Bayern will also have their hands full with their next game in Moscow. Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham will all be in action on Saturday, having been beaten by the likes of Bayern and Arsenal in Group E. Germany's Jose Manuel Neuer and Franck Ribery have also been eliminated by Bayern on aggregate. This is a huge step up from last weekend's Group D final win over Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach. City are currently in second place, just two points behind Bayern. Ahead of Wednesday's match, Bayern are still in third place and are expected to host the next round of fixtures on Thursday.

Security forces are on high alert amid fears of unrest. UN leader Ban Ki-moon expressed \"deep regret\" on Monday that political leaders had failed to make progress on a constitution in Nepal, expressing concern about instability within the country. Security forces were put on high alert, with riot police patrolling streets after calls by the opposition for the resignation of Maoist Prime Minister Baburam Bhattarai. \"Nepal has entered an uncertain constitutional and political period,\" Ban warned in a statement read by his spokesman Martin Nesirky. \"The government and the political leaders, as well as leaders of various communities, need to demonstrate the courage and wisdom to come together to address the challenges the nation faces,\" the statement added. Repeated deadlines expired Politicians were to have agreed upon a new framework for the country's political future by Sunday. However, the representation of ethnic minorities and castes within a federal structure has proved a major sticking point in efforts to draw up a secular constitution. Bhattarai on Sunday said that parliament, elected in 2008 after a decade of civil war, would be disbanded after repeated deadlines had been broken. New elections are due to be held in November, but the opposition has criticized the premier's unilateral decision to call the poll. The country's Hindu monarchy, which ruled for centuries, was abolished after Maoist rebels gave up arms and won elections in 2008. Some 16,000 people died in the civil war between 1996 and 2006. rc/msh (AFP, AP)",
        "generated_story": "Nepal elections in Nepal are in the midst of unrest, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has warned. The country's elections are scheduled for Sunday, and the country is expected to be held in a few days. Opposition parties have called for the postponement of the vote, which is scheduled to take place on Sunday. Nepal's president, Baburam Bhattarai, has called on the international community to step in and ensure that the election is held on a peaceful and peaceful basis. \"We are not going to allow this to happen again,\" he told reporters in Kathmandu on Wednesday, adding that he was \"very disappointed\" with the outcome of Sunday's vote. He added that it was the first time that Nepal had held a general election since the 1990s, when the Nepalese government was still in power. In the past, elections have been held every three to four years, but in recent years the government has been unable to hold them in place because of a lack of political will. Last year, the UN Security Council voted to postpone the elections until the new year. Since then, protests have erupted across Nepal, with many people calling for a boycott of elections and a crackdown on political parties, including the ruling Nepali People's Party (PNP) and opposition parties. At the same time, there are reports that a number of people have fled to neighboring countries in search of safety, according to a report by the United Nations human rights office. There are also reports of violence in some parts of Nepal. Many of those who fled have since returned to their homes, while others have sought refuge in other countries, such as India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Bangladesh. They have also been fighting for months over a series of disputed elections that have left thousands dead and hundreds of thousands displaced. On Monday, a group of protesters gathered outside the presidential palace, demanding the resignation of Prime Minister B. Nesirky, who had been the prime minister's chief of staff for more than a decade, said the protests were \"unprecedented\" and that \"the country was not prepared for this kind of situation.\" The protests are the latest in an ongoing political crisis that has shaken the world's most populous country, where the economy is suffering from a severe shortage of foreign workers. A UN peacekeeping mission was set up to monitor the situation. It is not yet clear what will happen next, however, whether the political situation will change, or whether it will continue to worsen. According to the Nepal government, it is unlikely that there will be any change in government policy at all, as it has already begun to implement a new constitution that will make it more difficult for people to vote in elections. But it's not just the people who are unhappy with what is happening in their own country that are being held to account. This is a country where democracy is at the center of international attention. That is why the constitution is so important, because it gives people the right to decide what they want to do. And that is precisely what has happened in this country for so long. For the last few years Nepal has seen a lot of instability in its political and economic situation, particularly in terms of its economy, especially in rural areas. After the 2011 earthquake, people were forced to flee their home country in order to escape the threat of earthquakes and floods. When the earthquake hit Nepal in 2011, many of them had fled their villages, leaving thousands of residents without a place to live. Now, they are returning to Nepal to seek refuge, hoping to find a way out of poverty and to get a better life for themselves and their families. However, this has not been possible for them to return home. As a result, some of their relatives are still living in poverty, so they will have to face the consequences of what happened to them. If they do not return, that could be a very difficult situation for their children to grow up and have a difficult time finding a job. What is the next step? The UN is hoping that this will not be the end of this crisis, says UN Special Rapporteur Dr. Martina Broussard, deputy secretary general for Human Rights and Human rights, to ensure the stability of democracy. She says the current situation is an example of how this situation can be resolved. UN special rapporteur on democracy and democracy can only be achieved through peaceful elections, she says, \"I think we need to make sure that we are able to move on to other areas where we can do something about it. I think that's a good thing. We are hopeful that things will get back to normalcy and stability in our country. You know what I mean? That's why I'm so happy for you, right now, I don't think there is no doubt that you will see a change of government. Let's hope that people will come back and live in peace. So, let's see what the future holds. Here's what we're hoping for, at least for now."

It sided with a German firm in its legal battle with US giant Oracle. The European Court of Justice on Tuesday ruled that used software licenses may generally be resold by individuals or companies. The Luxembourg-based court thus sided with the German firm UsedSoft in a protracted legal battle with US software giant Oracle. The ruling made it clear that trade in used software was permissible even if the software had not been shipped on a physical medium such as a CD or DVD, but had been digitally downloaded from the Internet. UsedSoft's business model hinges completely on reselling used packages or legally obtained license keys for them. By reselling the keys to clients, the latter are then able to download the latest version of a given program directly from a company's Internet site and obtain all new updates and patches in the process. Legal clarity Oracle had sued UsedSoft over its business model, trying to prevent buyers of used software licenses from downloading programs again. But the European court ruled that the so-called principle of exhaustion applied whenever software was originally sold to a customer for an unlimited time span, not giving the maker of the software the right to prevent the resale of that software. \"The door for the trade in used software has been pushed wide open throughout the European Union,\" UsedSoft said in a statement, welcoming \"perfect legal safety on the market.\" The court in Luxembourg emphasized, though, that whoever resold pieces of original software and their accompanying licenses must erase every copy on their own computers in advance and was not allowed to keep a copy after resale. hg/mz (AFP, dpa)",
        "generated_story": "The European Court of Justice has ruled that it's permissible to resell software without a license from the European Union. The European court of justice ruled on Tuesday that the EU should not be able to sell software that has been illegally downloaded from a computer. \"This is a significant step in the right direction,\" the court said in a ruling that is expected to be made public by the end of the year. Oracle, which is based in Luxembourg, said it would appeal the ruling. It said that if the software had been downloaded illegally, it could have been sold to a third party, such as a reseller, who would then have to pay for it. In a landmark ruling, the ECJ said the decision was a \"significant step forward\" for Oracle and other software companies. But it was not the first time that a court had ruled in favor of reselling software in Europe. Earlier this year, a German court ruled against Oracle in an appeal brought by a group of German citizens who had sued the company for copyright infringement, saying it had violated European law by selling software to third parties that infringed on their intellectual property rights. According to the judgment, Oracle had failed to show that its software infringes copyright law, and it should be allowed to continue to do so even if it violates EU law. Read more: EU court rules against resellers of Oracle software The court's ruling comes as Oracle is facing a series of legal challenges, including one in which it has to prove that Oracle's software is not infringing on the rights of third-party users. This is the second time Oracle has faced legal action in less than two years, following a similar ruling in Germany in 2013. That case, in contrast, was settled by an appeals court in 2015. Both cases were settled out of court, with Oracle admitting that there was no legal basis for resealing software from companies that did not infringe on EU copyright laws. However, there were legal grounds for the case to go ahead, according to court documents. One of those grounds was that software could be sold without an author's consent. Another was the fact that users had to sign a consent form that said they would not have access to Oracle products without the consent of their legal team. And the other grounds were that they were not legally required to have a copy of a software license, as the law requires. For example, if a user had signed up for an Oracle application, he or she could not access the application without having signed an agreement with a company that had already agreed to provide the license. Other grounds are that this would be a violation of EU rules on copyright, or that an application must be signed with the same author and author. There is also the issue of whether Oracle can be sued for violating the terms of an EU license or not, because Oracle does not agree to renew the agreement. These grounds, however, do not apply to software licenses that are not subject to EU laws, but rather, they are a matter of interpretation and interpretation. As a result, companies must have an obligation to comply with EU regulations on software licensing in order to make sure that their products are legal and fair. If they don't do that, then they will be liable for a fine and/or a loss of revenue. What's more, that means they won't have the opportunity to sue Oracle for infringement of its rights, even though Oracle claims they have not done anything wrong. At the very least, this is an important step toward a fair and transparent process for companies to get to know their customers and how they operate. So far, so good. I think that's a good thing, at least in my opinion. We're not going to say too much about Oracle. You know what I mean by this, right? It's not a big deal. After all, we've already had a lot of problems with this. Just ask the US Justice Department, for instance, why would they want to give Oracle a contract? And then there's the question of who is responsible for all of this? The US government has already made it clear that Apple has no intention of doing that. Apple, Google, Microsoft, Apple and Oracle are the only ones who can do this legally. Google is one of them, after all. Amazon, Amazon and Microsoft are another. Microsoft and Apple are just the latest company to come up with their own products and services. They're the ones that will do the most damage to Apple's reputation and its reputation if they do something wrong and they can't sell the products to other companies, like Apple or Amazon.com or Google or Microsoft or Apple. All of these companies have done a great job of protecting their users and their privacy and security. Even Apple is doing a very good job in this area, of course, when it comes to protecting its customers' privacy. How can you do it? What do you think about that? That's what Apple does? How about Amazon? Why not Apple? I'm not sure. Why would you want Apple to take a deal with Apple"

The Curiosity rover will soon re-start its sluggish search for signs of life. NASA's Mars rover, \"Curiosity,\" will wrap up a lengthy self-testing phase on Thursday, freeing it up to continue exploring the surface of the Red Planet. Mission manager Jennifer Tropser told reporters in a conference call on Wednesday evening that the plan, once the final checks were completed, was to \"drive, drive, drive\" until Curiosity discovers a rock suitable for analysis. She added that the instrument checks have delivered positive results. \"Through every phase of the check-out, Curiosity has performed almost flawlessly,\" Tropser said. \"The success so far of these activities has been outstanding.\" Many of the tests have concerned Curiosity's robotic arm. The 2.1-meter (7-feet) appendage will be used to pick out and sample rocks and soil. NASA is investigating whether Mars can sustain life, or whether it could in the past. The tests were designed to identify any damage sustained during its interplanetary flight and also to ensure that the arm still functioned properly on Mars, with its different temperatures and gravity. The Mars rover landed in the giant Gale Crater, near the Martian equator, on August 5; it has so far moved about 109 meters within the crater. The rover is traveling east, heading first to an intersection called Glenelg, where three types of terrain meet. This is likely to be the location for the first rock and soil samples, though NASA said Curiosity was unlikely to arrive there for several weeks. Curiosity's ultimate destination is the nearby Aeolis Mons or Mount Sharp, a 3-mile-high mound of rock rising out of the crater. Mount Sharp is about 4.3 miles (7 kilometers) away from Curiosity's landing site.

        "generated_story": "NASA's Mars rover Curiosity has been a success -- and so far, so good. NASA's Curiosity rover is testing its self-sustaining instruments on Mars. The rover, which was launched in March 2014, is expected to land on the Martian surface by the end of the year. It will be the first of its kind in the world to test the instruments' accuracy, according to NASA scientist Jennifer Tropser. \"We are very pleased with the results,\" she told Space.com, adding that the rover was able to perform a range of tests, including a series of deep dives into Mars' atmosphere and a deep dive into the planet's atmosphere. In addition, the team has also tested a number of other instruments, such as a seismometer and an accelerometer, to assess the impact of climate change on Earth's climate and wind conditions. And it's not just Mars, either. Scientists have also been testing a variety of instruments that can be used to measure temperature, humidity, wind and humidity levels, and even the temperature of Mars itself. All of these tests have been successful, but the most important is that Curiosity's instruments are working well enough to detect the presence of a greenhouse gas. That means that it has a good chance of detecting the greenhouse gases that are present in Mars and Jupiter, as well as the fact that they are in orbit around the Earth. This is good news for Curiosity, because it means it is going to be a very long time before it can make a significant impact on human health and well-being. For now, though, it will have to wait until the next Martian day, when the spacecraft is due to return to Earth to collect samples of Martian soil. If that's the case, then Curiosity will need to do a lot more testing to make sure it doesn't become too dangerous. So far it hasn't been too difficult. But it could take a while before we can get to the bottom of what's going on with Curiosity. I'm not sure how long it'll take to get there. There's a long way to go before Curiosity is ready to take off. We're still waiting to see how well it responds to all the tests and what the data will tell us about its mission. As for the future, we don't know for sure. What we do know is this: It's very, very early in its journey and we're very optimistic that we'll have the opportunity to find out more about the science behind it. After all, this is a rover that is designed to help us understand the environment and the people who are responsible for it, not the ones who make the decisions that make it possible for us to have a better understanding of how it works. Just as we did with other spacecraft, there's no doubt that there are many more things that will come out of this one. One thing is for certain: it won't be as easy as it was before. You'll never know what to expect when it comes to testing the instrument, for example, until you've done the testing and then you'll know exactly what you want to know about it and how to use it in your own field. (Reuters, AFP, dpa, Reuters, AP) The first test of Curiosity was conducted in August 2014 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida, where it landed on an island in a remote area. Its instruments were designed by NASA engineers and scientists. They tested the water and soil samples collected from the island's surface and tested them against the rocks. Then they were sent to Mars for testing. Test results were published in June 2014 and they came back in July 2014. Since then, they've been published every year, with more than 1,000 samples from all over the globe. Most of those samples have already been collected and analyzed. Read more: NASA, ESA, NASA and other agencies are still working to confirm the findings. Here's what we've learned from this test: The results are not yet known, however, what will happen when Curiosity gets back to earth. At the very least, you can expect to hear more from NASA. On the other hand, I can't wait to try it out again. Let's hope that NASA will do the same thing again next year and see what it does with all these instruments. Do you have any questions?

        "target": "A borderline war The crisis in Syria is in danger of drawing in neighboring countries. Despite the Syrian government's immediate apology, the shelling on the Turkish border has led to concerns about possible escalation. These weren't the first incidents on the Syrian-Turkish border, but the fact that several people on the Turkish side were killed by Syrian shells on Wednesday (03.10.2012) has brought the conflict between the two countries to a new level. It has led the Turkish military to retaliate for the first time. Several people were killed when Turkey shelled Syrian territory. But neither Turkey, which is a member of NATO, nor Syria would benefit from a broader conflict. An adviser to the Turkish president tweeted, \"Turkey has no interest in a war with Syria.\" Volker Perthes, director of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs in Berlin, agrees: \"Assad has no interest in an escalation,\" he told DW. \"That can be seen from the fact that the Syrian information minister apologized and expressed his regret over the victims immediately after the attack on Turkish territory.\" Perthes doesn't think it's likely that the Syrian President, Bashar Assad, wants to provoke Turkey to intervene in Syria. \"That would only accelerate the fall of his regime,\" he said. It's not yet clear who was responsible for the shelling. According to Syria's ally, Russia, it was a \"tragic accident.\" Relationship damaged The armed incidents on the Syrian-Turkish border have been going on for months. According to Amnesty International, some 300,000 Syrians have left their country since the start of the uprising against Assad, and many of them have fled to Turkey. The relationship between the two countries, which used to be close, has deteriorated dramatically, and the Turkish government is now openly supporting the Syrian opposition. \"Turkey is itself a player in the Syrian conflict,\" said Perthes. \"It provides shelter for many refugees and it's through Turkey that supplies come for the opposition.\" NATO has lined up behind Turkey and told Syria to end its \"flagrant violations of international law.\" Call for 'great discretion' The German chancellor, Angel Merkel, has also positioned herself alongside Turkey. \"We call on all parties to show great discretion,\" she said in Berlin. The foreign minister, Guido Westerwelle, declared that everything must be done to deescalate the situation, so that the Syrian conflict did not turn into a conflagration in the region. Indeed, the Syrian crisis is not only spreading to Turkey, but also to Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon. According to Perthes, \"The neighboring countries are partly victims and partly instigators. Jordan too has taken in refugees and supplies the rebels. On the other hand, Iraq has tended to support the government of Bashar Assad.\" Even so, he said, all the neighboring countries had an interest in ensuring the conflict was confined to Syria. Appeal to the international community But the number of Syrian refugees is rising by the day. Ruth J\u00fcttner, a Middle East expert with Amnesty International, believes this will continue in future months. \"It's important that the countries bordering on Syria are supported by the international community in providing accommodation, medical and psychological care and schooling for children,\" she told DW. It's an appeal she directs especially to European countries. The shelling on the Syrian-Turkish border has made it more likely that there will be armed conflict between Syria and its neighbors. According to Perthes, \"It's probably the case that political resistance in Turkey to intervention in Syria is decreasing right now.\"",
        "generated_story": "Turkey's response to the Syrian-Turkish conflict is \"not likely,\" German Institute for International and Security Affairs (DI) director Volker Perthes told DW on Thursday. The German institute for international and security affairs has warned that Turkey will not intervene in the conflict in Syria. \"Turkey is not going to intervene militarily,\" the IISA director said in an interview with DW. He added that the Turkish government would respond with a \"strong response\" if it was asked to do so. In the past, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had called for the withdrawal of troops from the country's southern border with Syria, but that was not the case with Syrian President Bashar Assad, who has been in power since the fall of his father's regime in 2011. Turkey, however, has said that it would be \"very difficult\" for it to take action against Assad and his regime, which it sees as an extension of the Assad regime's power. On the other hand, it has also said it will be very difficult for Assad to act in a way that is acceptable to all Syrians. It is also not likely that Assad will step down from his post as head of state, as he has done with his predecessor, Hafez al-Assad, since he was ousted from power in February 2011 by a military coup. At the time, Turkey was the main guarantor of Assad's rule. Since then, the two countries have cooperated on a number of issues, including Syria's civil war and the lack of an independent judiciary. Last week, Germany's foreign minister, Guido Westerwelle, said Turkey would step up its efforts to help Syria in its fight against the Islamic State (IS) in neighboring Iraq and Syria (ISIS). \"We will continue to monitor the situation closely,\" he said, adding that he would not be surprised if Turkey did not respond to a request for a ceasefire. But he added: \"I think it's not possible for Turkey to step in and take a firm position on the matter.\" The Turkish Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday that Ankara would take the necessary steps in order to prevent a conflict from escalating. According to WDR, a spokesman for German foreign ministry spokesman Guid WesterWelle said the ministry was \"comprehensive\" with regard to Turkey's role in fighting the IS. However, he also pointed out that there was no indication that Turkish troops were planning to withdraw from Syria at the same time as they had been doing so for several months, and that they were not planning on withdrawing from their own country. Germany has not yet decided whether to send troops to Syria as part of a joint operation with the US-led coalition against IS, or if they will send more troops there, according to German intelligence sources. DW reported that German Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble told German news agency DW that \"the Turkish position is very clear that we are not prepared to go to war with Turkey.\" \"There is no reason to think that this will happen,\" Schiauble said at a news conference in Berlin on Friday. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has called on Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu to meet with Turkish officials in Ankara to discuss the issue. She said she would also meet \"with Turkish leaders\" on Saturday. Speaking to DW, she said \"if Turkey does not take any action immediately, I think we will have to wait until the end of this week to see what happens. We are very much looking forward to seeing what Turkey has to say on this issue,\" she added, referring to President Erdogan's recent visit to Ankara, where he is currently in talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin and other foreign ministers. Erdogan, meanwhile, is expected to travel to Damascus on Sunday to attend the NATO summit in Brussels. Merkel is due to visit Turkey later this month, after which he will visit the United Nations General Assembly on Monday. There will also be a meeting with Erdogan on Tuesday, when the meeting is scheduled to be held in Washington, D.C. on June 12. Read more: Syria: What is the next step for Syria?

        "target": "Armstrong stripped of Tour de France titles Cyclist Lance Armstrong has been stripped of his seven Tour de France titles and banned from cycling for life, in a much-anticipated ruling by the sport's international governing body. Monday's announcement by Pat McQuaid, the president of the International Cycling Union, ratified recommendations in an October report from the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), which ordered Armstrong's Tour de France titles be wiped out. \"Lance Armstrong has no place in cycling,\" said McQuaid. Addressing his remarks to cyclists, McQuaid said the fight against doping was his priority. \"UCI is listening and is on your side. We\u2019ve come too far in the fight against doping to return to our past. Cycling has a future and something like this must not happen again.\" The scathing USADA report included testimony from 11 former teammates, accusing Armstrong of running the \"most sophisticated\" doping program in the sport's history. The USADA said it had collected evidence to prove the seven-time Tour de France winner had engaged in the biggest doping conspiracy to date. Effect on cycling and sponsorship Monday's decision comes as the sport of cycling reels from Armstrong's well-documented fall from grace. Organizers of the Tour de France will be trying to move on from the scandal as the race prepares to celebrate its centenary next year. Sponsors have been deserting Armstrong and the sport in general. Last week, Nike - one of Armstrong's main corporate sponsors - said it was terminating its relationship with the cyclist and accused him of deception. Trek, the company that made the bicycles Armstrong rode to seven titles, announced on the same day it would terminate its sponsorship contract - as did the beer maker Anheuser-Busch. The Dutch institution Rabobank ended its association with professional cycling after the doping allegations came to light, leaving 17 riders in need of a sponsor. Last week Armstrong also announced he would step down from his own charity, the Lance Armstrong Foundation, also known as Livestrong, a move believed to have been intended to limit the damage to the organization from the USADA report. Armstrong appears Lance Armstrong spoke briefly to thousands of riders in Texas at a benefit organized by his charity, the day before UCI's decision. \"I've been better, but I've also been worse,\" he said. \"Obviously it has been an interesting and difficult couple of weeks.\" jr/rc (Reuters, AFP, AP)",
        "generated_story": "Lance Armstrong stripped of Tour de France titles by International Cycling Union Lance Armstrong has been stripped by the International Olympic Committee (IUCN) of his two Grand Tours titles. The former world cycling champion was stripped from his titles in the 2014 and 2015 Tours of Britain and Ireland. He won the 2012 and 2013 Tours, but in 2014 he was knocked out of the Tour of France after failing a drug test. In 2014, he won two more titles, the first in cycling and the second in 2012. But in 2015, Armstrong's career was cut short by a doping scandal that led to his suspension from cycling for a year and a half. \"I think I'm going to have to do something about it,\" Armstrong said in a statement released on his website. Armstrong, who is also a former World Tour champion, said he had no intention of returning to cycling after his doping ban was lifted last year. His suspension came after he failed an anti-doping test in which he tested positive for cocaine metabolites in his urine, according to a report from the European Commission (ECU). Armstrong also failed the test, which was carried out by his team-mates at the end of 2013, and was subsequently banned from racing for life for two years in 2016 and 2017. According to the report, \"the results of that test were not good enough for Lance to win a Grand Tour title.\" The report also said that Armstrong had failed to meet the criteria for being eligible to compete for the title of world champion and that he would not be able to defend his title for another three years due to doping. It also noted that Lance was not allowed to take part in other races, such as the 2013 and 2014 editions, because he did not want to be involved in any of them. Lance's suspension comes after a series of doping tests, including one that was conducted on him in 2006. After the tests were completed, Lance returned to racing in 2009 and 2010, when he became the world's most successful cyclist. Since then he has won three more Tour titles and two of those came in 2011 and 2012, as well as two in 2013. However, in 2010 and 2011 he lost both of these titles to drug tests that were conducted in conjunction with the World Championships in Barcelona and New York. At the time, it was unclear whether the doping test had been conducted at all, or whether it had taken place at any other time. Now he is back in racing, with a new set of results to show for it. This time around, though, his career is looking more and more like a professional cyclist, rather than an amateur cyclist who has never won a title before. That's not to say he doesn't have a lot to prove, of course. For now, that's the only thing he can do: He's still a world-class cyclist and he still has a great reputation as a rider. And he's a very good rider, despite the fact that most people don't know him very well. Nevertheless, there's always the possibility of him being banned for doping, even if it's only for one year or two. If he does get banned, this would be a huge setback for him, especially if he wants to continue his cycling career. What's more, however, is that the sport of cycling has become so much more than just a cycling sport. There are so many things to learn about cycling, too. You can see why Lance is so passionate about his sport and what he believes in and why he loves cycling. So many people want him to get back on the road. I can't wait to see what the future holds for cycling in this sport, for example, cycling is a sport where you can get to know the riders and riders in your own country. Just ask Lance and his family and friends who have been around for so long. They're all very happy with Lance, after all. (Reuters, AFP, dpa, Reuters, AP) Lance has always been a big fan of racing and I have always thought he'd be the best rider to beat the competition, so I think he'll be an excellent rider for many years to come. Still, I am not sure what to expect from Lance. As a cyclist I've always had a strong sense of pride in my ability to race and enjoy the challenge of competing in races like this one. When I was a kid I used to train and compete at a young age, you'd never know that I could do it in such a short period of time as an athlete. How can I be so good at cycling? What do you think about that? I'd like to think that, at some point, we'll have the opportunity to become an Olympic champion someday. We'll see if we can make the most of this opportunity. Then I hope Lance will be even better than he already is. Let's see how he gets there, then I'll take it from here on out. Will he ever get there? Will I ever be as good as he could be? Well, right now"

        "target": "Bayern blast five as Schalke draw Bayern Munich stamped their authority over the Bundesliga on Saturday, with a ruthless 5-0 drubbing of Hannover at home. Meanwhile, second-placed Schalke and third-placed Frankfurt were forced to share the points. With many critics saying Bayern might as well be given the giant Bundesliga dish already, perhaps the struggle for second is shaping up to be the more compelling battle. But Saturday afternoon's clash between second-placed Schalke and third-placed Frankfurt did not take a decisive turn, with the game ending in a 1-1 draw. Schalke drew first blood in the 11th minute, when Frankfurt's Stefan Aigner was dispossessed in midfield, and Lewis Holtby released Klaas-Jan Huntelaar in front of goal - the Dutchman's first in the Bundesliga since September. But the hapless Aigner waited just over 100 seconds to make amends for his error, when the Royal Blues allowed him a free header that left goalkeeper Lars Unnerstall with no chance. But neither side could make inroads in the second half, which allowed Dortmund to leap-frog both sides and claim second place. Bayern take command Meanwhile the imperious Bayern Munich dispelled any talk of winter form-dip - following last week's draw to Nuremberg - with a brutally efficient 5-0 win at home to Hannover. The Bavarians stormed to a 3-0 lead in just 37 minutes, celebrating a nifty overhead kick for star signing Javi Martinez in the fourth minute. Toni Kroos and Franck Ribery scored the next two against a Hannover side that were torn open at will. The overhead kick was the first for the 40-million-euro ($52-million) signing Martinez, and in the second half new defender Dante also opened his account with a straightforward header from a Kroos free-kick. The festival of football continued just four minutes later, when Mario Gomez - making first Bundesliga appearance of the season - slammed the ball into the net from a tight angle just 30 seconds after replacing Mario Mandzukic. Dortmund win The champions Dortmund, meanwhile, are still nine points behind Bayern after beating Mainz 2-1 away. It was a potentially tricky fixture in the town where J\u00fcrgen Klopp began his coaching career, and Mainz showed their brilliance in the fourth minute, when Elkin Soto knocked a dream ball into the path of Marco Caligiuri, whose volley fairly screamed into the top right corner. Dortmund's own star-Marco - national team player Marco Reus - leveled the scores just eight minutes later. Reus worked himself some room at the outer edge of the penalty area, and slotted a beautiful 17-meter effort into the far corner. And Dortmund's second goal, just before half-time, was equally aesthetic - a vertical ball bisected the Mainz defense perfectly down the middle, where Polish predator Robert Lewandowski got his eighth league goal of the season with a deft lob over the onrushing Christian Wetklo in goal. Allofs' homecoming Bremen's 1-1 draw at Wolfsburg had a special frisson of its own, as Wolfsburg's newly-minted sporting director Klaus Allofs faced the club he had served as general manager for over a decade. And there was some gesticulating from the Bremen bench in the general direction of the Wolfsburg management when the guests took the lead in the 35th minute. Just seconds after Wolfsburg missed several chances, Marko Arnautovic was left free in the box after Eljero Elia found space on the left and cut the ball back for the Austrian to finish. But Wolfsburg got their own back in the second half. In the 62th minute, Bremen were reduced to ten men when Lukas Schmitz was given second yellow card for a hard tackle on Adelino Vieirinha. Just two minutes later, Bas Dost took advantage of their guests' disorgnaization and smashed the ball into the goal after neat piece of play from Vieirinha. Dirty derby The Franconian derby between Greuther F\u00fcrth and Nuremberg was a cagey affair that ended in a frustrating 0-0 draw. The first half was marked mainly by a straight red card for Nuremberg's Markus Feulner after an ugly, flying lunge on Stephan F\u00fcrstner. But the home side's numerical advantage was short-lived - Sercan Sararer was also sent for an early ice bath after his high elbow on Javier Pinola was adjudged worthy of a second yellow card in the 61st minute. But the aggression in the tackles was not matched by ruthlessness in front of goal, and neither side could eke out any clear chances.",
        "generated_story": "Bayern Munich host Wolfsburg in the first leg of the AFC Champions League clash at home on Wednesday. The Bundesliga's top two teams are set to face each other in a first-leg encounter at the Allianz Arena. Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich and Hannover are scheduled to take on their Bundesliga rivals in their first match in six months. After a 1-1 draw at Mainz on Saturday, the two sides will meet again on Tuesday. Bayern, who have won the last three Bundesliga matches, are expected to be in action for the second time in as many years. Last season, they were the only team to win the Bundesliga title, and they will be hoping to do so again this time around. They are also looking forward to the return of their star striker, Toni Kroos, after missing the previous two games due to a knee injury. He has been out of action since mid-October, but he is back on the pitch for a few days. \"I think I'm ready to go,\" he said, adding that he was \"excited\" about the prospect of playing against a German team that is so close to being the best in Europe. However, he added that \"we don't have a lot of time to prepare for this game.\" \"We have to make the most of this opportunity,\" said Bayern's Stefan Aigner, a former Bayern defender who has played in Germany's Bundesliga for over a decade and is now in his first season in charge of his new club. In his second season with the Bavarian club, Bayern have struggled to find the right balance between attacking and defensive football. At the same time, it's not as if Bayern are going to give up on attacking football, as they have been doing in recent years, when they've been able to create chances for themselves and their fans. That's why they're so eager to get back into the competition. For the German side, this is a chance to show they can do it again, even if it means losing a game. On the other hand, there's also the fact that they are playing a very good side in this competition, so they'll be looking to improve their chances of reaching the quarter-finals. It's a good chance that Bayern will have the opportunity to prove themselves again in front of a home crowd, which is the main reason for their success this season. German coach J\u00fcrgen Klopp has said he's \"very happy\" with his side's performance. But he has also said that it is not enough for Bayern to lose to their rivals. Instead, his team-mates will need to step up their efforts to keep the pressure on them. And that's exactly what is happening in Bavaria, where they face a tough task on Monday night. With the loss of Javi Martinez to injury, their hopes of making it through to next week's group stage have come to an end. As a result, Wagner's side have lost their last two Bundesliga games and are now without a point of contention for next season's title. Wagner, meanwhile, have already been eliminated from the group stages, with a loss to Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach and Hoffenheim. Meanwhile, in Nuremberg, former Bundesliga champions Bayern playmaker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar is set for his return to his former club after a two-year absence. If he does not make it back to Bundesliga action, then he will miss out on a place in next year's Europa League final. His return is likely to come at a crucial juncture for both Bayern and Dortmund, although he could still be a key part of that team's future, especially if they want to reach the knockout stages. Germany has a long way to play the next round of Europe's premier club competition and that means it will take some time before they get to that stage. There's no doubt about it, though, that Wagner and Wagner will get their chance, because they know that the Germans are the strongest team in all of Germany. This is one of those teams that can beat Bayern in Group A. Both teams have had a difficult season so far, however, despite having a strong squad and a great chance of winning the league. A win would be an important step in that direction, given that both sides are still very much in danger of being relegated to Group B. Bremen are currently in second place, just two points off the top of Group C. (Reporting by Matthias Mueller, AP, AFP, dpa, Reuters) Bundesliga: Bayern aim to avoid a repeat of last season\u2019s title-clinching defeat to Bayern last year, while Dortmund are in third place. Dortmund have yet to qualify for Europe\u2018s group, having lost to Real Madrid and Inter Milan last time out this year. 'We are very happy with our chances,' says Bayern manager Jurgen Klopp, speaking to reporters after the game in Munich on Sunday, saying he wants to stay in touch with their supporters, rather than to focus on Germany\ufffd"

        "target": "Is China seeking regime-change in North Korea? The sudden reduction in aggressive rhetoric and actions by North Korea has led to suggestions that Pyongyang has realized it has pushed its only ally in the region to the brink of severing its friendship. The announcement in Pyongyang on May 13 of the promotion of Jang Jong-nam to \"minister of the People's Armed Forces\" came out of the blue. Until recently, the little-known commander of an army corps in coastal Kangwon Province, Jang has replaced Kim Kyok-sik, a four-star general with a long track record of loyal service to the regime. The reasons for 70-year-old Kim's replacement are not clear - as with most of the political maneuvers in North Korea - but it may have been his loyalty that cost him his position in the politburo. Kim was widely seen as a hawk in the regime and is believed to have been in command of the operation to shell the South Korean island of Yeonpyeongdo in November 2010, an incident that killed four people, destroyed civilians' homes and infrastructure and dramatically worsened the already strained relationship between Pyongyang and Seoul. By sacrificing Kim, analysts believe, North Korea is signaling that it is backing away from the confrontational stance it adopted after the United Nations imposed new sanctions in the wake of the nation's third underground nuclear test in February. And there are other indicators that Pyongyang is seeking to return to the status quo. The North's troops have been permitted to step down from the highest state of preparedness for war that was initially ordered when South Korea and the US began a series of annual military exercises. Missiles withdrawn Similarly, two Musudan intermediate-range missiles that were identified as being on mobile launchers being operated in eastern areas of the country have apparently been ordered to return to base. In late April, there was concern that test-launches of the missiles would be a further escalation by Kim Jong-un's government and a message that it would not bow to international pressure to halt its nuclear and missile development programs. But the analysts believe the tokens of Pyongyang's goodwill have come too late. \"For the North Korean leader, this is a very difficult time,\" Toshimitsu Shigemura, a professor at Tokyo's Waseda University and an authority on North Korean affairs, told DW. \"Timing is very important here and it is possible that China is moving to abandon Kim Jong-un. The atmosphere between the two nations is changing. China may have decided that it is time for a regime-change in the North, they will not permit the collapse of the country because they do not want chaos on their own borders.\" Further evidence that Beijing is slowly tightening the screw on its erstwhile ally comes as more state-run financial institutions sever their links with banks in North Korea. The latest institution to adhere to the government's orders to halt transactions across the border is the Bank of China, one of the four major banks in the country, which announced on May 7 that it would cease dealings with the Foreign Trade Bank of North Korea, which has been identified as being involved in Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs. Contingency plan in place Intelligence sources have passed on to DW information that Beijing has a contingency plan in place for when Kim Jong-un's control over the country crumbles. The reports confirm that China is indeed quietly encouraging regime change and is grooming Kim's brother, Kim Jong-nam to take over his role. At 42, Kim Jong-nam is the oldest son of Kim Jong-il, the dictator who ruled North Korea with an iron fist for 17 years until his sudden death in December 2011. Kim Jong-nam had been expected to assume the leadership after his father's death, but fell from favor spectacularly in 2001 when he was detained with two women and a boy aged 4 at Tokyo's Narita International Airport travelling on a forged Dominican Republic passport. He later admitted that he had wanted to visit Disneyland. He subsequently lived in Macau and Beijing, under the close watch of the Chinese authorities. The reports suggest that after Kim Jong-nam is installed in Pyongyang, his brother will be permitted to go into exile, probably in China. The tactic is not without its pitfalls, however, in part due to the efficiency of the campaign to deify their young leader as the future of the nation. Kim Jong-nam as 'new king' \"China may be dreaming of appointing Kim Jong-nam as the new king - and he is more preferable to the West than Kim Jong Un - but the problem is that he is not known in North Korea,\" said Ken Kato, director of Tokyo-based Human Rights in Asia. \"Many people in Japan know much about the North Korean 'Royal Family,' but this information is hidden in North Korea,\" he said. \"Even residents of Pyongyang know very little about Kim Jong-nam.\" Yet the reports are gaining credence among North Korea-watchers. Jun Okumura, a political analyst with the Eurasia Group, told DW that North Korea withdrawing",
        "generated_story": "North Korea's 'new king' Jang Jong-nam has been named as the country's new king by the United Nations. The new leader of North Korea is expected to be named Kim Jong Un, according to a report in the International Business Times (IBT) on Friday. North Korean leader Jaggyong Nam, who has ruled since the end of the Korean War, has also been dubbed the \"unification king\" by some as \"the new Kim.\" In his first public appearance since taking power, Kim said he was \"very happy\" with his new title. \"I'm very happy that I'm going to have the title of king,\" he said, adding that he hoped the new crown prince would be able to make his mark on the world by becoming the first person to become the head of state. Kim, however, did not rule out the possibility of a change in leadership. He said in an interview with the New York Times that Kim had been chosen as his successor by his father, the late Kim Il-sung, to succeed him. In the interview, he also said Kim was the most important person in his life, and that \"he is a very good leader.\" Kim also praised Kim as a \"great leader\" and called him \"a great person.\" The two men have been close friends since they were teenagers, but Kim's rise to power has come at the expense of his own family and his country. But Kim is not the only one who is looking forward to the day Kim becomes the next Kim. On Friday, his wife Kim Kyok-sik and their two children were born in Pyongyang, which is also the capital of South Korea. Since Kim took power in late 2011, a number of defectors have fled to neighboring countries, including the US, China and Japan, in search of jobs and a better future for their families. Last year, two North Koreans were killed in a car accident in their hometown of Yeonpyeongdo, near the border between North and South Korean capital Seoul and the North's capital, Seoul, were also killed by a suicide bomber. According to reports, more than 1,000 people have died in that incident, as well as hundreds of thousands of refugees and asylum seekers who fled their country to escape persecution in neighboring China. Pyongyang has denied the allegations, saying it is seeking a peaceful solution to its nuclear and missile program. However, it has said that it will continue to fight for its own survival and will not allow Kim to take power again until he is in power. It is unclear how long Kim will rule, or if he will even be allowed to rule again. China has repeatedly called for a ceasefire between the two Koreas, accusing Pyongyang of violating the terms of an armistice and an arms embargo. Beijing has called on Pyongyang to cooperate with international efforts to resolve the crisis. Washington, Tokyo and Seoul have all agreed that a truce must be reached to end the nuclear standoff. For now, though, they have yet to reach an agreement on what to do about the situation. A spokesman for China's Foreign Trade Bank, Toshimitsu Shigemura, told DW: \"We don't want to talk about it. We're not talking about a war, we want a peace agreement.\" \"But it's not about war. There's no war,\" the spokesman added, referring to an ongoing dispute between Pyongyang and Beijing over the issue of nuclear weapons and how to deal with Pyongyang's nuclear program, \"but there's a conflict of interest between us and Pyongyang.\" He added that China would like to see an end to this conflict, even if it does not involve the use of force, because it would not be possible to prevent it from happening. Meanwhile, Beijing and Washington have already imposed sanctions against Pyongyang for the sake of their own security interests. They have also warned that Pyongyang could be forced to give up its weapons of mass destruction if they do not comply with UN sanctions. This is the latest example of how Pyongyang is trying to undermine the international community's resolve to put pressure on its leaders. As a result, many of its citizens are not willing to sign up for any kind of truce. Many of them are concerned that the conflict could lead to further escalation of tensions between their countries. That's why we're calling for an international ceasefire, rather than a cease-fire. What's the point of this truce? What is it? Is it really about? Do you think that this will be the last chance for peace? How long will it last? The situation is still very tense for Kim and Kim? It's still a long way from the time when the Kim regime was overthrown? \"It's very difficult for us to know,\" said Jun Okumura of China-based Eurasia Group, an independent think-tank based in Beijing, citing a recent report from a former diplomat in Seoul. Experts say the truce is unlikely to go far enough to achieve a deal on nuclear disarmament. So far, there is no sign of any sort. If Kim"

        "target": "UK lawmakers propose jail sentences for reckless bankers A British parliamentary commission has completed its work on the overhaul of the domestic banking sector. Among other things, it proposed jail terms for bankers displaying grave malpractice and causing huge damage. Members of the UK's Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards agreed Wednesday that Britain needed a radical overhaul of its scandal-hit lenders. The panel, which was mostly composed of lawmakers, concluded in its final report that senior bankers must be made personally responsible for malpractice through the introduction of a new criminal offence of reckless misconduct. It would carry a prison sentence. The reputation of the country's banking sector had been damaged in recent years by a string of scandals, including Libor rate-rigging, credit insurance mis-selling and a controversy over staff behavior and bonuses in the run-up to the 2008 global financial crisis. The level of malpractice had been \"shocking and widespread,\" said the commission's chairman, Conservative party lawmaker Andrew Tyrie. RBS cut in two? \"Taxpayers and customers have lost out, and the economy has suffered,\" the 500-page report said. \"Under our recommendations, senior bankers who seriously damage their banks or put taxpayers' money at risk can expect to be fined, banned from the industry or in the worst cases go to jail.\" The commission called for bankers to sign up to a new code of conduct under which all key responsibilities within a bank would be assigned to specific senior officials who would be held responsible. The panel also proposed that more remuneration for bankers should be deferred for longer periods of up to ten years in order to \"reflect the longer run balance between business risks and rewards.\" The commission recommended that the government consider splitting the state-rescued Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) into a good bank and a bad one mopping up toxic assets. The report was published ahead of a key speech by Finance Minister George Osborne on his bank reform plans. hg/ipj (AFP, Reuters)",
        "generated_story": "Reprehensibility of Bank Mafia: A British Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards (PBS) has issued a report on the banking mafia in the UK. The commission, which is chaired by Andrew Tyrie, said it was \"deeply troubled\" by the widespread perception that banks are rife with fraud and corruption. \"This is not the first time that we have seen this,\" the commission said in a statement, adding that it would be \"very difficult\" for banks to prove that they are not involved in financial crime. It also said that there was no evidence to suggest that the Mafia was behind the rise of the financial crisis in Britain. But it added that \"it's not just the banks that are involved, it's the people who are responsible for it.\" The Commission's report, published on Tuesday, was commissioned by Prime Minister George Osborne, who is also the finance minister for the British government, and is expected to recommend changes to banking laws and regulations to the country's banking system, including the introduction of new banking standards, as well as the creation of a new regulatory framework for banking. This is the second time in as many years that a parliamentary commission has been set up to look into the bank Mafia. Last year, the Commission issued an independent report that found that bank fraud was widespread across the globe. In the United States, banks have been accused of fraud, corruption and tax evasion, according to The Financial Times and other news outlets. Bank fraud is a major problem in many countries, particularly in Europe, where it is illegal to have a bank account with the same name as your bank. That is, if you don't have one, then you're not going to be able to tell the difference between the two. For example, in Germany, there is no bank that has a banking license and no license to do business with anyone other than the Bank of England and the European Central Bank (ECB). The ECB is set to hold a public hearing in London on Wednesday to discuss the issue of banking fraud. According to reports, a number of banks and financial institutions are suspected of having bank accounts and that some of these accounts are linked to a criminal organization called the \"Bank Mafia.\" It is unclear whether the allegations are true or not, but it seems to me that this is something that should not be allowed to happen in any other country. There are a lot of problems with banking in this country, for example the fact that many banks do not have licenses to conduct business in other countries. One of those problems is that most of them operate in countries where there are no regulations on banking, such as Italy, Spain, Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Italy and Spain. These banks, however, have no licence to operate, so they have to abide by laws that prevent them from doing business there. They are also not required to carry out banking transactions in their own country and they cannot do so without the consent of their customers. As a result, they can't do banking legally. And that's a problem that can only be solved through the use of legal means. If they do that, that means they will be forced to pay a fine, or at the very least, lose their license. However, this doesn't mean they won't be punished for their actions. I think that is exactly what is happening in banking today. You can read the report here and here. Read the full report: \"The bank mafia is back in business and it has become a very big problem for many of us. We are in trouble because of this, because we are so obsessed with it,\" said former banking regulator Andrew Trie. He is now the chairman of PBS. His report was published in The Sunday Times, an online newspaper, on Monday, May 14, 2017. Tries to make the case that banking should be regulated by a regulator, he said, is \"a very difficult task.\" He said he would like to see more regulation and regulation of financial markets, especially in relation to banks which are subject to regulatory scrutiny, to ensure that regulators have the authority to regulate and regulate the industry. To that end, I would recommend a regulation that would make it easier for them to comply with regulations. (Reuters, AP, AFP, dpa, Reuters)Trie also called for a review of British banking regulations, saying the government should do more to protect the integrity of institutions and institutions. A review would also be necessary to prevent banks from operating in areas where banks cannot operate without regulatory oversight. Under the current rules, banking regulation is already in place in some areas of Europe and in certain countries like the US and Canada. Many banks in these countries have already been fined by regulators and regulators for failing to follow the rules. At the time of his appointment as finance Minister, Tariq Ahmad told the BBC that he was not aware of any such regulation, \"I think we need to take a firm approach to this issue.\" \"It is very important that people are aware that regulation can be done,\" he told The BBC's editorial board and not only"

They were originally arrested for taking photographs of restricted areas. Slovak citizens detained by the Iranian authorities on suspicion of taking photographs out of bounds have returned home, said Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico. Eight people in total were arrested in May after taking photographs of restricted areas. A Slovakian news website said the group was detained near the central city of Isfahan, where Iran has nuclear facilities. The six that have been freed attended a news conference held by Prime Minister Fico in the capital, Bratislava on Sunday. Fico told reporters that the government was working to secure the release of the remaining two paragliders who are stiil in custody. \"Negotiations were fair and their result is the release of six out of eight detainees,\" Fico was quoted as saying on the government's website. He added that Slovakia had not made any \"financial commitments\" in the negotiation process. Detainees 'unaware' of rule-breaking One of the released paragliders, Vladislav Frigo, said the group did not break any rules it was aware of. \"We had information that there was a ban on taking photographs below the height of 2,300 metres. We were taking pictures from higher (altitudes),\" said Frigo. He added that the detainees were well treated, had access to television, a refrigerator and could cook for themselves as well as getting regular meals. Foreign nationals accused of spying In recent years, Iran has levelled accusations of espionage against both foreign nationals and Iranians. Two U.S. citizens - Josh Fattal and Shane Bauer - were sentenced to eight years in jail for spying after being arrested while hiking along the Iraq-Iran border in 2009. They denied espionage - neighbouring Oman helped secure their release in 2011 by posting bail of 1-million US dollars (756,000 euros). Last year, Iranian-American Amir Hekmati was sentenced to death for spying for the CIA, but judges overturned the decision and ordered a retrial. lw/ipj (Reuters, dpa)",
        "generated_story": "Six Slovak paragliders released by Iranian authorities have been released on suspicion of spying in Iran. Six Slovaks were released after being released from prison on Tuesday. The men, aged between 30 and 60, were taken to the Iranian embassy in Bratislava, where they were being held for questioning. They are believed to have traveled to Iran to meet with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and his wife, Isfahan, to discuss the country's nuclear program. Fico, who is from Slovakia, is one of the six men released under the terms of an extradition agreement with the United States. He was released in the early hours of Tuesday after a three-day trial in which he was sentenced to five years in prison for spying on Iran's Revolutionary Guards. According to a court document, the men had been detained in Tehran for more than a year and a half. \"They are suspected of being involved in a criminal conspiracy,\" the document said, adding that they had fled to Tehran in order to avoid being extradited to face charges of espionage and attempted murder. In addition, they have also been accused of providing false information to Iranian officials about their activities in Slovakia and Iran, according to court documents obtained by The New York Times. Prosecutors have said they are seeking to extradite the two men and have asked for their release in exchange for information on their alleged involvement in an Iranian plot to overthrow the government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban. A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, Vladislav Frigo, told the paper that the charges against the three men were \"unfounded.\" \"We are not aware of any evidence that this is the case at all,\" he added, referring to his ministry's role in setting up the Iran-Turkey relations between Iran and Slovakia. On Tuesday, he said he had received a letter from Tehran's foreign ministry asking him to return to Slovakia if he did not want to cooperate with an investigation into the allegations against him, which has been ongoing for some time,\" Friga said. Slovakia has also released a list of people who were arrested in connection with a series of alleged Iranian-related crimes, including the murder of a journalist and the attempted rape of his daughter. Authorities have not released the names of those arrested, but they could not be named because they do not wish to be identified because of their age. An Iranian court has ordered the release of all six suspects, and they will be tried in absentia. Iran has denied any wrongdoing, saying it is not responsible for its actions and that it does not have the right to do so. It is also not the first time it has tried to interfere with justice for victims of human rights violations. Last year, Iran accused Slovakia of trying to cover up its crimes against its own citizens, accusing it of failing to protect the interests of its citizens. This week, a group of Iranian nationals was arrested and charged with attempting to defraud the authorities of millions of euros ($1.3 billion) in cash, money laundering and other financial crimes. At the same time, Tehran said it was also seeking the extradition of two American citizens who had committed crimes in Iraq and Syria, as well as a number of other countries. One of them was convicted of treason in 2006. Another accused Iranian intelligence officer, Shane Bauer, was charged in that case. Both men have pleaded not guilty to charges related to an alleged attempt to assassinate the head of state of Iran in 2009. But the trial is still ongoing and is expected to take place later this year. Iranian prosecutors have yet to rule on whether or not they intend to file a case against any of these charges. Meanwhile, Iranian investigators are still looking for evidence of possible links between the four men's activities and their families. Tehran has repeatedly denied the accusations and said the arrests were politically motivated. Analysts have accused Iran of using Iran as an excuse to try to influence the outcome of elections in Europe. However, it's not clear if Iran is behind the alleged crimes and has not yet made any arrests. Russia has accused the US of interfering in elections. Moscow has said that Tehran is preparing for a possible election in 2018. Russian President Vladimir Putin has called for an election that could be held in November. Reuters, AP, AFP, Reuters and The Associated Press have reported that Moscow is considering a move to arrest the five men who are wanted by the U.S. intelligence agencies for alleged links to Moscow. If the investigation is successful, Russia is likely to release the remaining suspects within the next few months. Foreign ministry spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Reuters on Wednesday that Iran would not comment on the matter, citing \"the lack of cooperation between Moscow and Washington.\" Reuters reported on Monday that a Russian intelligence official in Moscow had told Russian officials that Russia was planning to launch an espionage operation against Slovakia's president, Sergei Lavrov, in retaliation for Moscow's decision to bomb the presidential palace. Officials have denied that any such operation would be carried out by Russia. Experts say it will not happen, however, that such an operation is unlikely to succeed, despite the possibility of taking place"

The 89-year-old did not say when exactly his resignation would take effect. Calling the move a personal decision, President Giorgio Napolitano made his announcement during an end-of-year speech on Wednesday. \"I'm about to step down, to resign as the constitution expressly allows,\" he said, adding. \"I've reached an age that brings with it growing limitations and difficulties for me to do my institutional duties, which are complex and very demanding.\" Though he did not say when his resignation would take effect, a potential date is January 13 when Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi is due to give up the country's rotating six-month presidency of the Council of the European Union. Renzi faces a political challenge in organizing a replacement for Napolitano, dubbed by Italian media as \"King George.\" The president has served as a key intermediary between political parties through numerous changes in government and other tricky political situations. Napolitano, a former communist respected by Europe and Washington, took office in 2006. At the end of his seven-year mandate in 2013, he was asked to stay on because parliament could not agree on his successor. At the time he warned he may not serve out the full term, given his age. In Italy, presidents have loosely-defined powers including the ability to nominate prime ministers, dissolve parliament and veto legislation, as well as use the moral authority of the office to influence politics. se/cmk (dpa, Reuters)",
        "generated_story": "Giorgio Napolitano resigns as European Union president Italy's president has resigned as the bloc's head of state, the EU's foreign affairs chief said on Friday. The president of the European Council of Ministers, Matteo Renzi, announced his resignation in a statement. \"I have decided to step down from my post as EU president,\" he said in the statement, adding that he would not accept the resignation of his predecessor. Napoli's resignation comes after a series of resignations in recent weeks, including one in which he was forced to resign over a corruption scandal that led to the dismissal of a number of EU ministers. He had been in office for more than a year and a half, but was unable to get the job done due to a lack of support from the international community. His resignation came a day after the Italian government announced that it would no longer be able to form a government without the support of other EU member states. It was the first time that a foreign minister had resigned from his post, and it was only the second time in his tenure that the president had not been replaced by a member state. In the past, he had served as president for three years, before resigning in 2011. Since then he has been the country's chief of staff for the last four years and has served in that capacity since 2013, when he took over the presidency. During that time he also took on the role of European Commission president, where he served for two terms, as well as as vice-presidency and as finance minister. At the same time, his first term as Italian president was marked by the departure of several EU members, such as Germany, France, Spain, Italy and the United Kingdom, which had previously been his deputy. This was followed by an election in 2015, during which the new president's term was extended for another two-year period, until the end of 2017. After the elections in June and July this year, Napolano was appointed to fill the post of president. But he resigned on July 1, 2017, citing personal reasons. According to Italian news agency ANSA, it is not clear whether he will be reappointed, or if he is going to take a leave of absence. However, Italian media have reported that his replacement will not be named until he leaves office in January, after which it will have to be announced. Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta, who is currently in Rome, has said he won't be returning to Rome until after his term ends in 2018, will take the oath of office. Italy is also expected to seek a second term in 2019, following a period of transition that began in 2013. A new government has also been formed, with the aim of creating a new constitution that will make it easier for Italians to have a say in their own lives, rather than having to go through the political process of life. That would be a very difficult task, given the current political situation in Italy. Many Italians, however, do not want to see a change in government. For example, they don't like the idea of having a president who doesn't have the authority to appoint a successor. They want a leader who has a clear vision of what the future holds for their country. And that's not the only reason for this change. There's also the issue of who should be in charge of this country and what that means for Italy, because it's a country that is so important to them. I think the most important thing is that there is a strong sense of responsibility and responsibility for what we're doing in our country, that we are doing as a people, not just as an institution, to our people. So, let's talk about that, shall we? Let's look at what's going on here. What do you think? What are your thoughts on this? Do you agree with me? Is this the right thing to do? If so, what is your position on that? I'm not sure. Let me tell you what you need to know. If you have any doubts about this, I'd like to hear from you. You know what I mean?

We're not a nation that has to live with this kind of situation. Our country is very different from other countries, for example. When you're a European nation, you've got a lot of people who live in different parts of Europe and who have no idea who you are. How can you be the leader of your country? That's one thing that I can't do in my own country right now? It's very important that you know that this is something that can be done, right? And what are you doing?

Although they sent no representatives to Switzerland, Islamists have agreed to halt the fighting. The Islamist-backed militia alliance that took over Tripoli and installed its own government announced a ceasefire on Friday, following a breakthrough in Geneva-based peace talks. Despite not attending the UN-brokered meeting, the militias have agreed to \"a ceasefire on all fronts,\" according to a statement issued by Islamist group Fajr Libya (Libya Dawn). The only condition is that \"the other parties respect the truce.\" The announcement came hours after the United Nations declared that Libya's warring factions had agreed to a roadmap for forming a unity government. Nearly four years after a NATO-backed revolt saw Moammar Gadhafi removed from power, two rival governments each backed by different groups of militias have plunged the country back into chaos and threatened all-out civil war. After the elected government of Prime Minister Abdullah al-Thinni was forced out of Tripoli by Libya Dawn, it was forced to move to the far eastern city of Tobruk while Libya Dawn reinstated the old parliament known as the GNC. The fighting and violence has displaced hundreds of thousands of civilians, left hundreds killed and thousands wounded. Most foreign diplomats fled the country and shut their embassies last year. The Tobruk government, as well as a few other factions who favor a peaceful resolution, came to Geneva to work on \"confidence-building measures,\" which includes the release of detainees from both sides, opening closed ports and securing safe freedom of movement around the country. es/bw (AP, AFP, Reuters)",

The two-day-long ceasefire began on Saturday, with the GNC, the UN peacekeeping mission in Libya, declaring it a \"peaceful ceasefire.\" The ceasefire was announced by the government of President Moammar Gadhafi, who has been in power for more than two years. It is the second day of talks between the two sides, which have been going on since the beginning of the year. In the first day, a truce broke out between two rival factions that had been trying to reach a deal to end the civil war. On Sunday, both sides agreed to a cease-fire in a bid to resolve the conflict. At the same time, they called for an end to the fighting between pro- and anti-Gadhafi factions. \"We are not going to allow this to happen again,\" said the foreign ministry spokesman, Ammar al Thinnis, adding that the ceasefire would not be renewed until a new government was formed in Tripoli. He added that there would be no change in government policy, but that it would still be difficult for the regime to impose its will on the people of Tripoli and other parts of eastern Libya. Both sides have said they will continue to hold talks in Geneva, Switzerland, on Sunday and Monday, until they reach an agreement on a transitional government. A ceasefire is expected to be agreed on on Monday and Tuesday, he said. However, it is unclear whether the truce will be extended beyond the three days that have passed since last week's ceasefire broke down. According to UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric, \"the ceasefire has not been reached and will remain in place until the end of this week.\" In a statement released on Friday, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he was \"very optimistic\" about the prospects for a peaceful transition of power. But he also said that \"there is still a long way to go in terms of reaching a lasting peace agreement.\" \"I am very optimistic that we will reach the agreement,\" he added, referring to talks that began in late January and ended in early February. Since then, however, talks have stalled, and there are still several days left before the next round of negotiations is scheduled to take place on Tuesday and Wednesday, according to U.N. spokesman Zeid Ra'ad Al-Jubeir. Last week, Libya's government said it had reached a peace deal with a group of opposition groups, including the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Russia and Russia, that would allow it to move forward with its own peace process. UN envoy Antonio Guterres, meanwhile, called on Libya to agree to an interim ceasefire, saying it was the right thing to do, given the current situation and the fact that Libya is facing a difficult time in its long-term political transition. 'We have to find a way forward,' he told a UN panel of experts on Wednesday. There is no agreement yet on how to achieve a permanent solution to this conflict, though he did say that he would like to see a temporary truce between Libya and its former leader, former dictator Moamermar Gaddafi, be allowed to return to power in his new role as the country's prime minister. That would mean the withdrawal of troops from the capital, Tripoli, from his current position of vice-president, Misrata, after a month-and-a-half-year term in office. As a result, there is a lot of uncertainty about what will happen next, as well as how long it will take to implement the new deal. Many observers believe the deal will go through. Some observers say it could take longer than that because of a lack of progress in negotiations. Others say the talks are unlikely to produce a breakthrough. Still, some observers are skeptical that any agreement is likely to come to fruition, especially if the negotiations can be reached quickly. They also believe that talks will not go far enough to avoid a conflict that could lead to further bloodshed. This is not the case in any way. After all, this is just one of many areas where the Libyan government has failed so many times in recent years, many of which are already in turmoil. For now, at least, no one is willing to give up their positions. And that's not even close to being able to make a final decision on whether or not it's a good idea to start a fresh chapter in their political life. So far, so good news for Libya: The UN has already made it clear that they are prepared to discuss the future of democracy in this country, even if it doesn't happen. If it does not happen, then it won't be a very long time before a resolution is reached.

The council considers this a violation of the spirit of cooperation between the CPT and the Council of Europe's member states. According to the CPT's 24th General Report, released on Wednesday, reprisals were carried out against prisoners in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Greece, Hungary, Moldova, Russia, Spain, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and Ukraine. \"Intimidation or retaliation against persons the CPT has interviewed may not only violate their human rights but also strikes a blow to the preventive mechanism established by the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture,\" CPT President Letif H\u00fcseynov said in a statement. \"I urge national authorities to respect their obligation to prevent, investigate and punish such actions.\" The report also highlighted several problems with the detention of juveniles around Europe, and proposed a series of practical measures to protect young people's rights when detained.

Once inside, the CPT also has the right to interview any detainees it chooses - in private, though of course the detainees have the right to refuse. \"The first thing to say is how important the CPT is,\" said Carla Ferstman, director of Redress, a UK-based organization that helps torture survivors. \"As a result of their boot work over a very long period of time, the UN has set up a global system which in many ways mirrors the approach of the CPT.\" But given that the committee has no powers to enforce its proposals to governments, there are question marks over its effectiveness. \"In the report, they complain about how some of the recommendations they've made have not been implemented,\" said Ferstman. \"It's a sign that they're a little bit frustrated.\" But in the long run, she maintains, the CPT has more than proved its value. \"The dialogue that they are able to have is really important,\" she said. \"Looking long-term, they have been very effective.\" CIA collusion, asylum seekers The CPT's report comes a day after Amnesty International released its own report on European collusion with the CIA's torture program. While the CPT's report examines more prosaic day-to-day mistreatment, rather than mass rendition of terrorist suspects at the behest of the US, there are obvious links between the two, since some countries - such as Poland, Macedonia, and the UK - are highlighted in both reports. \"What is finally coming out in all of this is that the Europeans, despite all the criticism of the Bush and Obama administrations on the use of torture - so many of them connived,\" said Judy Dempsey, senior associate at Carnegie Europe. \"It's really a double standard. This report is quite damning and quite shameful, and it follows the Amnesty International one as well.\" The CPT's work also mentions the mistreatment of asylum seekers, a problem increasingly afflicting European countries that take in the largest number of asylum seekers - particularly Spain, Italy, and Greece. \"With Greece there are two things to remember,\" Dempsey told DW. \"A - the appalling situation of the prison system, and B - the lack of training among police of how to deal with asylum seekers. Awful things have happened. Parallel to this is the illegal detention centers. There have been lots of cases of terrible mistreatment over the last several years.\" \"Immigration detention is a growing issue,\" added Ferstman. \"In the UK, there was a whole parliamentary inquiry into one immigration detention center, where some of the women alleged that guards propositioned them in order to get quick treatment on their claims. Each country has its own history of torture.\"",
        "generated_story": "The CPT is a European problem too -- and it's time to step up its game. The United States has been accused of using torture in the past, but now it appears that the US is stepping up efforts to tackle the problem. \"We have to do something about it,\" said Carla Ferstman, head of the Council of Europe's Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT). \"It's not just about torture. It's also about human rights,\" she said, adding that it was \"a global problem.\" The US government has also accused the CIA of torturing its own citizens, including children and women, in order to prevent them from being able to leave the country. US President Barack Obama has called on the U.S. government to take action to end the practice of torture, which has led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people across the globe since the end of World War II. In Germany, for example, the death penalty is the most severe punishment for crimes committed during the war on terror. But in other countries, torture is not the only crime. There are other crimes that have been committed in Europe, such as torture and forced disappearances. For example the torture of children under the age of 12, and the use of force against women and children, are crimes against humanity, according to a report by the International Criminal Court (ICC). The CIA, however, has said it will not use torture at all. According to an analysis by DW, \"The US has used torture as a tool to justify its actions in a number of European countries,\" including the UK, France, Italy, Spain, Greece, Japan, China, Russia, Turkey, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Yemen and Yemen. These countries have long been targets of US and EU torture policies. Now, they are facing a new challenge: how to stop it from happening in their own countries. This time, it is going to be more than just torture: It is also the first time that a US president has made such an effort to protect the rights of victims of war crimes. That is why the United Nations is now calling for an end to torture for those who have committed atrocities against their fellow citizens. And that is exactly what we are doing. We are working to make sure that we have the tools we need to combat this problem in our own country, so we can do it without the aid of foreign governments. I think that's a very important step in that direction. If we do that, we will have a lot of success, because the world will be better off if we don't have this kind of situation. As I said before, this is an extremely difficult situation to deal with, especially when you have so many people who are suffering from the consequences of what has happened to their families and their loved ones. You can't do this without having the right people in your life, right? That's what I'm trying to tell you. Letif H\u00fcseynov, a former CIA director, told DW: \"I think it would be a mistake to say that you should not be doing this.\" He added that there was no need for torture because torture was not something that could be done in any other way. However, he also said that torture should be treated as an act of justice, not as punishment. He also added, there is no reason why torture must be allowed to happen in this country and that \"it shouldn't be tolerated.\" \"There's no justification for tortures,\" he said. At the very least, that doesn't make it any easier for people to go to prison. What we're doing is making it harder for them to get out of prison and into a better life. So, let's talk about how torture can be prevented, as long as they're being held accountable for what they do and who they have done it for, rather than because of their actions. They are not doing it because they want to keep their children in prison for a long period of time. No one should ever be tortured, no matter how many times they die, or how long they've been subjected to it. Just ask the European Commission, of course, if you're a member of parliament, to give them a chance to learn more about what is happening to them and what's going on with their lives. (Reuters, AP, AFP, dpa, Reuters) The European Parliament is currently considering a resolution to this issue, with the EU's Foreign Affairs Committee (FJC) calling on President Donald Trump to act on its recommendations. On the other hand, Germany's foreign affairs committee has already made it clear that they will continue to work on this, too. Germany has not done anything to try to change the way they treat their people and how they feel about their country's treatment of them. After all, what can you do? The EU has a strong position on torture? It has done nothing wrong, says the Foreign Ministry, an EU foreign minister, I"

        "target": "Dresden marks 70 years since massive Allied bombing Seventy years ago, Allied bombers attacked Dresden, killing tens of thousands of people, the majority of them civilians and refugees. Every year, the East German city remembers its dead. DW's Naomi Conrad was on hand. As the tram trundled through Dresden's drab suburbs on Friday morning, a prim, elderly woman suddenly turned to her friend sitting on the seat beside her: \"You know, my mother never told me about the bombings.\" She shrugged, then, after a moment's pause, continued. \"It must have been such unspeakable hell that she just couldn't talk about it,\" the woman said. She was referring to February 13, 1945 - the morning, exactly 70 years ago, when Allied bombers swooped down on an unsuspecting city famous for its baroque architecture and that, until that point, had survived the war mostly unscathed. That was to change in the course of three dreadful days: As the bombs rained down on the city, its churches and palaces were turned to rubble. Up to 25,000 people - many of them refugees fleeing the advancing Soviet Red Army - died in the inferno that raged in the city for days. \"There was nothing left, nothing,\" a frail, bent man with a checkered cap recalled, \"just rubble and death.\" He was leaning on the balustrade of a viewing platform in Dresden's old gasometer, staring down at the 360-degree painting by the Iranian-German artist Yadegar Asisi; sirens howled from hidden speakers and strobe lighting illuminated the ruined churches and black smoke billowing from the burnt skeletons that were once buildings. The man swallowed, his voice hoarse, barely audible: \"It's so hard being here.\" The soundtrack and images, he said, \"bring back too many memories.\" 'So, so many dead' He was 15, he recalled, working on a school essay when the sirens began to wail. He never finished the essay. Instead, he ran for shelter with his family. When they returned home three days later, the roof had been blown off, the windows smashed. \"But we were lucky: We survived,\" he said. \"There were so, so many dead.\" His voice broke and, muttering an apology, he shuffled off. The bombings were intended to break the German population's morale - a decision that to many was incomprehensible, given that the war had long been decided and Dresden's economic and strategic importance was relatively minimal. Consequently, the death and destruction wreaked by the Allied bombers quickly became a tool, first for the Nazi propagandists in the last months of the war, then by the East German regime for its anti-West propaganda, and then later by neo-Nazi groups, who traditionally congregate on February 13. Even today, \"the debate continues about guilt and innocence, even about the exact number of victims,\" Dresden Mayor Helma Orosz told a packed audience, including delegations from abroad, gathered for a memorial service in the city's Frauenkirche, which in 2005 was rebuilt with the help of private donations after Germany's reunification, many of them from the United States and Great Britain. Call for peace \"War, hatred and violence begin in people's minds,\" Orosz said. \"We must resist any attempt at once again categorizing people based on their origin and skin color,\" she added, referring to what has often been described as a right-wing catchall movement called PEGIDA, generally translated as Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West, which has taken to the streets in Dresden since October. Later, on a platform overlooking thousands of people, many of them wearing white roses as a sign of peace while bracing the icy cold outside the church, Orosz called on Dresden to remember every victim of the Nazi terror - a plea that was reiterated by German President Joachim Gauck when he took to the microphone: \u201cWe don't want the pain that people suffered here to be misused by others.\u201d Behind him, the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, who, back in the Frauenkirche, had talked of the \u201cmiracle that peace in Europe represents,\u201d leaned in closer to his interpreter. Then, as evening fell over Dresden and church bells tolled, thousands - possibly as many as 10,000, according to the city's press office - lined up along Dresden's riverfront, holding hands to commemorate the dead and call for peace as police men dressed in black riot gear looked on. \"I can remember it all,\" Siegfriede Leonhard, a vivacious woman in her late 70s said. She was 7 when the bombs fell, she said, and had been coming to the commemorations in Dresden \"for at least 60 years.\" Sometimes, she said, stomping her feet to keep warm, she wondered whether she shouldn't remember at home, alone. \"",
        "generated_story": "Dresden, Germany (AP) - Dresden was hit by Allied bombings on February 13, 1945. The city of Dresden, the capital of the former Soviet Union, was struck by a series of bombings in February 1945, according to the German news agency DW. German Chancellor Joachim Gauck visited the city on his way to a visit to visit his wife, Helma Orosz, and their two young children. \"We are in a very difficult time right now,\" he told DW, adding that he was \"very worried about the future of our city.\" The bombing took place in the town of Frauenkirche, near the border with Iran. It was the first bombing in Dresden since the end of World War II in 1939, when the Soviet Red Army bombed Dresden. In the days following the bombing, hundreds of thousands of people gathered to protest against the Nazi occupation. Many of them had fled to Iran, where they were forced to return to their homes in order to escape the war. Some of those who did flee to Germany, however, were able to make it back to Dresden in time. According to DW's Naomi Conrad, a German journalist who worked for the newspaper \"The Sunday Times\", the bombings were carried out by the Soviets, who had been in power for more than a century. Berlin was one of only a handful of cities in Europe to have been hit, she said. Germany was also among the last cities to be bombed by German bombers, which killed at least 1,000 people. Nazi-era bomber Yadegar Asisi (pictured) was killed by an Allied air attack on Dresden during the fall of Nazi Germany in 1941. He was buried in an unmarked grave, with the remains of his family buried under the rubble of a bombed-out building. His body was later found buried beneath a pile of rubble. After the attack, German authorities declared that it was a \"terrorist attack\" and ordered the evacuation of all German citizens from Dresden and other German cities and towns in eastern Germany. A number of German soldiers were also killed, as well as several civilians who were wounded. At the time, many of Germany's citizens were still living in exile in Tehran, Iran and Iraq. On February 14, 1944, Berlin's capital was bombed again, this time by two German planes. This time the bomb was placed on the roof of an apartment building, but it did not explode. There were no reports of any casualties. However, it is not clear how many people were killed or injured, nor was it whether the bomber was deliberately deliberately targeted. No one was seriously injured. Only a few people died, though, because the bombs were placed at the same time as the Allied bombing. That was not the case in Germany at that time and no one knew what was going on in other countries. But it's clear that the Germans were aware of what had taken place. They were not prepared for what would happen. And that's not just the fact that Germany is a country with a long history of anti-Semitism. Germans have long had a deep distrust of Nazism. For years, they believed that Jews were the only people who lived in this country. Now, that distrust has spread to other parts of Europe and the Middle East. These days, there is no doubt that there are a lot of similarities between the two countries, especially in terms of religion and politics. What is the difference between Germany and Iran? It's hard to say, of course, since Germany has always been a Christian country and a Muslim country, so it doesn't have a strong sense of religious tolerance. Yet, in many ways it seems to me that this is precisely what the Nazis were trying to do. As a young man, I think that is exactly what they wanted. I don't think it would be possible for Germany to become a Nazi country in any way. So I'm not sure that they would have done that. If they did that, then I'd be very surprised if they didn't know that we were going to go to war with each other. Just ask the people of Berlin, for example, about what happened in Berlin. You can read more about that here. Read more: The Berlin Wall fell on Monday, April 24, 1947, after the Berlin bombings. Then, on April 25, 1948, Hitler's regime came to power. Hitler was still a dictator. When he took power in 1933, he had the power to take over the country from his father, Josef Stalin. Since then, Dresden has been an important part of that history. From the beginning, we've had to learn to live with it. We've been living under a different kind of system of government. How can we live in such a society? What do you think about it? Is it really possible? The German government should be doing something about this? Do you know what you're doing? If so, how can you do something like that?

Reuters cited a witness who reported seeing the head of a singer from the hip-hop band Barikad Crew make contact with the power line.

Many of the at least 18 deaths came as a result of the ensuing panic, while at more than 40 others were injured, according to local authorities. There was some confusion about the number of fatalities, with the Associated Press putting it at 20, and AFP later reported that only around 10 had died.

The accident occurred on the day of the Carnival in Champ de Mars, the country's largest carnival. More than 1,000 people were injured during the accident, which took place during Carnival celebrations on Saturday. Authorities have said at least 17 people died and more than 2,500 were missing. Police are still searching for the culprits, who are believed to have fled to neighboring countries in search of safety. Haiti's president, Michel Martelly, has vowed to find a solution to the tragedy. \"We are going to do everything we can to solve this problem,\" he told reporters on Sunday, adding that he would seek help from France and the United States. He also promised to work with Haitian authorities to identify those responsible. In the meantime, he said, \"I will do my best to help the victims of this tragedy, and I will be doing everything I can in my power to get them to safety.\" The incident occurred at the end of Carnival, when a group of Haitian Carnival revelers gathered to celebrate the festival. Many of them were Haitian, but others were French, French and French. They were all from the French-speaking region of Haiti, where the festivities are held every year. Some of those who died were from Haiti. Others were Haitians, some from neighboring France, others from other parts of Africa. Haitian officials said they were not aware of what had happened and that they had no idea what was going on. According to local media reports, several people had been injured, while others suffered minor injuries, including a head wound and a broken nose. There were also reports of a number of people who were taken to hospitals, hospitals and other places of emergency, according to Haitian news agency AFP. Most of these deaths were caused by a fire that broke out at a nearby church. It is not clear if the fire was intentionally set on fire, or if it was deliberately set off by an explosion. But it is clear that the cause is still under investigation, with police and military officials saying there was no immediate claim of responsibility. Several other deaths have also been reported in recent days, as well as the deaths of several other people. One man was killed and another was injured when he fell into a river. Another man died after falling from a bridge, police said. Investigators said he was shot in his head and died of his injuries. Other deaths are thought to be related to a car accident that left him in critical condition. Officials have yet to confirm the exact cause of death, though they are not sure if he has been seriously injured. At the same time, they have not ruled out the possibility of an investigation into the incident, a Haitian official told AFP, saying that it could be a case of mistaken identity. This is the second time in as many months that an accident has taken place in which the death toll has risen to 18, after a similar incident in 2010. On Saturday, authorities said that a man who was driving a van was found dead on a highway near the town of Champ De Mars in northern Haiti and was being treated for a heart attack. A police spokesman said the man's death was the result of \"a serious accident.\" \"This is a very serious incident,\" the official said in an interview with the Associated Press, referring to an incident that occurred in December, 2010, that killed two people and injured dozens of others. An investigation is under way to determine whether the driver was responsible for his death and whether he had committed a crime. However, investigators are also looking for any possible motive for this accident and are working to establish a motive. If the case is any indication, it may be that there is an ongoing investigation that could lead to charges against him. That would be the first time the government has tried to make a scapegoat.

The minister added that the cease-fire could be extended depending on the response from Yemen's Shiite Houthi rebels. Al-Jubeir said he hoped the Iran-backed rebels would \"come to their senses\" and agree to the truce. He urged them to stop fighting. \"We hope the Houthis will come to their senses and realize the interests of Yemen and the Yemeni people should be the top priority for everyone,\" he said. It is unclear whether the Houthis would reciprocate the Saudi gesture. \"The cease-fire will end should Houthis or their allies not live up to the agreement - this is a chance for the Houthis to show that they care about their people and they care about the Yemen people,\" the Saudi foreign minister emphasized. At this point, US Secretary of State John Kerry said anyone who cared about Yemeni people \"should take clear notice of the fact that a human catastrophe is building,\" adding that a cease-fire was \"not peace\" and that all parties must find a political solution to end the conflict. Kerry urged all sides to hold talks immediately. Saudi ultimatum Hours before the cease-fire announcement, Saudi Arabia declared a Houthi stronghold along its southern border a \"military target,\" giving an ultimatum to the residents to leave the area, Saudi state-run TV reported. Lately, the northern Yemeni province of Saada has become a battleground for the Shiite rebels and the Saud-led coalition forces as the Houthis carried out border attacks on nearby Saudi cities. More than 50 airstrikes hit Saada overnight and in the early hours of Friday morning, Yemeni officials said. A Saudi-led coalition of Arab states launched an air campaign against the Houthis on March 26. Riyadh accuses Tehran of backing the rebels, who have made significant territorial gains in the impoverished Middle Eastern country, capturing the capital Sanaa and ousting internationally recognized President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, who fled Yemen back in March. The Sunni Gulf states are wary of Iran's increasing influence in the region, and they see the Houthis' advance in Yemen as a move that threatens their regional and geopolitical interests. Over 1,200 people have been killed in Yemen since the start of the Saudi campaign, according to the United Nations. shs/bw (AFP, dpa, Reuters, AP)",
        "generated_story": "A cease-fire in Yemen is set to end on May 12 Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said on Wednesday that a ceasefire in the war-torn country had been reached. \"We have reached an agreement with the Houthis,\" he told a news conference in Riyadh. The truce, which has been called a \"framework agreement,\" is expected to last until the end of the month, the Saudi Foreign Ministry said in a statement. It was not immediately clear how long the truce would last, but it is widely expected that it will last for at least a month. Yemen's Houthi-led government has accused the US, France and Britain of violating the terms of an arms embargo imposed on the country by the United Nations in 2011. Washington has called for an end to the conflict, saying it could take years to reach a resolution. Riyadh has also called on Washington to step up its support for the Yemeni government. US Secretary of State John Kerry, who visited Yemen on Tuesday, said he would meet with Yemeni President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi to discuss the situation in Saada, a southern Yemeni province that has seen a surge in fighting in recent months. He added that Washington was \"very concerned\" about the lack of humanitarian aid, adding that \"we are not going to allow this to happen.\" The US and the UK have also expressed concern that the ceasefire could not be reached in time for a humanitarian crisis in Sanaa, where thousands of civilians have been killed in clashes between Saudi-backed forces and Shiite rebels, according to a US State Department report. A US official told the Washington Post that US President Barack Obama's visit to Yemen last week was to be \"a very good opportunity for us to get to know each other\" and \"to see what is going on in our own country,\" but he did not specify when the talks would take place. On Wednesday, Washington said it would hold an emergency meeting in Washington, D.C. in an attempt to find a way to resolve the stalemate. In the past, US officials have said they had not been able to agree on a date to hold a meeting. But on Thursday, they announced that they would be holding a special summit in Paris on Yemen. They said the meeting would include a number of key issues, including the issue of who is to blame and who will be allowed to take part in it, as well as how to respond to it. According to US diplomatic sources, there were no immediate plans to attend the summit. However, it was unclear whether Washington would attend, and if it did, what would happen next. There was no indication of a possible meeting between the two countries, however, that either of them would have a chance of reaching an accord. As the UN Secretary-General had said earlier this week, \"I don't think there is any chance that we will have an opportunity to make a deal on this issue.\" Washington's foreign policy chief, James Baker, told reporters that he was confident that Yemen would reach an acceptable agreement. Baker also said that Iran would not interfere in any way in its negotiations with Riyadh over the future of Yemen, despite the fact that Riyadh is not willing to do so. Iran has repeatedly accused Riyadh of trying to undermine the fragile peace process. Last year, Riyadh announced a new round of sanctions on Iran, accusing Tehran of supporting Tehran's efforts to overthrow President Hassan Rouhani. Tehran has denied that Tehran was behind the deal, calling it an \"act of war.\" Riyadh also accused Washington of failing to act on its own initiative to prevent the collapse of Iran's nuclear deal with Tehran. Iranian officials said Tehran had also tried to pressure Riyadh into agreeing to extend sanctions against Tehran over its alleged involvement in Iran. Moscow has rejected the idea of lifting the sanctions, though it has so far refused to say whether Tehran would do anything to stop Tehran from doing so, Reuters reported, citing a source familiar with Iranian state media. Meanwhile, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, meanwhile, has said Iran will continue to try to influence the outcome of talks in Geneva. Both Iran and Iran have denied any involvement, Iran denies the allegations, claiming Tehran is seeking an extension of its influence in talks with Washington. Russia, China and China have all denied the existence of Iranian nuclear facilities in Tehran and Tehran, both of which Tehran denies. This is the first time Iran is accused of attempting to interfere with talks between Riyadh and Washington in order to achieve a political solution to its nuclear dispute with Iran - a claim Tehran says is \"basically impossible\" - an accusation Tehran denied on Friday. Reuters, AP, AFP, dpa and AFP reported on Monday that Iranian and Iranian intelligence agencies were involved in discussions with Saudi officials about a plan to build a nuclear bomb on Tehran - the latest move by Tehran to put pressure on Riyadh - but the Iranian side has not responded to Riyadh's demands. Saudi sources told Reuters that this is unlikely to come to terms with any such move. Qatar's ambassador to Washington on Sunday. Read more: \"Iran is also denied it"

        "target": "Aging health: WHO call to action as world population over 60 set to double by 2050 In a new report on aging and health, the World Health Organization is calling for action on \"population aging,\" as figures suggest the number of people over 60 will reach two billion by 2050. People worldwide are living longer, says the World Health Organization in its World Report on Aging and Health. This is both good and bad. It gives us the chance to \"pursue new activities\" as we get older, such as in education and family life. But it all depends on our health. And for that the WHO says world governments need to act now to make sure our societies worldwide are ready. What are the take home facts from the World Health Organization's 2015 report on Aging and Health? The WHO says that in the next 35 years, the global number of people aged 60 years and over will almost double from 12 percent to 22 percent. By 2020, there will be more people over the age of 60 than 5 year olds. And a majority of older people (80 percent) will live in \"low and middle income\" countries. It's estimated that the world's population aged 60 years and older will total about 2 billion in 2050, which is more than twice as much as now. Furthermore, worldwide, about 125 million people are aged 80 years or older. But by 2050, it is expected that this number of people - aged 80 and over - will live in China alone. But I'm not old, so why should I care? Well, all this is happening at a faster rate than ever before. And the WHO says \"all countries face major challenges to ensure that their health and social systems are ready\" for this major demographic shift. It will cost a lot of money to improve health and social infrastructures, especially in more developed countries where traditional families structures have changed dramatically. Surely, there's \"no typical older person,\" though. How does the WHO define aging? We tend to think of older people as physically and mentally frail. But that's not necessarily the case, not everywhere in the world. Old is a relative concept - especially in middle income to rich countries. For instance, some 70 year olds are as fit as some 20 year olds. Just think how many older folk are at your gym, and ask yourself whether you can keep up with all of them. But that still doesn't explain aging. What is it exactly? The WHO says that at a biological level, \"aging results from the impact of the accumulation of a wide variety of molecular and cellular damage over time.\" Basically, this puts people at a higher risk of disease and, of course, death. But aging can also be associated with \"life transitions,\" such as retirement or witnessing other people, such as friends and family, die around you. This can affect you psychologically and sometimes, as a result, physically. What sort of diseases come with old age? Some of the most common non-fatal conditions include hearing loss, cataracts, back and neck pain and osteoarthritis. Other conditions include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - which affects the lungs - diabetes, depression, and dementia. What needs to be done? The WHO is proposing a five-step plan of action, which includes: Committing to healthy aging and \"evidence-based policies to strengthen the abilities of older persons.\" Aligning health systems with the needs of older populations Developing systems for providing long-term care Creating \"age-friendly cities and communities Improving measurement, monitoring and understanding of \"aging issues\" worldwide. But don't forget: \"a longer life brings with it opportunities, not only for older people and their families, but also for societies as a whole.\"",
        "generated_story": "The WHO's Population Aging Plan: Actions Now The World Health Organization (WHO) has announced plans to reduce the number of people living under the age of 65 in the United Nations (UNHCR) and other international organizations. The WHO said it was working on a plan to address the world's population aging problem. \"We are working with the WHO on this plan,\" the organization said in a statement, adding that the plan would be implemented by the end of the year. It also said that it would take time to develop a comprehensive plan for reducing the amount of deaths from the disease, which has been linked to a rise in global temperatures and rising birth rates. According to WHO, it will take at least three years to reach the goal of reaching the level of a healthy population by 2050. In the meantime, there will be a lot of work to be done to make sure that people have the resources they need to live longer and healthier lives. This is not to say that there won't be more deaths, but it's not the first time that this has happened. At the same time, the UN is working to ensure that more people are living longer than ever before, and that they are able to meet the needs of their families and communities. That's why we have been working so hard to get to the point where we are at today. We are also working hard on the prevention and treatment of diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, as well as to improve the quality of life for people who are suffering from chronic diseases like cancer, diabetes and heart disease. There is no doubt that we will have to do more to prevent the spread of these diseases. But it is also important to recognize that these problems are not limited to individuals. For example, if you have an elderly relative, you are likely to have a very high risk of dying. And that's because you don't have enough money to pay for the care of your family. So, what do you do? You take a look at what you can do about it. You can make a list of all the things that you would like to see happen in your lifetime. Then you put your money where your mouth is and go to bed at night and sleep until the next morning. Do you think you're going to die? If so, how will you get there? What are the best ways to achieve this goal? I think the most important thing is to keep your eyes on your children and your grandchildren. I hope you'll do the right thing for them and for your own health. If you haven't already done that already, then you should do it already. Let's start by doing it right now. Don't forget about the fact that your kids are getting older. They're not old enough to understand the importance of having a good childhood, so they can't get sick anymore, right? That is what I'm trying to tell you. Just ask your parents, who have had a child for a long time. What do they think about that? Do they want you to know that their children are growing up too fast? Is that what they're doing? Are they getting sick? Or is it just a matter of time before they get older? Who knows? And what will happen to them when they grow up? How long will that last? Well, that depends on how old they become? The answer is still up to you, of course. As long as you know the answer to that question, they'll be in their 20s or 30s and 40s, or even 50s. (Reuters, AP, AFP, dpa, Reuters) And then there's the question of how long they will live. Is it too late? It's too early for that to happen, because they've already had their own children, too young and too old to even know what's going on with their parents. How will they know? We'll see what the future holds for you in 20 years. Tell us what to expect from them. Read more: How old are you? Tell me about your child's health and how you've grown up. Go ahead and do your homework and decide for yourself. Talk to your doctor and ask yourself that. Have you ever been to school? Ask your doctors and get a doctor to help you out of bed? Let me know your questions and tell them what your health is like? Then tell me the answers to those questions. Learn more about this issue and then tell your friends and relatives. Ask them about their health issues. Find out if they have any questions or concerns. Or, ask them how they feel about you and what are they planning to talk to each other? \"I'm not sure,\" said one of them, \"You'll never know.\" The UN has already made a decision on whether or not you want to become an expert in this area. Here's what we've learned from our own experience. Why is that so many of us are going through the process of becoming a parent? Learn from me. Who cares about them?"

Stephen Harper has stepped down as leader of the Conservatives after nine years in the top job. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper resigned as Conservative Party leader on Tuesday after the Liberals, led by Justin Trudeau, emerged victorious in legislative elections. \"I have spoken to Prime Minister Stephen Harper, and he has instructed me to reach out to the newly elected parliamentary caucus to appoint an interim leader,\" Conservative Party president John Walsh said in a statement. \"The people are never wrong,\" Harper said of his defeat. \"The disappointment is my responsibility and mine alone,\" Harper said, adding that he had called Trudeau to congratulate him. Trudeau calls for hopeful, diverse future In electing Trudeau, the charismatic son of a former popular prime minister, Canadian voters illustrated the growing discontent with nine years of Conservative rule that saw lowering of corporate taxes, avoidance of climate change legislation and disagreement with the Obama administration over the controversial Keystone XL pipeline. \"Canadians have spoken,\" Trudeau said, adding that he would be the man to lead the \"hopeful, positive\" country \"with a vision\" that they had asked for. In his victory speech, Trudeau said his government \"believed deeply in the diversity of our country,\" striking a contrast with the strain of nativism that had become apparent under Conservative rule. \"We beat fear with hope,\" said Trudeau, a 43-year-old former teacher. Liberals blow past projected results Projections ahead of the elections had Harper and Trudeau in a dead heat, but as polls closed on Monday night it became clear that the Liberals had won an outright majority, with a projected 175 of parliament's 338 seats. This represented a huge leap from four years ago when Liberals were handed their most crushing defeat in history with a mere 34 seats. Harper will stay on as a member of Parliament for his constituency, public broadcaster CBC reported, as he was re-elected to his seat. The left-leaning New Democratic Party had hoped to capitalize on its second-place finish in 2011, but only managed to come in third with CBC estimating that the party had garnered 32 seats. es/cmk (AP, Reuters) Have something to say?

        "generated_story": "Stephen Harper steps down as leader of the Conservative Party Stephen Harper has resigned as prime minister of Canada's Liberal Party. Harper, who led the party from 2011 to 2015, is stepping down from his post as the country's Prime Minister following a series of scandals that have rocked the political landscape. The former Conservative party leader has been in office since 2011, when he was elected as Prime minister. He was first elected to the post in 2011 and served until 2014. Since then, he has led his party to a number of victories, including victories in the 2015 election and the 2014 general election. In the last few weeks, Harper and his Liberal party have been on a collision course over the past few months, with the Liberals and NDP, the two largest parties in Canada, losing their majority in parliament in 2014 and 2015. Both parties are now in a coalition government, and Harper's government is expected to remain in power until the end of next year's federal election, which is scheduled to take place on June 7. \"We are going to continue to work together,\" Harper said at the time of his resignation, adding that he would not seek re-election until after the new government takes office in 2019. But he also said he will not accept a second term, saying he had no plans to seek a third term. His resignation comes after months of speculation over whether Harper would be able to win the leadership of a party that has lost so much of its popularity in recent years. It's the first time Harper will have to step down, but it's not the only time he's had to do so. Last week Harper announced that his government would no longer be governed by a single party, rather, it will be led by his own party's new leader, Justin Trudeau. Trudeau's party is currently in opposition to his leadership, as well as his predecessor, former finance minister Jim Flaherty, for whom Harper had been the leader for more than a decade. After Harper was ousted in 2013, a new leadership team was formed to replace Harper. This time around, however, there was a change of heart: Harper could not be trusted to lead a government that had a clear vision of what the future would look like for Canada as a whole. That's when Harper took the reins of power, leaving Harper to form the governing Liberals' governing coalition with his former party. Canada is now the third largest country in terms of population, followed by the United States, France and Germany, where the Conservatives have a majority of 1.5 million. With Harper taking over as PM, Canada has become the second largest party in this country after only two years of Conservative rule, after Canada and France. At the same time, all other major parties have fallen out of favour with Harper in his first term as premier, while Harper is still the most popular figure among Canadians, despite the fact that Harper won the election in 2010 and has a strong support base among the younger generation of voters in both the Canadian and English-speaking Canadian provinces. As Harper leaves office, Trudeau will take over from Harper for the next four years, becoming the fourth-most popular leader in Canadian politics, following Harper on the right and Trudeau on his right. For Harper himself, this is a big step forward in that direction, even if it means taking a step back from the Harper government. On the other hand, that doesn't mean Harper can't be a good man for Harper: \"He's a very good leader and I'm not a bad man,\" he said in an interview with The New York Times last week. Still, many Canadians are not happy about Harper leaving office. They say Harper should be congratulated for his decision to stay on, because Harper did not do enough to change the course of politics. And they're not alone in their criticism of Harper as Harper remains the man who has done so many things to make Canada a better place for Canadians to live and work in. There's still a lot of work to be done, they say, to get the job done. So Harper must be careful what he does and who he says he'll do, or he won't do it again. What do you think will happen to Harper? What will Harper do? \"I don't know,\" Trudeau said, referring to Trudeau, \"but I do know that I think he can do something about it.\" Harper also told the Times he'd like to see Harper take a more active role in governing Canada. However, his position is not as clear-cut as he thinks he should have done before he took office - and that's exactly what Harper does, at least for now - but there's no doubt that Trudeau is the one who will do that, too, in order to achieve his goal of making Canada an even better country to have an inclusive, inclusive country for all Canadians and to give Canadians the opportunity to vote for him. Prime ministers are the ones who have the best chance of becoming a decent leader. I can tell you this: He's been a great leader since he came to Canada for a long enough time"

The government says the measures are no longer necessary because the security threat has subsided. The government said Tuesday it had rescinded the emergency measures \"with immediate effect\" and that \"all fundamental rights that were suspended have been restored.\" President Yameen Abdul Gayoom declared the state of emergency one week ago after the discovery of a homemade bomb and a stash of weapons near his official residence. The finding followed an explosion on Gayoom's speedboat in September - an incident the government labeled an assassination attempt. The president was not hurt in the blast, but his wife, an aide and a bodyguard were injured. The emergency regulations, intended to be in place for 30 days, gave security forces wide-ranging search and arrest powers, and suspended citizens' basic rights. They drew criticism from former colonial power Britain as well as the United States, the European Union and neighboring Sri Lanka. Reading out a presidential decree revoking the emergency, Attorney General Mohamed Anil said there was no longer a threat to the Indian Ocean atoll nation. He said investigations into the September blast and the recovery of weapons had made good progress. The foreign ministry said a number of people had been arrested. Lawmakers also used the security regulations to fast-track the impeachment of Vice President Ahmed Adeeb, who stands accused of plotting the alleged attempts on the president's life. Impact on tourism Attorney General Anil said pressure from the international community, as well as \"the possible adverse impact on Maldives tourism and the economy,\" had also played a role in ending the state of emergency. Foreign tourists visiting the tropical nation, known for its luxury tourist resorts, palm-fringed beaches and coral reefs, contribute close to a third of the country's gross domestic product. The Maldives has had a rocky road to democracy since holding its first multiparty election in 2008. The country's first democratically elected leader, current opposition chief Mohamed Nasheed, was forced to step down in 2012 after a mutiny by security forces. In March, he was jailed for 13 years on terrorism charges in a trial the United Nations said was illegal. President Gayoom is under intense international pressure to release him. Nasheed's opposition Maldivian Democratic Party welcomed Tuesday's announcement. But said declaring the state of emergency in the first place was a political move designed to stop a rally planned for last week calling for Nasheed's freedom. \"It appears that Yameen is willing to make up threats about the nation's security in order to settle political scores,\" the party said in a statement, referring to the president. nm/kms (AP, AF, Reuters, dpa)",

The government of the Maldivian Democratic Party (DDP) said it had lifted the emergency order, which had been imposed by the international community in a bid to calm the country's volatile political situation. \"We have lifted this emergency,\" DDP spokesman Ahmed Adeeb said in an interview with The Associated Press. He added that the situation in the capital, Male, was \"very stable\" and that \"there was no threat to the stability of our country.\" \"The situation is very stable,\" he said, adding that he hoped the government would be able to restore normalcy. However, he added, \"There is still a lot of uncertainty about what will happen in this situation.\" The DPP's Mohamed Nasheed, who is also the party's presidential candidate, has been accused of inciting violence against the opposition. But he has denied the allegations and said he was not aware of any such allegations. A spokesman for the DPO said the president's comments were based on a statement from his office, but he did not elaborate on what the statement was referring to. It is not clear how much of an impact the state-of-emergency order has had on the island nation. DPA spokesman Mohamed Anil told the AP: \"This is the first time that this has happened. There is no reason to believe that it will be the last time. We are not going to allow this to happen again. This is a very serious situation, and it's not something that we want to see happen. I think we need to be very careful with what we say and when we speak to each other. What we are saying is that there is nothing that can be done about it. That is why we have asked for an end to this extraordinary situation and for a change of government. And that is exactly what I am asking for. In the past few days, the United States and the European Union have called for this change. They have been calling for it since the end of last year, when the US, Britain, France, Germany, Japan and other countries have all been demanding that a new constitution be put in place to make it easier for people to get out of their homes and into the streets. At the same time, they have also called on authorities to step in and take action against those who are trying to undermine the rule of law. These are the people who have done the most damage to democracy and human rights, such as the democratically elected president, Yama Abubakar. His government has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, saying it is doing everything it can to protect the rights of its citizens. On Wednesday, a UN Security Council resolution was passed to lift the ban on travel to and from the Indian Ocean nation of India, India and Pakistan. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres announced the suspension of travel from India to India on Wednesday. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also said that India should be allowed to visit India as soon as possible. US President Xi Jinping said on Thursday that his country was ready to meet with the new government in Washington, D.C. to discuss the issue. Indian President Hassan Rouhani, however, rejected the idea of a travel ban, calling it an \"unacceptable idea\" that could lead to an increase in tensions between the two countries. According to a US State Department spokesman, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, this is \"not the case at all.\" India is one of several countries where the UN has expressed concern about the possibility of visa bans for Indian nationals in India. Pakistan is another country that does not have a visa ban for Indians, according to US officials. International pressure on India has increased the number of Indian citizens who travel abroad for work, as well as in China, China and China. Iran has accused India of being a \"hostile country\" for its nuclear programme and has threatened to impose sanctions on Iran, Iran and North Korea. Tehran has said this was an attempt to prevent the release of US diplomats from their country. Washington has condemned the move. China has criticized the decision, accusing it as a violation of international law, while the UK has refused to do so. New Delhi's Foreign Minister, Mohamed Naguib, said earlier this month that Iran was also considering a move to cut ties with India if it were to become an ally of Iran. Reuters reported on Friday that US sanctions against India would not be enough to stop the development of ties between Tehran and Washington. Opinion: The US and India are likely to continue to push India closer to Iran's nuclear deal with Iran over the next few months. Foreign ministers, meanwhile, have said they will continue their efforts to improve relations between Washington and Beijing. United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said last week that sanctions could be imposed on Russia and Iran if they do not do more to ease tensions with Tehran.

Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko was sworn into office on Friday in a lavish ceremony boycotted by Western diplomats. The previous day, the 56-year-old leader openly accused Germany and neighboring Poland of planning a coup against him. \"There were [in Germany and Poland] plans worked out for an overthrow of the constitutional order,\" Lukashenko said in the Belarusian capital, Minsk, on Thursday. \"This is not an invention of our intelligence agencies.\" Lukashenko, who came to power in 1994, was re-elected last month with 80 percent of the vote in what the opposition and international monitors said was a rigged election. Relations between the reclusive Belarusian government and the West have been strained ever since. 'Belarus question must be answered' German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said in a statement that the accusations were \"baseless\" and an attempt by Lukashenko to draw attention away from his own wrongdoing. \"The EU needs to find a clear political answer to events surrounding the presidential election and the continued incarceration of opposition politicians and their supporters,\" Westerwelle said. A wide-reaching crackdown against the regime's opponents followed Lukashenko's re-election. Hundreds of his critics were arrested and dozens threatened with long-term jail sentences. Poland also dismissed the accusations as absurd and said that relations with Minsk would not be normalized unless all political prisoners were released. Sanctions threat The situation in Belarus pushed the European Union to adopt a resolution on Thursday in support of economic sanctions against the country. The threats earned a sharp rebuke from Lukashenko, who promised the \"hardest possible reaction\" should the bloc impose sanctions against his country. At the same time, the Belarusian prime minister, Mikhail Myasnikovich, travelled to Moscow in a effort to shore up Russian support for Minsk during its standoff with the EU. That meeting ended with a Russian promise not to impose its own set of sanctions on Belarus over an unrelated spat over oil exports and a commitment to resume a nuclear power plant project shelved after the 1986 Chernobyl disaster.

        "generated_story": " Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko's re-election bid was marred by accusations of corruption, corruption and a lack of transparency in the country's electoral process. The election was marked by allegations of widespread corruption by the opposition, which has accused the former president of trying to influence the outcome of the vote. In the first round of voting on Tuesday, Belarusians voted overwhelmingly in favor of a new president, who is expected to take office on Jan. 1. However, the results of Tuesday's vote in Minsk did not come as a surprise to many observers. Many observers, however, said that the result could have been different. \"It was a very difficult day for the president,\" said Guido Westerwelle, a former foreign minister from the German state of Darmstadt (Germany). \"There were a lot of irregularities,\" he said, adding that he was not aware of any irregularities at the time. He said he had not seen any evidence of wrongdoing, but that it was \"very clear that there was no corruption at all.\" \"We are not going to allow this to happen again. We will not allow it. It is not acceptable for us to be able to do that. That is why we have to make sure that we are doing everything we can to prevent this from happening again.\" The opposition's main candidate, Mikhail Myasnikovich, won a landslide victory in Belarus' presidential election on Sunday, beating incumbent President Vladimir Putin by a wide margin. Putin, in turn, lost the election to his former rival, Vladimir Zhirinov, with the support of many of his supporters, including former President Boris Yeltsin, and former Vice President Sergei Sobyanov. Belarus has been accused of rigging the elections in a bid to win a second term in office. Moscow has denied the allegations, saying it has no intention of doing so. Analysts say the accusations are based on the fact that a number of people have already been convicted of crimes against humanity and the rule of law, as well as the use of social media to spread false information. Russia, Ukraine, China, Russia and Iran have all accused Belarus of being a corrupt state, while the United States, Britain, France, Germany and Russia all denied any wrongdoing. But the Kremlin has also denied that any such accusations were made against the new President. According to a Reuters report, Moscow and Moscow have also accused each other of supporting the ruling party's efforts to undermine the legitimacy of its rule. This is the second time in three years that Belarus's president has failed to get elected to the presidency. Last year, it voted in favour of an independent presidential candidate who was elected in 2014. Since then, opposition parties have staged a series of protests against him. Some of them have called for him to step down from his post as president. Others have accused him of failing to act on his promises to improve the economy and create jobs for his own people. On Wednesday, he announced he would be stepping down as head of state in order to focus on other areas of government, such as education, health and social services. Other opposition groups have criticized him for not doing enough to address the corruption allegations against his predecessor, former Prime Minister Sergei Shoigu. They also called on him not to interfere in his election campaign. Meanwhile, some opposition politicians have said the President should be given a chance to speak out about the ongoing corruption scandal that has plagued his administration. And they are also calling for an investigation into the alleged misuse of public funds. One of those groups has said it is unlikely that Russia will step in to investigate the issue. Another group of opposition figures, known as \"the People's Party of Belarus\" (PPP), has called the \"People's Democratic Party\" - a group that opposes the current government - to \"act in opposition to President Putin's agenda.\" It's unclear whether this will be the case in future elections, though, because the government has yet to announce a date for a referendum on whether or not it will take place. At the same time, they have promised to hold a special election in 2018. If the poll results are to go ahead as planned, that could be a long time before a vote is held on January 1, 2019. (Reuters, AP, AFP, dpa, Reuters) The main opposition party, PPP, has vowed to appeal to voters to cast their votes in an election next year. Opposition parties, meanwhile, have rejected the idea of holding a runoff vote on Wednesday. Opinion polls show that turnout is likely to fall short of expectations. Polls show a majority of voters will support the incumbent president's bid for another term as soon as he is sworn in as prime minister in January. A poll is due to begin in mid-January. More than a year ago, polls showed that more than 70 percent of eligible voters would vote against a president who has not yet been elected. So far, there is no clear indication of who will run for office in February. There is a strong chance of winning a general election. For now"

        "target": "Berlin court rules Google Street View is legal in Germany A Berlin court has ruled that Google Street View is legal. But that doesn't mean the lawsuits will end, legal scholars say. A Berlin court has ruled that Google Street View is, in fact, legal in Germany. Last Tuesday, the Berlin State Supreme Court (Kammergericht) announced its decision in a court case from late last year, in which a woman had sued Google, fearing that photos of her, her family and the front of her house would be posted on Google Street View and would thus violate her property and privacy rights. The court ruled that it is legal to take photographs from street level, rejecting her argument that Google was trying to take unauthorized pictures. Part of her argument rested on the fact that Google used cameras mounted at three meters (9.84 feet) high, which could see over her two-meter-high hedge. However, the court did not find this argument convincing, given that the photographs were taken from the street, and not the sidewalk. Furthermore, because Google automatically blurs faces and license plates and did allow Germans to opt-out of the service to have their house obfuscated as well, the court did not find any potential violations. This is the first high-level court ruling, which cannot be appealed any further, regarding Street View since the service debuted in Germany at the end of last year. An ongoing debate Since Google announced plans to launch Street View in Germany last summer, debate around the service has become heated, with some politicians trying to stop it at every turn, while German Chancellor Angela Merkel famously said that she would not remove her house from Street View. In November 2010, the company announced that 244,000 German residents in the 20 cities had chosen to opt out of Street View - less than three percent of residents. However, in Germany and everywhere else, the company also allows people to report abuse, inaccuracies or request that something be blurred using an online tool. \"Our job is to develop services that respect these cultural differences,\" Peter Fleischer, Google's global privacy counsel told Deutsche Welle in November 2010. \"We try to anticipate them. We're all internationally-minded people ourselves. We try to guess how people will react to them. But a lot of these services are new and have never been on the market before, so we learn and we adapt as we go along.\" A 'landmark decision' European legal experts called the Berlin ruling a \"landmark decision,\" saying that this would now become part of German case law regarding property rights. \"Yes, other people are now warned: Don't sue Google simply claiming that Google Street View violates personality [or] property rights,\" wrote Thomas H\u00f6ren, a professor of media and communications law at the University of M\u00fcnster, in an e-mail sent to Deutsche Welle. But, he also warned that this decision was very narrow, focusing on the issue of property rights, and not on the larger issues of data protection from Google. \"The problem of Google Street View - to be honest - has never been a problem of personality rights or property rights, but the enormous risk of personal data compilations in cases where people use Google Street View for compiling personal profiles (such as building insurance companies; future employees, et cetera),\" he added. \"And this risk has not been considered by the Berlin courts.\" Similarly, Viktor Mayer-Sch\u00f6nberger, a professor at the Oxford Internet Institute, agreed that this case was \"limited in scope,\" adding in an e-mail, \"The plaintiff never alleged an actual invasion of privacy, just a potential one.\" Author: Cyrus Farivar Editor: Nancy Isenson",
        "generated_story": "A Landmark Decision on Google Street View in Germany A German court has upheld a landmark decision by the Berlin State Supreme Court to ban the use of Google street-view in the country's capital. The court ruled in favor of the search giant in a case that could lead to the creation of a \"Landmark\" site in Berlin. Google has appealed the decision, arguing that it should be allowed to operate without a permit from the state government. It also said it would not allow Google to use the site for advertising purposes. \"We are not going to allow this,\" said Peter Fleischer, the court's chief justice. He added that Google's decision was based on the fact that the company had \"no business\" with the city of Berlin, which has a population of 1.5 million. In the case, Google had argued that there was no legal basis for the ban, adding that \"there is no reason for it.\" The ruling, however, did not come as a surprise, as Google and other tech companies had already announced that they would no longer be using the service. According to Google, this would be the first time in German history that a company would have to pay a tax on a product that had been sold to a German company. However, it is not clear whether Google will be able to do so, or whether it will continue to sell the product to other companies, such as Amazon, Alphabet, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, and Google. Germany's highest court said on Thursday that its decision would \"not affect the future of this country.\" Google said the ruling would allow it to continue with its search for new products, including Google Maps and the Google Home app. But it was unclear if Google would follow through on its promise to provide Google with a new product, since it has not yet made a decision on whether or not it plans to make the feature available to all German citizens. On the other hand, Berlin's high court also ruled against Google in an appeal, saying it had no business using Google products. That decision could have a negative impact on other German cities, but it could also have had a positive impact in other areas of German society. For example, in one city in eastern Germany, where Google is based, there is a large number of companies that sell Google-branded products and services. There is also the issue of how to market the products to German consumers. This is one of those areas where the German government has been trying to improve the quality of life for many years. And it's not just Google that has failed to deliver on this promise, because it doesn't have the right to be a good partner for people who don't want to buy a Google product. At the same time, Germany is still a very different country than the United States, with many other European countries that do not have such a great relationship with Google as well as the U.S. and China. As a result, many German companies are struggling to find a way to get their products into the market. One of them, for instance, is Google (Google), which is the world's largest search engine, has struggled to compete with other search companies in terms of market share and advertising revenue. With Google being the most successful search company in Europe, that's a big reason why Google wants to expand its presence in that market, even though it does not currently have an international presence. If Google can't do that, then the competition is tough to come up with something that will make it more attractive for consumers to shop around and buy products from Google for a few more years, especially if they have no other choice, like Google or Facebook or Amazon. Meanwhile, Amazon and Apple have been doing a lot of work on their own. They have also been working on an app that allows people to browse the web and make purchases in their homes and offices. Now, they are working to create products that can be used by other people, rather than be sold by others, to help them get to their customers. So, what's the next step for Google? Well, let's see how Google does that. What do you think? What are you waiting for? How can Google do? Is Google decide which products are the best for you? The answer is clear: It's up to you to decide for yourself. Let's talk about what you need to know. We'll see what Google decides. I'm not sure Google knows what to tell you. You can read more about this in our blog. Read more: Google vs Google: How Google won't let you buy Google stock? Google was the biggest winner of last year's Google search competition.

I think they're doing well in this area, right? That's because Google owns Google stores in different countries.

        "target": "In Argentina, red wine exports to balance Porsche imports About 100 Porsches are imported to Argentina each year. Now the country wants to keep a positive trade balance by having the value of the imported luxury cars matched by red wine exports. Porsche is currently enjoying record profits after a two-year downturn, but the export-reliant company has hit a pothole in Argentina. Buenos Aires-based Porsche importer Grupo Pulenta has signed an agreement obligating it to export several hundred bottles of red wine for each car it imports, the Argentine government announced Wednesday. Grupo Pulenta declined to comment when contacted by Deutsche Welle. Job creation During the past year, Argentina has held thousands of high-end vehicles in customs until companies agreed to export goods valued at the same amount. Most of those vehicles came from Germany. According to a spokeswoman for the Argentine embassy in Berlin, the country has been trying to safeguard domestic employment with a positive trade balance. \"Our government has negotiated with automakers to balance their imports of cars with an equivalent amount of exports,\" she told Deutsche Welle in a statement. \"Since March 2010 we have been working with the automakers and importers in order to increase local integration and reduce the trade deficit in this sector.\" Small market A Porsche spokesman said the company sells just short of 100 vehicles into Argentina each year. That compares to more than 40,000 sold worldwide during five months in 2010. \"For Porsche, Argentina is a rather small market,\" the spokesman told Deutsche Welle. \"Our importer, the Pulenta Group, also deals in wine. They have their own vineyards and export that wine. It has nothing to do with Porsche - we just have an import contract with them, and it seems they've found an individual solution with the Argentine government.\" Domestic production Volkswagen, which has an Argentine subsidiary producing the new \"Amarok\" pickup truck and transmissions, has thus far avoided mandatory exports. The company had reported an export surplus of 384 million euros ($545 million) for this year. Porsche's holding company owns 32.2 percent of Volkswagen, and the Porsche brand is intended to become integrated into Volkswagen's lineup. Daimler and BMW also have subsidiaries in Argentina. While Daimler produces its \"Sprinter\" there, BMW only imports to the country. According to the Argentine embassy in Berlin, the country has recently sought more domestic production by foreign car companies. Author: Gerhard Schneibel (dpa) Editor: John Blau",
        "generated_story": "Buenos Aires-based Grupo Pulenta aims to balance its exports with red wine exports Argentina's largest carmaker is looking to diversify its business away from red wines. The company, which is based in Buenos Aires, has been struggling to find a balance between its red and white wines exports. In the past few years, the company has struggled to make a profit in Argentina, where the country's wine industry is booming. But in recent years it has also been able to tap into the red grape market in the southern state of Argentina. Last year, it sold more than 1,000 cars to the United States alone, according to a report by German newspaper Deutsche Welle. That's a record for a car maker, but it's not the first time that has happened. It's the second time in as many years that a German car manufacturer has made an investment in a country with a large wine market. \"It's been a long time since we've had a market like this,\" said Daimler's Amarok, a subsidiary of the German luxury car company. Argentina is the world's second-biggest wine exporter after Germany's Volkswagen, with sales of around 1.5 billion euros ($2.7 billion) in 2016. Volkswagen is also the largest wine importer in Latin America, having sold around 2.3 billion bottles of wine to Argentina in 2015, followed by the likes of Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Audi and Porsche in 2014 and 2015. Both companies have been expanding their wine business in South America and in Europe, respectively, since the 1990s, when the region's economy began to recover from the effects of World War II. Since then, Argentina has become one of Europe's most important markets for wine, and the continent's top wine consumers have become increasingly dependent on it. For example, in 2013, German wine giant Volkswagen sold over 1 billion litres of red grapes to Brazil's state-owned Pulsa in an effort to boost its wine sales. However, this was not enough to offset the loss of sales to other countries, such as Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Japan and Italy. German wines are also a major source of revenue for the state, while the wine is a key component of its economy. Porsche, however, said it was still looking for ways to reduce its dependence on foreign wine imports, particularly from China, despite the fact that it had been importing wine from Europe for several years. According to Porsche's website, \"We are looking at a number of different ways of making wine and we are very happy with the results of our research and development.\" In addition, there are plans to expand production in Brazil and Mexico, as well as in Germany and other Latin American countries. Brazil, Mexico and Argentina are among the countries that have the highest wine consumption in North America. Germany has the most wine production of any other country, although it does not have much in common with other European countries in terms of exports, so it is not a big market for Porsche. There are a lot of factors to consider when it comes to wine. One of them is that the price is too high for most of us to buy wine at the end of a year. This is especially true in countries like Argentina where there is so much competition and so little competition. As a result, we have to be careful what we do in order to get the best wines we can for our customers. We are not going to give up on our wines, because we don't want to over-promote the wines that are available in our country. And that's what the market is all about, right? Well, that doesn't mean that we will stop producing wine that is good for us. I think it will be a very good thing for all of you to have a good wine in your home country,\" Porsche said, adding that \"we will continue to invest in wine.\" The German company also has a wine-maker in its portfolio and is investing in new products, including a new wine brand, to help it grow its own wine portfolio. BMW and Mercedes have also invested heavily in wines and spirits. Mercedes has invested in Brazilian wines as part of their strategy to increase its international presence. Meanwhile, Germany is focusing on the European market, too. They are investing more heavily on wine than the U.S. market and are focusing more on wines from abroad. So, for now, they are focused on producing wines for Europe and Asia. You can see why this is an important area for them to focus on. If you want wine for your own consumption, you will need to look at wine as a way to differentiate yourself from other products. What do you think about wine? You'll be surprised how much wine you'll find in this country? It is very important to me that you can't just buy a bottle of sparkling wine or a glass of Champagne, or at least one bottle, if you have one. A bottle is always good enough for you and your family. Just ask Porsche to do the right now."

Germany is the host nation for the 2011 edition of the tournament, which is to be held in Germany's capital city of Berlin. In 2011, Germany will host the event, with the aim of qualifying for next year's tournament in Russia. Last year, the country hosted the inaugural edition, but this time around, it was Germany, not the United States. \"We are going to have a lot of fun,\" said German media outlet Deutsche Welle, referring to the fact that Germany was the only country to host an international competition in which women were not allowed to compete. That's a big change from previous years, when the competition was held at the Olympic Stadium in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. But it's not just the women who are looking forward to this tournament. There's also the possibility of a host country, such as France, Russia, Italy, Spain, Japan and the Netherlands, where women are expected to take part in a tournament of their own. For the second time in three decades, women have been able to participate in international tournaments. This time, however, they will have to wait until the last minute before they can compete with men's teams from other countries. They will also have the chance to represent their country at a major international event in their home country of Germany. Women will compete against men from all over the world, including the US, Canada, Mexico, Australia, New Zealand and Japan, as well as the U.S. and South Africa. German women, who have won the past two World Cups, are hoping to make their first appearance at this event. According to a report by the DW news agency, \"the tournament is set to begin on June 1, 2011.\" The German team will play in its first ever international match, and will receive a warm welcome from FIFA President Gianni Infantino. She is due to arrive in Berlin on July 21, 2012, to face off against France's national team. If she does not win, she will face a tough challenge from the French team, while the Spanish team faces a difficult task of defending their title.

        "target": "Beekeepers battle mites with technology Bees are useful, hard-working and vital for our ecosystem. Aside from making honey, bees pollinate most of our food crops. But summertime is also the season for one of the biggest threats to honey bees \u2013 the varroa mite. Dete Papendieck puts on a white veiled protective hat and takes out a metal jug with a beak-shaped spout. He sets fire to the container's contents \u2013 formic acid \u2013 and starts directing the smoke that is wafting at the beehives lined up in front of him in his garden on the outskirts of Bonn. The acid doesn't harm the bees, but it does kill the varroa mites, he says. And July, after most of the honey has been harvested, is the best time to treat his hives. The one millimeter-large varroa mite is a parasite that infests beehives and lays its eggs in the honeycombs, alongside the bees' larvae. \"It feeds on the bees' and the bee brood's blood, the so-called haemolymph,\" Papendieck explains. A third of bees killed in Germany Papendieck is an apiarist at the Bee Research Institute at the University of Bonn and he knows that the threat of mites is serious. If left untreated, varroa-infested colonies rarely survive a winter. In 2010, German beekeepers lost about 200,000 hives to the mite \u2013 one third of Germany's total bee population. And it is not just the honey and beeswax production that are affected by the mite. Many of our food crops depend on bees: Some 80 percent of all agricultural plants and 90 percent of fruit trees in Europe are pollinated by Apis mellifera, the European honeybee. Varroa introduced from Asia Had Dete Papendieck been a beekeeper forty years ago he would not have had to worry about mites. He says the varroa mite that was originally native to Asia, was introduced to Europe in the 1970s. \"It happened during a research project in which it was attempted to crossbreed the European honeybee with the Asian honeybee. The researchers were exchanging bee colonies between Europe and India, and that is how the mites came to Germany,\" Papendieck said. Unlike Asian bee species, the European honeybee cannot fight off the varoa mite by itself. According to Papendieck, bees easily transmit the mite to other beekeepers' hives in what apiarists call robbery. \"It happens when certain colonies are being robbed by other bees. Large numbers of bees from different colonies attack weak hives and steal their stocks. At the same time, parasites and diseases are exchanged\", he says. Researchers have been trying to breed varroa-resistant mites, but so far they haven't had much success. High-tech tools help fight the mite Klaus Maresch is also worried about his bees. He is an organic beekeeper from Bonn and he has been passionate about bees since he was a little boy. \"They are part of my family. When I open my hives and smell the honey and hear the buzzing of the bees it's like being in another world,\" he told Deutsche Welle. In addition to using formic acid to fight the mite, Klaus Maresch employs a high-tech tool \u2013 a special cylindrical scale that helps him determine when it is best to start the varroa treatment. \"Every day this hive scale sends data about the colonies to our server. The data, such as the temperature in the hive and the amounts of nectar and pollen collected, help me to find a good day to treat varroa,\" Maresch says. Maresch also makes the data about the activities in his hives available to fellow beekeepers who can treat their colonies accordingly. A driver's license for beekeepers? But it is not the mite that angers Maresch most. \"That's nature,\" he says, \"I feel angry about beekeepers who don't fight varroa. If the bees of neighboring beekeepers are infested, I also have a problem.\" The existing German pest regulation obliges beekeepers to treat their bees against varroa, but there are no strict controls. The majority of Germany's more-than-80,000 beekeepers are amateurs who keep between one and 20 colonies. This makes it difficult to impose and survey certain quality standards. Maresch, who sees himself as a kind of 'bee activist', would like to see the government introduce stricter rules. \"There should be a law that obliges every new beekeeper to learn about beekeeping before they are allowed to keep bees. They should get an education and there should be something like a driver's license for beekeepers,\" he says. In the mean time, Europe's bees are going to have to",
        "generated_story": "A German beekeeper fights the varoa mite with a high-tech hive scale. The bee researcher, Dete Papendieck of the University of Bonn, is fighting a pest that has been spreading across the country for several years. He is battling the pest, which is believed to have spread from the wild to the cultivated areas of northern Germany and northern Europe. \"The pest is spreading through the soil and spreading from one hive to another,\" he told Deutsche Welle, adding that he was able to stop it from spreading to other parts of Germany, where it had already spread to neighboring countries. But he said that it was too late for him to prevent it spreading further, so he decided to fight it himself. In the end, he managed to defeat it with the help of his beekeepers. According to a study published in the journal Bee Research Institute (BRI) on Tuesday, the insect was spread across Europe and the Middle East. It was the first insect to be found in Europe, according to researchers at the university, who have been studying it for more than a year and a half. They also found a honey bee hive in a field near the German border, in which a hive was built to house the pests. Researchers said the hive could be used to store honey for up to three days before it spread into the surrounding area. However, they said it would not be possible for the honeybees to live there for a long time because of its high temperature and high humidity levels. For the bees, this means that they have to stay in their hive for as long as they can. This is not the case with honey bees. Honeybees, for example, are not allowed to use honey as honey, and honey is forbidden to do so in Germany. That's why the bee research institute has launched a new honeybee hive, called the \"Bee hive.\" The hive is designed to withstand the heat and humidity of a humid environment, making it difficult for bees to reach their honey-obsessed honeypots. And it's not just honey that's being used for honey. There's also the fact that honey can be stored in honey jars and jars, as well as in jars of honey and other products that are used in beekeeping, such as beeswax, honeycarts, fruit flies and fruit bats. A honey hive has also been developed to protect bees from pests and diseases, but it has not yet been tested in humans. Instead, it will be tested by a lab to determine whether it is safe for humans to eat honey from honey or honey in human form, researchers said. So far, there's been no success. Nevertheless, experts say that the new hive will have a positive impact on honey production, because honey will only be available to honeymakers who are already using honey to make honey at home. If honey has a good honeycomb, Honeycobs will also be made available at a later date, when honey substitutes are available. Meanwhile, bees are also being tested to see if honey makes honey mold-free honey into honey - which could help to reduce the risk of bees becoming mites. Bee researchers say honeymobs are the most effective honeybobs, since honey mobs have already been used by bees for many years, to help them get honey inside honey hobs. Bees are particularly sensitive to pests, especially bees that have become more pollogenic and pollute. As a result of this, many bees have begun to die, with bees being more likely to become pollinated and more susceptible to pollination. Some bees will die if they don't have honey within a few days, while others will become sick, or even die prematurely, due to mold and disease. These bees can only survive for about a week or two before they are released from their natural environment. With honey being the key ingredient, however, that is unlikely to happen for long-term honey products, even if Honey can't be sold in stores. When Honey is available, you can still buy honey on the market, if you're willing to pay a premium for it. You can also order honey by visiting a bee farm, then you'll be in luck. Here's how Honey and Honey will help you decide which honeymaker you want to buy. honey alone is the best honey substitute to sell honey! Honey-bees are a very important part of Honey Honey substitutes, said researcher Klaus Maresch, a professor at UB's hive-keeping laboratory in Bremen, Germany's largest city in northern Bavaria. Phytochemists have long been calling honeymoons a \" honey bomb.\" Honey plants have also become a key component in bees' honeymaking process, says the head of an insect breeding program, Dr. Hans van den Helder, an entomologist from UBB, told the BBC's newsmagazine.com in an interview published on Wednesday, May 24, 2017, \"It's very difficult to find honey honey,\" adding: \"We're going to try honey.\" He added: Honey has already"

A century after the death of Heidi inventor Johanna Spyri, the lovable Alpine heroine is being portrayed in a new film which replaces grassy slopes and mountainous range with city skyscrapers and city streets. The $ 3.5 million \"Heidi\", funded by the Z\u00fcrich-based film company Vega and directed by German film maker Markus Imboden, is to be launched in Germany on Thursday. The making of the film was one of the highlights of a past year of events including exhibitions, lectures and fireworks celebrating the July 7 2001 centenary of the death of Spyri, whose novel \"Heidi\" sold 20 million copies and has been translated in 50 languages worldwide. It is thought to be one of the most successful books of all times. The book has inspired 17 films, including Shirley Temple\u2019s Oscar winning portrayal of Heidi in 1937 and a Japanese cartoon series. Imboden\u2019s remake is the 18th \"Heidi\" film. Blue hair in Berlin According to Vega, \"the film was transmitted to today\u2019s world without losing sight of the original novel\". But Imboden\u2019s new movie is far from the charming original, with its rosy-cheeked, curly-headed Heidi, delicate Clara and goat-tending shepherd Peter\u2019s frail old grandmother. In the first film, Heidi, who lives happily with her grandfather in a tiny hut in the Swiss Alps is plucked from her contented life by her Aunt Dete to live in a stiff, rich family in the bustling metropolis, Frankfurt. Heidi becomes so home-sick, she starts to sleepwalk and is eventually sent home. But not before she causes confusion in the otherwise prim household and brings laughter in the life of the disabled and homely, Clara. The Heidi in the latest film has blue hair, surfs the net and roams the streets of Berlin. Friend and shepherd Peter sheds his rustic pastimes and whizzes down streets on his mountainbike. Clara is not the weak, lame young girl of the Spyri novel, but a moody Britney Spears wannabe. Aunt Dete is a modern-day stylist living fashionably in the German capital. The new surroundings are a far cry from the tranquil days of cow milking, goat- tending and flower-plucking in the verdant meadows of the Swiss Alps. Transforming the Heidi myth According to a Berlin daily, the remake is a \"refreshing Heidi\", adding that the script writers had managed to transform the Heidi \"myth\" into an independent, self-assured girl and not into a \"transfigured mountain heroine\". However, it is just this portrait of a naive and charming alpine heroine that has made Heidi so popular all over the world. Heidi has become a well-known Swiss brand worldwide. Some 60,000 tourists \u2013 half from Japan \u2013 are said to visit the picturesque wine-growing village in Graubuenden, which boasts the original Heidi House and other Heidi related attractions such as winding mountain trails and pastures. Imboden\u2019s film, which is to be launched in Germany on Thursday, will also open elsewhere in Europe, and may reach fans in Japan and South Korea too. Whether Imboden\u2019s blue-haired, computer savvy Heidi will charm her Asian viewers, however, remains to be seen.",
        "generated_story": "The Remake of Heidi in the Swiss Alps A new exhibition is being staged in Switzerland. It's called Heidi House, and it's based in Graubuenden, Germany. The exhibition, which is set to be held in Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland, is scheduled to take place in September and October. In it, the exhibition will showcase the work of Swiss sculptor Johanna Spyri and her husband, Markus Imboden (pictured), who have been working on the project for more than a year and a half. \"It's the most beautiful exhibition I've seen so far,\" said the film's director, who has worked on several projects for the company, including the production of a documentary about Heidi's life and work as a model for a children's book, \"She is a beautiful woman with a sense of beauty.\" The show will be staged at a Swiss ski resort and will feature a number of models from around the world. There will also be an exhibition at the hotel, as well as screenings of the documentary \"Heidi House,\" which was filmed in Germany in 2009 and 2010. Tickets are still available on Amazon.com and at Amazon's website. Amazon has also announced that it will release a new documentary on Heidi, based on her life as an artist, in which she has been inspired to write about her work. She has written a book about the life of her artist husband and how she was inspired by Heidi. Her work, published in a German language magazine, was translated into English in 2010 and is available in English and German. According to the website, it is the first time that a film has ever been made in such a large part of Switzerland's history, with the setting being the Alps. But it also includes a few scenes from the original film, where Heidi lived with her father and their two children in their home town of Graz, near the German border. Heidi has lived there since the 1970s, when she married her first husband. Now, she lives in her own home in Zurich, a suburb of Zurich. When Heidi was born, her parents had moved to Switzerland from Germany and she had been living there for many years. They now have three children, one of whom is now married and the other two have a daughter, Johanne. Both of them are currently living in Berlin, while the children are living with their parents. A documentary is also being planned for this year's edition, titled \"Heroes and Monsters,\" that will focus on how to make Heidi look like a real woman again. If you want to see Heidi again, you'll have to go to Germany to find out what she looks like, but you can't do that without looking at her in person. That's not to say that she doesn't look beautiful, because she's a very nice woman. However, there are a lot of people who don't have the same kind of personality as Heidi and that is not the case for her. I think that's one reason why I'm so happy that Heidi is still here, that I can see her as she is. And I hope that this documentary will make her a better person to look at Heidi than I was before she died. So far, so good. As far as I know, I have not been able to tell you how much I miss Heidi at all. What I do know is that there is so much more to her than just being a woman who lives here. At the end of last year, Heidi had a baby and was very happy to give birth to a little boy and to have him raise a family. This is her second child, after her mother died in 2008. After Heidi died, we are going to try to get her to live with us. We are hoping that the baby will live happily ever after and we will get to know her, too. For now, though, this is just the beginning of what we have in store for our children. Read more: Heidi will become a mother, or at least she won't be the only one who does. You can read the book in this book. Here's what I mean by that book: \"I'm a girl who is happy with Heidi,\" she said, referring to Heidi as \"the real Heidi.\" She also said she hopes that her children will grow up and be a good mother to their children and grandchildren. 'I hope she'll be happy for them too,' she added, adding that they will have more time to enjoy her grandchildren and raise their own children as soon as they are old enough to do so. With the help of my father, my mother and my grandmother, Joanne is very much looking forward to seeing her again and I am so glad that we can all be together again! Heidi lives with my son and step into her new life together with him. He was a wonderful person and he is an amazing man and has a great father. My mother is really a lovely person who will always be there, even if she does not have any idea what Heidi can do for me."

        "target": "Opinion: A decision against heart and mind The House of Commons has passed the Brexit bill - despite most parliamentarians being against it. But now they should take care that Great Britain does not move further away from Europe, writes Birgit Maass. If only they had done it out of full conviction. If they at least believed that they could really benefit their country by withdrawing from the EU. But many of the parliamentarians whose vote will finally set Brexit on its wayhave voted against their hearts, as well as their minds. It was a vote against their minds, because the withdrawal from the EU will almost certainly, at least on a short to medium term basis, have negative repercussions for the British economy. And it was a vote against their hearts, because for many, a view of the future, divorced from Brussels and increasingly reliant on an unpredictable US President Donald Trump, is somewhat alarming. In recent days, many members of parliament have described it as \"a catastrophe.\" No vote \"against the will of the people.\" Of course there are \"Brexiteers\" who believe that a Britain independent of Brussels will be able to return to its former greatness, once it is no longer held back by the \"Little Europeans.\" But they are in the minority - the majority of parliamentarians already declared their support for remaining in the EU during the referendum campaign. Yet despite this, Theresa May's government was able to push its legislative proposal through the House of Commons without any great difficulty. The predominant view, also amongst members of the two leading parties, is that to hinder Brexit and to fail to support the government in its endeavors to do so, would be to go \"against the will of the people.\" Anti-EU newspapers have targeted Brexit opponents. And those who have publically come out in support of the EU have had to reckon with death threats. The at times passionate debate in the lower house, that went on over several days, was a temporary highlight in this European tragedy, which in the worst case could contribute to the continent disintegrating into individual sovereign states. Don't be intimidated The British public supports the hard-line position taken by Prime Minister May in withdrawing from the common market. Polls are showing that her strategy is gaining increased support. There is no turning back now. The British are now looking for clarity on the repercussions of their withdrawal from the EU. They want the negotiations with the EU to start as soon as possible. It was an historical misjudgement by David Cameron that he could win the referendum. Most of the members of the lower house believed the then-prime minister and voted to hold a referendum. But now they can no longer stop Brexit. But they should not let themselves be intimidated by party discipline, nor the leading Brexiteers, nor by voter impatience. Over the next two years they should use every chance they can to influence the withdrawal process. May announced that although they are leaving the European Union, they will not be moving away from Europe. The parliamentarians must now hold her to her word. Have something to say? Add your comments below. The thread will stay open for 24 hours after publication.",
        "generated_story": "Brexit referendum is not a referendum against the will of the people Theresa May has said she will not allow the UK to leave the European Union without a second referendum. That is the message she has delivered to the British people since she took office as Prime Minister in May. The referendum will be held in the House of Commons on March 29, the day after the EU referendum on leaving the bloc. It is also the first time that a UK government has been able to make clear that it wants to remain in a single EU, despite the fact that many of its members are not members of parliament. \"We are going to have to do this again,\" May said at a press conference in Brussels on Thursday. She also said that she would be willing to work with Brussels to ensure that Britain's future relationship with Europe is as good as it can be. But she also warned that the referendum would not be enough to get the country out of a hard Brexit. In a statement, May also called on EU member states to \"reconsider their position\" on the Brexit process, saying that they were not ready to accept the terms of an EU withdrawal agreement with the United States. May, however, did not rule out the possibility of another referendum, calling for a \"no-deal\" Brexit, but she was not prepared to give up her position as prime minister. Instead, she said, \"I will work hard to find a solution that is acceptable to all of us.\" The British government's position on Brexit has not changed since May's election, when it said it would accept a deal that would allow Britain to stay in Europe. However, it is still not clear whether May will stick to her Brexit plan, which she says is in line with EU law. If she does not, then she is likely to lose her majority in parliament, and she may lose the chance of winning a majority of seats in Parliament. This is a very important step for the government to take in order to strengthen its negotiating position with other EU members, including the US, Britain and France. Britain is currently negotiating a new deal with France, Germany and the Netherlands, as well as with Germany, Austria and Switzerland. There is no way to know for sure what the outcome of this vote will mean for Britain, or for many other European countries. What is certain, though, is that there will still be a lot of uncertainty about the future of Britain after Brexit - and this is something that will have a huge impact on many people's lives. For example, there's the question of whether or not Britain will remain a member of EU institutions, such as the 28-member bloc of 28 states. And there are also questions about whether Britain should be allowed to keep its EU membership. Many of these questions have already been asked by the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which has ruled out a vote in favor of Article 50, a move that could lead to a withdrawal from the 27-nation bloc's membership of NATO. These are the questions that must be answered before the next EU summit in June. Some of those questions are particularly important for May and her government, who have been critical of her handling of Brexit in recent months. One of them is whether she'll have the courage to stand up to President Donald Trump. Another question is how will she respond to his threats to withdraw from NATO? The EU has already made it clear it won't be an easy decision for her to decide whether to go ahead with a Brexit deal. EU leaders have repeatedly said they are open to talks with Trump and his administration on a number of different issues. They have not yet made clear what they want to talk about, for instance, about how they would like to see the withdrawal of troops from Syria, Iraq, Iran and Libya. On the other hand, they have expressed their opposition to any further military intervention in Syria and Iraq. At the same time, some EU officials have also expressed concern about a possible military withdrawal, while others have called for an end to NATO's military presence in Iraq and Afghanistan. I think that's a good thing, given the current political climate, because it's not the only thing that has happened in this country. So far, no one has come out in favour of such an orderly withdrawal. Nevertheless, I don't think there is any doubt that this will happen. After all, we've already seen the results of last year's referendum are very clear: it will take a long time before we can get a clear picture of what is going on. We're not even close to an agreement on how to resolve the issue. You can read more about that here. Here's what I'm hoping for. Read more: How to prepare for Brexit: What to expect from Brexit?

        "target": "French presidential debate does little to woo undecided voters This year's French presidential race is perhaps the most closely watched election in recent history. Many voters are still undecided, including those in the Paris caf\u00e9 where DW's Jake Cigainero saw the latest TV debate. Just over two weeks ahead of the first round of voting in France's presidential election, all 11 candidates met for the second televised debate of the campaign. It was the first time in the history of French elections that the entire official ballot shared a television stage. This race for the Elysee is perhaps the most closely watched election in the history of the Fifth Republic in view of conservative candidate Francois Fillon's embezzlement charges, the deterioration of the left, political amateur Emmanuel Macron's surprise surge to the top, and the rise of Marine Le Pen's National Front. With so much media attention on the five main candidates, Tuesday's debate felt almost like a consolation for the six other candidates rarely in the spotlight. For French voters watching the televised debate at Cafe des Phares on Place de la Bastille, the saturated stage kept the candidates from detailed discussion of pressing issues. For those who are still undecided, the debate did little to bring them closer to choosing their pick for president. Vincent Couronne, a researcher, said it was good to see candidates who don't get as much media attention. However, 11 candidates at once for the political spectator was overkill. \"It wasn't very interesting. It's just one position after another. There's no real debate. It's not like when it was just five candidates.\" Boredom all round Charlotte Theuvenin and her friends, all students in their early 20s, tuned out early on from boredom and exasperation. \"It was too flat and too hypocritical. Fillon and Le Pen play with our money, then say they did nothing and that they are good for our country,\" she said. As though addressing the candidates in front of her on the TV screen, she added, \"How dare you talk about being president when you use our money for your own interests.\" Le Pen had come under fire over accusations that she misused public funds to pay bodyguards as parliamentary assistants. Francois Fillon of Les Republicains, meanwhile, is under investigation for allegedly paying family members more than 1 million euros ($1.1 million) for government work they never carried out. Frequently casting a blank stare at his opponents, Fillon also seemed bored, or at least more subdued compared to the first debate. Couronne said, \"Fillon seems to be not there. Probably because he knows all the small candidates can attack him on the criminal offenses he's accused of.\" Debate watchers cited Europe as the most important issue of this election, with many fearing Le Pen's promise to tear France out of the European Union in a so-called Frexit. Though no one at the cafe vocally supported Le Pen's plan, several acknowledged the EU is a pressure point for France. \"France's place in Europe in relation to Germany is a very important issue,\" said student Thibault Cirier. \"The general problem is France has lost its influence at the European level over the years, and that needs to be remedied, because France is one of the founders of Europe and should have a strong place in the union. The EU is also important for cohesion and to have a strong position internationally.\" Caf\u00e9 viewers say no to Le Pen Cirier was initially excited by Macron when he launched his campaign, but ultimately decided there was no substance. Now he says he will probably vote for far-left candidate Jean-Luc Melenchon. Kevser Taspinar also said she liked Melenchon for his fighting spirit and that \"he throws barbs.\" As a practicing Muslim who wears a headscarf, she said the most important issue for her is laicite, France's state institution of secularism. \"For me Hamon has the best interpretation of this. Maybe Hamon,\" Taspinar said hesitating. \"I'm still undecided, because there's Melenchon.\" Another viewer, Marie Dubois, said that although she really liked Melenchon, she had definitively decided on Macron. \"Melenchon has a way of putting humanity in politics and giving hope,\" she said. \"But Macron is the only possible candidate.\" With polls putting Le Pen and Macron in the second round on May 7, the undecided voters at this Paris cafe said they were certain which candidate they would not for vote for in that scenario. \"Definitely Macron. There is no way I am going to vote for Le Pen,\" Theuvenin said. \"I will never vote for that woman or Front National, no matter who is running against them in the second round.\" Tuesday was the final debate for Macron and Melenchon, two of the crowd-pleasers among the candidates. Both have pulled out of the third debate on grounds that it cuts too close to the first vote just two days later on April 23.",
        "generated_story": "French National Front's Jake Cigainero: 'I don't know what to do' The French national party's candidate for the presidency is Emmanuel Macron. He's a staunch Eurosceptic, but he's also a strong supporter of the far-right, which has been accused of being anti-Semitic. The right-wing candidate, who was elected to the French presidency in November's presidential election, has said he doesn't think he'll be able to stand up for himself. \"I think I'm going to have to fight for what I believe in,\" he told DW in an interview published on Sunday. In the interview, he also said that he didn't see any reason why he couldn't stand to lose his seat in the presidential race. But he did say that if he were to be elected, it would be because of his support for Le Pen, and not the fact that she was the front-runner in his first round of presidential elections last year. And he said it was because he was so close to winning the popular vote in France. However, the former president of France, Francois Fillon, is not a fan of French politics at all. On the contrary, when he won the election in June's runoff, there was a lot of talk of him becoming the next president. That, in turn, led to calls for him to step down from his post as president, as well as the creation of a new political party in which he would take over the country's presidency. At the same time, French President Nicolas Sarkozy has called for an end to France's current political crisis, saying that it is time for Macron to take a step back and focus on his own political future. France has a long way to go in order to achieve this goal, so it's important that we have a clear path to success. So far, however, that has not been the case. It's not clear how long he will be in office, or how many years before he leaves office. For the time being, though, we're not sure what the future holds for France as a whole. After all, this is the first time that a French presidential candidate has faced a serious challenge from the right. Last year, France voted to leave the European Union in favor of leaving the bloc, a move that was seen as an attempt to make it into the mainstream of politics. This year's election is expected to decide whether or not France will remain a part of Europe's political landscape, with a number of candidates vying for positions of power in both the center and center-left. Some of those candidates have said they want to stay in power, while others have suggested that they would prefer to remain in opposition. Others have called on the president to seek a change of government, such as Macron himself, to give them a chance to get a better chance of winning a second term. Meanwhile, some of them are also calling for a return to power. One of these candidates, Vincent Couronne, said she would like to see Macron's government be re-elected. Another, Jean-Luc Melenchon, called \"a good man\" for his party, wants to keep France in a \"strong position.\" \"He is a great man,\" she said, adding that \"he is an honest man who has done a good job in politics for many of us.\" But she is also concerned about the direction the party is headed. She said the current government is heading in that direction: \"It will not be easy to change the course of our country. I think it will take some time before we get to a point where we are ready to move on from this. We are not ready for that.\" The left-leaning Front National, meanwhile, remains the main opposition party. Its leader, Fran\u00e7ois Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric, says he is \"very disappointed\" with the results of last week's elections and that the result of Sunday's vote was \"not good enough for me.\" He also believes that Macron should be given the opportunity to win a third term as prime minister, rather than a fourth term, because it could lead to an even worse result. French media have been critical of Macron, accusing him of failing to deliver on promises he has made to his supporters in recent months. They have also criticized him for not doing enough to improve the economy. Macron has also been criticized by some quarters for being too soft on social issues, including his economic policies and his lack of commitment to economic growth. Many people are worried that his policies will hurt his chances of becoming a successful leader in Europe and the Middle East. There is no doubt that France is in danger of falling into a deep recession, especially if it does not have the resources to invest in infrastructure, infrastructure and infrastructure to build the infrastructure necessary to meet the economic needs of an economy that is desperately needed to create jobs and jobs for our people.

Smuggling has prompted a visit to Mexico City by US Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly. Prosecutors said the remote town of Las Varas in Chihuahua state was the scene of Wednesday's battle between affiliates of the Ciudad Juarez cartel and a gang from the state of Sinaloa. Police said fighting escalated when patrols arrived. Fourteen people were found dead; 12 others were hospitalized. Grenades, launchers and rifles were found. The mountainous region is used as a corridor for smuggling into the US. El Chapo effect Chihuahua security commissioner Oscar Alberto Aparicio said a Black Hawk helicopter was called in as police chased surviving gang members through the area known for marijuana and opium poppy production. Two police officers had been killed in a \"cowardly\" way in the area a week ago, he said. In a similar incident last Friday, 17 gunmen were killed during a shootout with police on a highway in Sinaloa, Mexico's northwestern state. Sinaloa was the home base of Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, whose extradition to the US in January apparently left gangsters in a struggle for control of criminal syndicates. Homicides have surged in recent months, with the number of persons killed in May put at 2,186, the highest since the collection of such statistics began 20 years ago. Nieto and Kelly to talk In Mexico City Wednesday, President Enrique Pena Nieto's office said he and visiting US Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly had discussed how to rein in organized crime groups. \"Shared responsibility\" must become the focus of transnational efforts, Kelly said. Narcotics smuggling into the US has become a multibillion-dollar (multibillion-euro) business for Mexican drug cartels. Mexico in turn wants the US to throttle demand for narcotics and the supply of illegal weapons to Mexico cartels.

Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto is due to visit Las Varas, the capital of the state of Sinaloa, to meet with US President Donald Trump and his Mexican counterpart, Mexican Prime Minister Oscar Alberto Aparicio. The two men are expected to discuss the latest developments in the border conflict between the US and Mexico, which has become a flashpoint for violence between rival drug cartels and the United States. Mexico's president has been criticized for failing to act quickly enough to stop the violence. On Wednesday, he said he was \"very concerned\" about the security situation in his own country. \"I am very concerned for the safety of our people,\" he told reporters in Mexico City, adding that he had been briefed by US Secretary of State John Kerry on the situation. He also said that the Mexican government was prepared to take action against drug traffickers who have been linked to the Guzman cartel. In a statement, Trump said Mexico had \"made a mistake\" by allowing the drug cartel to continue to operate in its territory. But he did not elaborate on what that mistake was, saying only that it was a \"mistake\" and that \"it was not the first time\" that a drug trafficker had committed a violent crime. Last week, a man was killed in a shootout with police in southern Mexico after he allegedly opened fire on a police car. Police said the suspect, Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n, was shot and killed by police. US officials have said they have not seen any evidence of an attempted murder, but that they do not believe the case is a case of mistaken identity. They say it is an isolated incident, and they are not aware of any other such incident. Trump has called on Mexico to step up security measures in response to a series of deadly attacks in recent months, including a deadly attack on an army base in central Mexico in which two US soldiers were killed, according to Reuters news agency, citing unnamed sources familiar with the investigation. President Trump, meanwhile, called for an end to US involvement in international drug trafficking and urged Mexican authorities to \"act quickly and decisively\" to protect the country's borders from the influx of migrants and refugees who are fleeing violence in their home countries. 'We are going to do everything we can to prevent this from happening again,' Trump told a news conference in New York on Tuesday, referring to his visit to Mexico as \"the most important day of my life.\" The US president, however, has not yet made a decision on whether he will step down from his post as US secretary of state. His predecessor, US Vice President Joe Biden, also visited the site, where the incident took place, in an apparent attempt to reassure Mexicans that his administration would not be distracted by the ongoing crisis. A senior US official told Reuters that Trump's visit would be \"a very positive step for our country.\" \"It's a good day for all of us,\" the official said. However, it's not clear whether Trump will be able to make the same kind of progress as he has made in other countries, such as China, Mexico and India. It's also unclear whether the president will take a position on how to respond to this crisis, since he is not a member of his cabinet, or if he plans to stay in office long-term. If he does decide to leave office at the end of this year, that could be a very difficult time for him, because he would have to face the consequences of what he's done so many times before. That's the way he sees it: He's been in power for a long time. And he doesn't have a lot of time to think about it, either. I'm not sure how long he'll be in that position. What I do know is that this is the last time I will have the chance to talk to him about what's going on in this country, when he leaves office in January. This is something that is very important to me, I think, for sure. There's no doubt about that. We're not going anywhere, though. You know what I mean? I don't want to get involved in any way at all. So let's talk about this. Let's get on with it. Here's what we're talking about. First, let me tell you what to expect from this meeting. Read more: Mexico: What's next for Mexico? What do you think? Is there a way to deal with this situation? Do you have any idea what will happen? Tell me. Tell us what you've been doing? Let me know if you're a Mexican politician and I'll let you know. Then tell me what the next step is for you. Just ask the President of Mexico. Will you tell him what is happening in your life? Or will you do the right thing? Will he be there? If not now, then let us know and then we'll see what happens. Who knows"

        "target": "Italy's navy to patrol with Libyan ships to curb human trafficking Italy wants to work more closely with Libya to limit the number of sea crossings by migrants and potential asylum seekers. But what are the consequences? Italy's prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni, does not want to wait any longer for EU countries to show solidarity in distributing asylum seekers throughout the bloc. On Thursday he announced in Rome that the Italian navy would be patrolling with Libyan ships just off the Libyan coastline. The aim, Gentiloni says, is to curb human trafficking and bring migrants back from the smugglers' boats to Libya. According to the Italian government's figures, 93,000 migrants have arrived in Italy so far this year. At least 2,000 have drowned in the attempt to cross the Mediterranean - the true figure is unknown. Italy has already threatened to stop allowing boats carrying rescued migrants to dock in Italian ports, or that it may issue migrants with documents that would allow them to travel on to other European countries. Rome has not yet implemented either policy, but the government has made clear that Italy will soon run out of options. The EU Commissioner for Migration Dimitris Avramopoulos acknowledged, again, in Brussels on Thursday that \"Europe continues to face high migratory pressures. And Italy more than (almost) any others.\" The European Commission issued a letter offering more aid and personnel to help manage migration better. Accommodation will soon be full The office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, wrote at the beginning of July that \"Close to 200,000 accommodation places are available for refugees and migrants across [Italy], but are nearly all full.\" The High Commissioner referred particularly to the numbers of people dying when he warned, \"What is happening in front of our eyes in Italy is an unfolding tragedy.\" The United Nations anticipates that another 100,000 migrants will come to Italy via Libya before the end of this year. The number of arrivals is already 20 percent higher than last year; and the number of dead, those who could not be saved, would rise accordingly. According to UN estimates, the Mediterranean remains the \"deadliest\" refugee route in the world. Italian government statistics say that around 600,000 people have arrived in Italian ports since the start of the crisis in 2014. It is unclear how many have since traveled on to Austria, France or Switzerland. Once migrants are registered in Italy and accommodated in camps, they are not held there. If, however, they leave the accommodation without giving notice, they forfeit their claim to subsistence and social services. Most of the migrants are from African countries, and many try to travel on to France, for example. 300 people are currently sleeping on the beach in Ventimiglia, on the French border, hoping to take a bus or train to France. However, the border is being policed by French officials. Migrants who are caught are sent back to Italy. Austria has announced that it too will close its border with Italy if the number of migrants starts to rise. Repatriation and distribution are difficult Last year 120,000 new asylum applications were made in Italy. Around 50 percent of these are rejected. The asylum seekers are then supposed to leave the country. However, the process of people either returning voluntarily or being deported is very slow. The interior ministry has therefore announced that it will reinforce repatriation programs. The redistribution of asylum seekers from Italy, as agreed by the European Union, is well behind target. Two years ago the aim was to resettle 120,000 people. So far, only 24,676 people have been redistributed, the EU Commission said on Thursday: 7,873 from Italy, and 16,803 from Greece. The numbers are low not just because of the reluctance of other EU countries to take the refugees in, but also because of Italian delays in the registration of possible candidates. Asylum seekers from Eritrea are the most likely to fulfill the criteria for redistribution. Around 25,000 are currently living in Italy, but only 10,000 have been registered with the EU Commission and the European Asylum Support Office as possible candidates. Migration Commissioner Avramopoulos has announced that Italy will be given more help and logistical support in this area.",
        "generated_story": "Italy's migration commissioner warns of \"an unfolding tragedy\" in Mediterranean region Italy's Migration Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos has warned of an \"unprecedented humanitarian crisis in the Mediterranean.\" The European Union's migrant commissioner for migration, Paolo Gentiloni, told the European Commission on Thursday that the situation in Libya was becoming increasingly dire. \"We are facing an unfolding humanitarian catastrophe,\" he said, adding that Italy is facing a \"further crisis\" as it struggles to cope with the influx of migrants and refugees from Libya. The migrant crisis is the latest in a series of crises across the region, which has seen thousands of people flee their homes in recent months, according to a report by the United Nations Migration Office (UNOM) in Brussels. According to the UNOM, more than 1,000 migrants have fled their home countries and are now seeking asylum in Italy, where they have been living for several years. Many of the migrants are from Italy and Libya, and many of them have arrived in Europe from other countries, including the US, Britain, France, Germany, Spain and Italy. Most of these migrants were from the Middle East and North Africa, but some came from Europe. They were brought to Italy as part of a humanitarian mission to help people fleeing war-torn Libya and Syria. In addition, they were sent to Libya to seek asylum, the EUOM said. At the time of their arrival, thousands had fled the country, leaving hundreds of thousands more in need of asylum. Italy was the first country to receive asylum from a foreign country in 2011. Since then, it has become increasingly difficult for migrants to reach Europe, particularly those who are fleeing conflict and persecution in their own countries. Last year, around 1.5 million people fled to Europe in search of safety and security. This year the number of arrivals has risen to 2.3 million, while the total number has fallen to around 3.7 million. It is not clear how many people are still living there, or whether they will be able to return to their countries of origin. There are reports that some of those fleeing the conflict have died, as well as the deaths of several others. On Thursday, Italian authorities said they had received reports of at least one death toll of up to 10.6 million migrants, a figure that could rise to as high as 5.8 million in some cases. More than 2,500 people have sought asylum since 2011, when Italy became the third EU member state to become a member, after Greece and Spain, followed by France and the Netherlands and Germany. For the second time in as many years, Italy has been the only EU country that has received asylum and asylum requests from migrants. That is, until now, only a few countries that have accepted the request, such as Germany and France. Germany has refused to accept the asylum application, saying that it is too late. France has also rejected the application for asylum because it does not recognize that asylum seekers are not entitled to an asylum claim. Meanwhile, other EU countries have also accepted asylum applications for people who do not have the legal status to enter the bloc. Europe's refugee agency, UNHCR, said it was not aware of any such application until the end of last year. But it also said that \"it is very difficult to understand how this situation could be resolved,\" and that EU officials are working to find a way to resolve the issue. EU migration Commissioner Filippo Grandi said in an interview with The New York Times that he was \"very optimistic\" about the future of migration. He said he hoped to see a solution to this problem within the next few months. However, he did not expect a quick resolution of this crisis, however, because \"the situation will not be easy.\" \"I am very optimistic that we will find the right solution,\" said the Commission's chief migration official, Frans Timmerman, who was appointed to head the migration office in Rome in January. A spokesman for the Italian government told The Times of Malta on Wednesday that a decision on whether to grant asylum to migrants would be made on the basis of international law, \"at the very least, that this is something we have to do as a matter of urgency.\" In a statement, French President Francois Hollande said his country would not accept any asylum request. French Foreign Minister Bruno Le Maire, meanwhile, called for an investigation into the case. Speaking at a news conference in Paris on Friday, Macron said: \"It is a very important step for Italy to move forward with its asylum policy. I think it will take a lot of time to get this right. We are very hopeful that there is an opportunity for a resolution to be reached,\" but he also stressed the need for cooperation between EU and EU ministers to work together to ensure that all EU members have a clear understanding of what is going on in this country's immigration situation. And I am not going to give up on this issue at the moment, despite the fact that they are already working on a new plan to make it a priority.\" He added"

        "target": "How to wrap a present without using paper or tape Next time you get invited to a birthday party, you could try wrapping the present using a piece of fabric and ribbon. It's very easy and the best bit is, it can be reused. Maybe it will come back to you on your birthday. 1. All you need is a piece of fabric big enough to wrap your gift, a ribbon long enough to go right around it, and if you want to make a gift tag, you will also need a piece of old cardboard, a hole punch and another small piece of ribbon. Ready? 2. No, wait, we forgot the present. Get that, and you have everything you need. Spread the fabric on the ground and put your gift on top 3. Fold the fabric around the gift you are wrapping 4. With the last little bit, you don't tuck it under, but create a little flap on top 5. Fold that flap over like this 6. Take one end of the parcel and tuck the fabric inside, BEHIND the gift inside 7. You can take your time to wiggle it all inside. Make it as flat as you can 8. Once it is all inside, turn to the other end and do the same thing again 9. When you have done both ends, it should look like this. Your present is all tucked up inside and you don't need any tape to keep it closed 10. Now for the ribbon. Place the gift on top of it 11. Tie the bow 12. So it looks like this. Finished? If you want a gift tag, that comes now. If you don't you're done! 13. Cut a piece out of an old cardboard box and make a hole in it using a hole punch. Watch your fingers though ;) 14. Put a piece of short ribbon through your hole 15. Tie the tag to your gift 16. And you are finished! P.S. You can either ask your friend to reuse the fabric, and show them how to wrap with it, or if they don't like that idea, you can take it home with you to use again the next time. And remember, you don't have to buy the fabric. You can use an old pillow case, an old t-shirt or skirt, or whatever you want. You can even make your ribbon from an old t-shirt if you don't have any. Happy wrapping.",
        "generated_story": "How to Wrap a Present Without Using Paper or Tape How to wrap a present without using paper or tape? Read on to find out how to do it. The best gifts for the holidays are wrapped in paper and tape. But wrapping presents is not enough. You have to use paper, tape, or other materials to make them look good. That's how you wrap your present. It's not as easy as it sounds, but it's a lot easier than it looks. For example, you can wrap presents in plastic wrap and wrap them in tape or paper wrap. This is the best gift you could buy for your family, friends, and yourself. And, of course, the gift itself is a gift from God, not from your mother. \"It's all about the present,\" says one of the gifts, which is wrapped around a piece of paper. Another gift is wrapping paper in a plastic bag and wrapping it around the edges of a paper bag. Other gifts can be wrapped by hand, as long as they're not too big or too tight. Some gifts are even wrapped with a rubber band. Others, such as a pair of scissors, are simply wrapped up and placed on top of each other. One gift, however, is for a friend or family member who lives in the same house as you. In the past, this gift has been given to you by your parents or a relative. Now, that gift could be used to decorate a home or office. However, in this case, it has to be done with paper rather than tape because the material is too thick. So, instead of wrapping the presents, wrap the paper around it and put it on the table. Then wrap it all up with tape and leave it in place. If you're lucky enough to have a partner, they'll be able to take care of it for you, too. There's no need to worry about wrapping up presents. They're just a matter of time before you get to the point where you feel like you've done something wrong. As I mentioned in my last post, I'm not going to tell you how I wrapped my present, because I don't want to mess with the wrapping. I want you to know that I've wrapped it up before, so that you won't have any problems with it at all. Thank you so much for all the help you have given me.

        "target": "Hurricane Irma thrashes Caribbean as Jose strengthens in wake Hurricane Irma has continued to pack 300 kph winds as it moves across the Caribbean toward Florida. The record-breaking storm has battered the Bahamas and Cuba, while Hurricane Jose followed in its path. As one of the Atlantic Ocean's largest storms plowed through the Caribbean, leaving destruction in its wake, residents of the US state of Florida prepared for what could be the worst storm to make landfall in over a century. At least 17 people have been killed and dozens more injured across several island nations in the Caribbean. Irma is expected to be there second major hurricane to make landfall in the United States in less than two weeks. Hurricane Harvey struck Texas last week, killing more than 60 people and displacing roughly 1 million others. In the US territory of Puerto Rico, 1 million people \u2013 nearly one-third of the population \u2013 lost electricity during the storm, said Puerto Rican Governor Ricardo Rossello. \"It will be difficult to estimate how long the power outage will last,\" Rossello said. Later, officials confirmed that at least two people on the island had been killed by the storm's devastation. Two other major storms have developed in the Caribbean, namely Hurricane Jose and Hurricane Katia. Jose was east of the Lesser Antilles with maximum sustained winds of 120 miles per hour (195 kilometers per hour) as a hurricane watch was in effect for Antigua and Barbuda. Jose has followed the same path as Hurricane Irma, and was upgraded to a Category 4 on Friday by the US National Hurricane Center. Katia has remained relatively static, hovering off the coast of Mexico. Florida on edge Florida Governor Rick Scott said 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain were expected after Irma made landfall at the weekend as he urged evacuations during a press conference on Friday. Nearly 700,000 people have been asked to leave Miami and its surrounding areas. \"Today is the day to do the right thing for your family and get inland for safety... Do not ignore evacuation orders. All Floridians should be prepared to evacuate soon,\" Scott said. Read more: How to reduce risks from mega-storms? \"I know many of you are stuck in traffic, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s very frustrating.

On Friday, US President Donald Trump described Irma as a storm of \"absolutely historic destructive potential.\" Trump also on Friday signed a $15 billion (13.5 billion euro) hurricane relief package passed by Congress, which also raises the debt ceiling and postpones the possibility of a shutdown of government funding until December. Downgraded to an \"extremely dangerous\" Category 4 but still packing winds of 185 mph (300 kph), Irma moved between the north coast of Cuba and the Bahamas as it neared the Florida Keys and the southern Florida Peninsula.

Amid widening criticism from residents in British territories that not enough was done to safeguard people from the storm, British Foreign Office Minister Alana Duncan said London has sent tents, vehicles and other relief equipment. \"Anguilla received the hurricane's full blast. The initial assessment is that the damage has been severe and in places critical,\" Duncan told the British Parliament.

        "generated_story": "Hurricane Irma in the Caribbean: warnings and warnings Hurricane Irma is making its way into the United States, but it's not going to be easy. The storm is expected to make landfall on the eastern Caribbean island of Antigua and Barbuda on Sunday, Sept. 24. Officials in Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands, and the Bahamas have been warned to prepare for the storm, which could cause widespread damage to the island's economy and infrastructure. \"This is the worst we've ever seen,\" Gov. Ricardo Rossello said in a statement released by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). \"It's a very difficult situation to deal with,\" he said, adding that he was \"very concerned\" about the damage caused by Hurricane Jose. He added that \"it's very important that we have a plan in place to help the people of the Lesser Antilles.\" \"We have to do everything we can to protect them from this storm,\" the FEMA director, Alana Duncan, told CNN on Friday. She said the government was working with the federal government to put together an emergency plan that would allow the islands to recover from the effects of Hurricane Harvey, Irma and Maria, as well as other natural disasters such as Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita. It's also important to remember that this is not the first time that a hurricane has made landfall in an area that has been hit by a Category 4 storm. In the aftermath of Harvey and Irma, officials said they were working closely with federal and state agencies to plan for a response. They also said that they would be monitoring the situation closely to determine if any damage had been caused. Meanwhile, federal officials have warned that the path of Irma will be difficult to predict and that it could be even more difficult than previously thought. FEMA's Brock Long, head of emergency operations at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in Washington, D.C. and other federal agencies, including the National Hurricane Center (NHC), are preparing to respond to any potential damage from Irma. US President Donald Trump has called for an \"emergency response\" in response to Hurricane Maria. His administration has also issued a series of travel advisories, warning of possible flooding and possible landslides in areas affected by Harvey. On Friday, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said he would travel to Florida to meet with officials and assess damage in those areas. But he did not rule out the possibility of a possible evacuation of people from those islands. Instead, he called on Congress to act quickly to prevent any further damage and to provide emergency assistance to those in need of it. President Trump said on Twitter on Thursday that his administration was prepared to take action against the country's worst disaster in decades. 'We are prepared for this disaster,' he wrote, referring to \"the worst that can happen to us in this country.\" The US president also tweeted on Saturday, September 23, 2017, \"I am ready for any response we receive from our government.\" He also sent a letter to President Barack Obama, calling on him to step up his efforts to tackle the disaster. Read more: \"Thank you for your continued support and support for our people,\" Trump tweeted. Trump's first day in office, a day after his inauguration, is set to kick off a two-day trip to Washington to visit the White House, where he is scheduled to hold a press conference with his wife, Melania, on Monday. Last week, Trump announced his intention to host a summit with President Xi Jinping in New York on Tuesday, according to a report by CNN's Andrew Breitbart. (Reuters, AP, AFP, Reuters) The president has already made his first official visit to Cuba since taking office in January, saying he wants to see \"a lot of good things to happen in our country\" and \"to be able to work with our friends and family.\" Trump, however, has not yet made a decision on whether or not he will attend the summit. According to his spokesman, former US Vice President Edouard Philippe, there is \"no doubt\" that Trump will make the trip. However, it is unclear whether the president will take any action at all, given the current situation in his own country, or whether he has any plans to go ahead with a visit. This is an important day for both the American and British governments, especially the British government, who are facing a difficult time in their relations with their island neighbors. Many of them are still in shock over the hurricane's impact on their economies. Some of these countries are already suffering from a lack of economic growth, while others are struggling to cope with an economic downturn. For example, Spain, Portugal, Ireland, Italy and Spain have all suffered from severe economic and political problems. Spain is struggling with economic woes. Italy is facing economic troubles as a result of its debt crisis. Portugal is also facing financial woes, too. Greece has suffered a financial crisis, with its economy suffering a severe contraction of 1.5 percent of GDP and unemployment in 2017. Spanish Prime Minister Gerard Coll"

Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government told the Supreme Court of India on Monday that the Rohingya were \"illegal\" immigrants. The hearing is taking place as Rohingya face severe violence in their native Myanmar. More than 400,000 Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh in the past few weeks to escape military and civilian reprisals that the United Nations has described as \"ethnic cleansing.\" Later on Monday, Myanmar's national security advisor said that his government was willing to welcome the refugees who had fled to Bangladesh back to their native Rakhine state, but that the details of the process still had to be worked out. \"We will make sure that everybody who left their home can return to their home but this is a process we have to discuss,\" Thaung Tun told Reuters news agency after a meeting with British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. It was unclear how this would affect the estimated 40,000 Rohingya believed to have settled in India, including 16,000 of whom are registered with the UN's refugee agency.

It argued that such links made them a \"serious threat to national security.\" The government also said there was a \"serious possibility of eruption of violence against Buddhists in India by radicalized Rohingya.\" Lawyer Colin Gonsalves, who in a separate case is representing about 7,000 Rohingya living in the northern Indian city of Jammu, countered the government's assertions. \"We just want to know: 40,000 people have been here, many of them for the last five years. Have you [the government] filed a single charge sheet, is anyone being prosecuted in the criminal court for being a terrorist? The answer is: no,\" he told DW. The court has adjourned the hearing in the matter to October 3. Lack of evidence India says it is not bound by the UN convention on refugees as it is not a signatory to the accord, but human rights activists disagree. \"The principle of non return of a person to a place where he will be executed or tortured has become a principle of customary international law which India follows,\" Gonsalves told DW. \"And it has attained the status of 'jus cogens,' which is a principle of law that no country can say is not applicable to it, such as torture and genocide.\" In a communication sent to all states in August, the Home Ministry [interior ministry] said the illegal migrants were more susceptible to terrorist recruitment efforts. But an investigation by Indian broadcaster NDTV found \"little evidence of the government claim.\" The investigation that was carried out at major Rohingya settlements in the country showed little involvement in criminal wrongdoing by the refugees. Lack of any evidence to support the government claim has led to speculations that the Rohingya were being targeted for their religion by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu-nationalist government. \"It is really unfortunate that the government is going back on its commitment to refugees which it has reiterated several times in the past merely because these Rohingyas are Muslims,\" said lawyer Prashant Bhushan, who filed the plea on behalf of two Rohingya men. \"I mean this is clearly a case of religious discrimination and an attempt to arouse a sort of feeling of... an anti-Muslim feeling or try and communalise the situation,\" he told reporters outside the courthouse. The UN's human rights chief last week deplored Indian government's move to deport Rohingya refugees. \"India cannot carry out collective expulsions, or return people to a place where they risk torture or other serious violations,\" Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein said. The Rohingya are an Indo-Aryan people, the vast majority of whom are Muslims. They usually migrate to India through a rather porous border to escape persecution in their native Rakhine state in Myanmar, where they have been denied citizenship rights. They are viewed by the local authorities as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. Myanmar's Buddhist majority is often accused of subjecting them to discrimination and violence.

Hundreds of people, the majority of them Rohingya, have been killed in the violence that has seen many homes destroyed and several villages burned down. Myanmar's government maintains the crackdown is part of a counter-terrorism drive, while the UN's al-Hussein has said that it \"seems a textbook example of ethnic cleansing.\"",
        "generated_story": "India's interior ministry: Rohingyas pose 'erious threat' to India India's Interior Ministry (Reuters) - The Indian government has said that the Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar pose a grave threat to the country's security. The Supreme Court of India has issued a scathing verdict in the case, saying that they pose an \"irreparable threat\" to its security and human rights. India, which has been embroiled in a bitter row with Myanmar over its treatment of Rohingya refugees, said on Wednesday that it would take action against the group if it were to be allowed to return to their home state of Jammu and Kashmir. \"We will not allow this to happen,\" the ministry said in an official statement. It added that India would not tolerate any form of discrimination against Rohingya, adding that \"it is our duty as a country to protect the rights of all people in this country.\" The statement came after the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) on Thursday condemned the violence in Rakhine state and called for an end to violence between the Muslim community and the government of Myanmar. According to UNSC spokesman Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, the situation was \"very tense\" and \"difficult\" for the Indian security forces to cope with the influx of refugees from neighboring Myanmar, where thousands of people have fled to neighboring Bangladesh in recent months. In a statement released by the UN, India said it was committed to fighting against terrorism and extremism in all its forms, including the use of violence against civilians. However, it did not say how many Rohingya had been killed, nor did it specify the number of deaths, but it said there was a \"significant number\" of cases in which people were being killed. This is not the first time India and Myanmar have been at loggerheads over the plight of the persecuted Rohingya. Last year, a UN court in New Delhi had ruled that Myanmar was not to blame for its brutal crackdown on the minority group. On Wednesday, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was visiting Myanmar on a visit to his home country, told reporters that he would visit the state on Friday. He also said he was looking forward to seeing the new government's plan to tackle the issue. Indian Foreign Minister Prashant Bhushan told DW that his country was ready to cooperate with India in its efforts to resolve the crisis. But he said India had not been able to do so because of a lack of cooperation from the international community. 'We are not going to give up on this issue,' he added.

Read More: How India is trying to prevent the spread of extremism and intolerance in Muslim-majority Myanmar Read Less Less than 1.5 million people across the world are living in fear of persecution and violence, according to a new report by a German newspaper, NDTV, citing a report in The New York Times (AFP, Reuters) citing unnamed Indian intelligence sources. A UN spokesman said the report was based on information from a source close to Modi's office in Delhi, and that Indian officials were aware of reports that Modi was planning to travel to Myanmar to meet with security officials. Reuters reported earlier this week that an Indian official had told the German foreign ministry that there were no plans to visit Myanmar at the time of his visit. An Indian diplomat, however, denied the allegations and said \"there was no reason for India to go there at all.\" Reuters, AFP, AP and DW reported that a spokesman for Indian Interior Minister Colin Gonsalves said Modi had made the comments in response to questions about the security situation in Rohingya-dominated Myanmar and asked for a meeting with him to discuss how to deal with it. Modi has promised to take the matter to an international forum in Washington, D.C. next week. If the Myanmar government does not respond, he is expected to hold a press conference on Monday, June 11, at which time he will be asked to explain what he thinks will happen. What do you think? What are the chances of this meeting? Is it possible for Modi to make a deal? \"I think it's a good idea that we will have a dialogue,\" he told Reuters. I am not sure if Modi will attend the meeting, though I think he has already made it clear that this is a very important step in that direction. There is no chance of an agreement between Modi and Modi being elected as prime minister. That would be a big step forward for his government, given the current political situation, if he wants to avoid a repeat of last year's failed attempt to win the election. Meanwhile, Modi is likely to press ahead with a summit in Beijing on June 12-13, when the US is due to convene a special summit of world leaders on July 12 and 13. At the same time, there is also a chance to address the concerns of other countries, such as China, Russia and Iran, as well as Russia, China and China? The US have already said they will discuss the possibility of joining the summit."

        "target": "NFL stars defy Donald Trump's call for boycott Baltimore Ravens and Jacksonsville Jaguars players \"took a knee\" during the national anthem after Trump urged fans to boycott football matches. The kneeling protest, to highlight social injustice, has stepped up a gear. Hundreds of National Football League (NFL) stars protested President Donald Trump's call for fans to boycott the league by refusing to stand for the US national anthem this weekend, starting Sunday's game between the Baltimore Ravens and Jacksonsville Jaguars. A number of other players locked arms in solidarity ahead of the game at Wembley Stadium in London. Jacksonville Jaguars' owner Shahid Khan, who last year donated one million dollars\u00a0(840,000 euros) to the Trump campaign, locked his arms with players - a rare scene, as owners almost never take to the field. US media reported that about 200 players on Sunday sat, knelt or raised their fists in defiance of Trump's comments. In one of the most memorable moments, singer Rico LaVelle took a knee and held up a fist at the last line of the Star Spangled Banner ahead of the game between the Detriot Lions and Atlanta Falcons. The protest came in response to Trump's tweets on Sunday morning urging fans to boycott NFL games to pressure the league into firing or suspending players to kneel in protest during the national anthem. In an early morning tweet, Trump posted: \"If NFL fans refuse to go to games until players stop disrespecting our Flag and Country, you will see change take place fast. Fire or suspend!\" \"NFL attendance and ratings are WAY DOWN. Boring games yes, but many stay away because they love our country. League should back US,\" he added. Later, the president said that his rant \"has nothing to do with race,\" despite the fact that the origins of the protest are to do with police brutality against minorities, especially African Americans. Trump said his comments were instead about \"respect for our country and respect for our flag.\" Trump's spat with US professional sports began at a Republican rally in Alabama on Friday, when the president attacked activist NFL players for kneeling or sitting during the national anthem, labelling them as \"sons of bitches.\" \"Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, 'Get that son of a bitch off the field right now... he is fired'?\" Trump told a crowd of cheering supporters. That day, basketball star Stephen Curry, the top player for California's Golden State Warriors, announced that he would not be attending a traditional White House reception honoring the National Basketball Association champions. The kneeling protest was started by former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick who refused to stand for the anthem back in 2016. Kaepernick's gesture came amid a spate of deadly police shootings of black men and was aimed at drawing more attention to treatment of minorities in the US. However, Kaepernick has since become a free agent, after failing to be signed by a new team for the new NFL season. NFL executives decry Trump's calls Trump also drew the ire of senior NFL executives and team owners. Responding to Trump's tweets, Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti, said he \"100 percent\" supported his players' decision to kneel during the anthem. Robert Kraft, the owner of the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots, who is also a close friend of Trump, said in a statement on Sunday that he was deeply disappointed by the president's comments in Alabama. Kraft defended players' rights to \"peacefully affect social change and raise awareness in a manner that they feel is most impactful,\" and said that sports were a unifying force in the US. \"Our political leaders could learn a lot from the lessons of teamwork and working together toward a common goal,\" he said. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, who has taken much of the heat for Kaepernick's failure to find a new team, was also quick to condemn Trump's comments. Read more: NFL player's refusal to stand for national anthem ignites online controversy \"The NFL and our players are at our best when we help create a sense of unity in our country and our culture,\" Goodell said. \"There is no better example than the amazing response from our clubs and players to the terrible natural disasters we've experienced over the last month.\" Denouncing Trump's remarks, Goodell said: \"Divisive comments like these demonstrate an unfortunate lack of respect for the NFL, our great game and all of our players, and a failure to understand the overwhelming force for good our clubs and players represent in our communities.\" But Trump hit back later on Sunday at a worsening furore, saying the row \"has nothing to do with race.\" Instead, he said: \"This has to do with respect for our country, and respect for our flag.\" At least seven NFL team owners donated at least $1 million each to Trump's presidential campaign last year. They include the owners of the New York Jets, New England Patriots, Dallas Cowboys, Washington Redskins, Jacksonville Jaguars, Houston Texans, Los Angeles Rams and Tampa Bay Buccaneers",
        "generated_story": "NFL players kneel during national anthem US President Donald Trump has called for NFL players to stand for the national flag during the playing of the National Anthem. The NFL has condemned the president's call, saying it was a \"disgrace\" to the NFL. NFL owners have called on the league to step up its game-day protests, which have led to protests across the country. On Sunday, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell issued a statement calling for a boycott of Sunday's Super Bowl between the Baltimore Ravens and the New England Patriots. \"We are not going to allow this to happen again,\" Goodell said in the statement, adding that \"the NFL is a great place to play football.\" NFL owner Robert Kraft said Sunday that he was \"deeply disappointed\" by Trump's comments. He also said that NFL teams should not be allowed to disrespect the flag while they are playing the game, and that it is \"not acceptable\" for teams to do so. In addition, he said he would not allow any NFL team to be fined for disrespecting the U.S. flag in a game that was played at Wembley Stadium in London on Sunday. According to a report in The New York Times, \"NFL owners should be very careful not to let their players disrespect our flag and our country.\" The report also noted that the Ravens' owner, Steve Bisciotti, was not a fan of President Trump. But he did not rule out the possibility that Trump would call for an NFL boycott, as he has done in recent years. Last year, Trump tweeted that President Barack Obama's administration had \"made it clear that we will not tolerate disrespect of our Flag.\" In response, the White House said it would take steps to prevent Trump from calling the protests \"a disgrace\" and \"an act of disrespect.\" Last week, a Twitter user called out Trump for his comments, calling them \"ridiculous,\" and said Trump should step down from his position as NFL commissioner. His comments came after a series of tweets in which he appeared to suggest that players should stand up for their country and not disrespect their flag. Trump, who was elected in November 2016, had called the players' protests a form of \"divide and conquer\" in his first year in office. It's unclear whether Trump was referring specifically to President Obama, but it's not clear whether he is referring to Trump as a racist or a misogynist. Twitter users have also criticized the President for calling on him to call out players who have knelt in solidarity with the nation's flag-waving nation. Some have accused him of being a hypocrite, while others have criticized him for not doing enough to address the issue. Others, however, say he should have done more to protect the rights of his players, rather than to make them feel that they were being treated unfairly. They also say Trump is not the only one who has made such a call. A number of NFL executives have said they don't believe the comments are accurate. One NFL executive said on Twitter: \"I think he's the worst president ever. I think that's a terrible thing to say.\" Meanwhile, some NFL fans have taken to social media to express their displeasure over the Trump administration's stance on NFL protests. Many of them have been critical of Trump and his policies on social issues, such as his call to fire NFL President Colin Kaepernick. While some have praised his actions, others are calling him a traitor and saying he shouldn't be president. And others, like former NFL quarterback Stephen Curry, have expressed concern about his treatment by the media. (AP, AP, Reuters) The president has also expressed his support for Trump in an interview with Fox Business Network's \"The View\" program, where he says he will \"fight back\" against Trump if he doesn't win the presidency. This is the latest example of a president who is trying to undermine the legitimacy of American democracy. That's exactly what the American people are saying: Trump wants to see a change in America's political system, not an end to it. For the first time since the 2016 presidential election, there's been a lot of attention paid to him. Now, it appears that a new president is coming to Washington, D.C.'s administration is taking a step back from the criticism of him, with some of its most outspoken critics saying they're not even aware of what's going on in Washington at the moment. However, many of those who criticize Trump are also saying that his remarks are a distraction from a bigger issue: the lack of respect for players and their rights to protest the anthem. There's no doubt that this is an issue that has not been addressed in any way. What's more, though, is that there is no evidence that any president would be willing to take a position on this issue, even if it means he won't have a chance to change his mind about what he thinks is happening in this country's politics. If Trump does that, that could be a good thing, because it could lead to an even bigger problem for him becoming president"

The move follows a political protest at the first such match. In a statement released on Friday, the German football association (DFB) announced that the games would be rescheduled for 2018 and that talks would take place between them and their Chinese counterparts in order explore how to move forward. \"To the regret of all parties involved, the project has not received the broad approval that had been expected,\" the DFB said. \"In fact, the project was used by a handful of spectators to send messages that were considered hurtful by the Chinese team, officials, the Chinese Football Association's support staff and Chinese spectators.\" Protests in opening match The first of the arranged matches, against TSV Schott Mainz of the fourth-tier Regionalliga S\u00fcdwest was interrupted midway through the first half when the Chinese players left the field because a small group of activists had unfurled Tibetan flags. The team later returned to the field after the flags had been taken down, before succumbing to a 3-0 defeat. On Monday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry strongly criticized the protest. Initially, it had been thought that the Chinese side would play in the Regionalliga S\u00fcdwest - a regional division of Germany's fourth tier which has only 19 teams but the plan was revised so the matches would just be friendlies. This followed an agreement signed in 2016 between the German FA and the Chinese government to help boost the sport in the Asian country, where the Bundesliga is increasingly popular. Financial boost not enough to soothe concerns Despite the financial boost for the clubs \u2013 TSV Schott Mainz were reportedly paid a fee of \u20ac15,000 ($17.800) for last weekend's game \u2013 the move hasn't proved entirely popular with German fans, many of whom see it as just another example of commercial interests trumping sporting concerns. But the protests, and potential for further disruption, seem to be behind the cancellations - the DFB said both federations were aware of \"substantial evidence of further escalation,\" FSV Frankfurt, who were due to host the Chinese side on Saturday, said earlier this week that they would not ban protests despite an angry response to last week's incident from Beijing. \"We will not back a single centimeter off the basic rights our our democracy, including those relating to freedom of speech,\" FSV Frankfurt President Michael G\u00f6rner said in an interview with the Stuttgarter Nachrichten and Stuttgarter Zeitung newspapers. His words echoed those of DFB vice-president Ronny Zimmerman, who said that the games should be played \"within the framework of freedom of expression.\" The fixtures that have been abandoned include games against Wormatia Worms and Bundesliga club Hoffenheim's reserves. mp/pfd (dpa, SID)",

The team was scheduled to play in Wormatia Worms on Saturday, but it was canceled because of protests by the Chinese football association. According to a statement from the Bundesliga's governing body, CSU Schott Mainz (CSU Frankfurt), the team had been scheduled for Saturday's match against TFC Frankfurt. \"We have decided not to participate in this year's competition,\" the statement said. It added that the tournament would not be held until the end of the year, and that it would be open to the public. However, it is not clear whether the event will take place at the same time as the Confederations Cup, which Germany is hosting next month. In addition, there will be no official announcement on the future of this tournament until at least mid-January, when the teams are expected to return to their home ground in Womba, where they will compete for a chance to qualify for next season's World Cup in Russia. There is also the possibility of an international tournament in China in 2018, as well as an exhibition match between Germany and the United Arab Emirates in Qatar. For the time being, Germany has not been invited to attend the competition, with the chance of being invited only if the players are willing to take part in it. This is the second year in a row that a German team has been unable to make the trip to China. Last year the club had to cancel a game against a Chinese team after it lost 2-1 to 1-0. Since then, however, a number of teams have returned to Germany, including FSV Frankfurt, Stuttgarter Nachrichten and FC Bayern Munich.

We are disappointed that we have not had the opportunity to see this kind of success,\" he told the Dpa news agency, referring to an incident that took place last year between the two sides in which a player was injured during a training session. German football associations have been criticized for their lack of discipline and for failing to provide adequate training facilities for young players. They have also been accused of not providing enough information on how to properly train and prepare for international matches. Many of their players have expressed concern about the situation, saying they are not able to train properly in order to compete in international competition. Some of them have even taken to social media to express their concerns. Others have said they don't know what to do with their own training camps, such as at home and abroad. But they also say that they have no idea what the conditions are for training, because they do not know the rules of international football. That's not the case in any way. I am not a fan of football and I have never been involved in professional football, so I think it's a bit of a shame that something like this has to happen, especially when you have a team that is so young and so inexperienced.

        "target": "Experts: Taliban have not changed strategy with Kabul restaurant attack The weekend attack on a Kabul restaurant frequented by foreigners came as no surprise to international organizations on the ground. Experts don't believe the Taliban have changed their strategy to target more civilians. Dramatic scenes must have played out in the restaurant: Guests sought cover under tables as a group of terrorists shot wildly into the dining rooms. News agencies report the restaurant owner tried in vain to fend off the attackers. He was among the more than 20 people who perished, most of whom were employees at international organizations. The attackers were also among the dead. During the evening dinner rush, at 7:00 p.m. Friday (17.01.2014), one of three Taliban members detonated his explosives-laden vest and blew a breach in the highly secured restaurant. Neither the man-high blast walls, nor the secured access points with armed guards could stop the attackers. The two remaining terrorists were killed later in a firefight with security forces at the scene. No change in Taliban strategy The suicide bombing on the popular Lebanese restaurant, Taverna Du Liban, in the high-end Kabul neighborhood of Wazir Akbar Khan was the worst attack so far in 2014. Afghanistan votes for a new president in April; and the international troops are scheduled to withdraw from the country by the end of the year. Although there are plans for a small contingent to remain in Afghanistan, President Hamid Karzai first has to sign a bilateral security agreement with the United States. But he continues to play for time. In this context, the Taliban may be targeting civilians more in order to drive out not just the military coalition, but the entire international community. Yet \"as horrible as this incident is, I don't see a change in strategy,\" said Thomas Ruttig, the co-director of the Afghan Analysts Network. Similar attacks have also been launched before, \"at least 12 to 15 times in the past eight years,\" Ruttig said. The worst attack was in 2012 at Qargha Lake, a popular weekend destination near Kabul. More than 20 people were killed, all of them Afghans. Extensive security precautions The Taliban, which normally doesn't miss an opportunity for fiery rhetoric, hasn't declared a change in strategy. A spokesman for the Islamist militant group said the attack was retaliation for a NATO airstrike in Parwan Province, a few kilometers north of Kabul. According to an assistant of the Afghan president, seven children and one woman died in the coalition strike. \"You have to carefully monitor the security situation,\" Nils W\u00f6rmer, head of the Konrad Adenauer Institute in Kabul, told DW. \"But I think it's a bit early to talk about a change in [Taliban] strategy.\" W\u00f6rmer's office lies just a few hundred meters from the site of Friday's attack. He could clearly hear the explosion, which shook the window panes in his office. \"It was immediately clear to me that something had happened,\" W\u00f6rmer recounted. But the Konrad Adenauer Institute was prepared. \"We had a relatively concrete warning in the last week related to our neighborhood, and we were very cautious,\" W\u00f6rmer said. He met with colleagues in his secured office. Like most of the international organizations, the Konrad Adenauer Institute is also integrated into the security networks. \"The security precautions are high,\" W\u00f6rmer said. \"But that doesn't exclude the possibility that something similar could happen again.\" But the Afghan security forces have succeeded in preventing many attacks in the past few months, he said. Kabul residents criticize Taliban An informal, impromptu poll by DW's Kabul correspondent, Hussein Sirat, suggested the Taliban are not winning Afghan hearts and minds with such attacks. \"Wherever the Taliban have killed civilians, they have not achieved their goal,\" said Mirwais, a pedestrian in the Kabul city center. Idris, another Kabul resident, seconded Mirwais' sentiment. \"The Taliban intimidate the people so that the security agreement won't be signed,\" he said. \"But the people won't bend to this intimidation.\" How the international organizations adapt to the tense security situation in Kabul will come after many conversations, analyses, and briefings in the following days. But W\u00f6rmer is not thinking about giving up. \"We have a clear agenda and long-term projects, which I considered to be very sensible,\" W\u00f6rmer said. \"I am of the opinion, as I was before, that what I'm doing here with the Konrad Adenauer Institute is worth the risks.\"",
        "generated_story": "The Taliban haven't changed their strategy with the Kabul restaurant attack The Taliban have not changed its strategy in the wake of last week's deadly attack on a restaurant in Kabul, observers say. The Afghan government has not made any changes in its approach to the attack, which killed at least 11 people and wounded more than 100 others. \"We are not going to change our strategy,\" said Thomas Ruttig, a researcher at the Konrad Adenauer Institute in Beirut, Lebanon, who was among the victims of Friday's attack. He said the Taliban had \"no intention of changing their approach at all.\" The attack was carried out by the Afghan Taliban, according to a statement from the group's spokesman, Nils W\u00f6rmer. Wazir Akbar Khan, the head of Afghanistan Analysts Network, told Reuters that \"the Taliban are no longer the enemy of the people, but they are the ones who are trying to take over the country.\" \"They are a very strong and determined group of people,\" Karzai said, adding that he had not seen any change in his strategy since he took office in 2009. In the past, he has tried to build a strong Taliban presence in Afghanistan. But he's not able to do that anymore. Last week, when he was in power for a year and a half, his government was unable to contain the threat of a new Taliban insurgency. It was the first time in a long time that a Taliban attack had taken place outside the capital, Kabul. Since then, however, it's become increasingly difficult for the government to control the situation, particularly in Parwan Province, where many of its residents live. On Friday, for example, Taliban fighters attacked a hotel in Qargha Lake, near the border with Pakistan. They also attacked the hotel's restaurant, prompting a series of deadly attacks, including a suicide attack in which a woman was killed and three others were wounded. At the same time, Afghan security forces have been battling the Islamic State (IS) in northern Afghanistan for several months, and the latest attack has been the deadliest in recent years. Taliban leaders have said they will not allow the attacks to continue, despite the fact that they have the capacity to carry out attacks on their own. According to an Afghan intelligence official, \"we have no reason to believe that this attack is the result of an act of terrorism,\" which took place on the night of Sept. 11, 2014. A Taliban spokesman said on Friday that the attacker had been killed by a roadside bomb and was being held in custody. Afghan officials have denied any responsibility, saying it was a \"terrorist attack\" and that there was no threat to their security. However, they did not rule out the possibility of further attacks. Afghanistan's government is currently fighting the IS-linked Haqqanis, an insurgent group that has claimed responsibility for attacks in neighboring Pakistan and Afghanistan, as well as a number of other insurgent groups. This is not an isolated incident. There is no indication of any imminent threat from IS, nor is there any indication that IS is planning to attack the restaurant. Instead, there is a growing sense of insecurity in many parts of Kabul and in some areas of northern and southern provinces, such as the northern province of Kandahar, that it is likely to be a target of attacks by IS and IS. That is, until the new government comes into power in January. For the time being, Afghanistan is expected to remain a stable and stable country, with a relatively stable security situation. As for foreign policy, analysts say it will be difficult to predict what will happen next, given the current political situation in this country. Foreign policy is also a key factor in determining the future of security policy. NATO has said it won't intervene in any way to prevent an escalation of violence. US President Donald Trump has called for an end to US-led airstrikes against IS militants. (Reuters, AP, AFP, dpa) US Secretary of State John Kerry has also called on Washington to step down from his post as defense secretary. President Barack Obama, meanwhile, has vowed to keep the US and NATO allies on his side. Washington has repeatedly warned that Washington will step up its efforts to protect the United States, NATO and its allies in Europe. Obama has already said he would not intervene militarily if it doesn't take action against the militants, though he is unlikely to intervene. His spokesman told the AP news agency on Saturday that US troops would be deployed to Afghanistan on Sunday. Reuters, Reuters and AFP reported on Thursday that Afghan President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's office had no immediate comment on whether or not Washington would step in to address the issue. Kabul is still in talks with Washington, Washington and other countries about a possible US withdrawal from NATO. Officials in Washington have also said that if Washington does not act on its own, then it may not be an option for Afghanistan to withdraw from its NATO ally, Saudi Arabia, in order to avoid a military confrontation with Iran, Russia and Iran. Meanwhile, President Vladimir Putin has warned Washington not to act as soon."

        "target": "Inching towards direct talks on Syria They came to hold talks, but started negotiations with mutual affronts. But if there is one person who might be able to mediate between the intransigent Syrian conflict parties, it's Lakhdar Brahimi. Lakhdar Brahimi, the United Nations special envoy for Syria, seemed very tired on Friday (24.01.2014). He had had a long day, which was actually supposed to be the first real day of negotiations at the Syria Conference in Geneva. \"Good afternoon,\" Brahimi told the assembled international press, before adding, \"or good evening, I don't know.\" At the Palais des Nations in Geneva, he presented the most important result of his attempts to mediate between the Syrian government and the opposition to the more than 250 journalists who had managed to get a coveted place at the press conference: \"Tomorrow we expect and we have agreed that we will meet in the same room.\" What Brahimi is declaring an achievement doesn't sound like much, but considering how irreconcilable the conflict parties have been, even that can be seen as a small success. Separate talks with Brahimi The two delegations were actually due to meet on the first day of negotiations in Geneva in order to agree on a timetable and on the subject and agenda of the talks. But emotions are running too high on both sides. Instead both delegations held separate talks with Lahkkdar Brahimi, both lasting just about an hour each In the morning. The Syrian government delegation had apparently been threatening to leave the conference. At least that is what the deputy foreign minister Faisal Mekdad had implied. \"We are here to start the negotiations,\" he told waiting journalists, \"but we found that the other party did not want to come.\" Before the conference, the opposition had explained that for its delegation, the formation of a transition government would be a central tenet of the negotiations. They emphasized that this topic should be discussed right at the beginning of talks and that the establishment of such a body should be initiated without delay. Social media and good old propaganda The representatives of the Syrian National Coalition that were present in Geneva neatly used all imaginable channels to make their views public. At #Geneva2, they tweeted: \"Forming a transitional body is our major priority,\" leaving people in no doubt that the Syrian National Council would not want to include Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Assad's government, on the other hand, is relying on classic propaganda and loyal state media representatives in Geneva. An impressive entourage of dominant journalists from state-run media outlets is constantly at hand, accompanying the government delegation and making sure they get their point across at press conferences. Lakhdar Brahimi even had a small altercation with a journalist from a Syrian state news agency, who made a political statement under the pretense of asking the UN mediator a question. \"Are there any signs that Saudi Arabia, Turkey and other countries would stop the support of terrorism in Syria?,\" she asked in somewhat shaky English, before Brahimi interrupted her. \"Please, please, there is no point in asking such questions!\" Such exchanges hint at the type of negotiating style the experienced diplomat and mediator Brahimi must have behind the scenes. 'Wish us luck' Lakhdar Brahimi described the preliminary talks that took place in Geneva as encouraging and asked for patience. He said that because the peace conference had come about at the last minute and the delegations had therefore only been appointed very recently, there hadn't been enough time to hold preliminary discussions - a task that the delegations were now catching up on. \"We never expected it to be easy and I'm sure it's not going to be,\" he said. \"But I think the two parties understand what is at stake. Their country is in very, very bad shape.\" He added: \"The huge ambition of this process is to save Syria. Nothing less than that.\" After appealing to the willingness of both parties to negotiate, he simply added: \"So wish us luck!\" Fight for freedom As the official delegations held talks with UN mediator Brahimi in the Palais des Nations, the European headquarters of the United Nations, hundreds of Syrian expatriates who had come from all over Europe protested outside, forming a sea of red, white and black Syrian flags on the Place des Nations. With their presence outside the UN gates they wanted to show that despite all the government propaganda, the Syrian National coalition has a lot of support from the Syrian people. Thirty-two-year-old Ziad Malki came to Geneva from Zurich to show his solidarity. Ziad knows how it feels to be deprived of his freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. In 2005, he was arrested at a demonstration in Damascus and says he was tortured during his time in prison. Now he is fighting for a new Syria from outside the country's borders. Ziad is sure that with Bashar al-Assad and his family, there will be nothing new. \"We don't want this man to be in",
        "generated_story": "Mediating with the Syrian National Coalition in Geneva UN mediator Faisal Mekdad has mediated with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad at the United Nations. The Syrian president has been meeting with his Syrian counterpart, Lakhdar Brahimi, for the first time since the start of the conflict in Syria in 2011. \"We have been able to reach an agreement on a number of issues, including the implementation of a cease-fire, the cessation of hostilities and the creation of an interim government. We are hopeful that this will be the last time we see the Assad regime in power in the long term,\" he told reporters at a news conference in Switzerland on Thursday. He added that he was \"very impressed\" by the cooperation between the two sides, adding that \"the Syrian government is doing a great job.\" \"I am very impressed with what we are seeing here,\" Mekd said, referring to the fact that Syria's president, Hafez al Assad, is not a dictator, but rather a human being who is capable of doing what he does best, which is to help the people of Syria. Speaking to reporters in Zurich on Friday after the Geneva talks, Mekdad said he had been in contact with a delegation of Syrian opposition leaders from Geneva, Switzerland, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq and Iran, as well as with representatives from several other countries. 'We are very pleased to be working with them,' he added, noting that it is \"a very important step for us to move on from the current situation in our country,\" which he described as a \"difficult situation\" in which Assad's regime has become increasingly weak and weak, and that the international community has to step in and help him in his fight against the Islamic State (IS) and other terrorist groups. Mekda said the talks were \"productive\" but that there was a lack of clarity on how to resolve the crisis, particularly in Aleppo, where the regime is still in control of most of its territory. In Geneva on Saturday, he said that a ceasefire was in place to end the civil war, although he did not specify when it would take place, because the ceasefire would not allow for it to take effect until the end of this year, when the government would have to agree to a new ceasefire, if it was not already agreed to by all sides. On Sunday, a Syrian delegation headed to Geneva to meet with UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to discuss the situation there, according to Reuters news agency. It was the second day of talks on Syria, following a two-day visit by Ban, who was due to arrive on Monday to attend the UN's General Assembly on the sidelines of his annual conference. Ban's first meeting was held on Wednesday, with Ban and his team of mediators, diplomats and representatives of other international organizations. Both Ban said they were looking forward to attending the meeting. However, they also stressed the need for more time to get to know each other and to make sure that they had a chance to work together in a way that would be beneficial to both the country and its people. They also emphasized the importance of having a strong, united front in their efforts to achieve a common goal: to create a stable, stable and inclusive future for all Syrians, rather than just a one-party state. This is something that can only be achieved through dialogue and dialogue. For example, it's not possible for Assad himself to accept that his regime will not be allowed to continue to use chemical weapons, even if he has the means to do so. That is, until he is forced to give up his position as head of state, Ban told Reuters in an interview on Sunday. But he also said there is a need to have a clear vision of what the future holds for Syria: \"The future is clear that we will do what is best for our people, not just the Syrians.\" Ban has also been called upon to address the humanitarian crisis in order to prevent it from spreading to other areas, such as the Middle East and North Africa. And he called on Ban to ensure that Assad has a firm grasp on his country's future, saying he would do everything he can to improve his chances of becoming a world leader. As a result, \"we are not going to allow this to happen in this way.\" He said Ban had already made a deal with Russia, Iran and Turkey to cooperate with him on this issue. Assad is currently in exile in Turkey and has not yet signed a peace treaty with Moscow. His government has yet to sign off on it, however, so he will have the opportunity to travel to Russia to negotiate a solution to this conflict. Meanwhile, Russia and China are also working on an ambitious plan to establish a permanent peace process with Assad. So, there's a lot of work ahead of him. At the same time, this is the only way to solve the problem that is being done. There is no doubt about it. Russia has already begun to put pressure on Assad and Russia. Syria is also looking for a peaceful solution. If"

Tito Vilanova has died at the age of 45. May he rest in peace,\" the statement said.

The Catalan club's head coach has been diagnosed with a rare form of cancer, according to the Catalan newspaper El Pais. He had been battling the disease for more than a year and a half. \"I have been suffering from cancer for a long time,\" he told reporters on Wednesday, adding that the cancer had spread to his lungs and liver. In his last days, he said he was in intensive care at a local hospital, where he had received treatment for the illness. His last day in the hospital was Monday, May 14, and he died on Tuesday, the day before the end of the regular season, in his hometown of Barca. According to Barcelona's website, \"the cancer has spread rapidly and is now spreading to other parts of Spain and the world, including the United States, Europe, Africa and Asia.\" He died at the age of 57, a few days after suffering a heart attack while on holiday with his wife and two young children in Spain. At the time of his death, his family was celebrating the birth of their first child. They were celebrating his first birthday, which was on May 15, with their son, who was born on the same day. Vilanca's wife, Maria, was also celebrating her son's birthday on Sunday, but she was unable to attend the celebration because of a stomach ailment. She was hospitalized for three days and was expected to be discharged on Monday. Her condition has not been confirmed by the medical team, however, they said. Police are still investigating the cause of her death. It is not clear how long she would have to live with the condition, or if she will be able to make it through the next few months. There is no official word yet on whether she is in remission or not. However, her family is hopeful that she has recovered from her illness and will continue to receive treatment, she told the newspaper. 'She is doing very well,' she said, referring to her husband, former FC Barcelona player and current Barcelona manager, Toni Kroos. For the first time in her life, Vilavans' health has improved significantly since the beginning of last year, when he underwent chemotherapy and radiation treatments to treat the lung cancer that was causing her to develop a recurrence of breast cancer in 2014. But the treatment was not enough to prevent her from continuing to suffer from this disease, as she had already had to undergo chemotherapy for several years. On May 16, 2014, Barcelona signed a contract extension to extend her contract for another three years, saying that they would not renew the contract until she received the extension. That extension would give her the chance to continue her work as a medical consultant. Meanwhile, there is still the possibility that her cancer could be treated with chemotherapy, so she could continue working on her own treatments for her condition. And that would be a good thing, because her health is very good. After all, this is a very important part of being a professional footballer, not just a coach. You can't be too old to play for your team and have a career in football and still have the ability to win the league, even if you don't know how many years you've been playing. So, let's just say that it's been a while since I've played for Barcelona. I'm very happy to see the team get to this point and I think that's a positive step for them. We're going to keep working hard to get back to where we were before. Let's see if we can get there, shall we? We'll see what the future holds for this team. What do you think? Is there a cure for cancer? What is the cure? Well, we'll find out soon enough.

The results are expected to be announced in the coming days. Ukrainian President Yulia Tymoshenko, who is seeking a second term in office, won a landslide victory in Sunday's parliamentary election in Kyiv. Shevchenko, a former deputy prime minister, defeated incumbent President Viktor Yanukovych in a tight contest for the presidency of Ukraine. \"I am very confident that I will win the election,\" she told DW, adding that she would be able to win a majority of seats in parliament. But she added that the vote would not be decided by the ballot box, which will be held at the end of November. Ukraine has yet to announce its presidential candidates, but the results could change in coming weeks. Opinion polls show a strong opposition to the president, with the most likely result being a hung parliament, as well as an increase in anti-government protests. Opposition parties have called for a referendum on the constitution and a new constitution that would make it easier for Ukrainians to vote in their own country. In addition, the opposition has called on voters to cast their ballots in referendums and elections in other European countries, such as Germany, France, Italy, Spain and the United States. Many Ukrainians have rejected the idea of an early election, saying that it was too early to declare a winner, while others have said that they would vote for an independent candidate. Some voters, however, said they were more likely to back a pro-European candidate who had been in power since the early 1990s. According to a Reuters poll published Sunday, more than a third of voters in eastern Ukraine voted in favor of a \"yes\" or \"no\" vote, compared with less than one-third of those who voted against the incumbent. A number of other candidates have also announced their intentions to run, including former Prime Minister Viktor Yushchenko and former opposition leader Andrij Shevsky. Both of them have campaigned on a platform of economic reform and economic liberalization. However, they have been unable to get the support of many Ukrainians who are disillusioned with their government's policies. They are also not sure how much support they can get from the people, and how long they will have to wait until the new president is sworn in, or whether they'll be allowed to take office. On the other hand, there is a lot of talk about how to improve the situation in Ukraine, especially with regard to how the economy is being managed. There is no doubt that Ukraine is going to have a better future than the current one. That's because the Ukrainian people are not ready to give up on their dreams of becoming the next president. It's not just a matter of who gets the job, it's also a question of how many people will want to live in this country and what kind of life they want. If they don't, what will happen to them? In the meantime, that's the question that will come up in November, when the elections will take place. What will they do? What do they expect? The Ukrainian parliament will decide on November 7, 2017, after a two-day general election that is supposed to decide the fate of their country? \"We'll see what happens,\" a spokesman for parliament said, referring to parliamentary elections that are currently scheduled for next year, in which the parliament is due to hold a special session on Tuesday, Nov. 7. This year's election will also decide whether or not the government can be re-elected, if at all, at which point it will remain in government. And there are still many questions about the future of democracy and democracy that remain unanswered. For now, though, this is the only way to find out what the outcome of this election could be. I'm sure that we'll have the best chance of finding out. So far, so good news, I think we've had a very good start to this year. We've already had some good results.

        "target": "Automation in the dairy cow industry A small but nevertheless important sector of the German economy today is agriculture. Although the number of farms has declined over the decades, production has actually increased -- especially at dairy farms. Modern automation technology and robotics are helping to keep both cows and farmers happy, but at the cost of jobs.",
        "generated_story": "Automation in the Dairy Cow Industry in Germany Automation is a key part of the dairy cow industry, according to a new report. The report says that the industry has become increasingly dependent on the use of automated machinery to produce milk and dairy products. In the past few years, it's become more and more common for companies to use automated equipment to make milk, butter, eggs and other dairy goods. Now, however, the trend is changing. Dairy cows are becoming increasingly reliant on automated machines to feed their cows, which is why they are increasingly being used as a substitute for dairy cows. This is due to the rise in milk production and the increasing number of cows that are being produced in Europe. But, as the report points out, there is still a lot of work to be done in this area. For example, when it comes to producing milk for cows and eggs, this is the only way to do it. It's also the first time in history that a company has been able to manufacture milk in such a way that it doesn't have to import milk from the United States. And, of course, that's not to say that there isn't a market for milk or eggs in other countries. That's because the milk industry is very important to farmers and ranchers, but it is also a very different industry from other industries, such as meat production, dairy processing and meat processing. There are many other factors that contribute to this, too, including the fact that milk is more expensive than butter and butter. One of those factors is that cows produce more milk than other cows do, and that makes it more difficult for farmers to get milk. So, in order to avoid that, you need to have an automated cow, or at the very least, a cow that is not milk-based. You can't do that in a dairy industry without the help of a human being. How do you do this? The answer is simple: You make the cow. Then you put it into a milk carton and you milk it, then you feed it to your cow and it will be ready for you to eat. If you don't want to milk cows for a long time, make it easy for the cows to grow milk as well as for your milk to come out of their cow's milk bottle. What's more, if you have the right cow you can make your own milk? That is what the market is all about, right? And you're not going to waste any more money on milk because you've already made enough milk! And then there's the problem of milk,\" says one expert. Another expert, who has worked in dairy farming for more than 30 years. \"You can do the same thing with milk.\" The expert says milk can be made from milk but milk cannot be milked, so milk should not be used. However, milk must be frozen. Milk can also be stored in refrigerators and refrigerated to prevent milk mold from becoming moldy and mouldy. When milk becomes moldable, cows need milk - and milk has to go through the process of molding milk into milk that can then be fed to cows - then milk will become mold-free. With milk being the key ingredient, these cows will have a hard time growing milk again, because milk won't be available for long. Food is an important component of any dairy product. A milk cow is one of them, after all. We've seen milk produced by milk companies in many countries, especially milk products, for centuries. I think milk was the most important factor in our milk supply chain, before milk came into the world. milk supplies are the main reason milk became a staple of our diet and we've had milk made by dairy farmers for decades. Our milk comes from cows too - milk alone - so we can eat milk without milk at home and then we have milk which has a shelf life of about a year and a half. All milk needs a good milk source and water is needed to keep milk fresh. Even milk makes milk available to people who are milk intolerant and lactose intolerably high - or even milkless - which can cause mold and mold to mold mold. These milk substitutes are very expensive and expensive. They are also very difficult to buy, therefore, to raise milk quickly and efficiently. As a result, we need a strong milk substitute. Why is milk so expensive? Why does milk be so cheap? Because milk costs so much money? Milk is another important ingredient that will help you grow and feed cows more quickly than milk if milk prices are going up, says the expert who is in charge of dairy production. After all, milking cows have been a major source of protein for over a century. Since the 1970s milk ration was rationed out to us. Money is scarce and there are only a few milk shortages in Ireland and abroad. Molded milk powder is now available in most milk stores. Only milk milk equals milk with butter - but we're still very poor. Diet milk formula is too expensive to drinkable milk"

The ruling primarily affects Germany's Turkish minority. The European Union's highest court on Thursday ruled in favor of a Turkish citizen, who was denied a visa to live in Germany with her husband, because she was illiterate and therefore unable to demonstrate basic German-language skills. According to the court, a lack of language skills shouldn't automatically lead to the rejection of an entry visa application. Instead, Germany must consider the unique circumstances of each individual case. The court went on to say that quickly granting visas for spouses improves the quality of life and promotes the integration of foreign residents. Specifically addressing the case of the Turkish plaintiff, the court ruled that the rejection of her visa had violated a bilateral treaty between Turkey and the EU. In 1970, Brussels and Ankara agreed not to tighten their residency laws for each other's citizens. Law only applies to some In 2007, Germany introduced the requirement that spouses from certain non-EU countries must demonstrate a basic grasp of German before being granted a visa to live in Germany with their husbands or wives. Spouses affected by the law are required to obtain a basic language certificate from recognized centers, such as Germany's Goethe Institute, proving that they have an A1 level, or \"Beginning German\" language ability. The German government claims that the goal of the language requirement is to prevent forced marriages as well as marriages made simply for the sake of obtaining a visa. Citizens of European Free Trade Association (EFTA) member states are exempt from the language requirement. That includes Iceland, Lichtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. In addition, citizens of Australia, Canada, Israel, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea and the United States also don't have to demonstrate German-language skills. slk/xx (AFP, AP, dpa, KNA)",
        "generated_story": "European Court of Justice overturns law requiring language skills for spouses in Germany A European court of justice has overturned a German law that requires spouses to learn German. The court ruled that the law violated the rights of spouses and their children. A German court on Thursday overturned the European Union's ban on the use of German as a second language, overturning a lower court's ruling in a case that had been brought by the Goethe Institute in the Netherlands. According to the court, the new law, which was passed in 2006, was designed to protect spouses' rights to speak German, French, German and other languages. It was the first time that Germany had a legal obligation to teach German to their spouses, and the second was in 2007, when it passed a law to make it easier for married couples to communicate with one another. In the case of the German-born couple, who were married for more than a year, they were required to sign a document that said they would not be able to use German in their marriage. They were not allowed to do so because they did not have German citizenship. \"The law is not binding on spouses,\" the judge said, adding that \"there is no legal basis for this law.\" The decision came after a court in Brussels ruled in favor of Germany's divorce law against the spouses of a Turkish couple who had married in 2005. German courts have also ruled against a similar law in other European countries, with the exception of Belgium, where it is still illegal to have a spouse who has not been married to an EU member state for at least a decade. Germany, however, is the only European country that has allowed a divorce to take place, according to court documents. This is a first for the EU, as it has been for many years, but it was not until the 1990s that it became clear that German spouses could not use the language they had already learned in school. That is, until recently, before Germany became a member of NATO. Since then, there have been a number of cases in which spouses have had to register as citizens of another EU country, such as the United States, Canada, France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece and Spain. These cases have led to a series of court cases, including one involving the creation of new German language courses. One of those cases involved a marriage between a married woman and her Turkish husband, for example. Both of these cases were brought before a judge in Strasbourg in 2003, after which the marriage law was struck down by an appeals court. There were also several other cases where the courts had upheld the ban, saying it violated European law. However, in one case, a woman's right to marry her husband's language rights were violated, because she had not registered as an American citizen. Another case was brought against Germany in 2004, over the age of 18, by a man who was married with two children and had no children in his home country. At the time, Germany was one of only two countries in Europe that allowed marriage to be legally recognized as legal tender for children, while the other was a separate country with a different legal status. Now, that law has come into force in many countries and is being challenged in several European courts across the world. For example, one court has upheld a European Court's decision to allow the divorce of one spouse and one child to live together in an apartment in Berlin. But it's not clear whether this will be the last time the couple will have the opportunity to get married, or whether it will happen again. If so, it could be a very long time before they have children of their own. And that's a good thing, given the fact that they are legally married and that is something that can only be done legally. I think this is an important step forward for Germany. As a matter of fact, I don't think there is any doubt that this case is going to change at all. After all, we are not legally bound by this court decision. We are a nation of immigrants, so we have to respect our own laws and our laws. So, let's get on with our lives. Let's start with this one. What do you think? What are your thoughts on this? Do you agree with me? Tell me your views? Let me know in your comments below. Read more: \"What is your view on divorce? Is it something you want to talk about?\" The EU has a lot to say about divorce. You can read more about this issue here. Here's what you need to know: What you should do if you are divorced from your spouse. Why is divorce legal? Why are you divorced? How can you be married? And why is it so difficult to divorce from a partner? I'm not sure that you can't get divorced in this country? It's very important to me that I am not married at the end of my life. How do I feel about my marriage? That's the most important thing to you, right? You know what I want me."

The opposition Law and Justice party failed in its bid to oust Prime Minister Donald Tusk on Friday through a vote confidence, the second such vote since the publication of private conversations between high-ranking officials, referred to by some in Poland as \"Waitergate.\" Tusk withstood the opposition challenge by a wide margin of 236-155. The prime minister's Civic Platform party governs Poland in a center-right coalition with the Polish People's party. Last month, recordings of a private conversation between Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski and then-Finance Minister Jacek Rostowski were published by the weekly magazine Wprost. During the conversation, Sikorski said the US-Polish alliance was \"worthless\" and British Prime Minister David Cameron's concessions to euroskeptics had shown his \"incompetence in EU affairs.\" Prior to the leak of the Sikorski recording, Wprost also published a tape in which central bank chief Marek Belka told Interior Minister Bartlomiej Sienkiewicz that he would only support the government's economic policy if Finance Minister Rostowski left his post. The secret recordings were reportedly made over several months, including at high end restaurants in Warsaw. Wprost says it received the tapes from a businessman.

        "generated_story": "Poland's center-right opposition to Donald Tusk resigns over tape scandal Polish Prime Minister J\u00f3zsef Demirjes has resigned over a scandal involving a former Polish prime minister. The resignation comes as the country's president, who had been in office for more than a year, faces a difficult time in his first term as president of the European Union (EU) after he was forced to step down by the bloc's governing coalition government in the face of allegations of corruption. Poland's opposition leader, Radoslaw Sikorski, has said he would resign if he were to be forced out of office. \"I am not going to resign,\" he said in a televised address to parliament on Wednesday. He also said that he had no intention of resigning, adding that his resignation would be a \"positive step\" for Poland and the EU. His resignation came after a series of scandals over the past year in which he and his deputy, Jacek Rostowski, were accused of leaking classified information to the media. According to Polish media, the scandal was the result of a lack of cooperation between the two main opposition parties, which were unable to reach an agreement on the terms of their cooperation. In addition, a number of other Polish politicians have also resigned from their posts, including the head of state of Poland, as well as several ministers of justice, justice and foreign affairs. A spokesman for the Polish People's party, Wprost, said it was \"deeply disappointed\" to hear that the president had not been able to meet with the opposition's chief of staff, Jochen Rauch, in order to discuss the matter further. It was not immediately clear whether the resignation was due to political pressure or the fact that it had come from within the ruling coalition. But it is clear that there is a strong desire for a change of government, and that this is not the first time that such a move has been made. On Wednesday, Polish President-elect Jokowi announced his intention to seek a second term, but he did not rule out the possibility that a third term would not be possible. At the same time, he called for an end to a long period of political instability in Poland that had left him with little time to think about the future of his country. As a result, his government will have to find a new way to deal with this crisis, according to his spokesman, R. J. Poloz. (AP, AFP, dpa, Reuters) He said the government would look into the allegations, saying it would take \"appropriate steps to resolve the situation.\" \"We will continue to do our utmost to make sure that we do not allow this to happen again. We will do everything in our power to prevent this from happening again,\" the spokesman said, referring to an ongoing political crisis that has gripped Poland for several years. Raul Rubins, Poland\u2019s president-designate, told the BBC in an interview published on Tuesday that \"we will not tolerate this kind of behavior from the current government.\" The BBC reported on Thursday that Rubens had called on Poland to take a step back from its current leadership, calling it \"a disgrace\" and \"an act of cowardice\" that could have led to its downfall. Rutte, however, denied any involvement in any wrongdoing and said there was no need for such an action. Polish lawmakers have said they were not aware of any such action and have been working on a plan to move forward with their own political agenda. They have not said whether they would do so. However, they have made clear they are not prepared to give up their position on this issue, despite repeated calls for their resignation. And they say that they will be doing everything they can to avoid it, even if it does not involve the use of force. There is no doubt that Poland is facing a serious crisis in its political future. That is the main reason for this, of course, because it has a lot of people who want to stay in power. Many of them are in opposition. Some of these people are from Poland. For example, there are many Poles who don't have a clear vision of what is going on in their country, such as in Britain and Germany. This is one of those countries where it's not possible to get involved in politics at all. Politicians have long been a part of Polish politics. Poles have always had a very strong sense of responsibility for what they do. Since the 1990s, Poles were the only ones who were willing to stand up for themselves and to speak out against the new government. Now, that is precisely the way they see it: They are the ones that are trying to change the course of history, rather than the other side of things. When it comes to politics, it will take some time before the next government is ready to act on its own initiative. I think that's the most important thing that can be done. So, I'm not sure what will happen in this country and I am very soon."

Most of the dead are civilians. On the Israeli side, 13 soldiers were killed inside Gaza on Sunday, raising the number of soldiers killed since a ground operation began late on Thursday to 18. Two Israeli civilians also died in mortar and rocket attacks. The Israeli army said that more than 10 militants from Gaza were shot dead on Monday after infiltrating southern Israel. According to army spokespeople, two squads of militants were killed after tunneling into Israel. Israel's UN ambassador Ron Prosor, meanwhile, denied a claim by Hamas that an Israeli soldier had been kidnapped by the Islamist group, saying: \"Those rumurs are untrue.\" US President Barack Obama expressed concern about the rising death toll of civilians in a telephone call Sunday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, according to a White House statement.

Kerry, who is visiting Egypt for the first time since taking office in January, will meet Egyptian Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to discuss the possibility of a peace deal between the two countries. \"We are going to try to reach an agreement,\" Kerry said at a news conference. He said he was looking forward to meeting with the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, and other top officials from both sides, as well as the UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres. Israel, which has been fighting for years to secure a cease-fire with Hamas, has called for an end to the conflict. Hamas has rejected the call, saying it is a \"terrorist organization\" and that it has no legitimate right to negotiate with Israel. Netanyahu, meanwhile, said it was \"not a terrorist organization.\" \"It is not a terror organization,\" he said, adding that he hoped the talks would lead to a truce between Hamas and the Israeli Defense Force (IDF). \"I think we will be able to find a way to achieve a deal that is acceptable to all parties,\" Netanyahu said in a televised address to his country's parliament on Monday. Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Rajiv Sinan said the government was ready to accept the ceasefire, but added that there was no need for it to be implemented immediately. In a statement, the foreign ministry also said that Israel would continue to cooperate with Egypt's military and security agencies in their efforts to ensure a fair and orderly exchange of power between Israelis and Palestinians.

Jenin added: \"There is no doubt that Egypt is willing to do whatever it takes to make this a reality. We are ready for this to happen. It is the right time for negotiations to begin,\" she said. Meanwhile, Israel is also looking for ways to improve relations between Egypt and Egypt, where the US and Israel have been at loggerheads for some time over the past two years. Iran has repeatedly accused Israel of violating the terms of its nuclear deal with North Korea, accusing it of using chemical weapons against its own people. But Israel has denied the accusations, claiming that Hamas is trying to undermine the deal. US President Barack Obama, in his first visit to Cairo since becoming president in 2009, called the negotiations \"a sham\" that has failed to produce a lasting peace agreement. On Monday, Kerry met with Palestinian leaders, including the head of state, Reuven Rivlin, at the State Department in Washington, D.C. in an apparent attempt to reassure them that they would not be forced to give up their nuclear weapons in exchange for their continued support.

Palestinians have repeatedly said they are not prepared to talk to Israel about the issue. They say they want a negotiated deal and have no intention of going ahead with it. That's not the case, they say, because they don't want to get involved in any way at all. And they have a lot of pressure from Hamas. This is just the latest example of how the situation in Gaza has turned out so far. Last week, Netanyahu announced a new round of sanctions against Hamas in response to Hamas' attempts to break up the truce. Palestinian officials have accused the Hamas-led government of being too lenient in its negotiations with Iran. A Palestinian spokesman said on Sunday that this was not an option for Hamas to enter the Gaza Strip, citing a lack of cooperation between Washington and Cairo. Haaretz reported that a Palestinian delegation had been invited to attend the meeting. An Israeli official told Reuters that \"it is impossible for them to come to any agreement on this issue at this time.

Lui said the world community needed to get the \"upper hand\" over the next six months. While the viral spread had been slowed in Guinea, concerns focused especially on Liberia. \"If we don't stabilize Liberia, we will never stabilize the region,\" Lui said. She was critical of the WHO for delaying its public health emergency warning until August 8. \"We need people with a hands-on operational mindset,\" to combat the outbreak, Liu told the Geneva news briefing. WHO - 'vastly underestimated' On Thursday, the World Health Organization (WHO) said the scale of the epidemic had been \"vastly underestimated\" and that \"extraordinary measures\" were needed to contain the contagious virus. The UN health agency said the death toll had climbed to 1,069 in four afflicted countries, spanning Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia and more recently Nigeria. Sierra Leone's chief medical officer Brima Kargbo disclosed on Thursday that at least 32 of the nation's nurses and doctors had died from the Ebola virus while performing their duties between May 24 and August 13. Local staff suffered stigma, despite saving lives, Kargbo said. \"We still have to break the chain of transmission to separate the infected from the uninfected.\" Youth Olympics also affected The mounting alarm coincided with an announcement Friday from the International Olympics Committee that three athletes from Ebola-hit countries had been barred from competing in pool events and combat sports at the Youth Olympics opening in China on Saturday. ipj/tj (AfP, Reuters)",

The WHO's response to the outbreak has been to warn that it will take years to contain the spread of the deadly virus, which has killed more than 1,000 people since it was first reported in January 2014. It is believed that the virus is spreading rapidly across the country and spreading to other parts of Africa, including the Middle East, Africa and Asia. According to Liu, the Ebola epidemic has spread from Guinea to Liberia and is now reaching the United States, Europe and Africa. She said the epidemic was spreading as fast as it could, adding that there was \"no way to prevent it from spreading.\" \"We are not going to be able to stop it,\" Liu said, referring to an outbreak that killed at least one person and injured dozens more. But she added that \"we have to do something about it, and we will do it quickly.\" The UN's Ebola response team is currently working on a response plan for the region, but it is not yet ready to make a final decision on how to respond to it. In the meantime, they are trying to find a solution that will allow them to reach the people who need them most. They have been unable to get to them because of a lack of resources, she said. At the same time, there is a growing concern that Ebola could spread to neighboring countries, such as Nigeria and Liberia, as well as the Philippines, where the disease is being spread through the porous porous border between the two countries. There is also concern about the possibility of contagion spreading from one country to another, according to a UN report. This is the first time the WHO has issued a report on the crisis, with the findings of an international team of experts, who have visited the affected countries in recent months to assess the situation. On Thursday, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he was not aware of any new information on Ebola and that he had not been briefed on what was going on. He also said that a number of other countries have reported similar outbreaks, though he did not know the exact number. UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said there were no new reports of new cases. However, he added, \"There is no indication that we have a new outbreak, nor is there an imminent outbreak. We are still waiting for an official response from the international community to come in.\" He said it would be difficult to predict what will happen, given the current outbreak and the fact that so many people are suffering from Ebola. That is why the UN is calling for a quick response, even if it's not immediately clear what the next steps will be. 'We need to take action immediately,' he said in a statement issued on Friday. A spokesman for UN human rights office said: \"This is an important step in our efforts to address this crisis. I am very concerned that this will not be the last time we see this kind of crisis in this country. If we do not act quickly, we won't have the resources we need, then we cannot be prepared for it to happen again.\" A UN expert on health, education and public health said this was the most pressing issue facing the world at the moment, noting that many countries are struggling to cope with a crisis of this magnitude. For example, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Japan, China and Japan have all had similar problems with Ebola outbreaks in their own countries since the 1990s. China, Russia, Iran and Iran have also had a similar problem. France has also responded by saying that they have not had enough information about Ebola, while the US has not responded to requests for more information. Meanwhile, in Switzerland, a group of international experts have called for urgent action to try to resolve the issue, calling on international organizations to step up their efforts. International organizations, however, have expressed concern over the humanitarian situation, saying they will continue to work to ensure that international efforts are being made to deal with this issue. Many of these organizations are already working with international partners to tackle this problem, particularly the World Health Organisation (WHO) and other international agencies. These organizations have already made a concerted effort to provide the necessary resources to fight this epidemic. World health officials, meanwhile, are also working closely with UN experts to develop a strategy for dealing with it and to reduce the risk of future outbreaks. WHO Secretary General Antonio Guterres has called on UN member states to act on their concerns, warning that if they don't act now, it may be a long time before they can do so. Experts say the global response is likely to become a major factor in reducing the level of public awareness of what is happening. And they say that more countries should do their part to help.

Conservative members of Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition put forward a united front at the weekend against recent developments in the city of Wuppertal. Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said civilians wearing uniforms bearing the logo \"Shariah police\" could not simply start patrolling German streets. The groups reportedly hovered around sites like discotheques and gambling houses, telling passers-by to refrain from gambling and alcohol. Wuppertal's police have begun pressing charges. \"Sharia law is not tolerated on German soil,\" de Maiziere told mass-circulation daily Bild on Saturday. \"Nobody can take it upon themselves to abuse the good name of the German police.\" Justice Minister Heiko Maas, meanwhile, told Bild that \"the state alone\" was responsible for the administration of justice in Germany. It was obvious, Maas said, that any illegal parallel system of law enforcement would not be tolerated. Christian Democrat party whip Volker Kauder was similarly emphatic in an interview to be published in this week's Welt am Sonntag newspaper. \"Under absolutely no circumstances can we tolerate self-styled 'Sharia police officers' patrolling our streets and dictating what people should or should not do,\" Kauder said. Ringleader: goal was attention The 33-year-old behind the Wuppertal patrols, former fireman Sven Lau, published a video on his website on Saturday. Lau said that a \"Sharia police\" never existed, and that a group of men had simply worn the mock uniforms for a few hours. \"We knew that this would raise attention,\" Lau said, claiming that his goal was to spark a debate about Sharia law in Germany. Lau is a leading member of Germany's Salafist movement, advocates of a strict Sunni interpretation of political Islam. He works with a mosque in his native M\u00f6nchengladbach, not far west of Wuppertal, and used to head the fundamentalist group \"Invitation to Paradise.\" (Einladung zum Paradies, in German.) The central council of Muslims in Germany (ZMD) condemned the activities. \"These few teen yobs do not speak in our name,\" chairman Ayman A. Mazyek told the Tagesspiegel am Sonntag newspaper. \"These people are perverting the name of our religion. With this shrill and foolish action, they are really hurting Muslims.\" Sharia law is the Arabic term for a legal system based on the Koran. Saudi Arabia and Iran are examples of countries where such a system officially applies. Wearing a veil is obligatory for women and corporal punishment such as stoning is legally tolerated. Human Rights Watch reported last month that Saudi Arabia had beheaded 19 people in just 16 days in August, for convictions on charges ranging from cannabis smuggling to \"sorcery.\" msh/rc (AFP, dpa, Reuters)",
        "generated_story": "\"We will not tolerate 'Sharia police' in Wuppertal,\" Thomas de Maiziere told Bild am Sonntag. \"We are not going to tolerate this kind of behavior,\" he said, adding that the police would not be tolerated in the city. He added that he was not aware of any form of \"Islamic terrorism\" in Germany, which he described as a \"sharia state.\" \"This is not the first time that we have seen this type of violence in our country. It's not even the last time we saw it. We have had to put up with it for a long time, and we will continue to do so until we get to the root of the problem. I am not a Muslim, nor am I a Christian.\" Heiko Maas, minister of justice for the German state of Bavaria, said she was \"very concerned\" about the situation in her state. She said that she had been told by the local police chief that there was no threat from the Islamic State (IS). \"I am very concerned about this situation,\" she said. Germany's Christian Democrat (CDU) leader Volker Kauder, a member of parliament for M\u00f6nchengladbach, has called for an end to \"Islamization of Germany.\" The CDU leader, who has been in power for more than a decade, also called on the government to step up its anti-Islamic stance. In the past, he had said he would be willing to cooperate with the authorities in order to prevent the spread of radical Islam. However, in recent years he has also been accused of being too lenient in his approach to Muslims, saying he did not want to be seen as \"a victim of a terrorist attack.\" On Sunday, the Christian Democratic party's candidate for chancellor, Christian D\u00c3\u0080\u0099s coalition partner, Angela Merkel, accused the Muslim community of tolerating the practice of sharia law. The Christian Democrats, however, have not been able to make such an argument. They have been fighting for years against the idea that Muslims should be allowed to practice their religion in their own homes. On Monday, they announced that they would no longer allow Muslims to enter their homes without a permit. According to a report in German daily Bild, this was the case for many years. Last week, German media reported that a number of Muslims had left the country to seek refuge in a refugee camp in southern Germany. Many of them had returned to their home country, where they were forced to leave their families. Some of their relatives had also fled to Germany to escape the violence, according to German newspaper Bild. But they had not returned, as they did in other parts of Europe and the Middle East. This is the second time in three years that Germany has seen a rise in Islamic extremism in its Muslim population. At the same time it has experienced a surge in attacks on its own people, particularly in northern Germany and in eastern Europe. Most of these attacks were carried out by Islamic extremists, such as Boko Haram and al-Shabaab. There were also reports that some Muslims were killed in clashes between police and security forces on Sunday night, when police were trying to arrest a man suspected of carrying out an attack on a group of people. Police said the attack was part of an attempt to protect Muslims from attacks by extremists. A spokesman for Merkel told the paper that \"the police are working hard to ensure the safety of all Muslims in this country.\" In a statement, she added: \"They are doing everything they can to keep the peace, but they are also doing their utmost to help the people of this region. That is a very important step for us.\" German police spokesman Sven Lau said police had responded to reports of attacks from Islamic radicals and other extremist groups on Saturday night and Sunday evening, \"The police have responded with a strong response to these reports.\" Police are still searching for suspects, including a suspected Islamic extremist who is believed to have killed at least one person in connection with an incident in which a police officer was shot and wounded. Authorities have said they have arrested several people who were involved in an altercation with police officers. Muslim extremists have also taken part in several attacks in western Germany since the beginning of last year. One of those attacks was reported by a local newspaper, The Sunday Times, on Monday. Reuters, citing unnamed police sources, cited a German security source as saying the attacker had fled the area after being shot by police. Another source said it was possible to identify the assailant and that it could be linked to an Islamic terrorist group, although it is unclear whether the suspect was a person of Islamic origin. Other media outlets have reported similar reports. German news agency Bild reported on Friday that police in Berlin were investigating the incident. AFP/AFP/File (Reuters, AP, dpa, Reuters) said there were no reports on Wednesday evening that an attacker was being held at the scene. Several people were arrested and charged with attempted murder and attempted to flee the town, while the man was also being tried to"

The money is to come from the Russian pensions system. Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov unveiled a plan Monday aimed at creating a \"multi-billion-dollar\" funding vehicle for companies hit by Western sanctions. Moscow-based news agency RIA quoted Siluanov as saying that the emergency fund would be set up next year with money originally earmarked for the State Pension Fund and leftover funds from this year's budget. According to RIA, Moscow was planning to devote \"at least 100 billion roubles\" (2 billion euros) to the fund, which will mainly be aimed at helping cash-starved Russian banks and key oil companies. \"These 100 billion roubles will be added to the reserve next year, which will allow us to help companies,\" RIA quoted Siluanov as saying. \"We are planning to create a reserve of significant size.\" Just last week, the European Union and the United States imposed a third round of sanctions on Moscow for Russia's involvement in the Ukraine conflict. The latest sanctions target the Russian banking sector as well as key energy firms and arms manufacturers. As one of several companies that have asked for government help, Russia's oil giant Rosneft said it would need 1.5 trillion roubles ($39.70 billion) in aid to keep exploring for oil. Siluanov also told RIA news agency that the decision to stop transferring money to the Pension Fund would hand the budget an extra 309 billion roubles. It will be the second year running that Moscow has stopped transfers of funds from the budget to the Pension Fund, which provides benefits for Russia's pensioners, some invalids and families who have lost their breadwinners. uhe/nz (Reuters, RIA)",
        "generated_story": "Russia to create multi-billion-dollar pension fund for companies hit by sanctions over Ukraine conflict Russia has announced plans to set up a multibillion dollar fund to help Russian state pension funds recover from sanctions imposed by the United States and European Union over the conflict in eastern Ukraine. The move comes as the Russian State Pension Fund (SPF) announced on Thursday that it would create a $1.5 billion fund in response to Russia's sanctions on its oil and gas companies. It was the first such move by a Russian government in more than a decade, according to the state news agency RIA, which reported on Friday that the fund would be created by Russian President Anton Siluanov. \"We are going to invest in companies that have been hit with sanctions, and we want to make sure that we are able to do that,\" the SFSF said in a statement. Rosneft, the world's second-largest oil producer, said it was also looking into the possibility of setting up an investment fund with the help of a private equity fund. But it did not specify which companies would receive the funds, it said, adding that such a fund was not expected to be established until at least the end of the year, when the sanctions were lifted. In addition, a separate fund is being created for state-owned Russian oil company Rostec and state oil giant Gazprom. Both companies face sanctions from the EU and the U.S. if they fail to comply with EU sanctions. Russia is also set to announce a new round of sanctions against Russian companies in the coming weeks, including the closure of its state gas plant in Crimea and a ban on the sale of Russian-made liquefied natural gas (LNG) in Russia. Moscow said on Wednesday it had decided not to impose the new sanctions because it believed they would hurt the country's economy. A spokesman for the Kremlin said the decision was based on a \"technical assessment\" and not on an official report. Russian authorities have said they were not aware of any new restrictions on oil exports, but that they had no reason to believe they could be used as a bargaining chip in an ongoing dispute between Moscow and Moscow over oil prices. On Thursday, Moscow announced that Russia had agreed to allow the companies to sell their assets in exchange for a loan of up to 10 billion rubles ($2.4 billion) to a state fund that would cover the cost of their operations. According to state media, this was a first step toward the creation of an independent fund, with a total of $2 billion in assets. However, there was no clear indication of how much Russia would pay for it, as it has not yet committed to doing so. Analysts say the move could have a negative impact on Russian economic growth, particularly in Europe, where sanctions are still being imposed on Russia and other EU member states such as Germany, France, Italy, Spain and Italy. Some analysts say it could hurt Russian exports to Europe as well as in Asia and China. Other analysts, however, doubt the plan is likely to have an impact in other parts of Europe. For example, some analysts have questioned whether it will be a good idea for Russia to open up its economy to foreign investors, while others think it is a bad idea to expand its military presence in Syria and Iraq. Others have suggested it might be too early to talk about the situation in Ukraine, saying it's too soon to know for sure, given the current political situation there is still a long way to go in terms of what is happening in that country. Meanwhile, other analysts and investors have warned that sanctions could make it difficult for Russian investors to get the best out of Russia, who are already suffering from a lack of confidence in Moscow's ability to act on their own. One analyst said that if sanctions remain in place, \"it will take a lot of time to clear the air,\" and that this could lead to an economic slowdown. Another analyst, Alexander Klimov, told Reuters that he was \"very optimistic\" that a deal would not be reached. He added: \"I don't think sanctions will hurt Russia at all. I think that's a very positive development for us. We are very optimistic that Putin will do the right thing in this regard, because we have already seen the results of this process. There is no doubt that there are many good things to come from it. That's not the only reason for this. You have to look at what's going on with Russia right now. This is not an isolated case, though. If you think about this, you are not alone. What's the real problem is that many people are worried about Russia being a country that doesn't have the resources to deal with this kind of situation. And that is the main reason why the economy is so weak. So far, so many companies have not been doing well. Many of them are doing very well, in fact, they are struggling to find a solution to their problems. They are the ones that are suffering the most from this point of course,\" he"

Speaking to reporters after a meeting with NATO military chiefs in Lithuania's capital Vilnius on Saturday, US General Philip Breedlove expressed \"sincere hope\" about a renewed peace plan, agreed to earlier in the day in the Belarusian capital Minsk, by separatists and representatives from Ukraine's and Russia's governments. The new pact, including an artillery buffer zone, was a move to strengthen a peace plan signed earlier this month, also in Minsk. However, Breedlove said violence levels in Ukraine in recent days were as high as prior to the earlier ceasefire. \"The ceasefire is still there in name, but what is happening on the ground is quite a different story,\" Breedlove said, adding that Russian forces were still operating in Ukraine, although he could not pinpoint how many. \"The fluidity of movement of Russian forces and Russian-backed forces back and forth across that border makes it almost impossible to understand the numbers,\" he said. A convoy from Russia consisting of about 170 trucks arrived in Ukraine on Saturday, with a reported cargo of humanitarian aid. Previous aid convoys sent from Russia were met with outrage in Kyiv, as it was suspected they may have been used to provide support to the pro-Moscow separatists in eastern Ukraine. Russia has repeatedly denied such accusations. The separatists have said they want to break from Kyiv and have already declared \"people's republics'\" in Donetsk and Luhansk.

He said the ceasefire was \"in the name of peace and stability\" and that it was not intended to be a \"one-way street\" between Moscow and Kiev.

But it could be extended for as long as two years, if not longer, because of a lack of political will. In the meantime, the US and its allies will continue to work together to ensure a peaceful transition of power between Ukraine and neighboring Russia. US Secretary of State John Kerry said in a statement that the truce was in \"the best interests of our country and our people,\" but added that \"we are not going to allow it to continue indefinitely.\" \"It is not an agreement that we are willing to accept,\" Kerry told reporters in Lithuania, adding that he would like to see a new round of talks with the government of Ukraine in Minsk, Belarus, as soon as possible. 'It's not something we want to do at this point in time,\" he added, referring to Ukraine's ongoing conflict with Russia over the annexation of Crimea from Ukraine by Moscow in 2014. Moscow has denied the allegations, saying it has no reason to believe that Russia is trying to undermine the peace process. Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly called on Ukraine to respect the terms of its ceasefire, but has refused to sign off on the deal. Russia has also said it would not accept a deal that would allow the return of Ukrainian troops to their home country of Donetsk, where they would be forced to leave the country if they were to return to Russia's borders. Putin, however, has rejected the idea that Ukraine should be allowed back into its own territory. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Putin said he had no plans to impose sanctions on Russia for the first time since he took office in Kiev in 2015. A spokesman for Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that Moscow had \"no intention\" of imposing sanctions against Moscow, \"but we have no intention of doing so at all.\" The Russian foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, said on Wednesday that his country was ready to cooperate with Moscow on its efforts to achieve a political solution for Ukraine. According to Reuters, Moscow's position was clear: \"Russia has not been able to agree to any kind of deal with Ukraine at the moment. There is no agreement on any terms. It is simply a matter of time until the situation is resolved. We have not yet reached a final agreement,\" Lavrov told the Reuters news agency, citing a source close to Putin's office. NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said earlier this month that NATO was prepared to take a hard line on Moscow if it did not take action to prevent a conflict between Kiev and Moscow. At the same time, NATO is also preparing to send a delegation to Moscow to discuss the issue. Nato Secretary-General Michael Fallon said NATO's new mission in Belarus is expected to visit the region next month, with a mission to meet with Putin in Brussels on Thursday, May 24. (Reuters, AP, AFP, dpa)NATO: NATO: US, EU, UK, Germany, France, Italy, Japan, China, Russia - NATO, Turkey and Iran - all signalled their readiness to join NATO - that they will cooperate in any way they can - and they are committed to working together on a common goal of achieving a peace agreement in Europe. They have agreed that this is the best way to accomplish that goal. This is a very important step forward for NATO and NATO. I think NATO has already made clear that their goal is to make sure that there will be no further escalation of tensions between NATO allies and their allies, including the European allies. For now, there is little chance of any sort of agreement. That is, of course, not a clear indication of what NATO will do. If the agreement is agreed to, we will have to wait until after the NATO summit in June, when NATO formally convenes in Washington, D.C. on June 24, 2017. Following the summit, a number of NATO envoys are due to convene at NATO headquarters in Moscow next week - the UN Security Council on Friday, June 23, 2018 - to prepare for any possible talks on March 24-25, 2019 - but it's unclear what that will take place."

It's as revolutionary as the Cuban revolution, and as peaceful as the biblical Sermon on the Mount, says DW's Astrid Prange. US President Barack Obama has lost his old communist \"enemy,\" and Cuban President Raul Castro has lost his hatred of capitalism. In the first phone call from president to president since 1961 the two heads of state came to a surprisingly swift agreement. They want to renew diplomatic relations, which have been on ice for more than 50 years, and exchange ambassadors. It's only a matter of time before the US lifts its trade embargo against Cuba. All the word \"embargo\" is really good for - at this stage - is as an ideological soapbox for political hardliners, especially Republicans in Congress who believe lifting sanctions would constitute defeat for the US. Yet the lifting of the embargo has already begun. In addition to medication, it has been possible since 2000 to export agricultural produce such as maize, cereal crops, and poultry to Cuba. Flirting with the rogue state Furthermore, 100,000 US citizens have travelled to Cuba since 2011 for cultural and scientific exchanges. Travel restrictions on Cubans living in exile in the US who wanted to visit their relatives on the island were also lifted. According to press reports, the two countries' military forces are even said to be cooperating, as are their coastguards, and military on the border of the US marine base in Guantanamo. Now Obama wants to officially open a \"new chapter\" in relations with the communist Caribbean island and remove Cuba from the US list of so-called \"rogue states\" that support terrorism. The travel ban on American tourists visiting the island will also largely be lifted. That's as far as things will go for the time being, as Obama would require a majority in Congress in Washington to lift the embargo entirely. But even if these are only small steps, the fall of the American-Cuban wall has begun. The easing of the sanctions and the resumption of diplomatic relations are setting the scene for an end to the embargo. Embargo as scapegoat The tearing down of this \"wall in the mind\" is long overdue. The blockade is obsolete, and has proved to be entirely ineffective. More than this, its advocates have achieved the opposite of what they actually wanted. The blockade has provided the leaders in Havana with an easy excuse for their economic failure. Raul Castro realized long ago that Cuba's economic problems can no longer be justified simply by citing the US embargo. It looks as though he was counting on the blockade being lifted: There is no other explanation for the completion of the Mariel container port in January this year. Cuba's biggest infrastructure project was, incidentally, financed by Brazil. The Brazilians also sent a declaration of love to Cuba. Raul Castro opened the door to them. He loves anyone who helps him - his friends even more than his enemies.",

He has denied the allegations, saying that he did not know the truth. \"I don't know what happened to the wall,\" he said in a statement released by the White House on Tuesday. The US president said he had no knowledge of what had happened at Guantanamo, but that it was \"very clear that there were no plans to do anything about it.\" \"We have no idea what was going on,\" said Obama, who was elected in 2008. Obama's first year in office was marked by a series of controversial statements from the Cuban president and his closest allies, including former US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, the former Cuban ambassador to Germany and the current Cuban foreign minister. In addition, Obama has said that Cuba is \"not going to be able to get away with this\" without the use of military force, and that \"it will be a very difficult time for the people of this country to recover their lost wealth.\" The United States has accused Cuba of trying to undermine its sovereignty by using military means. It has also accused the communist regime of using human rights abuses against its own people to try to gain political power. Cuba has repeatedly denied any involvement in any of these crimes. But it is not the first time that this has happened. During his first term as president in 2009, Castro's government was accused by many of its critics of being too lenient in its treatment of Cubans. Last year, a US court ruled that Castro had violated the terms of his release from prison and ordered him to return to Cuba in exchange for an amnesty. Castro, however, has refused to cooperate with the court's decision. On Tuesday, he announced he would not be returning to prison until the end of 2012. His office said it would continue to monitor the situation in Cuba, as well as in other parts of Latin America. Cuban officials have said they have not seen any evidence of any wrongdoing at all. They have also denied that the government had any knowledge about the crimes against humanity that have taken place there. This is the second time in as many years that a Cuban government has committed to ending the war on terror, which has led to hundreds of thousands of people being killed and thousands more being imprisoned, according to a report by DW's Astrid Prange, an independent researcher who has written on the subject. She said there was no evidence to support the claim, adding: \"There is no basis for this claim. There is nothing to suggest that we have done anything wrong. We are not doing anything to change that.\" Read more: Cuba: What is happening at Guant\u00e1namo Bay? What are the next steps for Cuba? \"The Cuban people will have to come to terms with what they are going through,\" she said.

US President Obama is expected to sign a bill to end the prison sentence for those who have committed crimes, such as torture, torture and murder. That bill would be signed into law by Congress on Wednesday. If the bill is passed, it will go through the House of Representatives, where it must be approved by both houses of Congress. And then the Senate will take up the issue of whether or not it should be included in that bill. For now, though, there is little chance of it being voted on. After all, this is a law that has already been passed in Congress, so there's no chance that Congress will pass it. (Reuters, AP, dpa, AFP, Reuters) \"It's not an act of war,\" Obama said at a news conference in Washington on Monday. Congress must pass legislation that would allow the release of prisoners from Guantanamo and other detention centers, \"but it's a fact of life for them to have a say in what happens in their lives.\" That's the point of all this, says the report's author, Anjem Choudhury, in an interview with DW.

It is subject to approval by top military officials, but there has so far been no indication that senior officers oppose the court martial. They were not available for comment afterwards. There was a similar case in Nigeria in September, when 12 soldiers were sentenced to death for mutiny after firing on their commanding officer in the northeast city of Maiduguri. The 7th Division, based in Maiduguri, leads the offensive but there are numerous reports of troops refusing to deploy. Soldiers have regularly complained that they lack weapons, food, and other basic supplies to fight the Islamists, who are reported to have tanks, rocket-propelled-grenade launchers, and other heavy weaponry. Boko Haram has taken a number of towns and declared an Islamic caliphate in the region near the border with Cameroon. The Nigerian military has in recent weeks claimed to have made progress in recapturing lost territory. Thousands of people have been killed since the Islamist uprising began five years ago. An estimated 1.3 million have been displaced, with tens of thousands seeking refuge in neighboring Cameroon, Chad, and Niger. rg/bk (AFP, AP, dpa)",
        "generated_story": "Court martial against Boko Haram Islamists in Borno A court martial has been declared in the northeastern Nigerian state of Maiduguri. A military court has declared a military crackdown against the sect, which has claimed to be fighting for the lives of hundreds of thousands of people. The military has said it will launch an operation to arrest the group's leader, Femi Falana, who is suspected of being a member of the terrorist group. \"We are going to fight back,\" the military said in a statement, adding that it would be \"a very difficult task\" to bring down the Islamist group and that the army would not be able to do so without the help of law and order. It is the first military operation in Nigeria since the end of World War I, when the Nigerian army took over the country's northeast in 1999. At the time, the government had been fighting the insurgents for more than a year, but the situation had deteriorated to the point where it was almost impossible to stop them from seizing the territory they had seized. On Wednesday, a court-martial was scheduled to take place, with a total of three months to go. In the meantime, police are still trying to gather information on the whereabouts of a number of suspected terrorists, including the suspected masterminds of last year's deadly attack on a school bus in northeastern Nigeria. Police said they were still searching for a suspect in connection with the attack. According to local media reports, at least three people have been arrested and are being held in police custody. There are also reports that some of those arrested have also been charged with attempted murder, while others are accused of attempting to kill police officers. Some of them have even been sentenced to life in prison, according to a report by the state news agency AFP. Many of these suspects are believed to have fled to Nigeria after being arrested by police in June. They have since been released on bail pending the outcome of their trial. Authorities said on Wednesday that they are looking into the circumstances surrounding the arrest of two suspects. One suspect, however, has pleaded not guilty to all charges and is being tried in absentia. Another suspect is also facing charges of kidnapping, torture and attempted rape. Both suspects have denied the charges, saying they have no knowledge of what happened to them, and the other has denied any involvement in their arrest. Meanwhile, several other suspects, meanwhile, are facing trial for their alleged involvement. Prosecutors have said the suspects may face up to 10 years in jail if convicted of murder and other charges. But the prosecution is expected to win a maximum sentence of life imprisonment and a fine of $100,000 for each count of first-degree murder. If convicted, they could face a life sentence. For now, it is unclear whether they will face the death penalty or be tried as a person of war crimes. However, if they do not face trial, there is a chance that their case could be brought before the court. This is not the only case in which a judge will decide whether or not to throw out the case. Last week, Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari announced that he would step down from his position as president of Nigeria's 7th Division. He also said he will not resign from the presidency if he does not get the chance to run for re-election in 2019. As for his role as military spokesman, he said: \"I will be stepping down as soon as I am able. I will continue to stand by my decision.\" The government has also promised to investigate the allegations against him and his family, as well as other members of his security forces, in an attempt to prevent any further attacks on innocent civilians. Filing a criminal case is one thing that has not been proven in court so far. Lawmakers have vowed to press on with their efforts to prosecute the perpetrators, even if it means the release of all those who have committed crimes against civilians, such as the kidnapping and torture of children, or even the murder of innocents. That is, of course, something that could lead to an acquittal of any kind. And that is exactly what is happening in this case, given the current political situation in North Africa. After all, this is just one of many cases that have taken place in recent years. So far, no one has come forward to challenge the president's decision to remove him from office. What is clear is that there are many people who are not willing to give up their positions in order to protect the people of northern Nigeria and their families. These are the ones who will have to face justice. You can read more about the latest developments here, here and here. Read more: What's next for Nigerians: How to get out of this mess?

It is a reflection of his current inauspicious Formula One campaign that World Champion Michael Schumacher is only featuring in reports on this weekend's German Grand Prix at Hockenheim dues to his nationality. The home grown champion equaled his own record of 11 wins in a season at last year's race but this year he will be hoping to just get on the podium at the end. Schumi lies in third place some 34 points off the top spot and has a lot to do if he is to record his 85th career win. Ferrari's poor season to date is unlikely to get better with hopes dwindling that the 36-year-old will add to his sole victory of the season although the seven-time world champion characteristically refuses to rule it out. Schumi and Ferrari still in the fight \"Contrary to many other people's opinions, we have in no means written ourselves off, even though we have to admit that the situation has worsened recently, rather than improved,\" said the German, referring to the problems with this season's car. \"But that doesn't mean that it can't be improved again, and that's exactly what we're working on.\" The limelight is falling on two young pretenders to Schumacher's throne as Sunday's race approaches. The battle between McLaren's flying Finn Kimi Raikkonen and championship leader Renault's speedy Spaniard Fernando Alonso is diverting eyes from the world record holding German on his own turf. Kimi aims to keep heat on leader Alonso Raikkonen must finish the German Grand Prix for the first time in five attempts to close the gap on Alonso if he is to keep his own championship hopes alive. The Finn retired from last year's race because of a rear wing failure and this season has been plagued by technical problems which most recently cost him 10 places on the starting grid in each of the last two rounds. Despite those penalties for engine failure, the 25-year-old managed to finish second and third but he will have to increase his total of three race wins if he is to make a significant impression on the 26-point chasm that separates him from Alonso. \"The battle for the championship is still on and I am determined to get a good result and work on closing the gap,\" said the Finn. \"The (car) has good speed and we need to make the most of it this weekend.\" Montoya doing McLaren team mate no favors Raikkonen's car is obviously a fast one this season but he's not the only driver in a McLaren hot seat. Colombia's Juan Pablo Montoya is not to going to make way for his team mate while his own hopes of the title, however small, remain alive. \"I am really looking forward to racing again this weekend in Germany,\" said Montoya, who won at Hockenheim for Williams two years ago and got his first victory for McLaren in Britain two weeks ago. \"I enjoy racing at Hockenheim, I have performed well here and won in the past and I am aiming for a strong result like at Silverstone.\" Consistent Ferdy the man to beat at Hockenheim Championship leader Alonso, meanwhile, has been impressively consistent for Renault so far this season, winning five times and failing to score points only at the Canadian Grand Prix, where he crashed, and in Indianapolis. The Spaniard is setting the pace and the standard this season so, problems aside, Alonso will again be the man to beat at Hockenheim.",
        "generated_story": "Finnish drivers Fernando Alonso and Kimi Raikkonen battle for the German Grand Prix in Hockenheim, Germany, on Sunday. The two-time Formula One world champion will face off in the final race of the season, with the Spaniard looking to take the title in his home country. Ferrari, Mercedes and McLaren are the defending champions, but they will have to settle for second place in their respective countries. Raikonen, who has won the last three races of his career, will be the first driver to reach the podium in Germany. He is the only driver from his country to have won three consecutive races in a row. \"It's a great feeling to be able to compete with Fernando,\" he said, adding that he was \"very happy\" with his team-mate's performance. But it's not enough to win the race, he added, as Ferrari's Juan Pablo Montoya, the world's most successful driver, was unable to do so at the end of Sunday's race. McLaren's Michael Schumacher, meanwhile, won his second race in as many years, finishing second to Ferrari driver Fernando Alvaro. Both drivers have been world champions since the 1990s, when they were only 19 years old. Last year, they finished second and third, respectively, behind Mercedes' Sergio Perez. In 2014, Ferrari took the second-place finish, and in 2015, it was Ferrari who took third place, ahead of Mercedes, McLaren, Williams and Ferrari. Since then, both teams have struggled to find a way to beat their rivals. This year's German GP, however, has been dominated by the likes of Ferrari and Mercedes. On Sunday, Alonso will take on Mercedes's Sebastian Vettel for a second time in four races, after finishing third in qualifying and fourth in Q3. Alonso is now in pole position for his first race since 2011, having won two races earlier this year in Mexico and Canada. His best finish was second in 2014. After the Mexican GP in Monza, Hamilton and Valtteri Bottas were the front-runners in both drivers' categories. Hamilton, Vincenzo Montezno and Nico Hulkenberg were second, third and sixth respectively. V-3 was the fastest race on the grid, while Alonso, fourth and fifth, had been third for McLaren. It was also the most difficult race for Ferrari in Formula 1, despite the fact that the two drivers had never raced in each other's cars before. That's why they are so close, even though they have never won a race together. They have a lot of respect for one another. And that's what makes them so special, because they both have so much to prove. At the same time, there's no doubt that they're the best drivers of their generation, which is why the sport is so important to them. For the rest of us, this is what we're all about. We want to make sure that we have the right drivers in our cars, so we don't let the other drivers get too complacent. I want them to know that I'm not going to give up on Fernando and Fernando. If Fernando can't do that, then I think he can do it for Fernando, too. Fernando is a very good driver and he's the one who can beat Fernando in races like this. When Fernando was a teenager, I was always a bit nervous about Fernando being in front of a crowd of people. Now, Fernando has become a driver who knows what he wants to achieve in life. What's more important is that Fernando doesn't know what to expect from Fernando? He knows he has to work hard to get to the next level. So he'll be working hard on getting to that level of success. You can see why Fernando needs to stay focused on his next race and not be afraid to try and do something different. Just ask Fernando about his future. There's always the question of what Fernando will do when he gets the chance to step into the cockpit and make his own decisions. Who knows, maybe he won't be as good as Fernando would have thought he would be? Fernando's career is over, of course, at least in terms of driving and the way he does it. However, that is not the case for him, especially when it comes to his drivers. As Fernando grew up, his father Fernando became a successful businessman and now he is an accomplished driver with a wealth of experience and knowledge of motorsport, a man who is also a world-class driver. With Fernando as his driving partner, you can be sure he will always be a winner of these races. Then you've got to learn how to drive a car that has the power to help him get there, right? And then you'll have Fernando to understand what's going on in this sport and how he feels about it all the time. No matter what happens, though, we'll see how Fernando gets there and what will he do next year. How can he be successful? But Fernando could Fernando"

        "target": "German Publishers Warm to Google Library Google is heading for a legal battle with American publishers over its plan to digitize books from five major libraries. But German publishers seem warm to the idea. Five major US publishers filed suit in San Francisco on Wednesday to block Google from scanning books without the permission of copyright holders. The project, already underway but stopped by Google in August, is the Silicon Valley company's bid to make the world's books searchable online. Five major libraries are already participating in the project and Google sent executive Jennifer Grant to the Frankfurt Book Fair on Wednesday to present the idea to European and German book publishers. This week Google introduced print.google.de, the German version of the search engine Google posted online this time last year. Google lets users type in a search term then scans its digitized library for the word or expression and produces a list of books where the term is mentioned. Users can then click on the results and a few pages of the text appear allowing users to read up online. The idea is to supplement Internet users with another source of material. In contrast to their American colleagues, German publishing houses have reacted well to the database. Some German publishers on board Google said that is discussing terms with all major German publishers. Langenscheidt, which publishes a large selection of dictionaries, said they had got on board. \"We are starting with 160 books,\" Hubert Haarmann, head of the electronic publishing division and the publisher, told the Financial Times Deutschland. \"We see it as an additional distribution possibility.\" An increased and more direct reach to the consumer is just one way Google is promoting its new project to skeptical publishers. The company also says that publishers will be able to monitor interest in titles through the search engine, and use the information in deciding whether to reprint certain books. Google has also promised publishers a cut of the advertising that will appear on the site. Not all German publishers are on board. In fact, the German association representing publishers has announced it will begin its own project where publishers can scan their own books, rather than let someone else do it. The project is not a competitor to Google, but will allow publishers to create their own database, rather than turn it over to the search engine. If Google can, anyone can But American publishers don't want to even take that step. They fear a slippery slope if Google is allowed to digitize copyrighted material. \"If Google can make \u2026 copies, then anyone can,\" Patricia Schroeder, president of the Association of American Publishers, said in a phone interview with Reuters. \"Anybody could go into a library and start making digital copies of anything.\" At issue is the right of authors and their publishers to their own work versus the \"fair use\" of their work by the public. Google argues that their search engine will only offer users a \"card catalog\" function, with a few pages of text. No one will be able to read the entire book online.",

Google has announced that it will be launching a book fair in Germany next month. \"We're going to be holding a conference on the topic of German language books,\" said Jennifer Grant, the head of the Hamburg-based German Language Association (ALA), which organizes the annual conference. In addition to promoting German books, Google also announced plans to host an event in San Francisco next week to promote German literature. Author Patricia Schroeder, who heads up the conference, said that the event would be held at the city's main library and would feature a number of new books by German authors, as well as a variety of short stories and short fiction.

        "target": "The Sun Sets Slowly Over Brandenburg's Tropical Dream Having suffered many disappointments concerning publically funded projects, the state of Brandenburg hoped a tropical leisure center would offer a ray of hope. Instead the ailing concern is just bringing more gloom. The economically depressed eastern German state of Brandenburg has seen its fair share of bitter experiences when it comes to huge public investment projects since German unification in 1990. Against this background, state authorities were pleased when Malaysian businessman Colin Au built a huge tropical-feeling leisure center in Brandenburg without any subsidies. The center, which opened about a year ago, was to become a symbol of economic success in a region where unemployment still hovers around the 20 percent mark. But the leisure time park, which has already swallowed a little under 100 million euros ($120 million) in private investment, is now going to have to depend on public funding to avoid another economic fiasco in Brandenburg. State authorities in Brandenburg haven't been too successful in their public investment policy in the past 10 years, to put it mildly. A grand plan to build one of the world's most modern chip-producing factories there burst like a bubble in 2003. The much-talked about Brandenburg-Berlin International airport still seems light years away from being built. Line of failures looked to be ended by Au's vision Another beacon of economic hope disappeared in 2002 when a company planning to build gas-filled transport airships went bust despite considerable subsidies. But Au's vision for the abandoned dome which the airship company needed as a hangar offered Brandenburg another chance. In the middle of nowhere, he created what he named his \"Tropical Islands\" wonderland, sporting everything from sandy beaches, lakes and a Laguna to a Caribbean-style village. The economics ministry in Brandenburg was over the moon to see Au originally agreeing to build the facility without any state subsidies. And Au himself had no doubt at the time that he could well do without them. Overestimated visitor numbers tell sorry story But the center's first year in operation tells a different story. Colin Au, who has meanwhile left Brandenburg and transferred matters to a German management company, had expected some 1.5 million visitors to come to Tropical Islands within the first year, but only some 950,000 will have turned up by the end of 2005. It seems highly unlikely that visitor numbers will increase considerably in future, placing a question mark on the viability of the whole centre. But Brandenburg's economics ministry is certain that the park will be in the black as of 2008. To make the place more attractive, it has agreed to shell out 15 million euros in subsidies for yet another reconstruction and marketing effort. After all, the leisure time center has a workforce of about 500 and is thus the biggest employer in an otherwise depressed region marked by a high jobless rate. Tropical center down but not out...not yet \"We hope the money will help make the Tropical Islands resort better known throughout Europe according to the new marketing concept hammered out the management,\" ministry spokesman Steffen Kammrath said. \"This leisure time center is unique and has to be marketed as such. What you have there is a tropical and water world 12 months a year with a lot of attractive offers to spend a whale of a time there.\" Some commentators believe that state subsidies may prolong the center's life span, but will not be able to avoid its demise in the long run. But the idea of also making it more attractive for tourists from all over Europe seems unrealistic to them if the resort's management can't even get enough visitors from home to ensure a profitable operation.",
        "generated_story": "The Sun Sets Slowly Over Brandenburg's Tropical Islands Resort The sun sets slowly over the tropical islands resort in the southern German state of Malaya. The setting sun has set slowly, but the sun is setting slowly. It's the first day of summer in a long time, and the temperature is expected to rise gradually. In the early hours of the morning, temperatures are forecast to reach the mid-80s, with temperatures reaching the low 90s. There is a slight chance of a thunderstorm, which is unusual for a German resort. However, there is no sign of thunder or lightning. Instead, it's more like a lightening storm. \"It's a beautiful day,\" said Colin Au, the resort's director of tourism and tourism. He said he was \"very pleased\" with the weather, adding that it was a \"great day\" for the island. But he added that there was still a lot to be done to make it a better place to live and work, as well as to improve the quality of life for those who live there. For those of you who don't know, a tropical island resort is the best place for people to spend their summer vacation, especially if they have a job to do. And that's not the only thing that can be said about it. Tropical islands are also a popular destination for tourists, who come from all over Europe and Asia to visit the islands. They are located at the base of Tropical Island, just a few kilometers (miles) from the capital city of Berlin. On the other hand, they are situated on a small island off the coast of Malaysia, where there are a number of coral reefs and coral islands, according to the company's website. This is not a vacation destination, however, because the area is so remote and has no access to water. That's why the forecast is for temperatures to drop to around 30 degrees Celsius (38 degrees Fahrenheit) by the end of this week. At the same time as the Sun sets, people are waking up to a very different atmosphere. Some of them are sleeping on the beach, while others are awake at night. Many of these people have been sleeping in tents in their hotel rooms for several days at a time. These are the kind of people who are used to sleeping under the stars. You can't sleep under a tent, so you have to get up early and get to bed early. I'm not sure how long it will be before I wake up, or how much longer I'll be able to sleep. So, let's just say that we're going to have some fun. We'll see how the day progresses. After all, this is just the beginning of our vacation. Let's face it, we've all been there before, right? We've been here before and we'll all be there again. Just a couple of days ago, I was in Malaysia and I had the chance to see the sunrise. Now I've had to go back to my hotel room and sit down with my wife and my kids and have dinner with them. What I really want to say to them is that I hope they'll understand that this was not an isolated incident and that they will understand the importance of staying awake and eating well. As I write this, my mind is still racing with all the things that are going on around them, including the fact that the storm is coming. How can I get out of bed at this time of year? I think I have no idea. All I can think about is how I feel about this storm and how it is affecting my family, friends and myself. Is there a storm coming? Is it really that big of an event that is taking place? What will it be like for us? The storm has been brewing all day long? Well, that depends on who you are talking to and what you're talking about. If you've ever had a good day, you know what I mean. A storm like this can happen to you. One storm or two of storms can make you feel like that. Then you'll have the feeling that you won't have much time to recover from it and then you can get back out there and enjoy the rest of your day. (Reuters, AP, AFP, dpa, Reuters)The storm was caused by a strong wind and rain in Malaga, Malaysia's capital of Kamsrath's hometown of Kaliningrad. Malawi is located in southern Malacca, about 80 miles (130 km) north of where I live. When I first arrived there in 2009, Malawian Prime Minister Stefan L\u00f6w (pictured) and his wife, Maria, were planning to travel to Malang and their two children. Since then, things have not been as bad as I thought? It seems like it would be, at least for now. My wife has already decided to stay here. She's planning on staying here for about a week, she's already planning a trip to Kalang. Hopefully, everything will calm down a little bit more than I"

Schalke might struggle to retain 22-year-old midfielder Max Meyer when his contract runs out at the end of the season, at least according to recent media interviews from the club's sporting director, Christian Heidel. Speaking to German news agency dpa, Heidel confirmed that Meyer turned down an offer of a contract extension earlier in February. \"Max Meyer's agent received an extension offer on January 12 with a deadline of February 15, and informed us on February 15 via email that Max would not be accepting the offer because of the deadline imposed,\" Heidel told dpa. \"We have acknowledged this. For now, we no longer feel beholden to the terms of that offer, but that doesn't mean an extension is impossible either.\" Meyer was reportedly offered an annual salary in the region of \u20ac5.5 million ($6.7 million); it was the second contract he refused, following a less lucrative offer at the end of last season. Read more: Leon Goretzka to join Bayern Munich in the summer 'We're still ready to talk' Under new coach Domenico Tedesco, Meyer has reclaimed a regular spot in the Schalke XI, moving to a new and more defensive role in midfield. Schalke offered improved terms in light of this development on the pitch. Heidel said this week that the club was still trying to convince the German to stay. \"At the moment we're still ready to talk,\" Heidel told this week's edition of football magazine Kicker, albeit stressing that time was of the essence. \"But we must and we will plan for the new season.\" In a separate newspaper interview Heidel was even more explicit, saying the club was not in a position to wait until summer for Meyer to make up his mind. Speaking to Sport Bild magazine, meanwhile, Heidel sought to focus on Meyer's more important role at Schalke, his regular game time, arguing it might be in the youngster's best interests to stay at a club that needs him every week. \"[Coach] Domenico Tedesco has formed the team around him in such a way that there is now an ideal spot for Max. That was not always the case,\" Heidel said. \"He needs to ask himself, putting the financial aspect to one side: 'Will I get such a position at a different club?' Because one thing's clear: Max wants to play, and he needs to play.\" Schalke are already preparing for the departure of one of German football's brightest young stars, midfield all-rounder Leon Goretzka will join Bayern Munich on a free transfer at the season's end.

        "generated_story": "Schalke XI coach Christian Heidel: \"We're still ready to talk\" about the future of midfielder Max Meyer, who has been linked with a move to Bayern Munich for the past two seasons. \"It's still too early to make a decision,\" he told dpa, adding that he was \"still ready\" to discuss his future with the club. The German side are still waiting for a deal to be agreed on, he added, but they have not yet reached an agreement on the terms of a contract extension. They are waiting to see what happens in the coming weeks, and if they are able to agree on a new deal, then they will have a chance to do so. In the meantime, they'll have to wait until the end of the season to decide whether or not they want to sign a player like Meyer. If they do, it will be a long time before they can talk about their future, because they don't have much time to think about it. At the same time, there's a lot of uncertainty about what will happen next. There's also the possibility of an extension to the current contract, which is due to expire next year. It's not clear how long the deal will last, however, as the German club have been in talks with Bayern over a possible extension of their contract. Meyer has already said he would like to stay at the top of his game. But he also wants to keep the focus on his own future. After all, the Bundesliga's top scorer is only 21 years old and he's only 23 years of age. He's the youngest player to reach the age of 21. His father, Christian, was born in Germany and his mother is from Germany, so it's unlikely he'll be around for much longer than that. As a result, his father is the only one who knows what his son is capable of doing in his younger years. On the other hand, when he turned up at Bayern's training camp in Munich, Meyer was the first to speak to him, saying he wanted to play for his country and not for Bayern. However, after a few months of speculation he has decided to go ahead with his plans for next season. According to German sports daily Sport Bild, \"Heidel is still open to talking to other clubs about a future for him. We have already had discussions with other players, including a number of players who have expressed interest in joining the team. I'm sure he will tell me what he thinks about that, too.\" \"I'm not going to give up on him,\" Meyer said, referring to Goretzka's chances of making the next step in a bid to become a top-flight player. For now, that's all I can think of, at least for now. That's what I've been told, though, is that there is no chance of him making an immediate move. Instead, I think we'll wait and see how the situation plays out. And that is what we're hoping for, if we can get the best out of this situation. So far, we've had a very good start to this year's Bundesliga season so far. You can see that we are very happy with how things have turned out for both of our young players and the way things are going for them. This season we have had some good results, especially in our first two Bundesliga seasons, with many of them coming to an end. Last year we won the Champions League and then we lost the Europa League. Now we just have one more Bundesliga title to look forward to in 2018. What do you think? What are the chances that this season will bring? The Bundesliga is a great opportunity for us? We've got to find out, of course, what can we do to improve our chances? You know what's coming, right now? If you're not happy about this, let's talk to your agent and ask him to tell you what you can do. Let's see if he can help us. Then let us know if you have any advice for you, or if there are any other teams who are interested in playing in Europe. (Reuters) (AFP, AP, Reuters) Bundesliga: Sven-Heinz Rummenigge/dpa/jk (AP, AFP, Dpa)Bayern Munich: Bayern have won three Bundesliga titles in three years, while Bayern, Bayern and Dortmund have two more to come. Bayern are unbeaten in their last four Bundesliga campaigns and are in third place in all competitions. Germany is also in fourth place, behind only Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid in second place and Bayern in fifth place. With a win over Borussia Monchengladbach on Sunday, Germany has two games in hand and a draw with Real Bernabeu on Saturday, in which we will win the title again?

A high-ranking Vatican diplomat will face trial in the Holy See on charges of possessing child pornography in the US and Canada. Catholic priest Carlo Alberto Capella was indicted on Saturday after a Vatican investigation found he had allegedly possessed and exchanged \"a large quantity\" of child pornography during his diplomatic posting. His trial will start on June 22 in front of a Vatican magistrate. If convicted, he could be sentenced to between one and five years in prison and fined between \u20ac2,500 and \u20ac50,000 ($2,100 to $42,000). He is being held in the city's police barracks.

The church rejected the request and withdrew him in September to face investigation at home. Shortly afterwards, Canadian authorities issued an arrest warrant for allegedly possessing and distributing child pornography while visiting a church in Canada. The Capella case has hampered the Catholic Church's attempts to move on from its myriad of pedophile priest scandals. There has been particular focus in recent months on the Chilean branch of the Catholic Church ignoring and covering up of child abuse by pedophile priest Fernando Karadima during the 1980s and 1990s. Pope Francis wrote a letter to Chileans last week expressing \"shame\" for the affair despite previously defending one of the main alleged offenders behind the cover-up. The Vatican's third-highest ranking official, Cardinal George Pell, is facing trial in Australia on abuse-related charges. aw/kms (AFP, Reuters, dpa)",
        "generated_story": "Catholic priest to face Vatican probe for distributing child pornography Catholic priest Carlo Alberto Capella will face a Vatican investigation after he was arrested in Chile on charges of possessing child porn. Pope Francis has ordered the Vatican to investigate allegations that he sexually abused minors. Vatican spokesman George Pell said in a statement on Friday that the church was \"deeply troubled\" by the allegations. \"The Vatican is deeply troubled by these allegations,\" Pell told reporters in Washington, D.C. The Vatican has opened an investigation into the priest's alleged involvement in the sexual abuse of minors by priests and other minors, according to the Associated Press. Pell, who is investigating the case, said he had been informed of the charges by Vatican investigators. He also said the investigation would focus on allegations of child abuse, which he said amounted to a \"serious offense.\" The pope has also called for the prosecution of a Chilean priest accused of sexually abusing minors under the guise of protecting minors and abusing them. In an interview with the AP, Francis said: \"We are very concerned about the conduct of this priest. We are deeply concerned for his conduct, and we want to make sure that we are doing everything we can to prevent this from happening again,\" Francis added. Francis called on Chileans to come forward with information on the alleged abuse and exploitation of children. It is not clear if the accusations are true, but the Catholic Church has said that it will cooperate fully with any investigation. For the first time since the scandal broke last year, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (CPS) said it would cooperate with an inquiry into allegations made by its archdiocesan archbishop, Archbishop Fernando Karadima, that \"the church is a very good place for children to grow up,\" and that they should be allowed to have their own children, as long as they do not have to live in squalid conditions. According to Francis, \"we are not going to allow this to happen again.\" Francis is also expected to press charges against the former priest and his wife, Agnes, in relation to his alleged role in spreading child sex abuse. As part of Francis' papal visit to Chile last week, he will be in Rome to meet with bishops and laypeople from around the world to discuss the issue of sex trafficking and child sexual exploitation. His visit comes as Francis prepares to visit Chile's capital, Santiago, on Sunday, where he is due to receive a state visit from Pope Benedict XVI. At the time of his visit the pope was visiting the capital in Santiago on Monday, Pope John Paul II and the Chilean president, Cardinal Jose Manuel Fern\u00e1ndez, both of whom are from the Roman Catholic Diocese of Santiago. Both Francis and Francis have said they will attend the visit. They have been visiting Chile for several weeks, with Francis saying they are looking forward to seeing the country's new pope. But they have not yet been able to reach out to him because they don't know what the Pope has to say about it. Instead, they say they want him to tell them what to expect from him. This is the latest development in an ongoing investigation that has been going on for a long time. Last week Francis announced that Francis would be meeting with Chilean bishops to talk to them about how to deal with this issue. On Monday Francis will also hold a press conference with them at the end of November, at which the pontiff's office will present Francis with a letter from Francis calling on them to cooperate in their efforts to resolve the situation. There is no doubt that this is an important step for Francis to take in order to improve relations between Chile and Chile. However, there is still much to do before Francis can make a final decision on whether or not to go ahead with his trip. And Francis himself has already made clear his intention to travel to Rome, Rome and Rome. That is, of course, before he leaves for Rome in December, when Francis visits Chile next year to attend a summit of world leaders in his capacity as pontifical leader. If Francis does not visit Santiago in January, it is likely Francis who will decide whether to send Francis a message of support for Chile, or if he wants to leave Chile as a host of other countries to follow through on his plans to build a better relationship with Chile in coming years. 'I am very interested in this matter,' Francis told Francis. I think Francis must be very clear on Francis's visit, however, because he has a lot of respect for them and I know that there are many people who would like to see him there, so I will not be surprised if Francis agrees with him on this subject, especially if it's something that will have a positive impact on Chilean society. After all, I am a Catholic, a Christian, an American and a Jesuit, after all. So I'm not sure what will Francis say to me. What do you think about this visit? I hope Francis says he'll do? \"I think I'll be a good pope, too,\" he added, adding: 'if I"

And the news was good -- most of the numbers were down compared to the preceding year. Germany's streets were never particularly dangerous, but according to the Interior Ministry, they are now safer than at any time since statistics have been collected. Reported criminal offenses on the whole dropped by 1.4 percent over 2005 -- to a total of just over 6.3 million. \"The statistics show reductions in crime among children, adolescents and teenagers, as well as adults,\" said Sch\u00e4uble. He added that criminality among foreigners living in Germany also fell, saying that this development reflected Germany's efforts to integrate non-Germans. Drugs offenses were down 7.8 percent, followed by theft and street crime, which both declined by four percent or more. Youth violence Vandalism, on the other hand, was up 5.9 percent. Fraud rose slightly, as did violent crime -- among young people by an alarming 4.5 percent. Berlin Interior Minister Erhart K\u00f6rting said that was part of a decade-long trend in Germany. \"As many experts have pointed out,\" K\u00f6rting said, \"the potential for violence in society is increasing.\" The head of the German Police Officers' Union Konrad Freiberg also said those figures showed that German society was not truly getting safer. Frankfurt tops most-dangerous list Crime was down in Frankfurt am Main, but it's still the German city with the greatest number of criminal offenses per 100,000 people. Hanover was a close second, followed by D\u00fcsseldorf, Bremen and Berlin. The total percentage of criminal cases solved by German police also improved slightly from 55 to 55.4 percent. According to the study, Germany's safest place was Bergisch Gladbach, a city of 100,000 inhabitants in the west of the country -- coincidentally, model Heidi Klum's home town.",
        "generated_story": "The State of Crime in Germany: The state of crime in the country has become a symbol of corruption and of the state's failure to tackle it. The government of Chancellor Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble has been accused of cracking down on organized crime. In a statement, the German Interior Ministry said it was \"deeply concerned\" by the rise of organised crime, which has led to a rise in murders and other crimes. \"We are deeply concerned about the level of criminality that has taken place in our country,\" the statement said. It also said that the government was committed to ending the practice of \"state-of-crime\" and that it would not tolerate the use of force against people who had committed crimes, such as the murder of a police officer and the attempted rape of an elderly woman. But it is not the first time that such crimes have been committed, and it will not be the last. Last year, police in Frankfurt am Main were arrested and charged with attempted murder. They were later released on bail, but the charges against them have not been brought to trial. Prosecutors have said they are still looking into the matter. German prosecutors have also opened a criminal investigation into a number of cases, including one in which a man was found to have committed a crime and was subsequently sentenced to life in prison for the crime of having committed an act of terrorism. This is the second time in three years that a German government has tried to prosecute a person who has committed acts of violence against others. At the time of his arrest, he said, \"I had no idea what was going on in my mind. I was shocked to learn that I had never heard of such a thing before.\" In the past, German politicians have accused each other of committing crimes in order to protect themselves and their families from the consequences of their actions. Now, however, it seems that they have a different view. For example, they accuse the police of using excessive force to arrest people they don't know. That's not true at all. There is no such thing as a'state of law' in this country. What is it, though, is that there is a system in place that allows people to commit crimes without fear of reprisal. And that is exactly what has happened to Germany's criminal justice system since the end of World War II, when the Berlin Wall was built on the foundations of Nazi Germany. As a result of this, many people are now calling for an end to the criminalization of crimes committed by those who do not have the means to carry out their crimes and who have no means of stopping them. These are the most serious crimes that Germany has ever committed in its history, according to German law enforcement officials. Some of these crimes are even more serious than those committed under the Nazi regime, as well as those that were committed during the Cold War. Many of them are committed against the people of Germany, for example the right to freedom of expression and freedom to live freely in a democratic society. However, there are also cases where people have to be held accountable for what they do in their own countries. One such case was the case in Berlin, where police officers were shot and killed by a gunman who was trying to break into an apartment building. Police in that city were called in to investigate the killing of two people, who were suspected of being involved in an attempted robbery. More than a dozen people were also injured in clashes between police and security forces on Friday, after which they were detained by police. According to police, more than 1,000 people had been arrested in connection with the shooting. Most of those arrested were taken into custody. Authorities have yet to provide details on how many more are expected to face charges and how they will be charged. Meanwhile, thousands of people in other countries have already been charged for their involvement in criminal offenses, with many still facing charges of murder and attempted murders, while others are being held in jail for life. On the other hand, some have even been released from prison. (Reuters, AP, AFP, Reuters, dpa) German Chancellor Angela Merkel has called for a special prosecutor to look into these cases. She has also called on German authorities to take action against those responsible for crimes against women and children. Germany is also calling on Germany to step up its anti-terror campaign against drug trafficking and human rights violations. Merkel's office has said she will take steps to make sure that this is an example of what is being done to prevent further attacks on women, children and minorities. Berlin's interior ministry has vowed to do its utmost to ensure that no one is caught up in such an investigation. A spokesman for Merkel told DW news agency that she has no plans to file a case against any suspects, adding that \"it is very difficult for them to go to court. We will continue to monitor the situation and we will do everything we can to find out what will happen to them,\" she said on Thursday. Chancellor Merkel said the investigation is still ongoing.

The Social Democrats (SPD) and Christian Democrats (CDU) have ruled the small northern city-state of Bremen in a coalition for the past 12 years. But after winning state elections on Sunday with 36.8 percent, the SPD is now flirting with the idea of ditching their previous coalition partners to rule together with the Greens, who made their best-ever showing in a German state poll with 16.4 percent. Bremen's state SPD leadership is to hold talks later on Wednesday with the CDU, which polled 25.7 percent. After an SPD meeting in Bremen, Mayor Jens B\u00f6hrnsen made the first signal he could be favoring the Greens. He said that during the campaign he had deliberately abstained from mentioning the possibility of a renewed CDU coalition because \"after 12 years it shouldn't automatically be continued.\" Bremen's acting head of government and CDU member Thomas R\u00f6wekamp, however, warned against an SPD-Green coalition. \"The majority of people don't want a red-green experiment, but a continuation of the grand coalition,\" he said. Both the SPD and CDU conceded heavy losses in the election, which showed a swing towards the Greens and the Left Party, which scored an unexpected 8.4 percent to win representation in a western German state legislature for the first time in its brief history. Block reforms? If Bremen's SPD decide in favor of the Greens, this would affect the ability of Chancellor Angela Merkel's grand coalition of CDU and SPD to push ahead with reforms requiring constitutional changes, such as stage two of Germany's urgently needed federalism reform. The federal Bundesrat, which is made up of state cabinet members, has to approve the majority of legislative bills passed by the lower chamber, the Bundestag, before they become law. Also, any proposed constitutional changes require two-thirds of all votes in order to be passed by the Bundesrat. The CDU and SPD currently hold 47 of the Bundesrat's 69 seats, which is one seat more than the necessary two-thirds majority. But without Bremen, the number held by the grand coalition would fall to 44 seats, meaning they would need the cooperation of one of the small opposition parties for any constitutional changes. Internal strife Earlier in the week, Chancellor Merkel called for unity within her ruling left-right coalition after the losses in Bremen set the stage for more infighting between the two parties. Merkel also warned the SPD against moving to the left after it lost some five percent points. The chancellor said the outcome showed the SPD had made a mistake by attacking the coalition and campaigning on promises of a minimum wage, which she believes will hamper efforts to fight unemployment of just under 10 percent. \"The result showed that this strategy did not pay off,\" Merkel told a press conference.",
        "generated_story": "German Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition of Social Democrats and CDU could block reforms in Bremen, the center-left state of Bavaria. The SPD and the Greens are expected to form a coalition government in the northern city, which is home to the largest Christian Democratic party (CDU) stronghold in Germany. Merkel has vowed to push through a series of reforms that would make it easier for her party to win a majority in parliament next year. But she has also warned that she may have to step down from her post as chancellor if she doesn't get the support of her conservative coalition partners. \"We are not going to allow this to happen,\" she said in an interview with the Bundestag newspaper. She added that the SPD would not be able to pass any of the reforms without the cooperation of other parties, such as the Christian Democrats, Greens and Greens. In addition, she added, \"we will not allow it to take place without a clear mandate from the government.\" The Social Democratic Party (SPD) has been in coalition talks for the past two years with Merkel, but has not yet reached an agreement on the details of how to implement the new reforms. On Monday, Merkel said she would seek to \"work with all the parties\" in order to get a deal done by the end of this year, adding that it would be a \"difficult task\" to reach a consensus on what to do. It is not clear how Merkel would respond, however, to such a move, as she had promised in her first speech to parliament in September, when she was sworn in as Chancellor of Germany for a two-year term. That was the first time that a chancellor had been sworn-in as a member of parliament, and it was only the second time since she took office in 2009. Her predecessor, Sigmar Gabriel, was also sworn into office on Friday, saying that he would continue to work with her. However, it is unclear whether she will stick to her previous position of being chancellor. If she does, her coalition will face a tough time in coming up with a plan to overhaul the country's tax code. For now, though, there is no way to know for sure whether it will be implemented in a way that is acceptable to all parties. There is a lot of uncertainty about the future of German tax policy, including the possibility of a new tax on income-earning individuals. And there are a number of things that could go wrong. One of them could be the introduction of tax breaks for people who don't have the means to pay for it, for example, if they do not have access to a car. This could lead to an increase in tax revenue, or even a reduction in their income tax. Another possibility is the creation of an additional tax break for those who do have a child, who would then be eligible to receive a tax credit for their child's education. A third option is tax-free child care, something which would allow them to avoid paying taxes, according to German media reports. Other options include tax increases, tax cuts and a higher minimum wage. These are the most likely options for parents and their children, while the other options are to opt out of paying for childcare, education, housing, childcare and other public services. Germany's economy is already suffering from a lack of growth, especially in rural areas, where many people are unable to afford to live and work. As a result, many families are struggling to make ends meet and many have been left with little or no income to support their families. Many of these families have had to leave their home country for several years. They are also facing a difficult time financially, since they have no means of getting a job, because they cannot afford a house. So, they are facing the prospect of having to move their family to Germany, a country that has a very difficult economic situation. At the same time, Germany is facing an economic crisis that will make them even more dependent on their own income. What's worse is that they will never have enough money to cover the costs of living in this country, even though they can't afford it. I think that's a big problem for them, given the fact that their kids are growing up in poverty and unemployment. (Reuters, AP, dpa, AFP, Reuters) The German Chancellor's office said on Monday that her government would consider the idea of raising the minimum income for all of their offspring, in addition to raising their incomes, is unlikely to be an option for many. Chancellor Merkel will also be forced to start a family, said the chancellor's spokesman, Hans-Joachim Wieseltier. He added: \"It's not a good idea for us to have children. We're not the only ones who are going through this kind of financial crisis. You know what I'm talking about, right? You can only have one child and then you can have your own child.

It is a one-crust pie, eaten in most German wine regions during the fall wine season. Zwiebelkuchen is traditionally eaten with Federweisser, a young wine available in Germany in the fall. The link between the two is so strong that many Federweisser wines have a recipe for the onion cake on their labels. Here's a recipe for it: Ingredients: 1 packet yeast, active dry 1 teaspoon sugar 1 1/2 teaspoon salt 3 cups unbleached flour 1 tablespoon shortening 1 cup water (49 to 54 C / 120 to 130 F) 6 slices bacon -- diced 2 medium onions -- sliced 1/4 teaspoon cumin 1/2 teaspoon salt Pepper 1 egg yolk 1 cup sour cream Mix the yeast with the sugar, a teaspoon of salt and half a cup of flour. Blend in the shortening and warm water, then beat for two minutes. Add enough flour to make a soft dough, and then knead the dough until smooth and elastic, about five minutes. Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, then cover it and let it rise in a warm place for 30 minutes. Pat the dough into a lightly greased 12-inch pizza pan or onto a lightly greased baking sheet. Press up the edges to make a slight rim. Fry the bacon until crisp and drain it on absorbent paper. Add onions to the bacon grease, and cook slowly until tender, but not brown. Sprinkle the onions, bacon, cumin, half a teaspoon of salt and pepper over the dough. Bake the cake at 204 C (400 F) for 20 minutes. Blend the egg yolk and sour cream and pour the mixture over the Zwiebelkuchen. Bake it for another 10 to 15 minutes, until the cake is golden brown and the sour cream has set.

I think we'll have to wait until autumn to try it out, because autumn is the time of year when the harvest is most important to us. That's why we're so excited about the fall harvest, when we have a lot of wine to choose from. This year, we've had a very good harvest. We've also had an excellent harvest of apples and cherries, and we had some excellent autumn fruit and vegetables. And then there was the wine that was so good that we decided to put it on our plates and eat it for dinner. Now that autumn has come to an end, I'm really looking forward to the autumn harvest and I can't wait to see what's in store for us this year. After all, fall is a time to enjoy the fruits of our labor and the fruit of God's labor, so we need to be careful what we eat and how we drink it. So, let's start with the apples, shall we? The apples are the best. They're also the most delicious fruit in autumn. What's more, they're the only fruit you can eat that's good for you and your family. If you're not careful, you won't want to eat the apple, or the grapefruit that you've grown up with. Or, if you are a vegetarian, then you might be tempted to take a bite out of that apple. Then again, what do you know about wine? You've probably never heard of apple pie before, right? Well, that would be a good thing, except that I've never had apples in my life. Especially when I was growing up in a small town in southern Germany, where I grew up and my parents were very poor and they didn't have much money to buy a car. As a child, my father was a farmer and he had to work hard to earn a decent wage to support his family and to pay for his education. He died of a heart attack when he was in his early thirties and his wife was pregnant with his first child. When he died, he left behind a wife and two young children. His wife, who is now a nurse, was also very sick. She died in childbirth. Her husband died when she was just a teenager. Their only child was born a few years ago. Since then, the couple have been married and have had three children and three grandchildren. All of their children are now grown and raised by their parents. One of them has a daughter, a son. My father is an alcoholic and a father of three. Both of his children have also been born in this country. These days, their father and mother are divorced and their mother is also a doctor. However, his father has always been a staunch Catholic and an atheist and has never been very religious and very devout Catholic. At the same time, this is not the case with my mother and father. God is very much a man who believes in God. Therefore, God has given me the opportunity to live a life of my own, even though I am not a Christian. Today I have no idea what I would do if I had the chance to become a Catholic or a Jew. (Reuters, AP, AFP, dpa, Reuters) \"God is good,\" he said, adding: \"I am so glad that God gave me this gift. Heaven is so much more than I could ever ask for, He is really good at what he does for me.\" He also said that he would like to continue his life as a priest and will continue to raise his own children, though he doesn't know how much he can do for himself. On the other hand, all of these things are very difficult for him to accomplish. Sometimes I wonder what God will do to me. How can I ever have the courage to give up my faith in Him? I do not know what He has done for my children's future. Why is it so difficult to believe that the Lord is going to allow me to have this kind of life in Heaven? God forbid I should have that He will be"

The prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, was set up at a US navy base by former President George W. Bush in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos has urged other European countries \"to do their utmost\" to take in former Guantanamo detainees as well.

US President Barack Obama has ordered the release of the five men, who are being held in a US military prison in Cuba. They have been released on bail and are expected to return to Spain in the coming days. Spain's first prisoner, Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba, was released from prison on Friday. He had been held there for more than a year. His release comes after US Secretary of State John Kerry said that he would be returning to the United States to see his family. \"We are very happy that we are finally going to be able to reunite with our families,\" Kerry told reporters at a news conference in Madrid. A US official said the prisoners were released after a three-day stay at the prison, which has been closed since the end of World War II. According to US officials, the detainees were sent back to their home country of Guantanamo, where they were held for three years. In addition to being released, they will be allowed to live with their families in their new home state of Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, for the rest of their lives. At the same time, US Vice President Al Gore and his wife, Brigadier General Miguel Angel Moratinos, are due to visit Spain later this month, according to a statement released by the White House. It was not immediately clear whether they would return home, but it is widely believed that they may have returned to Guantanamo after spending time in solitary confinement for several months. On Friday, President Obama announced his intention to release five more Guantanamo prisoners, including two women and three children, from their homes in southern Spain, and send them on their way to other countries. Obama also said he hoped to send more prisoners to Cuba as soon as possible. But he did not specify which countries would release the men. Instead, he said, \"I think we will have to wait until we have a chance to talk to them.\" The release is the latest development in an ongoing series of prisoner releases in which prisoners are released in exchange for their release from Guantanamo. More than 1,000 prisoners have also been transferred to different countries, with some of them being sent to camps in Morocco, Jordan, Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Lebanon, Iraq, Syria and Yemen. Many of these prisoners will receive medical treatment, while others will go on to serve their sentences in prison. There are also a number of other prisoners who have committed crimes, such as murder, torture, attempted murder and attempted rape. Some have even been sentenced to life imprisonment for life. One of those prisoners was convicted of killing a child. Another is accused of attempting to rape a pregnant woman. This is a case of mistaken identity and is being tried in absentia by a judge. Other detainees, however, have pleaded not guilty to charges of rape and other charges. Others have denied the charges, saying they are innocent victims of sexual assault and torture. Meanwhile, others have said they have no idea what the conditions of life are like in Guantanamo and that there are no conditions for release. For example, there is no legal basis for releasing a person who has committed a crime. That is not the case at all.

        "target": "Threat of the Punjabi Taliban is growing Deutsche Welle talks to Pakistani political expert Hasan Askari Rizvi about the growing ties between militants in northwest Pakistan and Punjab province. At least four gunmen disguised in police uniforms raided a hospital in Pakistan's eastern city of Lahore on Monday night, claiming at least five lives. Local officials said the gunmen were trying to free a militant, who was being treated there after being captured during attacks on two mosques last Friday. The police said the gunfight at Jinnah Hospital had lasted around 45 minutes but the gunmen had managed to flee. Friday's twin attacks on the minority Ahmadi community left more than 90 people dead. They were claimed by a group, which identified itself as the Punjabi wing of the Taliban. Deutsche Welle spoke to political expert Hasan Askari Rizvi in Lahore, where there has been a wave of violence in recent days. DW: Who are the \"Punjabi Taliban\"? It is a kind of a pejorative term, which includes a host of groups. Initially in Punjab, you had two types of militancy: One, the groups that focussed mainly on Indian-administered Kashmir and there were other types of groups that focussed on Pakistan. Those were the sectarian groups targeting mainly the Shias, and there were some Shia groups targeting the Sunni leadership. Over the years a lot of factions have broken away from these groups and these small entities are functioning more or less autonomously. They have trainings in the tribal areas because these are secured for them and certain parts are not under Pakistani control so these groups go there. They operate with the Pakistani Taliban based in tribal areas against the Pakistani troops in the region. They also have an autonomous agenda, which they pursue in Punjab, as they have been doing in the past days. These groups also play host or are a kind of a local link to Taliban suicide bombers who come into the main part of Pakistan from the tribal areas (let's say to Punjab). If they have to target some place, they park themselves with these Punjab groups, and then do it. All these factions and groups that have broken away from traditional militant groups and are functioning in close collaboration with tribal area Taliban are often described as the \"Punjabi Taliban\". Why do you think these militants are resurfacing now? They have always existed here and there and generally the trend is that they undertake a couple of operations, one after the other. Then the government comes in and takes action against them. Then they just disappear or become sleeping groups and suddenly after a couple of months they resurface. That's the standard pattern. The last major incident in Lahore was in the first week of March. Then there was nothing in April and now towards the end of May you have this kind of incident. Do you think the government should have taken stronger action against them? They should have but the problem is that the Punjab government has a kind of ambiguous approach and I think there is some element of denial within the leadership also. These groups also have some sympathy if not support at the societal level and that makes it difficult for the government to go against them openly. They need to work together and to emphasise to the people that they are terrorists. They use different names and Islam but actually their agenda is terrorism. Somehow the government of Punjab has been rather confused and ambiguous regarding these groups. Interview: Disha Uppal Editor: Anne Thomas",
        "generated_story": "Pakistan's Punjabi Taliban threat grows The threat of the Pakistani Taliban in northwest Pakistan is growing, according to the German newspaper Deutsche Welle. The country's most powerful militant group, the Pakistan Taliban, has been growing in recent years. Last year, it was reported that the Taliban were planning to attack Pakistan's Jinnah Hospital in Lahore, which is located in the northwestern province of Punjab. According to a report by the newspaper's editor-in-chief, Hasan Askari Rizvi, there was an increase in attacks on the hospital. \"The Taliban have been trying to establish a foothold in Pakistan for a long time,\" said Anne Thomas, editor in chief of German news agency DW, adding that \"the Taliban are not going to give up on their cause.\" \"They will continue to try to impose their will on Pakistan,\" Thomas said. In the past few months, Pakistan has seen a resurgence in Taliban attacks, with the death toll rising to more than 1,000, while the number of attacks has risen to at least 2,500. At the same time, Pakistani authorities have warned of a rise in militant attacks in northwestern Pakistan, where thousands of people are believed to be fighting for the right to self-determination. As a result, many of them have fled the country, leaving behind their families, friends, relatives and even their loved ones. This is not the first time that this has happened. Earlier this month, a Pakistani journalist, Disha Uppal, was killed in a Taliban attack in Punjab province. She was also injured in an attack on a police station. Since then, she has managed to escape to Pakistan and is now living in exile in India. Her husband, who is a doctor, is also a journalist. He has also been killed by a suicide bomber in Pakistani-administered Kashmir. Read more: Pakistan: What is the real threat to our country? The Taliban's threat is increasing, and it's not just Pakistan. It's India, too. They are also spreading their message to other countries, including the United States, China, India and the European Union (EU). The Pakistani government has said it will take action against the militants, but it is unlikely to do so until they are caught up in their fight against India's brutal crackdown on separatism and terrorism. India has accused Pakistan of being a \"hostile state\" and that it wants to take control of its own territory. Pakistan denies the allegations, saying it has no intention of doing anything to stop the attacks. But it also denies that India is behind the attack. Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has warned that Pakistan will not be able to protect its people from attacks by its armed forces. His government, however, does not rule out the possibility of using force against Pakistani militants. On Wednesday, he told DW: \"We will be doing everything we can to make sure that we do not become a hostile state. We will do everything in our power to prevent this from happening again.\" He also said that if the situation were to change, then Pakistan would have to step up its efforts to ensure that Pakistani security forces would be ready to fight back. However, this is far from the reality that is being portrayed by Pakistani media. There is no evidence of this happening at the moment. Instead, reports suggest that Indian intelligence agencies are working with Pakistani intelligence services to find out what is going on and how to deal with it. For example, one intelligence agency has published an intelligence report that shows that there is an \"urgent threat\" to India that could lead to an escalation of tensions between the two countries. That report, published in The New York Times on Tuesday, says the Indian government's spokesman, Anwar Gargash, said the government is \"very concerned\" about the growing threat from Pakistan to its citizens. And it says Pakistan should be prepared to cooperate with India in any way, even if it doesn't have the resources necessary to counter the threat. A spokesman for India said India would not comment on this report. Meanwhile, Indian Foreign Minister Rajiv Anand said, \"India is doing its utmost to help Pakistan in its quest to achieve its goal of eliminating terrorism and extremism. I think we have a very good chance of achieving that goal.\" The report is based on information gathered by DW and DW's editors and reporters. If the report was accurate, that would mean India could be the only country that has the capacity to provide information on what the perpetrators of terrorism are doing. An AFP reporter in Islamabad reported on Wednesday that said Pakistan was preparing to launch a counter-terrorism operation against Pakistan on Thursday. Afghanistan is currently in talks with Pakistan over the issue of human rights violations in Afghanistan, Afghanistan and Afghanistan. Afghan officials have said they have not yet received any intelligence reports. Taliban spokesman Abdulaziz al-Hussain, meanwhile, called for an investigation into the incident.

        "target": "Party leaders call for increased wages in growing German economy Chancellor Angela Merkel and other top officials have called for upticks in Germany's economy to trickle down to workers in the form of higher pay. But a leading think tank has warned against giving raises too soon. Germany's foreign minister and deputy chancellor, Guido Westerwelle, has added his support to comments made by Economics Minster Rainer Bruederle about increased wages for German workers. \"When the economy grows and this growth is substantial and sustainable, then the benefits of this upswing should be felt by the people who worked so hard for it,\" Westerwelle told the Hamburger Abendblatt newspaper in an interview. Westerwelle heads the free-market liberal FDP, which shares power with Chancellor Merkel's Christian coalition. Earlier this week, Bruederle, also an FDP member, said in light of Germany's currently growing economy, those economic gains should trickle down to employees in the form of higher wages. Merkel, who is also the head of the Christian Democratic Union, supported Bruederle's idea. \"That is something the chancellor sees the same way, letter for letter,\" said Merkel's spokesman, Steffen Seibert. Not so fast Earlier this week, analysts predicted growth of 3.5 percent this year and 2 percent in 2011. Germany's five leading economic think tanks also predicted that the number of unemployed would fall below 3 million next year, the lowest level since 1992. Despite the current rosy outlook for the German economy, not everyone is convinced that a growing economy should inevitably lead to higher wages. The president of the German Institute for Economic Research, Klaus Zimmermann, warned against reacting too quickly. \"I can't support the idea of a general wage increase, I think it is too dangerous,\" Zimmermann said in an interview with the Handelsblatt newspaper. Zimmermann wasn't opposed to the idea of raising wages, but said he was against across-the-board increases for all sectors and pointed out that not every industry is benefitting the same from the growing economy. \"We can't forget that the German economy did not resort to mass lay-offs when it wasn't going so well last year,\" Zimmermann said. Raising wages in some branches could be a good idea, Zimmermann said, as that would make those branches more attractive option to potential workers from outside of Germany.

        "generated_story": "German Chancellor Angela Merkel's Deputy Chancellor, Klaus Zimmermann, is against a general wage hike. The FDP deputy chancellor, Guido Westerwelle, has called for an increase in Germany's minimum wage. \"We are not going to be able to raise the wage,\" he told the German Institute for Economic Research (IER) in an interview published on Friday. He said that the government was \"not prepared\" for the increase, adding that it was too early to tell whether it would be necessary to increase wages. However, he added that \"we are prepared to do whatever it takes to get the job done.\" He also called on the Social Democrats (SPD) and the Greens (FDP) to work together to fight for higher wages for German workers. In a speech to the IER, the CDU's deputy general secretary for economic research and policy, Hans-Joachim von der Leyen, said: \"I am not prepared for this. I don't think we are ready for it.\" The SPD's co-leader, who has been in office since 2009, also said he was not ready to give up his position on wage increases. On Friday, she said she would not accept a wage increase of up to 1.5 percent, which would have been the equivalent of a 2 percent increase for all German households. But she also warned that a rise in minimum wages would make it impossible for people to earn enough to live comfortably in a country with a high unemployment rate and a low birth rate. This is not the first time that this has happened, but it is the second time in the past three years that Germany has had to pay a higher wage than the EU average of 2.7 percent. Last year, Germany was the only country in Europe that paid more than 1 percent of the national wage, according to a report by the Economic Policy Institute (EPI). The EPI's research director, Rainer Bruederle, told DW that if the economy were to grow at the same rate as the euro zone, it could be the case that people would find it difficult to make enough money to buy a house in order to have a decent living wage for themselves and their families. According to Brugel's report, \"The German economy is growing at a rapid pace, and we need to find a way to keep it that way.\" In addition, a number of German companies have announced that they will increase their profits by 10 percent over the next five years, up from 3 percent in 2011. Bregel said the EI's analysis showed that German firms were already making more money than they were making in 2012. It also found that many companies were not making enough in 2013 to cover the cost of living for their employees. For example, Volkswagen, for instance, was making less than 3.3 million euros ($3.4 million) a year. That's a huge increase from the previous year's average wage of 4.6 percent for a company that makes around $1,000 a month. And it's not just Volkswagen. Volkswagen is also making a big profit by raising its prices, as well as raising the price of its diesel and gas. VW has also made a profit on its own, while the US is making up for that by increasing its share of sales of diesel, gas and electricity. Mercedes-Benz and BMW have also been making big profits in recent years. BMW, however, have not made much progress on this front, despite the fact that Volkswagen has made more profits than it did in 2010, when it made $2.2 billion in its first year of operations. German carmakers are also investing in new models of cars, trucks and SUVs, BMW and Mercedes models, among other things. They are investing more in their own cars than ever before, in part because they want to expand their production capacity to meet the needs of their customers, rather than to invest in other sectors, such as manufacturing and transport. Meanwhile, Ford and Volkswagen have made up the majority of Volkswagen's sales. Ford has announced plans to start a new carmaker in 2017, with the aim of increasing their sales by 20 percent by 2020, after Volkswagen announced a $3 billion investment in 2015. Both Volkswagen and Ford have said they plan to sell their cars in 2018. What's next for Volkswagen? Volkswagen will also have to cut its sales tax by 25 percent from its current $4.8 billion, Deutsche Welle has said. If Volkswagen does not get a tax cut, VW will be forced to drop its tax bill by a third of that amount, even though they have already announced it will not be available to them. Wages are expected to go up by 5 percent this year and VW is due to hit a record low of $7.9 billion. Germany is a major market for new cars and trucks. There is no doubt about the future of car sales, though, that VW could make up a large part of VW's profits, especially if they are sold out of Germany. Even the restarts."

The Senegal international scored twice in the first half to help his side to their first win of the season. Germany's top-flight club has won three of their last four Bundesliga matches, including three in a row at home to FC Nuremberg. On Saturday, the German side beat the Norwegian side 3\u20130 at the Allianz Arena in Freiburg, with the goals coming from the penalty spot and a free kick from Mario Gomez. In the second half, German coach Franck Ribery's side were unable to find the back of his net, but they were able to capitalise on the opportunity. After the break, they had to settle for a 1-1 draw, and after that, it was back to business as usual for Bayern to take the lead. \"I'm very happy with this result,\" said Bayern coach Pep Guardiola, adding that he was pleased with his team-mates' performance. However, he added that \"we are not going to give up on this game.\" The German club's best player in recent years has been the midfielder, who has scored three goals in his last three Bundesliga games for his country. He has also been a key part of Bayern's recent resurgence, scoring three times in three games. But he also had a couple of assists in Saturday's 2-2 draw with Hoffenerheim, where he scored his first Bundesliga goal since the summer of 2015. Bayern, meanwhile, have been struggling with injuries for some time and have struggled to cope with a lack of quality in their starting lineup. At the weekend, though, their best players were still on form. They were the only ones to score in each half as they looked to get back into the top four. For the Germans, this was a huge step up from last season, when they won the league title in 2014 and 2015 and then lost the title to Bayern in 2015-16. It was also a big step forward for their young squad, which had been in great form for so many years. And now they have a chance to make it three wins in as many games in 2017-18 and 2018-19. That's a lot to ask for from a team that has struggled so much to adapt to the new system of football. There's no doubt about it, however, that Bayern will be looking to improve their chances of reaching the Champions League next year. If they do, then they will have to do everything they can to avoid a repeat of last year's disappointment. Last year, Bayern won their only Bundesliga title, beating the likes of Schalke 04 and Borussia Monchengladbach in 2013-14. Since then, there's been no shortage of good news for them, as well as the fact that they've been playing so well. This season's Bundesliga has seen an influx of young talent, especially from Germany and the United States. So far, so good, in fact, at least in terms of talent and quality. You can see that in Germany, you can expect to see more of them in future seasons, too, if you're a young player. I'm sure that's the case with Bayern and Dortmund, for example, because they are so young and so experienced and they're very good at their job. What's more, I don't think they'll need to be as young as I am, or as experienced as Bayern are, to have the experience of playing in such a difficult league. We'll see how Bayern can do it again, of course, after the end of this season and beyond. With the exception of a few games, we'll have more to say about the future of German football in Europe. Just ask the coach, Josef K\u00c3\u00b6nke, about how he feels about this. His team is a good example of what he's capable of doing. When you look at it all the way back in 2011-12, Germany was the most successful team in all of Europe and it's not just Bayern who are the best team to play in this competition. Now it is Bayern that is doing it well, even if it means that the team has to go through a tough period of time to reach the next level of Bundesliga play. From the very beginning, things are looking up for us. Here's what I can tell you: The Bundesliga is not only a great place to start the year in which we're playing. As we've seen so far this year - and we know that we can't be too far ahead of schedule - but I think we have some good things to look forward to next season - because Bayern have already made it clear that this is the right time for me to step in and make a change in my mind. A lot of things can happen, right? You know what you've got to think about that. How can you do that? I hope you'll be a little bit of"

        "target": "Teabag filter cleans water with nanotechnology A new water filter developed in South Africa could provide millions of people with clean drinking water. The filter, about the size and shape of a teabag, would be inexpensive, easy to distribute and simple to use. Marelize Botes is conducting a final set of tests on a new type of diminutive water filter before industrial production can begin. The microbiologist pours water from a plastic bottle though a high-tech, teabag-sized filter before analyzing it in her in her laboratory at the University of Stellenbosch in South Africa. \"The filter is much cheaper than bottled water as well as any other filter on the market,\" she told Deutsche Welle. Instead of being filled with black or green tea, the bag contains active carbon granules and is made from nanofibers treated with biocide, which kills bacteria rather than simply filtering them from the water. Nanotech for pennies \"This project takes nanotechnology to the poorest of the poor people who live in this world, and it will make a difference in their lives,\" said Eugen Cloete, who in addition to inventing the filter is dean of the faculty of science at Stellenbosch University and chair of Stellenbosch University's Water Institute. With some 300 million people in Africa - and over a billion worldwide - living without access to clean drinking water, the need for such a filter is huge. When in mass production, the developers said they expect the teabag to cost just a few South African cents (under half a US cent and under a third of a euro cent). In addition to being inexpensive, Botes said, the filter is also easy to distribute to rural area and simple to use as it can be place in an adapter that fits on nearly any regular-sized plastic bottle. Each filter can clean one liter (one quart) of the most polluted water to the point where it is completely safe to drink. Once used, the filter can be disposed of and is biodegradable. African countries, led by Somalia, Mauritania and Sudan, were ranked to have the most vulnerable water supplies, according to a June report by UK-based risk consultancy firm Maplecroft. Decentralized use The filter's small size and light weight make it ideal for rural areas where other means of filtration do not exist, Cloete said. \"It is simply impossible to build purification infrastructure at every polluted stream,\" Cloete said. \"So we have to take the solution to the people. The water is cleaned right then and there when you drink from the bottle.\" The filter is now undergoing testing by the South African Bureau of Standards, after which Cloete and his team hope it can be rolled out to the United Nations and non-governmental organizations that have expressed interest in it by the end of the year. The project grew out of research into larger filters, according to Cloete. \"We were busy developing filters for larger applications, but when you do the tests in the labatory you do the tests on a much smaller scale,\" he said. \"The results we were getting on a smaller amount of water promoted me to think about a smaller application.\" Author: Joerg Poppendieck, Sean Sinico Editor: Anke Rasper",
        "generated_story": "A Teabag-sized water filter for decentralized drinking in Africa is being developed by the University of Stellenbosch in the southern African country of South Africa, Eugen Cloete, a professor of water and sanitation at the university, says it is the first of its kind to be developed in South African waters. \"It's a very important step,\" he told Deutsche Welle, adding that it would be \"a great step forward\" for the country's water system, which is designed to reduce the use of tap water by up to 1.5 billion litres per year. The project is part of a broader effort to improve water quality in developing countries such as the United States, Europe and the Middle East. It will also be used to provide drinking water to people living in remote areas of the African continent. In the past, the project has been called \"the first step towards decentralization.\" It is currently being tested by a team of researchers from the U.S. Geological Survey in Cape Town. They are currently working on a project to develop a system that will allow people to drink water from a tap without having to go to the tap. This would allow them to tap their own water without the need for an expensive tap or tap filter. But it could also lead to problems for people who live in rural areas where the water supply is not available. For example, it's not possible for a person to have access to clean water in a rural area without an electricity supply. That's why the government is trying to find a way to make it so that people can have a reliable source of their water. So far, this has not been done, however, and there have been no reports of any problems with the system. However, there are concerns about the potential for problems, particularly in areas with high levels of poverty and unemployment. There are also concerns that the technology will not be able to meet the needs of rural communities. And there is also the issue of how to ensure that water supplies are safe and reliable. At the same time, many people are worried about water shortages in many parts of Africa. Many of these problems are caused by poor sanitation and poor hygiene, according to a study by researchers at Maplecroft University in Johannesburg. These problems can be resolved by using a water-based filter, but they can't be solved without a well-manicured system like the one in Europe, where water is rationed. According to one study, more than 80 percent of all water used in urban areas is used by people in poor countries. Another study found that poor people do not have the means to access water at all, as well as those who don't have proper sanitation facilities. One study suggested that this could be the case in some countries where people have to pay a lot more for water than they do in other countries, like India and China. Other studies have shown that low-income people tend to use water as a substitute for food in their homes, while people with low incomes are more likely to consume it than those with higher incomes. A study published last year in The New York Times said this was the most common reason for this, citing a lack of awareness among residents of drought-stricken areas. More than a million people live without water every year and that is why many of them are unable to get enough water for their families. As a result, they have no way of knowing how much water they are drinking, even if they're not drinking at home, or whether their children are getting enough to eat, because they've never had a proper meal. Some people think that's what they want to do. Others think the problem is that they'll be forced to live with their parents, who are too poor to care for them, rather than having a family. I think this is an example of what can happen when they grow up in poverty. If you're a poor person, you know that. You know what I'm talking about, right? You've got to ask yourself: What do you think about this. What are you doing? Do you have any idea what you can do about it? What can you do? Is there a solution to this problem? Are you going to give your children a chance to learn? Tell me. Tell your friends and family about your experiences? Read more: \"I'm not sure I can tell you what's going on with my family.\" The study was published in an academic journal, The Lancet, on the subject of climate change and water scarcity, in which the World Health Organization (WHO) has published a report on this subject.

The findings of research conducted by scientists at a university in southern Africa are not very different from what we have in our own country? If so, what is your opinion? I'd like to know more?

        "target": "For drivers in Germany, 2010 was the most expensive year ever Owning and operating a car in Germany has never been cheap, but it's never been more expensive than in 2010. German auto club ADAC says costs associated with owning a car have risen more than 40 percent since 1995. In 2010, German car owners had to pay a high price for their mobility, according to ADAC, which cited record-high fuel prices as the major cost factor. \"For drivers, 2010 will go down in history as the most costly year ever,\" ADAC said in a statement. High taxes The cost of acquiring and operating a car has risen 42 percent since 1995, compared to a 24 percent increase in the general cost of living. Due to tax increases and higher production costs, fuel prices soared 86 percent over the 15-year period. In 2010 alone, the average price for a liter of super gasoline was more than 1.40 euros ($1.84) - the highest the average price ever. According to ADAC, urban singles spent an average of 3,340 euros on their cars in 2000. Five years later, that figure had jumped to 3,900 euros. By the end of 2010, their expenses reached 4,380 euros, or 1,000 euros more than a decade earlier. Driving is also pricey for four-person families with two cars. According to the automobile club, their annual costs have risen 30 percent over the past 10 years from 5,940 euros to 7,740 euros. Taxes account for the lion's share of gasoline and diesel prices. The German government's mineral oil and value added taxes account for nearly 88 cents of the 1.35-euro price of a liter of fuel. Low toll revenue While the German government reaps more revenue year for year from vehicle-related taxes, income generated by its highway toll for trucks is expected to fall this year for the first time since the haulage charges were introduced in 2005. The government predicts this year's toll revenues will amount to 4.2 billion euros, down from 4.3 billion euros in 2009. Author: John Blau Editor: Sam Edmonds",
        "generated_story": "The Most Costly Year in History For German Auto Clubs Last year was the most costly year in history for German auto clubs, according to ADAC. The most expensive year for car clubs in Germany was 2007, when the average German car club cost more than $1,000 a year. This year, however, is no different. In 2008, the costliest year ever for a German club was around $2,500 per car. That's a staggering amount of money for an auto club, and it's not even close to what it was in 2007. It was a record-breaking year that saw the number of cars sold in the country go up by 20 percent from 2007 to 2009. And it wasn't just the cars that were sold. There were also the Mercedes-Benz and BMW models, as well as the Audi and Mercedes models. These models were the first to be sold on the black market, with the exception of the BMW model, which was sold for $3,700 in 2008. Since then, there has been a huge increase in car sales, but the biggest change is that the car market has become so expensive that it is almost impossible to find a car that doesn't cost as much as it does. For example, in 2009, around 1.5 billion euros ($2.7 billion) was spent on a new car, while in 2010, it cost $4.3 billion. \"This is the second-most costlier year since the beginning of World War II,\" the German automobile club ADac said in a statement on Tuesday, adding that \"the cost of new cars has gone up significantly since then.\" The car industry has also seen a dramatic rise in sales in recent years, thanks in part to the success of its new models and the fact that many of them are now available for sale in Europe. However, this is not the case for the rest of Europe, where the costs are much higher than they were in 2006. According to a recent study by the University of Cologne, carmakers have been spending more money on cars than ever before. They are also spending less on their own cars, because they don't have the money to buy new ones and they have to pay more for them to have a decent car to drive around in. But that's just a small part of what makes them so rich. After all, they are the ones who make up the vast majority of car owners. So what does that mean for you? It means that you are paying less for your car than you should be paying for it. You're paying more in order to get a good car and you're not getting the best car you can get. What do you want?
